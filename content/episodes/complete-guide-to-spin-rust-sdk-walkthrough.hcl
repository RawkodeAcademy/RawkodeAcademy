   ### SUMMARY
   Spin is a framework for building, deploying, and running fast, secure, and composable cloud microservices with WebAssembly.
   In this video we continue exploring the Rust SDK for Spin. In this video we implement a HTTP endpoint , we'll also take a look at getting HTTP request headers , body and query parameters. 
   We'll conclude by making an outboud HTTP request
