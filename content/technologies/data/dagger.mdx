description: |
  Dagger is a programmable CI/CD engine that runs your pipelines in containers. It allows you to define your CI/CD pipelines as code, enabling you to run them anywhere, from your local machine to a cloud provider, with the same behavior and results. Dagger leverages containerization to provide reproducibility, portability, and efficiency in your development workflows. It solves the challenges of inconsistent environments and vendor lock-in by providing a unified platform for building, testing, and deploying applications.
