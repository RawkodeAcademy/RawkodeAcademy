description: |
  Acorn is a simple, powerful platform for building, running, and managing applications on Kubernetes. It focuses on developer experience, enabling developers to package their applications with all dependencies (services, databases, configuration, etc.) into a single artifact, called an Acorn image. This simplifies deployment and management across various Kubernetes environments, from local development to production clusters. The value lies in its abstraction of Kubernetes complexities, offering a higher-level API for application orchestration. 
  
  Acorn's primary use cases include simplifying the deployment and management of microservices, full-stack applications, and cloud-native applications. It is particularly useful for developers who want to focus on writing code rather than managing infrastructure and configuration.
