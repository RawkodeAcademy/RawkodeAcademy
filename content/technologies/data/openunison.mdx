description: |
  OpenUnison is an identity management solution built for Kubernetes and cloud-native environments. It centralizes authentication and authorization, allowing organizations to manage access to their cloud-native applications and services consistently across different identity providers (IdPs). It supports various identity providers (e.g., Active Directory, Azure AD, Google, SAML, OIDC) and enables fine-grained access control policies based on user attributes, roles, and context.
  
  OpenUnison simplifies security management by providing a single point of control for authentication and authorization across cloud-native deployments. It reduces the operational overhead associated with managing multiple IdPs and access control mechanisms, while improving security posture and compliance. Its main use cases include securing Kubernetes clusters, microservices, APIs, and web applications in cloud-native environments.
