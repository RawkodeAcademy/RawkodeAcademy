description: |
  GitLab is a comprehensive DevOps platform delivered as a single application. It provides a complete lifecycle toolchain, from project planning and source code management (SCM) to CI/CD, security, and monitoring. GitLab enables development, security, and operations teams to collaborate effectively, accelerate software delivery, and reduce development costs.
  
  GitLab's value lies in its unified approach, which streamlines workflows, increases visibility, and fosters collaboration across the entire software development lifecycle. Main use cases include version control, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), issue tracking, code review, security scanning, and release management, ultimately empowering organizations to build, test, and deploy software faster and more efficiently.
