description: |
  Telegraf is an open-source, plugin-driven server agent for collecting and reporting metrics and events from a wide variety of sources. It's part of the TICK stack (Telegraf, InfluxDB, Chronograf, Kapacitor) and is designed to be highly flexible and lightweight, making it suitable for collecting data from servers, databases, applications, and even IoT devices. Telegraf eliminates the need for writing custom data collection scripts by providing hundreds of input plugins for commonly used technologies. 
  
  The value Telegraf provides lies in its ease of configuration and extensibility, allowing users to easily monitor their entire infrastructure. It simplifies the process of gathering time-series data, transforming it, and sending it to various outputs, like InfluxDB, Graphite, Prometheus, or even cloud platforms. Its primary use cases include server monitoring, application performance monitoring (APM), database monitoring, and IoT data collection.
