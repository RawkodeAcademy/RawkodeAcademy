description: |
  Fleet is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution manager. It simplifies the process of managing and deploying Kubernetes across a fleet of machines, especially edge and bare metal servers. It enables GitOps-style management, allowing you to define desired cluster states in Git repositories and automatically reconcile the actual state with the desired state, ensuring consistency and simplified management at scale.
  
  Fleet's value lies in its ability to bring centralized and declarative management to distributed Kubernetes deployments. Common use cases include managing edge clusters for IoT applications, deploying Kubernetes on bare metal servers without the complexity of traditional infrastructure setup, and simplifying the management of multiple Kubernetes clusters spread across different environments.
