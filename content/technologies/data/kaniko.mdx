description: |
  Kaniko is a tool to build container images from a Dockerfile, inside a container or Kubernetes cluster. Unlike Docker-in-Docker (DinD), Kaniko doesn't depend on a Docker daemon and executes each command in the Dockerfile completely in userspace. This allows building images in environments that can't easily or securely run a Docker daemon, such as Kubernetes clusters. Kaniko significantly enhances security and portability by eliminating the need for privileged containers or Docker daemon access during the image building process.
  
  Its primary use cases include building container images within CI/CD pipelines running in Kubernetes, automating image builds in cloud environments where Docker daemons are not available, and enhancing the security of image builds by avoiding privileged mode.
