description: |
  mirrord lets you run your local code in the context of your cloud environment. It intercepts network traffic, file system access, and environment variables from a pod in your Kubernetes cluster and forwards them to your local development environment. This allows developers to debug and test code locally as if it were running inside the cluster, without the need for containerization, deployment, or remote debugging setups. 
  
  mirrord streamlines development workflows by significantly reducing iteration cycles. Developers can work with real-world data, configurations, and dependencies directly from their local machines, making it easier to identify and fix bugs, test new features, and ensure compatibility with the production environment. Main use cases include debugging complex microservice interactions, testing local code against production-like data, and validating changes before deploying them to a live environment.
