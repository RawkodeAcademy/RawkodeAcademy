description: |
  Cluster API is a Kubernetes sub-project focused on simplifying the creation, upgrading, and operation of Kubernetes clusters. It uses Kubernetes-style declarative APIs to manage the lifecycle of clusters, enabling infrastructure as code for Kubernetes. This allows for consistent and repeatable cluster deployments across various infrastructure providers, from on-premises data centers to public clouds. It promotes infrastructure immutability and automation for Kubernetes cluster management.
