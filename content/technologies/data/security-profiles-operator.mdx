name: "Security Profiles Operator (SPO)"
description: |
  The Kubernetes Security Profiles Operator simplifies the management of seccomp profiles in Kubernetes. Seccomp (Secure Computing Mode) is a Linux kernel feature that restricts the system calls a process can make, thus reducing the attack surface. The Seccomp Operator automates the generation, deployment, and management of seccomp profiles, making it easier to enforce security policies at the container level.
  
  It provides value by enabling fine-grained control over container capabilities, enhancing security posture, and reducing the complexity of seccomp profile management. Main use cases include hardening container workloads, limiting potential security breaches, and ensuring compliance with security standards.
