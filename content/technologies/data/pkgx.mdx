description: |
  pkgx is a fast, cross-platform package manager designed to simplify development environment setup. It excels at managing arbitrary toolchains, including those not found in system package managers. It solves the problem of dependency conflicts and inconsistent environments by providing isolated installations and deterministic builds. pkgx is particularly useful for scripting, CI/CD pipelines, and managing projects with complex dependency requirements, allowing developers to easily manage multiple versions of tools like Node.js, Python, and Go, without interfering with system-level packages or other projects.
