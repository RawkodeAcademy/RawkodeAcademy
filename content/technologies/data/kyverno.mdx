description: |
  Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes. It allows you to manage, validate, mutate, and generate Kubernetes resources using declarative configuration. Kyverno operates directly in Kubernetes, eliminating the need for a separate language or custom code to define policies. Policies are written as Kubernetes resources themselves, making them easy to manage, version, and distribute.
