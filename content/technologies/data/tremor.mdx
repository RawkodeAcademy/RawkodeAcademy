description: |
  Tremor is an event processing system designed for high-throughput, low-latency, and fault-tolerant data streaming. It acts as a data ingestion and processing pipeline, capable of transforming, filtering, enriching, and routing events in real-time. Tremor provides a powerful query language for defining data flows and transformations, allowing users to build complex event processing logic with relative ease.
  
  The value of Tremor lies in its ability to handle large volumes of event data from diverse sources, enabling real-time analytics, alerting, and data aggregation. It's particularly well-suited for use cases such as IoT data processing, log aggregation, security information and event management (SIEM), and industrial automation, where timely and accurate insights are crucial.
