  Env0 is a Self-Service Cloud Management Platform that empowers DevOps teams to manage and govern their cloud environments through Infrastructure as Code (IaC). It provides a centralized platform to provision, manage, and tear down environments on AWS, Azure, and GCP, reducing cloud costs, improving security, and enhancing team collaboration. Env0 enables organizations to maintain consistency and control over their infrastructure while giving developers the autonomy to create and manage environments on demand.
  
  Env0's main use cases include managing development and testing environments, automating cloud provisioning workflows, enabling self-service access to cloud resources for developers, enforcing cloud governance policies, and optimizing cloud spending. It helps organizations to standardize their infrastructure deployments, prevent misconfigurations, and reduce the operational overhead associated with managing cloud environments.
