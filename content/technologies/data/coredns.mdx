description: |
  CoreDNS is a fast, flexible, and extensible DNS server that can serve as a cluster DNS for Kubernetes. Written in Go, it is designed to be a modular and pluggable DNS server, where functionality is provided through a chain of plugins. These plugins can be configured and chained together to provide various DNS features, such as service discovery, load balancing, and external service resolution.
  
  CoreDNS is valuable because it offers a highly customizable and scalable solution for managing DNS within containerized environments. Its integration with Kubernetes simplifies service discovery and provides a robust and reliable way for applications to resolve service names. Main use cases include Kubernetes cluster DNS, service discovery in cloud-native architectures, and general-purpose DNS server replacement.
