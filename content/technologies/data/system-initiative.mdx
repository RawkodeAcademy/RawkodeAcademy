name: "System Initiative"
description: |
  System Initiative is a project focused on improving how complex, multi-service applications are composed, deployed, and managed in cloud-native environments. It aims to streamline service composition and lifecycle management, enabling developers to define application blueprints that describe the desired state of their applications and rely on automated reconciliation to achieve and maintain that state. This includes automated service discovery, dependency management, and configuration management.
  
  System Initiative's value lies in simplifying the orchestration of applications consisting of numerous microservices. Use cases include deploying and managing complex applications on Kubernetes, automating cross-service dependencies, and enabling self-healing and auto-scaling capabilities at the application level, rather than just at the individual service level.
