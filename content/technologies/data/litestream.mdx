description: |
  Litestream is a standalone streaming replication tool for SQLite. It provides point-in-time recovery and enables running SQLite databases in edge and cloud environments with near-zero recovery time. It continuously backs up your SQLite database to object storage (like S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage), allowing you to easily restore your database to any point in time. 
  
  The primary value of Litestream is improved durability and availability for SQLite databases. It makes it easier to run SQLite in production environments where data loss is unacceptable and allows for read replicas to scale read workloads. This is especially useful for applications that are architected around SQLite but need the reliability of a traditional database.
