description: |
  Podman is a daemonless, open source, Linux native tool designed for developing, managing, and running OCI Containers and Pods. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) familiar to those who have used Docker, making it easy to transition. Podman allows users to run containers as a non-root user, enhancing security, and manage images, containers, and volumes without requiring a daemon process running in the background. This daemonless architecture reduces the attack surface and resource consumption compared to Docker.
  
  Podman's primary use cases include building and managing container images, running containers in development environments, and facilitating the creation of Kubernetes pod definitions. It excels in scenarios where rootless container execution is required, such as CI/CD pipelines or local development on shared systems. Podman also supports deploying containers to Kubernetes and other orchestration platforms.
