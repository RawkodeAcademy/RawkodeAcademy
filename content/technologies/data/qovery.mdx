description: |
  Qovery is a Cloud Native application deployment platform that simplifies and accelerates the deployment and management of applications in the cloud. It abstracts away the complexity of Kubernetes and cloud provider configurations, allowing developers to focus on building and deploying code rather than managing infrastructure. Qovery provides a streamlined developer experience, enabling teams to easily deploy, scale, and manage applications across different cloud providers, with features like automated environment provisioning, CI/CD integration, and observability.
  
  Qovery's main value lies in its ability to significantly reduce the operational overhead associated with cloud deployments. It enables faster time-to-market, improved developer productivity, and reduced infrastructure costs. Key use cases include deploying web applications, APIs, microservices, and databases to cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP, as well as managing staging and production environments with ease.
