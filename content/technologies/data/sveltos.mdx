  Sveltos is a Kubernetes add-on controller designed to simplify deploying and managing applications across multiple Kubernetes clusters. It allows users to define a single set of configurations and policies that can be automatically applied to a fleet of clusters, regardless of their underlying infrastructure or distribution. This drastically reduces operational overhead and ensures consistency across environments.
