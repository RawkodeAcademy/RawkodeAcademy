description: |
  Tekton is a powerful and flexible open-source framework for creating CI/CD systems, allowing developers to build, test, and deploy across multiple platforms and cloud providers. Built on Kubernetes, Tekton enables the creation of reusable components called Tasks, which can be orchestrated into Pipelines to define the entire software delivery lifecycle. It provides a standard vocabulary and architecture for building CI/CD pipelines, promoting consistency and portability across different environments. 
  
  Tekton's value lies in its Kubernetes-native design, declarative configuration, extensibility, and reusability. It simplifies the process of defining and executing CI/CD pipelines, allowing teams to focus on developing and delivering software more efficiently. Main use cases include building and testing code, deploying applications to various environments (staging, production), running integration tests, and managing infrastructure deployments.
