description: |
  PHP is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development. It can be embedded into HTML and is known for its ease of use and large community. PHP excels at creating dynamic web content, handling form data, managing sessions, and interacting with databases. Its simplicity allows developers to quickly build and deploy web applications, making it a popular choice for everything from small personal projects to large enterprise systems. 
  
  While PHP wasn't originally designed with Cloud Native principles in mind, modern frameworks and tools like Laravel, Symfony, and Docker integration allow PHP applications to be effectively deployed and managed in cloud environments. By containerizing PHP applications and utilizing orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, developers can achieve scalability, resilience, and automated deployments for their PHP-based services.
