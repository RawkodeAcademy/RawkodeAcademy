description: |
  K3s is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution built for resource-constrained environments and edge computing. It packages Kubernetes components into a single binary that is less than 40MB, reducing the footprint and simplifying deployment. K3s is fully certified by the CNCF as a conformant Kubernetes distribution, meaning applications designed to run on any Kubernetes cluster will run on K3s. 
  
  It is designed to be easy to install, lightweight, and reliable, making it ideal for edge computing, IoT devices, CI/CD, and situations where a full-fledged Kubernetes cluster is overkill. Its small footprint allows it to run on resource-constrained devices and makes it perfect for environments with limited connectivity.
