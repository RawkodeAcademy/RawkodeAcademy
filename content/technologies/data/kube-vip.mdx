description: |
  kube-vip provides a high-availability load balancer solution for Kubernetes clusters. It uses Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) or Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to manage a virtual IP address (VIP), ensuring that services remain accessible even if a node fails. Kube-vip eliminates the need for external load balancers in many scenarios, simplifying infrastructure and reducing costs.
  
  Its primary use cases include providing a reliable control plane for Kubernetes clusters, load balancing ingress traffic to applications, and managing database cluster endpoints. By providing a stable IP address that floats between nodes, kube-vip ensures that services remain available and consistent, improving the overall resilience of Kubernetes deployments.
