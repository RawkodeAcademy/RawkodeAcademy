description: |
  Second State provides a WebAssembly (Wasm) runtime and developer tools for building high-performance, secure, and portable cloud-native applications. Their key value proposition lies in enabling developers to leverage the benefits of Wasm, such as faster execution speeds, smaller code size, and enhanced security, directly within cloud environments. This allows for more efficient resource utilization and improved application responsiveness.
  
  Second State's technology is primarily used for building serverless functions, microservices, blockchain applications, and other performance-critical workloads. They provide tools and infrastructure for compiling, deploying, and managing Wasm modules, making it easier for developers to integrate Wasm into their existing cloud-native workflows. Their focus is on empowering developers to build applications that are both fast and secure, while maintaining portability across different platforms and environments.
