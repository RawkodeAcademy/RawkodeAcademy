description: |
  Telepresence is an open-source tool that lets you run a single service locally while connecting it to a remote Kubernetes cluster. This allows developers to rapidly iterate on services as if they were running within the cluster, without the need to build and deploy containers for every code change. Telepresence proxies network traffic between your local machine and the remote cluster, enabling you to debug and test your local service in a realistic production-like environment, complete with access to other services, databases, and configurations. 
  
  The key value proposition is dramatically reduced development cycles. Instead of building, pushing, and deploying container images for every code change, developers can immediately test their changes live against a full-scale microservices environment. Common use cases include debugging complex interactions between services, testing changes with realistic data and configurations, and collaborating on features with colleagues working on other microservices within the same cluster.
