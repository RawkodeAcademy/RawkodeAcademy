name: "Open Policy Agent"
description: |
  Open Policy Agent (OPA) is a general-purpose policy engine that unifies policy enforcement across the cloud native stack. OPA decouples policy decision-making from policy enforcement. This means you can centralize your policy decisions in one place and reuse them across different services and infrastructure components.
  
  OPA provides value by enabling consistent policy enforcement for microservices, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, API gateways, and more. It simplifies policy management and reduces the risk of misconfiguration or inconsistent policies across diverse systems. Common use cases include authorization policies, data filtering, validating configuration, and compliance checks.
