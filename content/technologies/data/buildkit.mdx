name: "BuildKit"
description: |
  BuildKit is a toolkit for converting source code to build artifacts in an efficient, expressive and reproducible manner. It's designed as a replacement for the classic Dockerfile build system, offering features such as concurrent dependency resolution, optimized layer caching, and support for sophisticated build strategies. It addresses common pain points of traditional Docker builds, like slow build times and inefficient image layering, leading to faster builds, smaller images, and improved security.
