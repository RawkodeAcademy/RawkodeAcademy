name: "Teleport"
description: |
  Teleport is an identity-aware access proxy that consolidates access to servers, applications, databases, and Kubernetes clusters behind a single, unified platform. It eliminates the need for traditional VPNs and SSH keys, providing a more secure and auditable approach to infrastructure access. Teleport leverages short-lived certificates and integrates with identity providers (like Okta, Google Workspace, or Active Directory) to enforce authentication and authorization policies.
  
  Teleport provides value by reducing the attack surface, simplifying compliance, and improving developer productivity. Its main use cases include secure remote access for engineers, privileged access management for administrators, and centralized auditing of all infrastructure access activities.
