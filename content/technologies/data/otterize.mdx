description: |
  Otterize provides fine-grained access control and network policies for cloud-native applications, simplifying and automating zero-trust security. It enables developers and security teams to define and enforce access control policies at the service level, based on application intent, automatically generating and managing network policies for Kubernetes. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access and lateral movement within the cluster, improving security posture and streamlining compliance efforts.
