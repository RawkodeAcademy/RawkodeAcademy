description: |
  Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. It achieves memory safety without garbage collection by employing a borrow checker, preventing data races and dangling pointers at compile time. This makes Rust ideal for performance-critical applications and systems programming, where control over memory and execution is paramount. Rust's rich type system and modern concurrency features also allow developers to build reliable and efficient concurrent systems. 
  
  Its main use cases include operating systems, embedded systems, game development, web browsers (like Firefox components), and high-performance networking applications. In the cloud native space, Rust is increasingly adopted for building infrastructure components, container runtimes, and serverless functions, offering a compelling alternative to languages like C++ and Go when performance and resource efficiency are crucial.
