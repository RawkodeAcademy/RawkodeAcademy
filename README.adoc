Community Decision Records take huge inspiration from Architecture Decision Records https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record[ADR]. They're proposals to help the Academy grow and become an inclusive place for all people interested in future-facing technologies.

Have a look at the link:cdrs[cdrs] folder for the records.
