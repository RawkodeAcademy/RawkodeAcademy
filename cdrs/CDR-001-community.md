# CDR 001 - Community Decision Records

## Context

Rawkode Academy is currently run by [@rawkode](https://github.com/rawkode) with the help of people within the community.

Decisions, such as the below, are often discussed openly within [Discord](https://rawkode.chat).

- Communication channels - Should we use Discord? Should we use Matrix? Use GitHub Discussion?
- Events - Another Hackathon?
- Content - Community blog?
- ...

## Decision

This CDR introduces 3 new terms to the vocabulary.

### Vocabulary

#### Friction

Frictions are issues opened on this repository and labelled appropriately. Anyone can open a friction when they feel that something about the community can be improved.

#### CDR

Community Decision Record's (CDRs) can be submitted, via pull-request, to improve the structure and processes of the community. It is expected that a friction exists before a CDR will be submitted, but not enforced.

### Notes

1. Proposals can be opened, via pull-request, by any member of the community.
2. Proposals can be voted on, via thumbs-up or thumbs-down, by any member of the community.

## Consequences

With implementing this record we lay more decisions in the hand of the community. The community is the reason the Academy exists and therefore every voice should be honored.
