# CDR 001 - Council

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Rawkode Academy is currently run by [@rawkode](https://github.com/rawkode) with the help of some people from the Discord community.
To make decisions regarding

- Communication channels - Should we use Discord? Should we use Matrix? Use GitHub Discussion?
- Events - Another Hackathon?
- Content - Community blog?
- ...

easier, a group of people (which includes [@rawkode](https://github.com/rawkode)) should discuss said topics and put them to a vote with the community.

## Decision

A council of 5 (to get a quorum) meets once a month to discuss the aforementioned points / topics. The council session happens in public and each decision should be written down as an ADR.

The "bootstrap" council consists of

- [@rawkode](https://github.com/rawkode)
- [@icepuma](https://github.com/icepuma)

The council for 2025 will be community elected. [@rawkode](https://github.com/rawkode) has a permanent seat and is accompanied by 2 community seats.

## Consequences

With implementing this record we lay more decisions in the hand of the community. The community is the reason the Academy exists and therefore every voice should be honored.
