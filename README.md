## CDRs

Community Decision Records take huge inspiration from [Architecture Decision Records ](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record). They're proposals to help the Academy grow and become an inclusive place for all people interested in future-facing technologies.

Have a look at the [cdrs](./cdrs) folder for the records.
