## CDRs

Community Decision Records take huge inspiration from Architecture Decision Records [ADR](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record). They're proposals to help the Academy grow and become an inclusive place for all people interested in future-facing technologies.

Have a look at the [cdrs](cdrs) folder for the records.
