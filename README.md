## Contribute for Cash

Want to earn some extra cash by contributing to the Rawkode Academy? We've got plenty of options to help you get started.

## Write an Article

We're always looking for new articles to add to the Rawkode Academy.

If you have an idea for an article, please open an issue with the "New Article" template. We'll review this as soon as possible and either give you feedback, or approve it. Once approved, you can start writing and open the pull request when you're ready.

**We do not accept articles that are already published elsewhere, nor derivative works.**

### Fees

We pay on a sliding scale, with introductory articles starting at $50 and more advanced articles earning up to $500.

Payment can only be made if you're willing to invoice with your legal name, address, and contact details.

When you open your pull request, we'll inform you how much we'd be willing to pay after a review. At this stage, you can either accept the terms and we merge or we'll close the pull request and you can publish your article somewhere else.

## CDRs

Community Decision Records take huge inspiration from Architecture Decision Records [ADR](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record). They're proposals to help the Academy grow and become an inclusive place for all people interested in future-facing technologies.

Have a look at the [cdrs](cdrs) folder for the records.
