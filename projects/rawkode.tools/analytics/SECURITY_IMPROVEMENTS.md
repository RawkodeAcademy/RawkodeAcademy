# Security Improvements Summary

This document summarizes the security improvements made to address the issues identified in PR #642.

## High Priority Issues (Completed)

### 1. SQL Injection Vulnerability Fixed ✅
- **Location**: `api/resolvers/analytics.ts`
- **Changes**: 
  - Added input validation and escaping for event types
  - Validated and sanitized groupBy columns against whitelist
  - Added timestamp validation for time ranges
  - Enhanced rawQuery with forbidden keyword detection and pattern matching

### 2. API Authentication Implemented ✅
- **Location**: `api/index.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added X-API-Key header authentication middleware
  - API keys stored securely as environment variables
  - Returns 401 for unauthorized requests

### 3. CORS Configuration Fixed ✅
- **Location**: `api/index.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced wildcard CORS with explicit origin whitelist
  - Added support for environment-specific allowed origins
  - Properly handles preflight requests

## Medium Priority Issues (Completed)

### 4. Rate Limiting Added ✅
- **Location**: `api/index.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added rate limiting middleware (placeholder for Cloudflare KV implementation)
  - Rate limits based on API key or IP address
  - TODO comment added for production implementation with Cloudflare Rate Limiting Rules

### 5. GraphQL Introspection Disabled ✅
- **Location**: `api/index.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Introspection disabled in production environment
  - GraphiQL interface disabled in production
  - Environment-aware configuration

### 6. Security Headers Added ✅
- **Location**: `api/index.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  - Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
  - Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()
  - Content-Security-Policy configured

### 7. Input Validation Implemented ✅
- **Location**: `pipeline/event-collector/src/validation.rs` (new file)
- **Changes**:
  - Event type validation (alphanumeric with dots, hyphens, underscores)
  - Source URI validation
  - Subject length validation
  - JSON depth validation (max 5 levels)
  - String length limits
  - Batch size validation (max 100 events)

### 8. Payload Size Limits Implemented ✅
- **Location**: `pipeline/event-collector/src/lib.rs`
- **Changes**:
  - 10MB max payload size for requests
  - 1MB max size per individual event
  - Returns 413 Payload Too Large for oversized requests

## Low Priority Issues (Not Implemented)

### 9. JWT Token Authentication
- **Status**: Not implemented (marked as future improvement)
- **Recommendation**: Consider implementing JWT tokens with expiration for better security

### 10. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Status**: Not implemented (marked as future improvement)
- **Recommendation**: Implement data filtering based on user roles for multi-tenant scenarios

## Environment Variables Required

Add these to your Cloudflare Worker configuration:

```toml
[vars]
ANALYTICS_API_KEY = "your-secure-api-key-here"
NODE_ENV = "production"  # or "development"
ALLOWED_ORIGINS = "https://app.example.com,https://admin.example.com"  # Optional additional origins
```

## Next Steps

1. Deploy these changes to a staging environment for testing
2. Generate secure API keys for production use
3. Configure Cloudflare Rate Limiting Rules
4. Consider implementing the low-priority improvements in future iterations
5. Set up monitoring and alerting for security events

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test SQL injection attempts against the API
2. Verify API authentication with valid/invalid keys
3. Test CORS from allowed and disallowed origins
4. Send oversized payloads to verify size limits
5. Send malformed events to test validation
6. Verify GraphQL introspection is disabled in production
