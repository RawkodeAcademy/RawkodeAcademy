# Apache Iceberg Implementation Plan for Analytics

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to implement Apache Iceberg for the analytics system using Cloudflare Workers and R2 storage. Since the project hasn't reached production yet, we can implement Iceberg from the start without migration concerns.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **Iceberg Table Schema**
   - CloudEvents-compatible schema with 25 fields
   - Partition columns for efficient time-based queries
   - ZSTD compression optimized for Workers

2. **Storage Architecture**
   - R2 bucket for data files (Parquet format)
   - Metadata stored in R2 with version-hint pattern
   - Partition strategy: type/year/month/day/hour

3. **Processing Architecture**
   - Durable Objects per partition for buffering
   - Memory-efficient Parquet writer (50MB limit)
   - Batch sizes limited to 5,000 events
   - Automatic flushing at 2,000 events or 30 seconds

4. **Catalog Architecture**
   - R2 Data Catalog (managed Iceberg REST catalog)
   - No custom catalog implementation needed
   - Direct integration with Spark, Snowflake, PyIceberg
   - ACID transactions and schema evolution support

## Implementation Phases

## Technical Implementation Details

### Iceberg Writer Configuration
```typescript
const WRITER_CONFIG = {
  maxMemoryMB: 50,
  maxBatchSize: 5000,
  flushIntervalSeconds: 30,
  compressionType: 'ZSTD',
  rowGroupSize: 10000,
  dataPageSize: 1024 * 1024 // 1MB
};
```

### Partition Strategy
```
analytics/
├── type={event_type}/
│   ├── year={yyyy}/
│   │   ├── month={mm}/
│   │   │   ├── day={dd}/
│   │   │   │   └── hour={hh}/
│   │   │   │       └── {uuid}.parquet
```

### Durable Object Assignment
- One Durable Object per partition (type + hour)
- Natural isolation between event types
- Prevents write contention
- Enables parallel processing

## Testing Strategy

### Test Distribution
- **Unit Tests (70%)**: Core Iceberg operations, metadata management, write operations
- **Integration Tests (20%)**: R2 interactions, Worker timeouts, compaction
- **E2E Tests (10%)**: Full pipeline validation, performance benchmarks

### Key Test Scenarios
1. Concurrent write conflict resolution
2. Worker memory limit handling
3. Transaction rollback scenarios
4. Schema evolution compatibility
5. Compaction effectiveness
6. Query performance benchmarks

### Performance Targets
- Write throughput: >10,000 events/second
- Query latency (P50): <100ms
- Transaction success rate: 99.99%
- Storage efficiency: 20% reduction vs raw Parquet

## Frontend Integration

### Event Collection SDK Updates
1. **Client-side batching**: Reduce API calls by 90%
2. **Offline support**: IndexedDB queue for reliability
3. **Compression**: Gzip before transmission
4. **Retry logic**: Exponential backoff with jitter

### Query Interface Design
1. **GraphQL extensions**: Time travel, partition filtering
2. **Caching hierarchy**: Memory → IndexedDB → Service Worker → CDN
3. **Progressive loading**: Adaptive resolution based on viewport
4. **Real-time updates**: WebSocket/SSE for live data

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| R2 latency | High | Metadata caching in Workers KV |
| Worker memory limits | High | Streaming APIs, smaller batches |
| Concurrent writes | Medium | Optimistic locking, retry logic |
| Schema breaking changes | Medium | Validation before deployment |

### Operational Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| Data loss | Critical | Transaction logs, checksums |
| Performance degradation | High | Continuous monitoring, alerts |
| Compaction failures | Medium | Manual fallback procedures |
