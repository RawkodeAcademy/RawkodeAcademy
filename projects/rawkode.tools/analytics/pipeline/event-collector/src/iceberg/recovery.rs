//! Error recovery mechanisms for Iceberg operations
//! 
//! This module provides utilities for recovering from various failure scenarios
//! in the Iceberg implementation, including:
//! - Partial write failures
//! - Metadata corruption
//! - Network timeouts
//! - Memory exhaustion

// Imports removed as recovery features are not yet implemented

// Note: Recovery strategies and circuit breaker patterns have been removed
// as they are not currently implemented. They can be added back when needed.
