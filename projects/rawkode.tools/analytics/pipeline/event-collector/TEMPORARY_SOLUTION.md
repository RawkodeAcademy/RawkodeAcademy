# Temporary Solution: Direct R2 Writes

Since R2 Data Catalog is returning 404 errors, here's a temporary solution to get data flowing:

## Option 1: Direct Parquet Writes (No Catalog)

Instead of using the REST Catalog API, we can:
1. Write Parquet files directly to R2
2. Skip the Iceberg metadata management
3. Query the Parquet files directly using tools like DuckDB or Apache Spark

## Option 2: Use Cloudflare Analytics Engine

Since you have Analytics Engine configured, you could:
1. Write events to Analytics Engine instead of Iceberg
2. Use Analytics Engine's SQL API for queries
3. This is already configured in your wrangler.jsonc

## Option 3: Check R2 Data Catalog Setup

1. Verify R2 Data Catalog is enabled:
   - Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → R2 → Your Bucket → Settings
   - Check if "Data Catalog" is enabled
   - It might be in limited availability or require specific setup

2. Check API Token Permissions:
   - Ensure R2_DATA_CATALOG_API_TOKEN has the right scopes
   - Might need "R2 Data Catalog:Edit" permission

## Recommended Immediate Action

For now, let's modify the code to write Parquet files directly to R2 without the catalog:

```rust
// In flush_to_iceberg, replace catalog operations with:
// 1. Write the Parquet file to R2
// 2. Log success
// 3. Clear the buffer
```

This will at least get your data into R2 in a queryable format while we figure out the catalog issue.
