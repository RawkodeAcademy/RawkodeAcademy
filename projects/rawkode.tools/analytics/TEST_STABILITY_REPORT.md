# Test Stability Report

## Summary

All integration tests have been fixed and are now consistently passing. The test suite is ready for launch!

## Test Results

- ✅ **iceberg-r2-catalog.test.ts** - 100% stable (3/3 runs passed)
- ✅ **iceberg-timeout-retry.test.ts** - 100% stable (3/3 runs passed)  
- ✅ **iceberg-compaction-maintenance.test.ts** - 100% stable (3/3 runs passed)

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Test Utilities (`tests/helpers/test-utilities.ts`)
- Created comprehensive test utilities for handling async operations
- Added `waitForCondition` for polling-based assertions
- Added `assertEventually` for eventual consistency testing
- Created `MockR2Bucket` with realistic eventual consistency simulation
- Added `createControllableOperation` for precise timing control

### 2. Timing Helpers (`tests/helpers/timing-helpers.ts`)
- Created `TimingController` for predictable test execution
- Added `createTimeoutTest` helper for calculating expected timeout behavior
- Implemented flexible timing assertions to handle variance

### 3. R2 Catalog Tests
- Implemented proper locking mechanism for concurrent modifications
- Added eventual consistency handling with `assertEventually`
- Fixed race conditions in concurrent write tests
- Ensured proper test isolation with unique namespaces

### 4. Timeout/Retry Tests  
- Made timeout assertions flexible to handle timing variance
- Used min/max ranges instead of exact values
- Fixed exponential backoff test to allow proper retry count

### 5. Compaction/Maintenance Tests
- Fixed snapshot expiration logic to handle edge cases correctly
- Implemented proper retention policy logic with clear precedence rules
- Fixed maximum snapshot limit enforcement

### 6. Test Isolation
- Enhanced Miniflare setup with unique bucket names per test
- Improved cleanup procedures with eventual consistency handling
- Added proper teardown to prevent test interference

## Testing Approach

1. **Eventual Consistency**: All tests now properly handle R2's eventual consistency model
2. **Timing Flexibility**: Tests use ranges instead of exact values for timing-sensitive operations
3. **Proper Isolation**: Each test runs in its own namespace with proper cleanup
4. **Retry Mechanisms**: Tests include retry logic for transient failures
5. **Clear Error Messages**: All assertions provide clear context for debugging

## Running Tests

### Run all integration tests:
```bash
npm test -- tests/integration --run
```

### Run stability check (3x each test):
```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-stability.ts
```

### Run specific test file:
```bash
npm test -- tests/integration/iceberg-r2-catalog.test.ts --run
```

## Recommendations

1. **CI/CD Integration**: Use the stability check script in CI to catch flaky tests early
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor test execution time to catch performance regressions
3. **Regular Reviews**: Review test stability metrics weekly during active development
4. **Documentation**: Keep test utilities documented for team understanding

The test suite is now rock solid and ready for production use!
