**In order to** leverage ACID transactions and time travel capabilities  
**As an** Analytics Engineer  
**I want to** create and manage Iceberg tables on R2 storage

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given valid table schema, when creating an Iceberg table, then table metadata is stored in R2
- Given an existing table, when updating table properties, then changes are atomic
- Given multiple concurrent writers, when writing to same table, then operations are serialized correctly
- Given a table creation request, when R2 is unavailable, then appropriate error is returned

#### Story 1.2: Parquet to Iceberg Migration
**In order to** preserve historical data while gaining Iceberg benefits  
**As a** Platform Engineer  
**I want to** migrate existing Parquet files to Iceberg tables

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given existing Parquet files, when migration runs, then all data is preserved in Iceberg format
- Given partitioned Parquet data, when migrating, then partitioning scheme is maintained
- Given migration in progress, when queries arrive, then they continue to work on old data
- Given successful migration, when validated, then row counts and data integrity match source

### Epic 2: Event Collection with Transactions

#### Story 2.1: Transactional Event Writes
**In order to** ensure data consistency and prevent partial writes  
**As an** Analytics Engineer  
**I want to** write events using ACID transactions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given batch of events, when write fails midway, then no events from batch are visible
- Given concurrent event batches, when writing, then all succeed without conflicts
- Given successful write, when queried immediately, then data is visible
- Given write transaction, when committing, then performance remains under 100ms

#### Story 2.2: Exactly-Once Event Processing
**In order to** prevent duplicate events in analytics  
**As a** Platform Engineer  
**I want to** implement exactly-once semantics for event ingestion

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given duplicate event ID, when processing, then only one instance is stored
- Given network retry, when event is resent, then duplicate is detected and ignored
- Given idempotency check, when performed, then latency impact is under 10ms
- Given event deduplication, when active, then storage overhead is less than 5%

### Epic 3: Time Travel and History

- Given time range query, when executed, then performance is within 2x of current query
- Given invalid timestamp, when querying, then helpful error message is returned
- Given time travel query, when via GraphQL, then syntax is intuitive

#### Story 3.2: Data Rollback Capability
**In order to** recover from bad data imports or transformations  
**As an** Analytics Engineer  
**I want to** rollback tables to previous states

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given table and timestamp, when rollback executed, then table state is restored
- Given rollback operation, when completed, then audit log entry is created
- Given active queries, when rollback happens, then they complete with consistent results
- Given rollback, when successful, then notification is sent to stakeholders

### Epic 4: Schema Evolution

#### Story 4.1: Non-Breaking Schema Changes
**In order to** adapt to changing business requirements  
**As an** Analytics Engineer  
**I want to** evolve table schemas without breaking existing queries

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given new column addition, when added, then existing queries continue working
- Given column rename, when executed, then both old and new names work temporarily
- Given type promotion, when applied, then data is automatically converted
- Given schema change, when applied, then change is instantly visible to new queries

#### Story 4.2: Schema Versioning and Documentation
**In order to** understand data model changes over time  
**As a** Data Analyst  
**I want to** view schema history and documentation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given table name, when requesting schema, then current and historical versions are available

#### Story 5.2: Partition Pruning and Statistics
**In order to** achieve sub-second query response times  
**As a** Data Analyst  
**I want to** leverage partition pruning and column statistics

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given partitioned query, when executed, then only relevant partitions are scanned
