## Context
Mix‑minus in v1 adds complexity. We want Meet‑like interaction without echo.

## Decision
Provide guests a program video return (muted) and receive other participants’ audio via SFU. No program audio to guests.

## Consequences
- Pros: No self‑echo; simpler than mix‑minus.
- Cons: Program audio cues not heard as a single mix; requires client audio mixing.
