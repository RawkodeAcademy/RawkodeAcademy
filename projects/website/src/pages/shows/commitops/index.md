## The Cloud Native CI/CD Podcast

### What is CommitOps?

CommitOps is a monthly Cloud Native CI/CD podcast that features four amazing guests, every month, from the best CI/CD companies in the Cloud Native community.

We meet on first Wednesday of every month with our panel to discuss a topic within the Cloud Native security space.

The podcast will be recorded live and streamed to YouTube, Twitter, and LinkedIn. The podcast will also be published to all major podcast platforms.
