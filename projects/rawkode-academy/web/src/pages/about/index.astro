	<h2>The History Lesson</h2>

	<h3>The Early Years</h3>
	<p class="mb-4 dark:text-white">
		Starting his career, back in 2003, David joined a small local development
		company that specialised in ticketing systems for horse racing tracks across
		the UK. His favourite thing about working at a smaller shop was the ability
		to work across the entire product stack; including custom kernel development
		(C), backend servers (C & PHP), front-end point of sale terminals (C++ with
		QT3), and even mobile development (C#) ... which wasn't like mobile
		development today; have you ever tried a Windows CE 4 device? ðŸ˜…
	</p>

	<p class="mb-4 dark:text-white">
		Given that this was a small team, David was also responsible for the
		infrastructure that ran the company's products; primarily due to his
		extensive Linux knowledge having ran Linux on the desktop since his first
		Coral Linux install in 2000. Is it they year of the Linux desktop yet? ðŸ¤”
	</p>

	<p class="mb-4 dark:text-white">
		Working with all these technologies from early on in his career, David
		become a bit of a technology magpie; continually exploring and experimenting
		with new technologies to better understand the problems they solved and the
		paradigms they brought. One of the first technologies to capture David's
		attention was Puppet, back in 2004. Puppet revolutionised the way the
		company managed their fleet of servers, which where all located at their
		customer sites across the UK. No more 3 hour drives at 4am in the morning to
		fix a server that had crashed due to a power outage. ðŸ™Œ
	</p>

	<h3>First Real Scaling Challenge</h3>

	<p class="mb-4 dark:text-white">
		David was an early adopter of cloud, containers, and cloud-native
		technologies. During his time as the Director of Development for a rock and
		metal media organization called TeamRock (now LouderSound), David was
		responsible for the software, infrastructure, and website during its biggest
		test: the unfortunate death of Lemmy Kilmister. Fortunately, due to his
		desire to experiment and play with new technologies, David and his team had
		already migrated their slow to provision virtual-machine centric
		infrastructure to containerised workloads running on Amazon Web Services the
		year prior, 2014, not long after the public launch of Docker.
	</p>

	<h3>The Educator</h3>

	<p class="mb-4 dark:text-white">
		As much as David enjoys writing software, scaling infrastructure, and
		leading teams; he quickly realised that his passion was helping others learn
		and be successful. David started presenting at local user groups in 2016,
		slowly working up to conferences, before eventually moving into a full-time
		Developer Advocacy position at InfluxData
	</p>

	<p class="mb-4 dark:text-white">
		During his time at Influx, David was a driving force to help make it easier
		for people operating Kubernetes adopt InfluxDB and Telegraf as their stack
		of choice for metric collection and storage. This didn't just involve being
		at conferences and user-groups speaking about monitoring and observing
		Kubernetes clusters, but actively working with engineering to ensure the
		project was easier to deploy and manage on top of Kubernetes.

	<p class="mb-4 font-medium dark:text-white">
		After moving on from InfluxData, David joined Equinix Metal where he
		continued to work-on and grow the Rawkode Academy by helping developers and
		operators learn how to run and use Kubernetes, and other Cloud Native
		technologies, on bare metal; which comes with a whole host of challenges
		that are not present when running on a cloud provider.
	</p>

	<p class="mb-4 font-medium dark:text-white">
		Throughout his time working with Kubernetes, David was a fan and keen
		watcher of TGIK, a weekly live stream hosted by Joe Beda, one of the
		creators of Kubernetes. On TGIK, Joe live streamed himself exploring new
		Cloud Native technologies, by working through the documentation and
		examples. Often, he'd rely on the maintainers and contributors to those
		projects being active in the chat to help him out when he got stuck. This is
		when David decided that he wanted to carry on TGIK in his own way, by
		inviting the maintainers and contributors of said projects on a live-stream
		with him, where they could not only help him when there were issues, but
		also talk about the project and the problems it solves while sharing its
		history, flavour, and context.
