00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.930
<v Speaker 0>Hello, and welcome back to the Rawkode Academy.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.825
<v Speaker 0>I am your host, David Flanagan, also known

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:17.665
<v Speaker 0>across the Internet as Rawkode.

00:01:17.745 --> 00:01:19.585
<v Speaker 0>And today is an episode of Rawkode Live,

00:01:19.585 --> 00:01:20.945
<v Speaker 0>the show where we take a look at

00:01:20.945 --> 00:01:23.104
<v Speaker 0>all the latest and greatest open source cloud

00:01:23.104 --> 00:01:24.225
<v Speaker 0>native projects.

00:01:24.545 --> 00:01:26.305
<v Speaker 0>And today is no exception. We are taking

00:01:26.305 --> 00:01:27.985
<v Speaker 0>a look at a project called Preq, as

00:01:27.985 --> 00:01:29.745
<v Speaker 0>you may have gathered from the intro music.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.610
<v Speaker 0>It's going to help us build and run more

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.170
<v Speaker 0>reliable software. And our guest and host for

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.130
<v Speaker 0>today is,

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.970
<v Speaker 0>Tony.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.090
<v Speaker 0>Hey, man. How's it going?

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Listen.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'm blown away by that

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.530
<v Speaker 1>song. Like, I think we should just put

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.715
<v Speaker 1>that on a loop and make that the

00:01:45.715 --> 00:01:47.155
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle. That's incredible.

00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:50.195
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing great. This was like, that that

00:01:50.195 --> 00:01:51.795
<v Speaker 1>was amazing. That was hilarious. That was awesome.

00:01:51.795 --> 00:01:54.355
<v Speaker 0>Should we just quickly go ahead? I mean,

00:01:54.355 --> 00:01:56.275
<v Speaker 1>you know, that's that was amazing.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.140
<v Speaker 0>AI today in 2025.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.700
<v Speaker 0>What time? Like, the fact that that song

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.620
<v Speaker 0>can be put together, and I don't even

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.660
<v Speaker 0>need to know how to play a guitar

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.900
<v Speaker 0>or anything. So it's a real no. It's

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.580
<v Speaker 1>a real band. That's the community put that

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.340
<v Speaker 1>together. Can we? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.605
<v Speaker 0>sure. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. No, it's awesome to

00:02:14.605 --> 00:02:16.285
<v Speaker 1>be here. I, your your podcast is amazing.

00:02:16.285 --> 00:02:17.805
<v Speaker 1>We were just talking earlier about the WASM,

00:02:17.805 --> 00:02:19.325
<v Speaker 1>the WASM podcast you did a couple of

00:02:19.325 --> 00:02:20.845
<v Speaker 1>days ago or weeks ago. It was

00:02:21.405 --> 00:02:22.525
<v Speaker 1>awesome to be here. Thank you for your

00:02:22.525 --> 00:02:23.005
<v Speaker 1>time.

00:02:23.405 --> 00:02:25.405
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Thank you for joining me. So for

00:02:25.405 --> 00:02:27.245
<v Speaker 0>anyone who's not familiar with you and your

00:02:27.245 --> 00:02:28.530
<v Speaker 0>work, please take a little bit of time

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.969
<v Speaker 0>just to say hello and tell them what

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:32.129
<v Speaker 0>you've been up to. Yeah. So my name

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.930
<v Speaker 1>is Tony. I'm a CTO at a company

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.049
<v Speaker 1>called Prequel

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.090
<v Speaker 1>and a maintainer of a tool called Preq.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Quick background from me is I spent my

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.409
<v Speaker 1>first

00:02:44.034 --> 00:02:45.555
<v Speaker 1>ten years of my career

00:02:46.435 --> 00:02:48.915
<v Speaker 1>doing vulnerability and exploit development here in the

00:02:48.915 --> 00:02:50.915
<v Speaker 1>US at a place called the National Security

00:02:50.915 --> 00:02:52.915
<v Speaker 1>Agency. So I loved working there. The mission

00:02:52.915 --> 00:02:53.875
<v Speaker 1>was really fun,

00:02:54.834 --> 00:02:56.515
<v Speaker 1>really humbling experience.

00:02:57.075 --> 00:02:59.620
<v Speaker 1>You jump into the deep end, and it's

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.420
<v Speaker 1>a very hard

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.580
<v Speaker 1>job and but a fun mission.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.900
<v Speaker 1>But, you know, I don't know if this

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.460
<v Speaker 1>is known widely, but the government can sometimes

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.500
<v Speaker 1>be this, you know, big bureaucratic organization that

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.380
<v Speaker 1>moves slow sometimes.

00:03:12.095 --> 00:03:15.935
<v Speaker 1>So I ended up leaving in 2014

00:03:16.334 --> 00:03:18.095
<v Speaker 1>to join a startup, so the opposite end

00:03:18.095 --> 00:03:19.855
<v Speaker 1>of the spectrum. And it was a company

00:03:19.855 --> 00:03:20.415
<v Speaker 1>called

00:03:20.735 --> 00:03:23.215
<v Speaker 1>Endgame, where we were building an endpoint security

00:03:23.215 --> 00:03:23.775
<v Speaker 1>product.

00:03:24.174 --> 00:03:25.935
<v Speaker 1>So I was there for for a while

00:03:25.935 --> 00:03:28.894
<v Speaker 1>as VP of engineering, and we ended up

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.440
<v Speaker 1>selling that business to a company called Elastic,

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.680
<v Speaker 1>the makers of Kibana and Elasticsearch.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.519
<v Speaker 1>Really big in open source, and that's kind

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.519
<v Speaker 1>of how I got my first introduction into

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.840
<v Speaker 1>working with open source communities. So I was

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.560
<v Speaker 1>there for

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.720
<v Speaker 1>quite a while doing

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.319
<v Speaker 1>a VP of engineering, but

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:46.495
<v Speaker 1>I still would find every excuse to cancel

00:03:46.495 --> 00:03:48.095
<v Speaker 1>a meeting, go jump on an incident or

00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:49.455
<v Speaker 1>not. I should go chase the bug. I

00:03:49.455 --> 00:03:50.895
<v Speaker 1>think it was probably chasing the first ten

00:03:50.895 --> 00:03:51.935
<v Speaker 1>years of my career.

00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:55.615
<v Speaker 1>I've always sort of been haunted by problems

00:03:55.615 --> 00:03:58.095
<v Speaker 1>in software and bugs and curious to

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.170
<v Speaker 1>I think the best way to understand software

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.410
<v Speaker 1>is when it breaks. And so we ended

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.010
<v Speaker 1>up building a product to kind of help

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.489
<v Speaker 1>practitioners, engineers figure out when their software breaks,

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:07.930
<v Speaker 1>that's how we ended up on Preq.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:09.370
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.690
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Lots of love there.

00:04:12.375 --> 00:04:14.775
<v Speaker 0>I've skipped over the government, alright. Okay.

00:04:15.735 --> 00:04:17.654
<v Speaker 0>You know, working on security is obviously gonna

00:04:17.654 --> 00:04:19.015
<v Speaker 0>teach you a lot. Working

00:04:19.815 --> 00:04:21.735
<v Speaker 0>with bugs, of course. I love that you

00:04:21.735 --> 00:04:23.895
<v Speaker 0>mentioned that, you know, software

00:04:24.375 --> 00:04:26.699
<v Speaker 0>does break and people are human and people

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.940
<v Speaker 0>introduce bugs every single day and things go

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.580
<v Speaker 0>wrong. And one of my shows called clustered

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.860
<v Speaker 0>that I haven't done in a long time,

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.539
<v Speaker 0>but I'd love to bring it back. People

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.620
<v Speaker 0>always said, oh, the breaks are too contrived,

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.060
<v Speaker 0>and the premise of the show was live

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.725
<v Speaker 0>debugging. And I'm like, yeah. But people shouldn't

00:04:40.725 --> 00:04:42.565
<v Speaker 0>have to know this stuff. But when you

00:04:42.565 --> 00:04:44.565
<v Speaker 0>do, you do. Right? And it's like when

00:04:44.565 --> 00:04:46.485
<v Speaker 0>things go wrong, when things are broken, when

00:04:46.485 --> 00:04:48.085
<v Speaker 0>shit really hits the fan,

00:04:48.325 --> 00:04:49.845
<v Speaker 0>that has been you learn all these little

00:04:49.845 --> 00:04:51.445
<v Speaker 0>tiny nuggets of knowledge that you would never

00:04:51.445 --> 00:04:54.085
<v Speaker 0>learn under any book or other circumstance than

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:55.950
<v Speaker 0>when things are on fire. And I think

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.710
<v Speaker 0>that is a great way. And people should

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.630
<v Speaker 0>embrace failures and bugs and all of this

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.150
<v Speaker 0>stuff. But we have this

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.150
<v Speaker 0>not that I wanna try and solve software

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.710
<v Speaker 0>engineering as a community or anything, right? But

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.150
<v Speaker 0>there's a stigma, and we need to kinda

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.230
<v Speaker 0>get past that and be vulnerable and be

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.655
<v Speaker 0>willing to make mistakes in public. And, yeah,

00:05:11.655 --> 00:05:13.735
<v Speaker 0>I wish more people would do that anyway.

00:05:13.735 --> 00:05:15.895
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yep. Totally agree. That's why I think

00:05:15.895 --> 00:05:17.335
<v Speaker 0>it's really cool that we're taking a look

00:05:17.335 --> 00:05:19.655
<v Speaker 0>at Preq by Prequel

00:05:19.655 --> 00:05:22.455
<v Speaker 0>founded by yourself on this show. So

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:25.020
<v Speaker 0>what is Preq?

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I guess there's, you know, the short

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.660
<v Speaker 1>version is

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:32.379
<v Speaker 1>like, if you've ever written software or even,

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:33.500
<v Speaker 1>you know, used it,

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:35.419
<v Speaker 1>and and this could be, you know, SaaS

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:37.340
<v Speaker 1>software or it could be Ubuntu,

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.255
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is, you know, like we just

00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:40.935
<v Speaker 1>said, it inevitably breaks.

00:05:42.535 --> 00:05:44.455
<v Speaker 1>You know, all too often, you know, especially

00:05:44.455 --> 00:05:46.375
<v Speaker 1>if you're, you know, a maintainer or engineer

00:05:46.375 --> 00:05:48.695
<v Speaker 1>that has to support that software, even if

00:05:48.695 --> 00:05:50.695
<v Speaker 1>you're in customer success and you've, you know,

00:05:50.695 --> 00:05:52.295
<v Speaker 1>got a bunch of known issues with older

00:05:52.295 --> 00:05:54.440
<v Speaker 1>versions of software, know, when it breaks, you

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.120
<v Speaker 1>often go on this hunt, and you're looking

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.120
<v Speaker 1>through all of this data. You you start

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.320
<v Speaker 1>with your investigation,

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.199
<v Speaker 1>you know, hours, sometimes days later, you'll end

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:03.960
<v Speaker 1>up like, oh, here's a known issue with

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.320
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of other people that have run

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.400
<v Speaker 1>into the same thing, and here's what they

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.655
<v Speaker 1>did to fix it. And, oh, let me

00:06:09.655 --> 00:06:11.575
<v Speaker 1>try that. Okay. Cool. That fixed it. Now

00:06:11.575 --> 00:06:13.255
<v Speaker 1>let me put a detection in place.

00:06:14.135 --> 00:06:14.695
<v Speaker 1>And

00:06:15.015 --> 00:06:17.015
<v Speaker 1>that I don't like that world. That world's

00:06:17.015 --> 00:06:18.455
<v Speaker 1>not fun to live in. I mean, look.

00:06:18.455 --> 00:06:20.215
<v Speaker 1>I love doing investigations. I love it when

00:06:20.215 --> 00:06:20.935
<v Speaker 1>software breaks,

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:23.910
<v Speaker 1>but it's always that bittersweet moment whenever you

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.150
<v Speaker 1>find that issue that other people have seen.

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:29.110
<v Speaker 1>I think Preq is sort of our

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.069
<v Speaker 1>our vision is to kind of create a

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:34.710
<v Speaker 1>world where if someone in the world has

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:35.909
<v Speaker 1>seen this problem before,

00:06:36.775 --> 00:06:38.535
<v Speaker 1>that should be the last time. That first

00:06:38.535 --> 00:06:39.895
<v Speaker 1>time should be the last time. And then

00:06:39.895 --> 00:06:41.495
<v Speaker 1>we should start with that detection and share

00:06:41.495 --> 00:06:42.295
<v Speaker 1>that knowledge.

00:06:42.695 --> 00:06:44.615
<v Speaker 1>Kind of we call it reliability intelligence,

00:06:44.775 --> 00:06:46.295
<v Speaker 1>Common Reliability Enumerations.

00:06:46.295 --> 00:06:48.135
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's that's the goal of

00:06:48.135 --> 00:06:49.495
<v Speaker 1>Preq is how do you come up with

00:06:49.495 --> 00:06:50.615
<v Speaker 1>a way where you can start with a

00:06:50.615 --> 00:06:53.730
<v Speaker 1>detection first that actually shows you the problem

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.050
<v Speaker 1>and the mitigation? Like, here's what the rest

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.330
<v Speaker 1>of the community has done when they've seen

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:58.050
<v Speaker 1>this problem.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.010
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I love that. You're building

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.370
<v Speaker 0>a library, a collective knowledge, if you will,

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:04.930
<v Speaker 0>of

00:07:05.875 --> 00:07:08.435
<v Speaker 0>things that go wrong in software and allowing

00:07:08.435 --> 00:07:11.475
<v Speaker 0>people to detect that early upfront, a shift

00:07:11.475 --> 00:07:12.995
<v Speaker 0>left if you wanna throw in a corporate

00:07:12.995 --> 00:07:15.155
<v Speaker 0>buzzword, right? That is a a good mission,

00:07:15.155 --> 00:07:17.635
<v Speaker 0>a very noble mission indeed. Yeah. We're giving,

00:07:18.195 --> 00:07:19.555

<v Speaker 1>we're it's it's sort of a new idea

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.590
<v Speaker 1>and reliability, but it's also an approach that

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.470
<v Speaker 1>has worked really well in security for twenty

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.790
<v Speaker 1>years because it was a similar situation

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.630
<v Speaker 1>in the early 2000s where you would have

00:07:32.545 --> 00:07:35.825
<v Speaker 1>individuals chasing problems, but those problems were security

00:07:35.825 --> 00:07:38.225
