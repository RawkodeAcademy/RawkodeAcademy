<v Speaker 0>Hey.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.160
<v Speaker 0>Have you heard of DuckDuckGo?

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.320
<v Speaker 0>No. What's that?

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.799
<v Speaker 0>It's a search engine that's privacy focused.

00:00:13.785 --> 00:00:15.465
<v Speaker 0>It means you can search for whatever you

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:17.865
<v Speaker 0>want and don't leak any information takes there

00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:20.505
<v Speaker 0>no bad search engines, you know, like Google.

00:00:23.145 --> 00:00:23.865
<v Speaker 0>Are

00:00:24.025 --> 00:00:25.705
<v Speaker 0>it results

00:00:25.705 --> 00:00:26.744
<v Speaker 0>as good as Google?

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:31.849
<v Speaker 0>No. Not really.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.010
<v Speaker 0>But it does have this really killer feature

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.289
<v Speaker 0>called bangs,

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.690
<v Speaker 0>which allow you to search on other search

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:38.410
<v Speaker 0>engines.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.489
<v Speaker 0>So

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.090
<v Speaker 0>how often do you use bangs?

00:00:45.465 --> 00:00:47.145
<v Speaker 0>I pretty much only use bangs.
