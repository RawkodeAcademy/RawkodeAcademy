00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.080
<v Speaker 0>Hey. Welcome.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.319
<v Speaker 0>Today, we're gonna take a look at how

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.120
<v Speaker 0>my stream is automated and how easy it

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.960
<v Speaker 0>is for me to schedule a new episode

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.160
<v Speaker 0>of clustered.

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.755
<v Speaker 0>Now you'll see there is no stream schedule

00:00:13.755 --> 00:00:15.434
<v Speaker 0>for this one for today and then one

00:00:15.434 --> 00:00:18.474
<v Speaker 0>next week, but there's no clustered on Thursday,

00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:21.675
<v Speaker 0>something that I normally schedule every Monday.

00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:23.915
<v Speaker 0>Oops. I'm a little bit late today, but

00:00:23.915 --> 00:00:25.195
<v Speaker 0>it has worked out in our favor.

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:27.329
<v Speaker 0>Now

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.449
<v Speaker 0>everything is German through a headless CMS. This

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.369
<v Speaker 0>is the Contentful.com.

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.290
<v Speaker 0>I'm on the free plan, which gives you

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.649
<v Speaker 0>25,000

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:36.530
<v Speaker 0>entries.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.170
<v Speaker 0>You'll see I'm only using 300,

00:00:40.085 --> 00:00:42.485
<v Speaker 0>But we're going to search for

00:00:42.805 --> 00:00:43.685
<v Speaker 0>clustered.

00:00:44.885 --> 00:00:46.725
<v Speaker 0>And here, we will see some of the

00:00:46.725 --> 00:00:48.565
<v Speaker 0>episodes that we've had recently.

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:51.845
<v Speaker 0>The most recent episode was clustered 16.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.420
<v Speaker 0>But because this week's episode is a team's

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.739
<v Speaker 0>edition, I am going to clone this.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.900
<v Speaker 0>Clustered is pretty much the same every week.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.620
<v Speaker 0>The guests change, but the description and

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:06.905
<v Speaker 0>other

00:01:07.465 --> 00:01:09.385
<v Speaker 0>the description and other things are all the

00:01:09.385 --> 00:01:11.465
<v Speaker 0>same. But, really, I'm just going to come

00:01:11.465 --> 00:01:13.145
<v Speaker 0>in here and update the teams.

00:01:14.745 --> 00:01:18.025
<v Speaker 0>And spoiler alert, this Thursday's custard is feature

00:01:18.025 --> 00:01:20.825
<v Speaker 0>in teams from Digital Illusion and from Skyscanner.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.970
<v Speaker 0>From here, I can tell it which show,

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.890
<v Speaker 0>so I can have different branding, descriptions, and

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.890
<v Speaker 0>automation depending on the shows that I'm I'm

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.130
<v Speaker 0>working on. Right now, it primarily is just

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.330
<v Speaker 0>Rawkode Live.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.290
<v Speaker 0>We have a series which allows us to

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.525
<v Speaker 0>have some pretty nice

00:01:36.605 --> 00:01:37.485
<v Speaker 0>description

00:01:37.485 --> 00:01:40.765
<v Speaker 0>or at least linkage within our videos.

00:01:41.245 --> 00:01:42.685
<v Speaker 0>So let me just make sure that doesn't

00:01:42.685 --> 00:01:44.685
<v Speaker 0>play. But if we jump down here and

00:01:44.685 --> 00:01:45.885
<v Speaker 0>say show more,

00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:49.180
<v Speaker 0>you'll see that the series actually lists every

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.500
<v Speaker 0>other episode of clustered on the link.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.659
<v Speaker 0>So by adding

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.220
<v Speaker 0>our episode to this, we will see

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.460
<v Speaker 0>all previous episodes of clustered description be updated

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.579
<v Speaker 0>to include

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.020
<v Speaker 0>the new video.

00:02:03.755 --> 00:02:05.195
<v Speaker 0>And let me just show you what this

00:02:05.195 --> 00:02:06.954
<v Speaker 0>looks like. So we'll remove this just now

00:02:06.954 --> 00:02:09.354
<v Speaker 0>and we'll add that back in after we've

00:02:09.354 --> 00:02:11.595
<v Speaker 0>already published it so you can see that

00:02:11.755 --> 00:02:13.915
<v Speaker 0>cascading update across our videos.

00:02:15.035 --> 00:02:17.435
<v Speaker 0>This week's episode is, well, this week.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.069
<v Speaker 0>Why can't I scroll? I'm gonna move it

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.030
<v Speaker 0>off monitor.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.630
<v Speaker 0>That's an interesting bug.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.989
<v Speaker 0>Okay. We've updated it to July 29. I

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.990
<v Speaker 0>believe the time is 05:30

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.790
<v Speaker 0>as always.

00:02:32.424 --> 00:02:35.305
<v Speaker 0>It is awesome. Nothing to change there. And

00:02:35.305 --> 00:02:37.224
<v Speaker 0>now we're gonna change our teams. So we

00:02:37.224 --> 00:02:38.825
<v Speaker 0>can hit move from this is I get

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.025
<v Speaker 0>for trying to do it on my little

00:02:40.025 --> 00:02:41.784
<v Speaker 0>monitor so I can look straightforward the whole

00:02:41.784 --> 00:02:42.425
<v Speaker 0>time.

00:02:43.144 --> 00:02:43.944
<v Speaker 0>Now

00:02:43.944 --> 00:02:45.625
<v Speaker 0>we will add digital

00:02:45.625 --> 00:02:46.185
<v Speaker 0>ocean.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.370
<v Speaker 0>Thank you. And Skyscanner.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.010
<v Speaker 0>And insert.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.970
<v Speaker 0>And those are our two guests, two teams

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:57.770
<v Speaker 0>for this episode.

00:02:59.585 --> 00:03:01.105
<v Speaker 0>I could scroll down here

00:03:02.145 --> 00:03:03.905
<v Speaker 0>and update this.

00:03:04.225 --> 00:03:06.705
<v Speaker 0>But, yeah, this is slightly repetition.

00:03:06.705 --> 00:03:08.944
<v Speaker 0>I could definitely automate this too, but for

00:03:08.944 --> 00:03:10.225
<v Speaker 0>now, it's alright.

00:03:10.705 --> 00:03:12.865
<v Speaker 0>Thank you to Teleport for continuing to sponsored

00:03:12.865 --> 00:03:13.425
<v Speaker 0>clustered.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.510
<v Speaker 0>We scroll down. Now we don't want to

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.630
<v Speaker 0>use this image,

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.110
<v Speaker 0>so we'll remove it. We don't want to

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 0>overwrite an existing YouTube video, so we'll remove

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:22.470
<v Speaker 0>it.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 0>And we have a JSON editor here that

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.550
<v Speaker 0>just puts on the first time segment for

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.950
<v Speaker 0>the video.

00:03:27.825 --> 00:03:29.185
<v Speaker 0>We have no length,

00:03:30.145 --> 00:03:31.105
<v Speaker 0>and now

00:03:33.105 --> 00:03:34.305
<v Speaker 0>we have published.

00:03:35.584 --> 00:03:38.144
<v Speaker 0>Now what's happening behind the scenes was that

00:03:38.144 --> 00:03:41.025
<v Speaker 0>Contentful is configured with a webhook configuration.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.220
<v Speaker 0>And you'll see that whenever I update a

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.860
<v Speaker 0>series, an episode, or a guest, it triggers

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.020
<v Speaker 0>a function on pipedream.net.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.700
<v Speaker 0>Pipe dream is then reaching out to YouTube,

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.060
<v Speaker 0>but it's checking to see if that YouTube

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.784
<v Speaker 0>ID exists. If it doesn't, it goes and

00:03:57.784 --> 00:03:59.545
<v Speaker 0>creates a video. And then checks to see

00:03:59.545 --> 00:04:01.065
<v Speaker 0>if an image exists. If it doesn't, it

00:04:01.065 --> 00:04:03.864
<v Speaker 0>generates an image. And then once it has

00:04:03.864 --> 00:04:05.385
<v Speaker 0>all of those missing components,

00:04:05.944 --> 00:04:07.385
<v Speaker 0>updates the description

00:04:07.465 --> 00:04:09.224
<v Speaker 0>and publishes the entire thing.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.910
<v Speaker 0>Now we're gonna do the CDs modification

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.270
<v Speaker 0>shortly after, but first, let's go back to

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.790
<v Speaker 0>Rawkode.live

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.470
<v Speaker 0>and see if our new episode is listed.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.790
<v Speaker 0>And there it is.

00:04:26.355 --> 00:04:29.235
<v Speaker 0>Cluster teams, DigitalOcean, and Skyscanner.

00:04:29.715 --> 00:04:32.995
<v Speaker 0>Now this image is generated for us. It

00:04:32.995 --> 00:04:36.675
<v Speaker 0>pulls in their images from GitHub profile photos.

00:04:36.675 --> 00:04:38.755
<v Speaker 0>So this is the DigitalOcean logo from GitHub,

00:04:38.755 --> 00:04:40.570
<v Speaker 0>and this is the Skyscanner logo from GitHub.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.730
<v Speaker 0>Not the best example in this automation because

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.210
<v Speaker 0>they're transparent, but still cool that it's all

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.690
<v Speaker 0>done.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.290
<v Speaker 0>This is all generated for us from the

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.690
<v Speaker 0>automation on Pipedream. So, you know, I didn't

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.530
<v Speaker 0>say that this is Rawkode Live and it's

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.970
<v Speaker 0>hosted by me and this is my website,

00:04:55.305 --> 00:04:57.225
<v Speaker 0>etcetera. I didn't set that we wanted a

00:04:57.225 --> 00:05:00.505
<v Speaker 0>timeline or the guest information and team information.

00:05:00.745 --> 00:05:02.824
<v Speaker 0>This is all part of that automation that

00:05:02.824 --> 00:05:04.665
<v Speaker 0>comes through for us.

00:05:05.065 --> 00:05:07.465
<v Speaker 0>You'll see there's no list here of clustered

00:05:07.465 --> 00:05:08.425
<v Speaker 0>episodes.

00:05:08.585 --> 00:05:09.785
<v Speaker 0>So we're gonna fix that now.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.050
<v Speaker 0>We jump into here and we'll see this

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.690
<v Speaker 0>is

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:15.810
<v Speaker 0>clustered.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:22.610
<v Speaker 0>I will hit publish.

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:35.875
<v Speaker 0>What should happen now is that we should

00:05:35.875 --> 00:05:37.795
<v Speaker 0>be able to pop over

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.590
<v Speaker 0>to the YouTube page, refresh the description,

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.990
<v Speaker 0>see the series information

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.110
<v Speaker 0>on our new DigitalOcean and Skyscanner video.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.270
<v Speaker 0>Not only that, I should be able to

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.310
<v Speaker 0>click on any clustered video and see our

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.030
<v Speaker 0>new episode.

00:05:55.095 --> 00:05:57.175
<v Speaker 0>In fact, it's already reloaded

00:05:57.814 --> 00:06:00.294
<v Speaker 0>page for me. That's nice. Let's just do

00:06:00.294 --> 00:06:01.095
<v Speaker 0>it anyway.

00:06:03.495 --> 00:06:04.935
<v Speaker 0>And we have our CDs information

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.669
<v Speaker 0>and we have the order's a little bit

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.470
<v Speaker 0>funny, but there we go. We have DigitalOcean

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.710
<v Speaker 0>and Skyscanner here. Now I'm just going to

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.270
<v Speaker 0>click on the very first episode of clustered

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:18.750
<v Speaker 0>and pop down,

00:06:20.075 --> 00:06:21.355
<v Speaker 0>and we should see

00:06:21.755 --> 00:06:23.115
<v Speaker 0>our new episode.

00:06:24.795 --> 00:06:26.475
<v Speaker 0>So that's my stream automation.

00:06:27.115 --> 00:06:28.235
<v Speaker 0>Stay tuned

00:06:28.875 --> 00:06:31.355
<v Speaker 0>because I'll be live streaming, rebuilding all of

00:06:31.355 --> 00:06:34.449
<v Speaker 0>this automation using nothing but open source cloud

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:35.890
<v Speaker 0>native technologies,

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.530
<v Speaker 0>using Git as a source of truth for

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.530
<v Speaker 0>all episodes, series, and guests.
