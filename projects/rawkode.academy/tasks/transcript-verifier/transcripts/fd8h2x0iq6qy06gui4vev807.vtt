00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.480
<v Speaker 0>Android

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.199
<v Speaker 0>and iOS. We can definitely do another session

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:04.880
<v Speaker 0>on this shit. Yeah.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.359
<v Speaker 1>Are you on a what are you on?

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:10.480
<v Speaker 1>IOS or Android? Did So I was iOS

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.080
<v Speaker 0>for the last six years. I was Android

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.120
<v Speaker 0>fully before that, and now I'm back on

00:00:14.465 --> 00:00:16.145
<v Speaker 0>the Android train. And I've gotta say the

00:00:16.145 --> 00:00:18.065
<v Speaker 0>Pixel is a great device.

00:00:18.065 --> 00:00:18.705
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:00:19.105 --> 00:00:20.705
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh. Like, I can go on

00:00:20.705 --> 00:00:22.705
<v Speaker 1>so much about the whole iOS because I've

00:00:22.705 --> 00:00:24.865
<v Speaker 1>done both. I was a iOS,

00:00:24.865 --> 00:00:25.345
<v Speaker 1>like,

00:00:25.665 --> 00:00:27.744
<v Speaker 1>iOS user for a long time, then went

00:00:27.744 --> 00:00:28.785
<v Speaker 1>went to Android,

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.650
<v Speaker 1>then went back to iOS, and, like, currently,

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm on Android on a Pixel device and

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.050
<v Speaker 1>loving it. Absolutely loving it. Yeah.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.650
<v Speaker 0>The only thing I really miss is just

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.129
<v Speaker 0>the Pixel watch is dreadful.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.175
<v Speaker 0>But the Apple watch Yeah. I have I

00:00:44.175 --> 00:00:45.695
<v Speaker 1>have one. Like, it's a

00:00:46.815 --> 00:00:48.495
<v Speaker 1>whatever. I never had an Apple watch, so

00:00:48.495 --> 00:00:50.415
<v Speaker 1>I don't know any better. But the Apple

00:00:50.415 --> 00:00:52.015
<v Speaker 0>watch is great because you we're able to

00:00:52.015 --> 00:00:53.535
<v Speaker 0>just, like, log in to my MacBook with

00:00:53.535 --> 00:00:55.135
<v Speaker 0>it and everything, and I've lost all that

00:00:55.135 --> 00:00:57.215
<v Speaker 0>convenient stuff. But, I mean, I'm willing to

00:00:57.215 --> 00:00:59.375
<v Speaker 0>pay that price for a more open platform.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Well, in part of that, it's because

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.160
<v Speaker 1>you're on a you're on you're on Linux

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>too. So Yeah. Ironically,

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.880
<v Speaker 2>Android works better with Windows.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That that's that's

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:11.400
<v Speaker 1>yeah. That's what I want.

00:01:12.135 --> 00:01:15.415
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. The the integrations there are stellar.

00:01:16.215 --> 00:01:19.415
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. People are dripping in the hello, BigPod.

00:01:20.215 --> 00:01:22.375
<v Speaker 0>Says echo. Is that me?

00:01:22.775 --> 00:01:23.975
<v Speaker 0>Do I have an echo?

00:01:24.534 --> 00:01:25.494
<v Speaker 1>Oh, shoot. Someone

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm not hearing anything. Yeah.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.990
<v Speaker 0>And there's some iOS ARCs. That's nice. Yeah.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.430
<v Speaker 0>I mean, this is just gonna be a

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.350
<v Speaker 0>therapeutic run, I think, from the three of

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.310
<v Speaker 0>us. Right? So Yeah. So, Hayden, I wanted

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.950
<v Speaker 1>to know yeah. So I think so

00:01:42.265 --> 00:01:43.865
<v Speaker 1>I guess if we all just,

00:01:44.344 --> 00:01:46.585
<v Speaker 1>like, basically shared, like, what what we work

00:01:46.585 --> 00:01:48.825
<v Speaker 1>on or whatever. But, like, Hayden, I've never

00:01:48.825 --> 00:01:51.545
<v Speaker 1>quite figured out. Are you primarily a Windows

00:01:51.545 --> 00:01:54.185
<v Speaker 1>user? Like, your breadth of knowledge on

00:01:54.424 --> 00:01:55.145
<v Speaker 1>Linux use

00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:57.420
<v Speaker 1>Linux and Unix

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.500
<v Speaker 1>and Windows is amazing.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.580
<v Speaker 1>And, like, I can never really figure out,

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.820
<v Speaker 1>like, what type of user you actually are.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean, I I use both daily.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.420
<v Speaker 2>So daily driver,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.260
<v Speaker 2>Windows 11 with WSL,

00:02:12.805 --> 00:02:14.645
<v Speaker 2>but I work in the cloud. I work

00:02:14.645 --> 00:02:16.885
<v Speaker 2>on my own servers on Linux.

00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:19.765
<v Speaker 2>I mean, I've used Linux

00:02:19.765 --> 00:02:22.325
<v Speaker 2>since, like, I was a teenager since, like,

00:02:22.325 --> 00:02:23.845
<v Speaker 2>circa 1999.

00:02:23.845 --> 00:02:25.765
<v Speaker 2>Like, my first Linux experience

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.340
<v Speaker 2>was having to rebuild the Linux kernel to

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.140
<v Speaker 2>support my ATI graphics card.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.580
<v Speaker 2>That was my first foray into Linux. This

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.860
<v Speaker 1>is like it's almost the same because I

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.100
<v Speaker 1>got into Linux around '98. It was around

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.660
<v Speaker 1>the time Windows '98 because, like, I was

00:02:41.025 --> 00:02:43.185
<v Speaker 1>I was I got into computing or whatever,

00:02:43.185 --> 00:02:45.504
<v Speaker 1>like, was really with DOS, pretty much just

00:02:45.504 --> 00:02:48.064
<v Speaker 1>Intel and DOS. That's where you know? And

00:02:48.064 --> 00:02:50.704
<v Speaker 1>so I I got heavily into Windows '95.

00:02:50.704 --> 00:02:52.305
<v Speaker 1>I was very active in the wear scene

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:54.640
<v Speaker 1>back then. Nice. And so I got into

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.640
<v Speaker 1>Windows 95 really early because it was all

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.840
<v Speaker 1>on the wears. You can get it early

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.440
<v Speaker 1>before it came out. So I I, like,

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.600
<v Speaker 1>I got into Windows 95 and got super

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.880
<v Speaker 1>good at that. And then by the time

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.040
<v Speaker 1>Windows 98 came out, I was, like, fed

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.935
<v Speaker 1>up with like, I could reinstall Windows

00:03:09.015 --> 00:03:12.055
<v Speaker 1>so fast and reconfigure everything because I felt

00:03:12.055 --> 00:03:13.735
<v Speaker 1>like I had to do it weekly because,

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:15.814
<v Speaker 1>like, it would just always go to crap.

00:03:15.814 --> 00:03:17.334
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like, there's gotta be something better.

00:03:17.334 --> 00:03:18.614
<v Speaker 1>So I started looking at Linux.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.330
<v Speaker 1>And so my experience with with Linux was

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.849
<v Speaker 1>like, I'm like, oh, I heard about this

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.770
<v Speaker 1>thing. Let me download it and try it

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 1>out. And I spent literally about a month

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.410
<v Speaker 1>trying to get the Tulip driver working for

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.370
<v Speaker 1>my network card.

00:03:32.965 --> 00:03:33.605
<v Speaker 1>And

00:03:33.765 --> 00:03:35.925
<v Speaker 1>but, by the way, also realized I knew

00:03:35.925 --> 00:03:38.165
<v Speaker 1>nothing about programming. Really nothing. It was like,

00:03:38.165 --> 00:03:39.605
<v Speaker 1>I spent about two weeks just trying to

00:03:39.605 --> 00:03:40.965
<v Speaker 1>get Linux installed,

00:03:41.205 --> 00:03:42.885
<v Speaker 1>and then I finally got it installed. And

00:03:42.885 --> 00:03:44.245
<v Speaker 1>I got it, like, boot up, and I

00:03:44.245 --> 00:03:46.005
<v Speaker 1>got to the command line. Like, I got

00:03:46.005 --> 00:03:47.045
<v Speaker 1>to the login,

00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:48.960
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm like, shoot.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.960
<v Speaker 1>I didn't because, like, Windows doesn't have a

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.800
<v Speaker 1>user by default. It was like I was

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.200
<v Speaker 1>like, what do I log in with? So

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.800
<v Speaker 1>then it was like, I had to find

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.480
<v Speaker 1>out what a root user was and what

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.120
<v Speaker 1>the root user.

00:04:01.185 --> 00:04:02.625
<v Speaker 2>So I actually

00:04:02.864 --> 00:04:06.065
<v Speaker 2>came up on early DOS, early Windows,

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:08.545
<v Speaker 2>started dabbling in Linux.

00:04:09.025 --> 00:04:09.745
<v Speaker 2>And then

00:04:10.224 --> 00:04:11.585
<v Speaker 2>post XP,

00:04:11.985 --> 00:04:14.305
<v Speaker 2>I kind of still fiddled with Linux

00:04:14.944 --> 00:04:15.665
<v Speaker 2>but

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:17.690
<v Speaker 2>switched to Mac.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:21.769
<v Speaker 2>And I was pretty diehard Mac user from

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.449
<v Speaker 2>about 02/2003

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:25.210
<v Speaker 2>to I can date it to

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:26.810
<v Speaker 2>the new

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:28.889
<v Speaker 2>MacBook butterfly keyboard.

00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:31.655
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So I I I bought I I

00:04:31.655 --> 00:04:33.735
<v Speaker 2>sold my old MacBook Pro and bought the

00:04:33.735 --> 00:04:35.415
<v Speaker 2>new MacBook Pro every year

00:04:35.655 --> 00:04:39.495
<v Speaker 2>until the butterfly keyboard came, and I could

00:04:39.655 --> 00:04:43.014
<v Speaker 2>not stand it. So I started looking around

00:04:43.095 --> 00:04:44.615
<v Speaker 2>for great keyboards,

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.710
<v Speaker 2>and I got a lot of recommendations for

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.590
<v Speaker 2>ThinkPads. And I'm like, perfect. I'll get a

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.150
<v Speaker 2>ThinkPad. They're really well supported on Linux,

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.830
<v Speaker 2>installed Linux,

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.910
<v Speaker 2>but there were a handful of applications I

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.590
<v Speaker 2>needed at the time that needed Windows that

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.675
<v Speaker 2>didn't run well in Wine, and I was

00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:01.955
<v Speaker 2>running VMs.

00:05:02.275 --> 00:05:04.835
<v Speaker 2>And this little thing had just been announced

00:05:04.835 --> 00:05:06.275
<v Speaker 2>just around 2016

00:05:06.915 --> 00:05:08.435
<v Speaker 2>called WSL.

00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:11.155
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like, wait. So I can have

00:05:11.155 --> 00:05:11.875
<v Speaker 2>a desktop

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:13.620
<v Speaker 2>that just works,

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.620
<v Speaker 2>runs all my programs,

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.259
<v Speaker 2>but then also gives me my Linux working

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:19.860
<v Speaker 2>environment for programming.

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:21.060
<v Speaker 2>And

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.860
<v Speaker 2>that's that was it for me. So,

00:05:25.384 --> 00:05:27.225
<v Speaker 2>David, I think we before we went live,

00:05:27.225 --> 00:05:28.425
<v Speaker 2>you commented how

00:05:28.905 --> 00:05:31.465
<v Speaker 2>you wanted a OS that

00:05:31.945 --> 00:05:34.105
<v Speaker 2>just worked but still gave you that

00:05:35.305 --> 00:05:37.625
<v Speaker 2>that that experience on the terminal.

00:05:38.025 --> 00:05:39.785
<v Speaker 2>I just came at it from a different

00:05:39.785 --> 00:05:40.425
<v Speaker 2>direction.

00:05:40.824 --> 00:05:41.145
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Like, David, what are what are what are

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.250
<v Speaker 1>you running now? So

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.090
<v Speaker 0>I'm in a bit of a weird phase

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.490
<v Speaker 0>right now. So after the fire, I just

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.730
<v Speaker 0>stole my my Apple hardware.

00:05:54.055 --> 00:05:56.375
<v Speaker 0>I'm kind of in frustration with the Apple

00:05:56.375 --> 00:05:58.935
<v Speaker 0>approach to the the European ruling that they

00:05:58.935 --> 00:06:00.375
<v Speaker 0>had to have a more open platform, and

00:06:00.375 --> 00:06:01.974
<v Speaker 0>I feel that the way they made App

00:06:01.974 --> 00:06:04.215
<v Speaker 0>Store to work in Europe only and super

00:06:04.215 --> 00:06:06.694
<v Speaker 0>expensive, like, the paper install and stuff like

00:06:06.694 --> 00:06:08.690
<v Speaker 0>that. I was just like, this isn't the

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.050
<v Speaker 0>company I wanna be using

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:11.730
<v Speaker 0>their products anymore.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.650
<v Speaker 0>So right now, I have a nice desktop

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:14.290
<v Speaker 0>computer.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.530
<v Speaker 0>I've got a new Android phone, and the

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.410
<v Speaker 0>Linux that I'm running is normally Nexus,

00:06:19.935 --> 00:06:21.855
<v Speaker 0>which I know I'm gonna get slapped for.

00:06:21.855 --> 00:06:23.535
<v Speaker 2>You're just playing into a.

00:06:24.975 --> 00:06:27.055
<v Speaker 0>It's the boss. The form you you listen

00:06:27.055 --> 00:06:29.055
<v Speaker 1>to to Twitter too much of everyone who

00:06:29.215 --> 00:06:31.215
<v Speaker 1>everyone who's talking about these days is, like,

00:06:31.215 --> 00:06:32.415
<v Speaker 1>just dive right into.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.390
<v Speaker 0>And in my opinion, Nixos is what I

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.550
<v Speaker 0>was running, like, seven years ago before I

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.270
<v Speaker 0>went on my Mac my Mac holiday. So

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.910
<v Speaker 0>but

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.430
<v Speaker 0>I am trying for Dora Silverblue right now,

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.270
<v Speaker 0>and I'm gonna kinda try and explain why.

00:06:47.285 --> 00:06:49.685
<v Speaker 0>I've given talks at conferences over the years,

00:06:49.685 --> 00:06:51.845
<v Speaker 0>and I talk about my desktop habits or

00:06:51.845 --> 00:06:53.525
<v Speaker 0>laptop habits, which is I wipe all my

00:06:53.525 --> 00:06:55.125
<v Speaker 0>devices every 30.

00:06:55.765 --> 00:06:56.405
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:06:56.725 --> 00:06:58.165
<v Speaker 0>Because I like the automation. I like to

00:06:58.165 --> 00:06:59.765
<v Speaker 0>know that I'm never losing anything older than

00:06:59.765 --> 00:07:00.165
<v Speaker 0>a month.

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.730
<v Speaker 0>Keeps me fresh. I change things up.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.770
<v Speaker 0>But with SilverBleu, I don't know if I'm

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.290
<v Speaker 0>even gonna need to do that because it's

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:08.970
<v Speaker 0>an immutable operating system

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.530
<v Speaker 0>where I just have my home directory. And

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.324
<v Speaker 0>everything that I need, I I still use

00:07:14.324 --> 00:07:16.085
<v Speaker 0>Next. Like, if I need packages, I use

00:07:16.085 --> 00:07:17.365
<v Speaker 0>Next or Flatpaks.

00:07:17.764 --> 00:07:19.604
<v Speaker 0>Flatpaks are a pain. We'll get into that

00:07:19.604 --> 00:07:20.885
<v Speaker 0>as we kinda

00:07:21.125 --> 00:07:22.565
<v Speaker 0>go through the flow the flow of the

00:07:22.565 --> 00:07:23.365
<v Speaker 0>motions here.

00:07:23.764 --> 00:07:25.925
<v Speaker 0>But I'm really impressed with Silverblue.

00:07:26.085 --> 00:07:27.444
<v Speaker 0>It's essentially code OS,

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.670
<v Speaker 0>but for desktop computing.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.350
<v Speaker 0>And George, who was on the chat don't

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:32.390
<v Speaker 0>know if he's still here because he says

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.470
<v Speaker 0>he'll need to catch up with the recording.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.790
<v Speaker 0>He has a a uBlue. He works on

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.710
<v Speaker 0>the uBlue project, which is, like, trying to

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.645
<v Speaker 0>make it silver Silver Blue more developer friendly

00:07:41.645 --> 00:07:43.805
<v Speaker 0>and for it went to expatriates. I don't

00:07:43.805 --> 00:07:45.725
<v Speaker 0>even know what that means, but it comes

00:07:45.725 --> 00:07:47.725
<v Speaker 0>with some pretty awesome default. I don't understand

00:07:47.725 --> 00:07:48.845
<v Speaker 0>that either too.

00:07:50.365 --> 00:07:51.245
<v Speaker 1>What

00:07:51.245 --> 00:07:53.645
<v Speaker 1>what exactly is the Ubuntu flare that that

00:07:53.645 --> 00:07:55.005
<v Speaker 1>they're adding? But

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.919
<v Speaker 1>but it's a no. I like what they're

00:07:56.919 --> 00:07:57.800
<v Speaker 1>doing with the

00:07:58.919 --> 00:08:00.759
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's it's just it's the simple things

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:02.280
<v Speaker 0>that, like you know,

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:04.919
<v Speaker 0>I normally disable Secure Boot, which I know

00:08:04.919 --> 00:08:05.879
<v Speaker 0>I get flagged for too.

00:08:07.415 --> 00:08:09.495
<v Speaker 0>But they make it so easy because they

00:08:09.495 --> 00:08:11.015
<v Speaker 0>handle all the signing and stuff like that

00:08:11.015 --> 00:08:13.575
<v Speaker 0>that it just works. Yeah. And they even

00:08:13.575 --> 00:08:16.535
<v Speaker 0>configure things like using the TPM module for

00:08:16.535 --> 00:08:18.375
<v Speaker 0>automatic disk decryption.

00:08:18.695 --> 00:08:20.375
<v Speaker 0>And, like, it's all these subtleties that just

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:22.180
<v Speaker 0>make it a more pleasant experience. And, also,

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.419
<v Speaker 0>the fingerprint reader works on my framework laptop,

00:08:24.419 --> 00:08:25.860
<v Speaker 0>which is never the case. And I don't

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.419
<v Speaker 0>know what magic they've done to their configuration

00:08:28.419 --> 00:08:30.100
<v Speaker 0>to make that work, but I love it.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.100
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. They're doing a great job. I think

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.580
<v Speaker 1>that's more of a testament to framework because

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.580
<v Speaker 1>they they cater so much to the Linux

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.395
<v Speaker 1>community. Because, like, I would use the fingerprint

00:08:38.395 --> 00:08:40.555
<v Speaker 1>reader on my my ThinkPads or whatever, but

00:08:40.555 --> 00:08:42.795
<v Speaker 1>it just wasn't reliable enough. Kinda drove me

00:08:42.795 --> 00:08:45.435
<v Speaker 1>nuts. Yeah. Yeah. Not in this weird situation,

00:08:45.435 --> 00:08:47.275
<v Speaker 0>Marie. You're scanning it. It says no enter

00:08:47.275 --> 00:08:49.355
<v Speaker 0>password, and then you start typing your password,

00:08:49.355 --> 00:08:50.715
<v Speaker 0>then the fingerprint logs in anyway. And you're

00:08:50.715 --> 00:08:51.275
<v Speaker 0>like, what?

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:53.490
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. All these little things.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.610
<v Speaker 0>And Yeah. Yes. Framework is amazing. Their their

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.370
<v Speaker 0>hardware is great. Like, I just ordered a

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.690
<v Speaker 0>new released a new screen, and I can

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.210
<v Speaker 0>hot swap that. This well, not hot swap.

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:03.810
<v Speaker 0>But I can swap it pretty easy when

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:05.330
<v Speaker 0>it comes, and I'm like, this is amazing.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.445
<v Speaker 0>So Yeah. So I have a serious problem

00:09:07.445 --> 00:09:09.205
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to buying laptops. I almost

00:09:09.205 --> 00:09:11.285
<v Speaker 1>always buy a new laptop every year,

00:09:12.005 --> 00:09:14.005
<v Speaker 1>and then it's, like, kinda gotten worse these

00:09:14.005 --> 00:09:16.245
<v Speaker 1>days because, like, I started getting into, like,

00:09:16.245 --> 00:09:18.245
<v Speaker 1>Windows and AI stuff. So then it was

00:09:18.245 --> 00:09:20.005
<v Speaker 1>like, oh, well so I, like, I have

00:09:20.005 --> 00:09:20.565
<v Speaker 1>a framework.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like, I'm a I've been a pretty

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:23.340
<v Speaker 1>diehard

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:24.620
<v Speaker 1>ThinkPad user,

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.380
<v Speaker 1>and then I got into framework because I

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.140
<v Speaker 1>like the fact you can swap out things.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.260
<v Speaker 1>I think, like Yeah. Framework's kind of like

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:32.700
<v Speaker 1>promise, ThinkPad's

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.660
<v Speaker 1>my impression like, I really like ThinkPads. I

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.345
<v Speaker 1>just think they're such a nice like, when

00:09:38.345 --> 00:09:39.625
<v Speaker 1>you think about a laptop,

00:09:39.944 --> 00:09:41.785
<v Speaker 1>it's like, what do you care about a

00:09:41.785 --> 00:09:44.904
<v Speaker 1>laptop? It's it's like the tactile experience of,

00:09:44.904 --> 00:09:47.064
<v Speaker 1>like because that's the thing you're physically touching.

00:09:47.064 --> 00:09:48.185
<v Speaker 1>So you should get the one with the

00:09:48.185 --> 00:09:50.584
<v Speaker 1>best keyboard with the best feel or whatever.

00:09:50.584 --> 00:09:51.770
<v Speaker 1>So it's like that's why I like the

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.930
<v Speaker 1>ThinkPad so much. So, like, framework is kinda

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:55.930
<v Speaker 1>weird. It's the op it's somewhat it's like

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:57.850
<v Speaker 1>it's more practical. It's swappable. It's all those

00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:59.290
<v Speaker 1>stuff, but it doesn't have the same, like,

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:01.930
<v Speaker 1>tactile experience, but it's not terrible. It's just

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:03.770
<v Speaker 1>like so it's like it's a weird thing.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:04.890
<v Speaker 1>But, anyway, so I have a framework.

00:10:05.705 --> 00:10:07.305
<v Speaker 1>Like, I have a framework, and then in

00:10:07.305 --> 00:10:10.025
<v Speaker 1>the last, like, month or like, last month,

00:10:10.025 --> 00:10:11.945
<v Speaker 1>I guess, I got a Surface laptop.

00:10:12.745 --> 00:10:14.745
<v Speaker 1>But even on the framework, was running Windows.

00:10:14.745 --> 00:10:15.225
<v Speaker 1>But

00:10:15.705 --> 00:10:17.545
<v Speaker 1>but, anyway, so let me let me explain

00:10:17.545 --> 00:10:20.105
<v Speaker 1>my my my setup or or whatever. Like,

00:10:20.105 --> 00:10:22.500
<v Speaker 1>what I what I do. Because, like, I

00:10:22.579 --> 00:10:23.860
<v Speaker 1>I got in like I was saying, I

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.699
<v Speaker 1>got into Linux back, like, in in the

00:10:25.699 --> 00:10:26.660
<v Speaker 1>late nineties,

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.380
<v Speaker 1>and I I mean, I'm a diehard Linux.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:30.820
<v Speaker 1>Like, I just 100%

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.220
<v Speaker 1>switched to Linux. Everything I've done

00:10:33.699 --> 00:10:36.595
<v Speaker 1>since then has been all of my personal

00:10:36.595 --> 00:10:37.795
<v Speaker 1>and professional

00:10:37.875 --> 00:10:40.834
<v Speaker 1>devices have always been Linux. Like, every company

00:10:40.834 --> 00:10:43.154
<v Speaker 1>I worked at never allowed Linux, like the

00:10:43.154 --> 00:10:44.675
<v Speaker 1>big companies I worked at. Mhmm. But I

00:10:44.675 --> 00:10:46.675
<v Speaker 1>just broke all the policies and hacked my

00:10:46.675 --> 00:10:48.274
<v Speaker 1>way and figured out and I always ran

00:10:48.274 --> 00:10:49.954
<v Speaker 1>Linux. I did a lot of, like, terrible

00:10:49.954 --> 00:10:52.060
<v Speaker 1>things where it's like, oh, like, that was

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.339
<v Speaker 1>probably not a smart idea, but I was

00:10:53.339 --> 00:10:55.420
<v Speaker 1>young and stupid. But, anyways, so it's like

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.820
<v Speaker 1>so I've always run Linux on everything. So

00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.980
<v Speaker 1>it's like, my my perspective is, like, one,

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.740
<v Speaker 1>I love Linux because

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.295
<v Speaker 1>I have this thing where it's like, it

00:11:04.295 --> 00:11:06.134
<v Speaker 1>just drives me nuts where it's like, I

00:11:06.134 --> 00:11:07.815
<v Speaker 1>want things to be a certain way.

00:11:08.214 --> 00:11:10.055
<v Speaker 1>Like and if I can't have that, it

00:11:10.055 --> 00:11:11.654
<v Speaker 1>drives me nuts. I think it's just like

00:11:11.654 --> 00:11:14.375
<v Speaker 1>my aversion to authority or something. You know?

00:11:14.375 --> 00:11:16.694
<v Speaker 1>It's like, I just so that's what drives

00:11:16.694 --> 00:11:18.370
<v Speaker 1>me nuts about Mac is, like, Mac is,

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:19.970
<v Speaker 1>like, an amazing thing, but there's just certain

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.730
<v Speaker 1>things that are just like, no. I you

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:23.410
<v Speaker 1>just can't have that. Like, you just can't

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:25.410
<v Speaker 1>have it. And so that's why, like, fundamentally

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.089
<v Speaker 1>why I just will not use Mac. It's

00:11:27.089 --> 00:11:29.010
<v Speaker 1>like that I I'll run into one thing

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:30.690
<v Speaker 1>that would drive me nuts, and I can't

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.209
<v Speaker 1>have it, and I just can't work around

00:11:32.209 --> 00:11:34.745
<v Speaker 1>it. There's no hack. Whereas, like, Linux, Windows,

00:11:34.745 --> 00:11:36.904
<v Speaker 1>there's always a hack. But, anyway, so it's

00:11:36.904 --> 00:11:37.065
<v Speaker 1>like

00:11:37.785 --> 00:11:38.825
<v Speaker 1>for Linux,

00:11:38.985 --> 00:11:40.904
<v Speaker 1>it's like, I've been using it so long,

00:11:40.904 --> 00:11:43.065
<v Speaker 1>and I went through basically the kinda like

00:11:43.065 --> 00:11:45.225
<v Speaker 1>the first fifteen years of using Linux was

00:11:45.225 --> 00:11:47.305
<v Speaker 1>more of your typical Linux person who, like,

00:11:47.305 --> 00:11:49.610
<v Speaker 1>thinks it's amazing and wants everyone to use

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:50.410
<v Speaker 1>Linux.

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:52.650
<v Speaker 1>And then after about, like, fifteen years, realized

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:54.570
<v Speaker 1>how kind of dumb it is to, like,

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.690
<v Speaker 1>preach Linux to people. And then, like, for

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.170
<v Speaker 1>the last decade, it's more like, okay. I

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:02.170
<v Speaker 1>just need this thing to work. And I

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.464
<v Speaker 1>and I just, like so I'm, like, I

00:12:04.464 --> 00:12:06.464
<v Speaker 1>I now on Twitter is, like, I'm just

00:12:06.464 --> 00:12:09.185
<v Speaker 1>constantly telling people how terrible Linux is.

00:12:09.745 --> 00:12:11.985
<v Speaker 1>Yet, like, I'm a diehard Linux user, but,

00:12:11.985 --> 00:12:13.824
<v Speaker 1>like, I just can't help because it's, I've

00:12:13.824 --> 00:12:15.345
<v Speaker 1>used it for so long that it's, like

00:12:16.259 --> 00:12:18.899
<v Speaker 1>there's just so many problems of, like, trying

00:12:18.899 --> 00:12:20.820
<v Speaker 1>to get it to a larger mass market

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:24.820
<v Speaker 1>of users that, like, it's just so infeasible.

00:12:26.339 --> 00:12:28.180
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like I don't know. On

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.779
<v Speaker 1>the one hand, it's like I don't wanna

00:12:29.779 --> 00:12:32.255
<v Speaker 1>discourage people from trying to make Linux better,

00:12:32.255 --> 00:12:34.575
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand, I understand, like,

00:12:35.774 --> 00:12:36.894
<v Speaker 1>the practicalities

00:12:36.894 --> 00:12:39.454
<v Speaker 1>of it will probably never get across the

00:12:39.454 --> 00:12:42.175
<v Speaker 1>line. Like, it'll probably like, it's so hard.

00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:44.735
<v Speaker 1>Like, Canonical had the best shot, and they

00:12:44.735 --> 00:12:46.720
<v Speaker 1>gave up. And so I was like, I

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.720
<v Speaker 1>don't know where Linux like, how Linux is

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.560
<v Speaker 1>really gonna so it's like, it's just this

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.160
<v Speaker 1>niche niche niche thing. But

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.440
<v Speaker 1>but, yeah, that's, like, the bigger but, like

00:12:55.519 --> 00:12:57.440
<v Speaker 1>but for me, like, for Linux these days,

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.235
<v Speaker 1>it's like, it just has to work. That's

00:12:59.235 --> 00:13:01.075
<v Speaker 1>my biggest thing is, like because I use

00:13:01.075 --> 00:13:03.155
<v Speaker 1>it professionally and I do everything. It has

00:13:03.155 --> 00:13:06.035
<v Speaker 1>to work. So I I go towards I

00:13:06.035 --> 00:13:08.595
<v Speaker 1>have a very kind of conservative Linux

00:13:08.595 --> 00:13:09.395
<v Speaker 1>approach

00:13:10.195 --> 00:13:13.330
<v Speaker 1>that, like, is not shiny and cool. Like,

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:14.770
<v Speaker 1>everyone like, everyone who's trying to get to

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:16.530
<v Speaker 1>use Linux these days is doing, like you

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.370
<v Speaker 1>know, it's like, oh, look. Like, this crazy

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:20.130
<v Speaker 1>team up set up or or

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:21.810
<v Speaker 1>or

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:22.530
<v Speaker 1>whatever. Or

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Like,

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:26.995
<v Speaker 1>all the stuff that, like like, you know,

00:13:26.995 --> 00:13:29.075
<v Speaker 1>DHH is doing, which is great. Like, I'm

00:13:29.075 --> 00:13:31.395
<v Speaker 1>glad to see bringing users and new exciting

00:13:31.395 --> 00:13:33.795
<v Speaker 1>thing or, like, all that stuff. I don't

00:13:33.795 --> 00:13:35.315
<v Speaker 1>do any of that. I'm, like, a really

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:36.355
<v Speaker 1>boring user.

00:13:38.035 --> 00:13:39.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. Like so I wanted to

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:42.410
<v Speaker 1>actually, like like, show completely, like, show my

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:43.130
<v Speaker 1>setup.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Like like, this is how I use Linux.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:46.570
<v Speaker 1>So it's like, this is how I use

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:48.890
<v Speaker 1>Linux. And then why over the last, like,

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:51.945
<v Speaker 1>six months or so, I've actually switched to

00:13:52.185 --> 00:13:53.385
<v Speaker 1>so what I have is, like, I have

00:13:53.385 --> 00:13:55.705
<v Speaker 1>a desktop and a laptop. My desktop is

00:13:55.705 --> 00:13:57.625
<v Speaker 1>this crazy Threadripper system

00:13:57.865 --> 00:13:59.145
<v Speaker 1>that runs Linux.

00:13:59.625 --> 00:14:01.865
<v Speaker 1>It's static. It's like the workhorse.

00:14:02.025 --> 00:14:04.345
<v Speaker 1>And then I have a laptop, and I

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:06.570
<v Speaker 1>flip, like, fifty fifty between the the the

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:08.490
<v Speaker 1>two things. So it's like during the day,

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:10.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm working on the desktop, and at night,

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:13.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm working on the laptop. And I typically

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:15.770
<v Speaker 1>do more programming on the laptop because at

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:17.450
<v Speaker 1>night, I'm not talking to people. During the

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:18.410
<v Speaker 1>day, I'm talking to people.

00:14:19.855 --> 00:14:20.735
<v Speaker 1>And so

00:14:20.975 --> 00:14:23.615
<v Speaker 1>my setup is, like, I have, like, a

00:14:23.615 --> 00:14:26.015
<v Speaker 1>I synchronize things between the devices so I

00:14:26.015 --> 00:14:27.855
<v Speaker 1>can very seamlessly go back and forth be

00:14:28.015 --> 00:14:30.095
<v Speaker 1>between me or whatever. But so it's so

00:14:30.095 --> 00:14:32.175
<v Speaker 1>the the desktop is Linux, but the laptop

00:14:32.175 --> 00:14:32.815
<v Speaker 1>is Windows.

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:36.230
<v Speaker 1>And I'm able to switch between the two

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:39.110
<v Speaker 1>and and really not know any different. And

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:41.430
<v Speaker 1>that's what I've really enjoyed about Windows and

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:44.310
<v Speaker 1>WSL two is I get my, like, Linux

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:45.350
<v Speaker 1>fix out of it

00:14:45.835 --> 00:14:47.755
<v Speaker 1>because the way I've I use it and

00:14:47.755 --> 00:14:49.515
<v Speaker 1>the way I've set it up is, like,

00:14:49.675 --> 00:14:51.835
<v Speaker 1>I almost don't even know it's Windows. I

00:14:51.835 --> 00:14:52.475
<v Speaker 1>really

00:14:53.035 --> 00:14:55.275
<v Speaker 1>rarely see the Windows side of it,

00:14:55.835 --> 00:14:57.835
<v Speaker 1>but I get the benefits of the Windows

00:14:57.835 --> 00:15:00.635
<v Speaker 1>side of it where things generally just work

00:15:00.635 --> 00:15:00.875
<v Speaker 1>better.

00:15:01.449 --> 00:15:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Like like, for example, like, I tried to

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:06.490
<v Speaker 1>join a Google Meet for this this like,

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:08.329
<v Speaker 1>the invite you sent out had a meet

00:15:08.329 --> 00:15:09.610
<v Speaker 0>for something that I Google.

00:15:10.329 --> 00:15:11.610
<v Speaker 1>So I clicked that.

00:15:12.009 --> 00:15:13.370
<v Speaker 1>And, like, when you log in to that,

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.485
<v Speaker 1>it was like, oh, do you wanna have

00:15:15.485 --> 00:15:18.685
<v Speaker 1>us frame your your like, use AI and

00:15:18.685 --> 00:15:20.685
<v Speaker 1>frame your your head in the picture or

00:15:20.685 --> 00:15:21.165
<v Speaker 1>whatever?

00:15:21.805 --> 00:15:23.405
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like, oh, that's interesting. Let me

00:15:23.405 --> 00:15:26.845
<v Speaker 1>click that. Complete garbage. It's, like, slow. But

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:29.010
<v Speaker 1>this is the thing you just come to

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:31.010
<v Speaker 1>expect on Linux. It's like, ah, whatever. It's

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:32.850
<v Speaker 1>like it's Linux. Like, it probably works fine

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:34.690
<v Speaker 1>on Mac and Windows. But, like, on Linux,

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:36.290
<v Speaker 1>there's some weird thing where it's just not

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:37.410
<v Speaker 1>working right or whatever.

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:38.370
<v Speaker 1>So

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:40.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. So,

00:15:41.815 --> 00:15:43.815
<v Speaker 1>yeah. So let let me let me actually,

00:15:43.815 --> 00:15:45.575
<v Speaker 1>like like, share my setup. I'll show you

00:15:45.575 --> 00:15:47.255
<v Speaker 1>what I'm doing. So, like, I'm I'm sharing

00:15:47.255 --> 00:15:49.015
<v Speaker 1>my screen, and I'll show you. Let me

00:15:49.015 --> 00:15:50.215
<v Speaker 1>get this out of the way.

00:15:51.895 --> 00:15:53.735
<v Speaker 1>So this is gonna be, like, tiny because

00:15:53.735 --> 00:15:55.895
<v Speaker 1>it's just, like, my my desktop or whatever.

00:15:55.895 --> 00:15:57.899
<v Speaker 1>Let me let me oh, yeah. I'll just,

00:15:57.899 --> 00:16:00.939
<v Speaker 1>like, minimize this. Okay. So what I run

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.819
<v Speaker 1>so this is my desktop. It's like what

00:16:03.819 --> 00:16:05.019
<v Speaker 1>I run is

00:16:05.259 --> 00:16:05.980
<v Speaker 1>Ubuntu.

00:16:08.785 --> 00:16:09.425
<v Speaker 0>Oops.

00:16:09.905 --> 00:16:11.905
<v Speaker 0>Sorry. That was me. My bad.

00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:13.345
<v Speaker 0>So

00:16:15.265 --> 00:16:18.545
<v Speaker 1>so what I run is I run Ubuntu

00:16:18.545 --> 00:16:19.345
<v Speaker 1>LTS.

00:16:19.345 --> 00:16:21.745
<v Speaker 1>So, again, like, what I found is

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.480
<v Speaker 1>I really hate rolling distributions

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.520
<v Speaker 1>because rolling distributions, they just end mean in

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.000
<v Speaker 1>the Linux ecosystem, a rolling distribution just means

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.680
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna randomly break.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.495
<v Speaker 1>And so for my host OS because, like,

00:16:34.495 --> 00:16:36.975
<v Speaker 1>I really separate things between, like, what's the

00:16:36.975 --> 00:16:38.495
<v Speaker 1>host OS and then what I have in

00:16:38.495 --> 00:16:41.295
<v Speaker 1>my home directory. For my host host OS,

00:16:41.295 --> 00:16:43.055
<v Speaker 1>I want something super stable.

00:16:43.375 --> 00:16:45.375
<v Speaker 1>So it's like, I really like Ubuntu LTS

00:16:45.375 --> 00:16:47.774
<v Speaker 1>because Ubuntu, what I found, it has, like,

00:16:47.774 --> 00:16:50.350
<v Speaker 1>the best compatibility with hardware from a kernel

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:51.070
<v Speaker 1>perspective.

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:54.270
<v Speaker 1>Like, Fedora, I think, is an amazing distribution.

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Like, they're doing a lot of good things,

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:58.350
<v Speaker 1>but it still does not have the the

00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:59.230
<v Speaker 1>compatibility,

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:01.870
<v Speaker 1>I think, that that the Ubuntu kernel does.

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:04.589
<v Speaker 1>Like, I, like, I think Ubuntu puts a

00:17:03.675 --> 00:17:06.395
<v Speaker 1>crap ton of effort into just hardware device

00:17:06.395 --> 00:17:07.914
<v Speaker 1>compatibility and whatnot.

00:17:08.075 --> 00:17:08.714
<v Speaker 1>So

00:17:09.915 --> 00:17:11.994
<v Speaker 1>so, anyway, so I run LTS, and so,

00:17:11.994 --> 00:17:14.155
<v Speaker 1>like, I haven't even switched to twenty four

00:17:14.155 --> 00:17:15.755
<v Speaker 1>zero four yet because I was it was

00:17:15.755 --> 00:17:17.434
<v Speaker 1>more of, like, I'm gonna hold off and

00:17:17.434 --> 00:17:19.099
<v Speaker 1>wait till that stabilizes a little bit because,

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:20.460
<v Speaker 1>again, I don't wanna be screwing too much

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:22.859
<v Speaker 1>with this. But so so what I run

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:23.419
<v Speaker 1>is

00:17:30.059 --> 00:17:32.220
<v Speaker 1>Some some of their motorcycle or something.

00:17:34.165 --> 00:17:34.725
<v Speaker 1>So

00:17:35.205 --> 00:17:35.525
<v Speaker 1>I

00:17:36.245 --> 00:17:38.005
<v Speaker 1>this is ex Ubuntu, but I think I

00:17:38.005 --> 00:17:39.685
<v Speaker 1>technically install Ubuntu

00:17:39.685 --> 00:17:41.525
<v Speaker 1>because, like, I'll do an Ubuntu, a minimal

00:17:41.525 --> 00:17:43.684
<v Speaker 1>install, and then just do the x

00:17:44.085 --> 00:17:46.645
<v Speaker 1>the x debt or x Ubuntu desktop package

00:17:46.645 --> 00:17:48.565
<v Speaker 1>or whatever. Whatever. But but for the most

00:17:48.565 --> 00:17:49.125
<v Speaker 1>part, like,

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:52.020
<v Speaker 1>the packages that I have installed on the

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.220
<v Speaker 1>host are

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.899
<v Speaker 1>are just ex Ubuntu. Like, I don't really

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:00.260
<v Speaker 1>actually touch app that much. Like, I I'm

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.900
<v Speaker 1>a pretty diehard like, I use brew for

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:03.780
<v Speaker 1>pretty much everything.

00:18:04.395 --> 00:18:05.995
<v Speaker 1>So it's like, I use brew in my

00:18:05.995 --> 00:18:06.875
<v Speaker 1>home directory.

00:18:07.995 --> 00:18:09.755
<v Speaker 1>Because, like, what I found over time was

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:11.675
<v Speaker 1>that, like, if you keep your host OS

00:18:11.675 --> 00:18:13.675
<v Speaker 1>super stable and you never touch it, like,

00:18:13.675 --> 00:18:16.475
<v Speaker 1>you it needs to supply, like, the base

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:19.370
<v Speaker 1>graphical environment. So x f c x f

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:20.490
<v Speaker 1>c e comes from it.

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:23.770
<v Speaker 1>Like, I keep that super stable,

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:25.850
<v Speaker 1>and then I have all the crazy bleeding

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:28.490
<v Speaker 1>edge development stuff in my home directory. So

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:30.810
<v Speaker 1>brew is tech is pretty much a

00:18:31.144 --> 00:18:33.865
<v Speaker 1>rolling Linux distribution. It gives you the latest

00:18:33.865 --> 00:18:35.784
<v Speaker 1>and greatest of everything. So it's like, I

00:18:35.784 --> 00:18:36.984
<v Speaker 1>like that setup.

00:18:37.705 --> 00:18:39.465
<v Speaker 1>So it's like my home directory, latest and

00:18:39.465 --> 00:18:41.224
<v Speaker 1>greatest, the host, super stable.

00:18:41.544 --> 00:18:42.985
<v Speaker 1>And this is, like, why I also kind

00:18:42.985 --> 00:18:44.424
<v Speaker 1>of appreciate, like, Silverblue.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.170
<v Speaker 1>And and because, like, Silverblue or what, like,

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:49.650
<v Speaker 1>Bluefin is doing like, they're kind of doing

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.490
<v Speaker 1>this, you like, implicitly to a certain degree

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:53.809
<v Speaker 1>where it's like, the host and the applications

00:18:53.809 --> 00:18:56.690
<v Speaker 1>are really completely different distributions. Because flat pack

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:58.129
<v Speaker 1>brings in its own distribution.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:18:59.250
<v Speaker 1>But

00:19:00.035 --> 00:19:01.475
<v Speaker 1>but the so the so the way I

00:19:01.475 --> 00:19:04.115
<v Speaker 1>do things is, like, I have this this

00:19:04.115 --> 00:19:06.035
<v Speaker 1>is actually it's XFCE, but you can see

00:19:06.035 --> 00:19:08.355
<v Speaker 1>there's, like, nothing. Like, I don't I don't

00:19:08.355 --> 00:19:08.674
<v Speaker 1>like

00:19:09.554 --> 00:19:10.835
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a,

00:19:11.475 --> 00:19:12.434
<v Speaker 1>like, a dock.

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a start menu equivalent thing

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:17.300
<v Speaker 1>or whatever. It's like, all I ever do

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.220
<v Speaker 1>is if I wanna run something,

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.780
<v Speaker 1>I can run I hit, like, you know,

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:22.980
<v Speaker 1>hot keys,

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:25.460
<v Speaker 1>and, basically, I can launch things. This is

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.835
<v Speaker 1>just built into XSD. So if I wanna

00:19:27.835 --> 00:19:29.355
<v Speaker 1>start an application, I can do it that

00:19:29.355 --> 00:19:30.875
<v Speaker 1>way. But the vast majority of the time,

00:19:30.875 --> 00:19:32.555
<v Speaker 1>I launch things from the from the terminal

00:19:32.555 --> 00:19:33.435
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.

00:19:34.395 --> 00:19:37.355
<v Speaker 1>I'm a very basic user in terms of,

00:19:37.355 --> 00:19:39.355
<v Speaker 1>like, I don't do fancy like

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:42.330
<v Speaker 1>like, the way I do terminals is I

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:44.649
<v Speaker 1>just do tabs in a terminal browser. Like,

00:19:44.649 --> 00:19:46.729
<v Speaker 1>I've never got on the TMUX train.

00:19:47.289 --> 00:19:49.369
<v Speaker 1>I keep it very, very simple.

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:51.929
<v Speaker 1>The same thing with VIM. Like, I'm a

00:19:51.929 --> 00:19:54.605
<v Speaker 1>diehard VIM user, but I don't like, I

00:19:54.605 --> 00:19:56.045
<v Speaker 1>never got on NeoVIM.

00:19:56.205 --> 00:19:58.525
<v Speaker 1>Like, I just keep like, everything's just super

00:19:58.525 --> 00:20:00.525
<v Speaker 1>basic or whatever. So it's like, all I

00:20:00.525 --> 00:20:02.845
<v Speaker 1>ever really do in Linux is, like, for

00:20:02.845 --> 00:20:04.525
<v Speaker 1>the most part, I'm running

00:20:05.165 --> 00:20:08.070
<v Speaker 1>I have a terminal. I run my IDEs,

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:10.310
<v Speaker 1>which I use JetBrains for everything. Actually, I

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:11.590
<v Speaker 1>think I already have it running here.

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:14.390
<v Speaker 1>I use JetBrains

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:16.470
<v Speaker 1>for pretty much all of my development.

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:19.110
<v Speaker 1>And then for a browser,

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:20.870
<v Speaker 1>I oops. Where'd that go?

00:20:22.105 --> 00:20:23.865
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. It's over here on the screen.

00:20:23.865 --> 00:20:25.304
<v Speaker 1>So for a browser

00:20:26.424 --> 00:20:27.865
<v Speaker 1>let me put it over here.

00:20:29.065 --> 00:20:30.504
<v Speaker 1>I actually use Edge,

00:20:30.665 --> 00:20:33.465
<v Speaker 1>which is weird because I switched to Edge

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.159
<v Speaker 1>in the last,

00:20:36.679 --> 00:20:38.440
<v Speaker 1>like, six months to a year. I switched

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:39.960
<v Speaker 1>to Edge, and it was,

00:20:41.159 --> 00:20:43.640
<v Speaker 1>in my story, there's, like, I've I've used

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.985
<v Speaker 1>Firefox forever. Like, I love Firefox. I hate

00:20:46.985 --> 00:20:49.225
<v Speaker 1>Chrome. I've always hated Chrome for the same

00:20:49.225 --> 00:20:50.825
<v Speaker 1>reason that, like, I don't like the fact

00:20:50.825 --> 00:20:53.145
<v Speaker 1>that Chrome locks down the user experience. It's

00:20:53.145 --> 00:20:55.385
<v Speaker 1>like, there's certain things you can't change. It's

00:20:55.385 --> 00:20:57.865
<v Speaker 1>not as configurable, so I love Firefox.

00:20:58.265 --> 00:20:58.825
<v Speaker 1>But

00:20:59.705 --> 00:21:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Firefox has fallen behind Chrome for for some

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.040
<v Speaker 1>time now. Like, everyone develops for Chrome. So

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.280
<v Speaker 1>I've always been jealous of the Chrome users

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.880
<v Speaker 1>of, like, I kinda wish I could run

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:09.520
<v Speaker 1>Chrome,

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.080
<v Speaker 1>but, like, Firefox was just fit my personality

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.000
<v Speaker 1>better. And then I discovered Edge,

00:21:15.554 --> 00:21:16.195
<v Speaker 1>which

00:21:16.514 --> 00:21:17.794
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the things I appreciate

00:21:17.794 --> 00:21:20.034
<v Speaker 1>about Microsoft in general is, like, they make

00:21:20.034 --> 00:21:21.315
<v Speaker 1>everything configurable.

00:21:21.315 --> 00:21:21.794
<v Speaker 1>So

00:21:22.115 --> 00:21:24.595
<v Speaker 1>I kinda get the compromise of, like it's

00:21:24.595 --> 00:21:26.754
<v Speaker 1>not as flexible as Firefox,

00:21:27.394 --> 00:21:30.100
<v Speaker 1>but they they allow you to tweak like,

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.700
<v Speaker 1>the out of the box experience, I think,

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:33.460
<v Speaker 1>with Edge is is horrific.

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.380
<v Speaker 1>But they allow you to basically, like, turn

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:37.620
<v Speaker 1>off all the features, tweak whatever you want.

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.020
<v Speaker 1>There's flags. You can find some setting. And

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.860
<v Speaker 1>so, like, I ended up with, like, this

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.325
<v Speaker 1>is the Edge. Like, I actually like it.

00:21:45.445 --> 00:21:47.445
<v Speaker 1>So I switched to Edge. And so it's

00:21:47.445 --> 00:21:47.924
<v Speaker 1>like

00:21:48.325 --> 00:21:49.684
<v Speaker 1>so my setup is,

00:21:49.925 --> 00:21:50.965
<v Speaker 1>like, primarily,

00:21:51.125 --> 00:21:52.805
<v Speaker 1>I'm running you know, I got a a

00:21:52.805 --> 00:21:54.805
<v Speaker 1>terminal. I run IDE, and I have a

00:21:54.805 --> 00:21:56.805
<v Speaker 1>web browser. Those are the main applications I

00:21:56.805 --> 00:21:57.045
<v Speaker 1>use.

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.180
<v Speaker 1>And then what I found is, like, I

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:01.780
<v Speaker 1>don't really use any

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.660
<v Speaker 1>native Linux GUI applications.

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:07.540
<v Speaker 1>The only GUI applications I use

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.220
<v Speaker 1>are all proprietary.

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:11.185
<v Speaker 1>And it's like I just just over time,

00:22:11.185 --> 00:22:12.945
<v Speaker 1>I've just realized this or whatever. So it's

00:22:12.945 --> 00:22:14.945
<v Speaker 1>like because it's like, I'll run you know,

00:22:14.945 --> 00:22:16.545
<v Speaker 1>it's like, I've got Slack,

00:22:17.025 --> 00:22:17.745
<v Speaker 0>Zoom.

00:22:20.545 --> 00:22:22.545
<v Speaker 1>What are the other ones? Maybe Spotify,

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Discord.

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:27.570
<v Speaker 1>But, basically because, see, every single GUI application

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:29.170
<v Speaker 1>I run is proprietary.

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:30.769
<v Speaker 1>And, like, basically, like,

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:33.330
<v Speaker 1>you're you'll be extremely hard pressed, and let's

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:35.650
<v Speaker 1>see if anyone disagrees with me, to find

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:37.410
<v Speaker 1>a Linux GUI application

00:22:37.965 --> 00:22:40.205
<v Speaker 1>that is in fact better than a Mac

00:22:40.205 --> 00:22:41.884
<v Speaker 1>or Windows equivalent.

00:22:42.924 --> 00:22:45.484
<v Speaker 1>Oops. Can I find that? No. Okay. So

00:22:47.965 --> 00:22:50.365
<v Speaker 1>so it's like so this is, like, my

00:22:50.365 --> 00:22:52.765
<v Speaker 1>kind of, like, my whole experience

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:53.970
<v Speaker 1>is, like, primarily,

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:55.090
<v Speaker 1>like, just in

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:57.890
<v Speaker 1>in these these apps.

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:01.170
<v Speaker 1>And I don't really do a lot. It's

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:03.570
<v Speaker 1>like I just program, and I'm on Twitter.

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:05.730
<v Speaker 1>That's, like, my life on computers, basically.

00:23:07.085 --> 00:23:07.725
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:23:08.205 --> 00:23:08.765
<v Speaker 1>So

00:23:09.085 --> 00:23:11.164
<v Speaker 1>so, like, this is my Linux setup.

00:23:11.325 --> 00:23:13.165
<v Speaker 1>And so you can see, like, the so

00:23:13.165 --> 00:23:13.485
<v Speaker 1>I've

00:23:14.205 --> 00:23:15.965
<v Speaker 1>I I I got into the

00:23:16.685 --> 00:23:18.525
<v Speaker 1>I see I have a a a panel

00:23:18.525 --> 00:23:21.085
<v Speaker 1>up here. This is the XFCE panel. This

00:23:21.085 --> 00:23:23.210
<v Speaker 1>is one thing I appreciate about XFCE is

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:25.690
<v Speaker 1>it's way more configurable than people think.

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:27.530
<v Speaker 1>Like, the out of the box experience with

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:30.090
<v Speaker 1>XFCE is kind of, like, archaic and weird

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:31.049
<v Speaker 1>and ugly,

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:33.930
<v Speaker 1>but you can very easily tweak it. And

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:35.290
<v Speaker 1>so this is the way I've done things.

00:23:35.644 --> 00:23:37.644
<v Speaker 1>And so what I do is I perfectly

00:23:37.804 --> 00:23:40.445
<v Speaker 1>I make this this panel the exact same

00:23:40.445 --> 00:23:42.605
<v Speaker 1>size as the window title, so it just

00:23:42.605 --> 00:23:45.404
<v Speaker 1>kinda blends into it. So it's super slick.

00:23:45.565 --> 00:23:47.485
<v Speaker 1>And I and I started doing this because

00:23:47.485 --> 00:23:48.845
<v Speaker 1>of Ubuntu's

00:23:48.845 --> 00:23:51.450
<v Speaker 1>Unity is I really like the way Unity

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:53.610
<v Speaker 1>would do this is they would blend

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:56.410
<v Speaker 1>the applications bars into the top. And so

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:58.810
<v Speaker 1>you get, like, the amount of screen real

00:23:58.810 --> 00:23:59.450
<v Speaker 1>estate

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:01.450
<v Speaker 1>that's that's taken by,

00:24:02.164 --> 00:24:04.005
<v Speaker 1>you know, the the bars or whatever is,

00:24:04.005 --> 00:24:05.205
<v Speaker 1>like, almost nothing.

00:24:06.965 --> 00:24:09.044
<v Speaker 1>So so I really liked this approach or

00:24:09.044 --> 00:24:10.404
<v Speaker 1>whatever. And so that's how I've been been

00:24:10.404 --> 00:24:12.325
<v Speaker 1>running, like, my XFC or whatever.

00:24:14.085 --> 00:24:16.000
<v Speaker 1>But yeah. So that's, my Linux setup, and

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.680
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you the Windows one instead or

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.960
<v Speaker 1>whatever. But it's like don't know if you

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.600
<v Speaker 1>have any, like, questions or you or anyone.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh, people are asked, like, Bash or ZHS.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm Bash. Like, I have just such a

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:31.015
<v Speaker 1>like, I don't understand why people like, I'm

00:24:31.015 --> 00:24:33.495
<v Speaker 1>kinda curious of, like, why people like, one,

00:24:33.495 --> 00:24:35.335
<v Speaker 1>most mapped users, as far as I know,

00:24:35.335 --> 00:24:38.054
<v Speaker 1>use ESH because it's the default. The second

00:24:38.054 --> 00:24:39.655
<v Speaker 1>reason people use ESH

00:24:39.655 --> 00:24:41.654
<v Speaker 1>is because of the the fancy

00:24:41.735 --> 00:24:44.510
<v Speaker 1>prompt command prompt. Like, you can do and

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:46.270
<v Speaker 1>you make it look pretty. Right? But you

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:48.429
<v Speaker 1>can see, like, this is my command prompt.

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:50.830
<v Speaker 1>I just don't care. I don't get a

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:53.389
<v Speaker 1>significant amount of value out of customizing that.

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:56.830
<v Speaker 1>The the other thing, like, just kinda personalities

00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:58.270
<v Speaker 1>wise is for me is, like,

00:24:59.345 --> 00:25:01.425
<v Speaker 1>I'm really bad at organization.

00:25:01.425 --> 00:25:03.345
<v Speaker 1>Like, there's a lot of, like, Linux users

00:25:03.345 --> 00:25:05.425
<v Speaker 1>who love tiling window managers,

00:25:06.865 --> 00:25:08.145
<v Speaker 1>and they're and they're a lot more I

00:25:08.145 --> 00:25:09.505
<v Speaker 1>just feel like they're a lot more organized

00:25:09.505 --> 00:25:11.265
<v Speaker 1>in how they approach things because it's like,

00:25:11.265 --> 00:25:14.039
<v Speaker 1>oh, look. I put this app here,

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.799
<v Speaker 1>and I put this one here, and they're

00:25:15.799 --> 00:25:16.999
<v Speaker 1>much more intentional.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm not. I'm just like, the way I

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.120
<v Speaker 1>work is, like, I'm constantly, like, opening up

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:22.759
<v Speaker 1>new

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.640
<v Speaker 1>windows and creating a couple more tabs, and

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.240
<v Speaker 1>I've got a couple part. So it's like,

00:25:27.745 --> 00:25:29.424
<v Speaker 1>I love the chaos

00:25:29.585 --> 00:25:31.904
<v Speaker 1>of a floating window manager.

00:25:32.465 --> 00:25:34.625
<v Speaker 1>Although I I still do things like, you

00:25:34.625 --> 00:25:36.304
<v Speaker 1>know, I can I can do tie you

00:25:36.304 --> 00:25:39.184
<v Speaker 1>know, like, various types of tiling or whatever?

00:25:39.184 --> 00:25:41.549
<v Speaker 1>Like, it's just built into XFZ. But what

00:25:41.549 --> 00:25:43.629
<v Speaker 1>I've found over time from for myself

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:46.350
<v Speaker 1>is I don't find tiling to be valuable

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:47.309
<v Speaker 1>most of the time.

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:50.190
<v Speaker 1>Like, I just I don't know. I just

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:50.830
<v Speaker 1>don't.

00:25:51.549 --> 00:25:54.645
<v Speaker 1>Because, like, the only time where, like, logically

00:25:54.645 --> 00:25:57.285
<v Speaker 1>tiling makes sense to me is development,

00:25:58.165 --> 00:26:00.885
<v Speaker 1>but I'm also a I use IDEs. Like,

00:26:00.885 --> 00:26:01.605
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like a

00:26:02.325 --> 00:26:04.085
<v Speaker 1>like, there's a whole realm. You know, it's

00:26:04.085 --> 00:26:06.645
<v Speaker 1>like Versus Code is, like, really editor plus

00:26:06.645 --> 00:26:06.885
<v Speaker 1>plus,

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:10.060
<v Speaker 1>and so is NeoVim. It's like editor plus

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:12.140
<v Speaker 1>plus. And and so there's a lot of

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.980
<v Speaker 1>people who, like they like tiling,

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:16.380
<v Speaker 1>but those people who like tiling tend to

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:19.100
<v Speaker 1>gravitate also towards, like, NeoVim or or terminal

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.975
<v Speaker 1>based approaches where it's like an IDE just

00:26:21.975 --> 00:26:24.375
<v Speaker 1>gives you the same thing as tiling. Right?

00:26:24.375 --> 00:26:26.055
<v Speaker 1>It's like, I have an editor here. I

00:26:26.055 --> 00:26:27.895
<v Speaker 1>have a terminal down here. If I really

00:26:27.895 --> 00:26:29.255
<v Speaker 1>want you know? So it's like, I still

00:26:29.255 --> 00:26:30.294
<v Speaker 1>wanna be, like,

00:26:30.695 --> 00:26:31.815
<v Speaker 1>used for it or whatever.

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:34.809
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:36.409
<v Speaker 1>So

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:37.369
<v Speaker 1>alright.

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:40.169
<v Speaker 0>I don't know. How many are, like, the

00:26:40.169 --> 00:26:42.009
<v Speaker 0>exact opposite person?

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:43.369
<v Speaker 0>Like, 100%.

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:45.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So that's so that's the thing is

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:47.529
<v Speaker 1>is, like that that's the thing about Linux

00:26:47.529 --> 00:26:48.330
<v Speaker 1>is, like like,

00:26:48.934 --> 00:26:50.215
<v Speaker 1>this is what kind of what I like

00:26:50.215 --> 00:26:51.654
<v Speaker 1>about it, and it's like,

00:26:52.135 --> 00:26:53.654
<v Speaker 1>this is my personality

00:26:53.735 --> 00:26:56.775
<v Speaker 1>my personality, and this setup matches my personality,

00:26:56.775 --> 00:26:57.735
<v Speaker 1>which is, like,

00:26:58.294 --> 00:27:00.375
<v Speaker 1>completely opposite. And then what I found within

00:27:00.375 --> 00:27:01.575
<v Speaker 1>the Linux community

00:27:01.735 --> 00:27:03.975
<v Speaker 1>is I actually don't know many people who

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:06.770
<v Speaker 1>would agree with me. Within the Linux community,

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:08.370
<v Speaker 1>it tends to go the other way of,

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:10.850
<v Speaker 1>like, people love, like, tiling window you know,

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Sutclast, like, all the like, DWM I three,

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:15.810
<v Speaker 1>those type of things, or they love TMux.

00:27:16.304 --> 00:27:17.985
<v Speaker 1>And it's like so that's where it's like

00:27:18.065 --> 00:27:19.345
<v Speaker 1>feel like, like, I don't fit in with

00:27:19.345 --> 00:27:21.105
<v Speaker 1>the Linux users because I'm just like, no.

00:27:21.105 --> 00:27:22.384
<v Speaker 1>I don't I don't like all that, like,

00:27:22.384 --> 00:27:23.584
<v Speaker 1>geeky cool stuff,

00:27:24.784 --> 00:27:26.625
<v Speaker 1>whereas most Linux users do. It's like they

00:27:26.625 --> 00:27:28.784
<v Speaker 1>also like Mix. You know? They're like it's

00:27:28.784 --> 00:27:31.970
<v Speaker 1>like Mix is like a engineer catnip. Like,

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:33.409
<v Speaker 1>it's just it's like, oh, it's cool.

00:27:34.049 --> 00:27:36.210
<v Speaker 0>But Yeah. I can't go more than an

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:38.610
<v Speaker 0>hour before trying to tweak something in my

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:40.690
<v Speaker 0>dot files, my Z shell config, my fish

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:43.729
<v Speaker 0>config, whatever, trying new software and just

00:27:44.049 --> 00:27:45.695
<v Speaker 0>yeah. I spent 50% of my time doing

00:27:45.695 --> 00:27:46.895
<v Speaker 0>some work in Fit to Fit, and my

00:27:46.895 --> 00:27:49.535
<v Speaker 0>time just fucking around. Change So that's the

00:27:49.535 --> 00:27:50.575
<v Speaker 0>thing is, like, I

00:27:51.295 --> 00:27:54.495
<v Speaker 1>do that. Like so I'm constantly installing distributions,

00:27:54.575 --> 00:27:56.895
<v Speaker 1>trying out things, like, fooling around with that,

00:27:56.895 --> 00:27:59.100
<v Speaker 1>fooling around with Neo. Like, all of those

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.180
<v Speaker 1>things I do, but I typically do those

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:02.460
<v Speaker 1>in a virtual machine.

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.500
<v Speaker 1>So I don't screw with my, like, my

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.740
<v Speaker 1>because it's like I don't know. It's like,

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:09.500
<v Speaker 1>I I gotta work. I have a boss.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.900
<v Speaker 1>I have to deliver things. So it's like,

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.660
<v Speaker 1>I can't screw with my, like, my my

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:16.355
<v Speaker 1>default setup or whatever. But, like, I'm constantly

00:28:16.515 --> 00:28:19.794
<v Speaker 1>so it's like, I've got VirtualBox, VMware, and

00:28:19.794 --> 00:28:22.434
<v Speaker 1>Vert Manager all installed on this machine because

00:28:22.434 --> 00:28:24.995
<v Speaker 1>different hypervisors seem to do a better job

00:28:24.995 --> 00:28:26.915
<v Speaker 1>with different things. And so it's like I'm

00:28:26.915 --> 00:28:27.955
<v Speaker 1>constantly running different,

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:30.470
<v Speaker 1>like, virtualization.

00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:33.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm always trying out diff different distributions.

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:35.990
<v Speaker 0>But this is the this is what I

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:37.269
<v Speaker 1>stuck to. And so

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:40.470
<v Speaker 1>I started getting interested in Windows about

00:28:41.485 --> 00:28:43.725
<v Speaker 1>well, it's been a couple years where I've

00:28:43.725 --> 00:28:45.804
<v Speaker 1>been kind of, like, theoretically

00:28:45.885 --> 00:28:47.404
<v Speaker 1>like, I've been trying to see, like, can

00:28:47.404 --> 00:28:49.565
<v Speaker 1>I move to Windows? Because I already know

00:28:49.565 --> 00:28:51.245
<v Speaker 1>I can't survive in Mac, but, like, maybe

00:28:51.245 --> 00:28:52.364
<v Speaker 1>Windows, could.

00:28:52.845 --> 00:28:54.845
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why I started to, like,

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:57.020
<v Speaker 1>think about that is, like, the setup that

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:59.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm showing you is, like, the setup that

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.260
<v Speaker 1>I've had for over a decade.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:03.820
<v Speaker 1>And the reason, like, is it works. It

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:06.220
<v Speaker 1>works extremely well for me. Like, I have

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.700
<v Speaker 1>no complaint. It just works, but that's also

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:09.100
<v Speaker 1>boring.

00:29:09.645 --> 00:29:12.685
<v Speaker 1>It's like, I want shiny new things, but,

00:29:12.685 --> 00:29:14.365
<v Speaker 1>like, whenever I try out shiny new things

00:29:14.365 --> 00:29:16.924
<v Speaker 1>in Linux, I can't find, like,

00:29:17.645 --> 00:29:19.245
<v Speaker 1>I can't find a new thing that works

00:29:19.245 --> 00:29:21.245
<v Speaker 1>for me. Like, when I started in Linux,

00:29:21.245 --> 00:29:23.245
<v Speaker 1>like, I went through these these different eras

00:29:23.245 --> 00:29:26.010
<v Speaker 1>of, like, I was using GNOME and KDE.

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:27.450
<v Speaker 1>I spent a lot of time in Ice

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:30.009
<v Speaker 1>WM, which is a very weird window manager.

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:32.249
<v Speaker 1>And then I spent a significant

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:34.010
<v Speaker 1>amount of time in enlightenment,

00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:34.809
<v Speaker 1>like e 16.

00:29:36.195 --> 00:29:38.195
<v Speaker 1>I so that was kinda like that was

00:29:38.195 --> 00:29:40.674
<v Speaker 1>the peak of my Linux coolness was, like,

00:29:40.674 --> 00:29:42.354
<v Speaker 1>e 16. But

00:29:43.955 --> 00:29:46.595
<v Speaker 1>then, like, then I found x s like,

00:29:46.595 --> 00:29:48.195
<v Speaker 1>and then I started fooling around with Unity,

00:29:48.195 --> 00:29:50.195
<v Speaker 1>and I actually liked Unity, although all of

00:29:50.195 --> 00:29:52.320
<v Speaker 1>the Linux people hated

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Unity. I actually really liked it.

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:56.960
<v Speaker 1>So I liked Unity, and I had a

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:57.600
<v Speaker 1>weird,

00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.840
<v Speaker 1>like, bastardized version of it because it was

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:03.200
<v Speaker 1>comp Compass under the under the hood. So

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.320
<v Speaker 1>it's like, you could do all the cool

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.360
<v Speaker 1>Compass stuff.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.424
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like a kinda sorta ran

00:30:08.424 --> 00:30:10.345
<v Speaker 1>Unity, but it was heavily tweaked with the

00:30:10.345 --> 00:30:12.345
<v Speaker 1>Compass stuff, so it was completely different.

00:30:13.385 --> 00:30:15.065
<v Speaker 1>But then Ubuntu

00:30:15.145 --> 00:30:16.345
<v Speaker 1>abandoned

00:30:17.225 --> 00:30:19.865
<v Speaker 1>Unity, which had the side effect of basically

00:30:19.865 --> 00:30:21.065
<v Speaker 1>killing Compass.

00:30:22.039 --> 00:30:23.320
<v Speaker 1>Is that how you say it, Hayden? I

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.240
<v Speaker 1>don't know how you say yeah. Yeah. It's

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:25.720
<v Speaker 1>like

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.280
<v Speaker 1>had the side effect of basically killing that

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:28.999
<v Speaker 1>project.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.120
<v Speaker 1>So then I was abandoned. I was like,

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.720
<v Speaker 1>well, crap. What am I gonna do going

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.159
<v Speaker 1>forward? And then so that's why I ended

00:30:35.159 --> 00:30:37.005
<v Speaker 1>up switching to XFC. But but I've been

00:30:37.005 --> 00:30:39.085
<v Speaker 1>basically stuck on x x so I spent

00:30:39.085 --> 00:30:41.485
<v Speaker 1>all this time, like, switching my desktop environment.

00:30:41.485 --> 00:30:43.164
<v Speaker 1>Well, once I found XFCE,

00:30:43.245 --> 00:30:45.565
<v Speaker 1>and it's worked so well for me, it,

00:30:45.565 --> 00:30:47.164
<v Speaker 1>like, kinda set the bar so high that

00:30:47.164 --> 00:30:49.085
<v Speaker 1>whenever I try something else, it's just not

00:30:49.085 --> 00:30:51.050
<v Speaker 1>as good. And then this is where my

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:52.970
<v Speaker 1>frustration with the Linux community now comes in.

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:55.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like is the fact that, like, whenever

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:57.210
<v Speaker 1>things get to the point where they're like,

00:30:57.210 --> 00:31:00.170
<v Speaker 1>oh, it's it it's almost there, they go

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:01.770
<v Speaker 1>and rewrite it. Like, that's what will happen

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:03.785
<v Speaker 1>with Gnome three. And then this is what's

00:31:03.785 --> 00:31:05.705
<v Speaker 1>happened with PopOS. Was like, I was following

00:31:05.705 --> 00:31:08.425
<v Speaker 1>PopOS where I'm like, PopOS is the new

00:31:08.425 --> 00:31:09.865
<v Speaker 1>thing. Like, that's what I'm gonna end up

00:31:09.865 --> 00:31:12.105
<v Speaker 1>switching to. Like, I wanna switch to PopOS

00:31:12.105 --> 00:31:13.545
<v Speaker 1>because it was it was so good. They

00:31:13.545 --> 00:31:14.505
<v Speaker 1>were doing such a good job.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.520
<v Speaker 1>And then they're like, we're gonna rewrite it,

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.520
<v Speaker 1>which I'm like, fine. I understand. Gnome shell

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:20.720
<v Speaker 1>is kind of a disaster.

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.760
<v Speaker 1>So, like, fine. Rewrite the shell. But now

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.280
<v Speaker 1>if you look at what the Cosmic Project

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:27.775
<v Speaker 1>is doing is they're rewriting everything. They have

00:31:27.775 --> 00:31:29.535
<v Speaker 1>a new terminal. They have an editor. They

00:31:29.535 --> 00:31:31.535
<v Speaker 1>have a and it's just like, holy crap.

00:31:31.535 --> 00:31:32.095
<v Speaker 1>Like,

00:31:32.495 --> 00:31:33.054
<v Speaker 1>no.

00:31:33.375 --> 00:31:36.175
<v Speaker 1>Like, you're so close, and you're not like,

00:31:36.175 --> 00:31:38.335
<v Speaker 0>are you gonna get there now? So that's

00:31:38.335 --> 00:31:39.935
<v Speaker 1>where it's like, this is my frustration. It's

00:31:39.935 --> 00:31:41.950
<v Speaker 1>just just like so I have a setup

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:44.029
<v Speaker 1>where it works extremely well, but as a

00:31:44.029 --> 00:31:46.350
<v Speaker 1>nerd, I want something new, but I can't

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:48.989
<v Speaker 1>get something new because everything else sucks.

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:51.390
<v Speaker 1>So it's like, I don't know what I

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:52.510
<v Speaker 1>know what to do. So, like, that's why

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:54.190
<v Speaker 1>I started looking at Windows where it's like,

00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:55.549
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. Maybe I can get Windows

00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:55.870
<v Speaker 1>to work.

00:31:56.875 --> 00:31:59.114
<v Speaker 2>So what so Windows is your new DE?

00:31:59.515 --> 00:32:01.434
<v Speaker 1>It is. So so let me show you.

00:32:01.434 --> 00:32:02.715
<v Speaker 1>So I'll show you. So it's like, you

00:32:02.715 --> 00:32:04.395
<v Speaker 1>know, you you've seen what my Linux environment

00:32:04.395 --> 00:32:06.155
<v Speaker 1>looks like. So now so what I've done

00:32:06.155 --> 00:32:07.914
<v Speaker 1>is oh, hopefully, this is still set up.

00:32:07.914 --> 00:32:09.835
<v Speaker 1>Is so I have this I bought this.

00:32:10.559 --> 00:32:13.279
<v Speaker 1>I started using Windows on my framework laptop,

00:32:13.279 --> 00:32:15.679
<v Speaker 1>and then I just recently bought this Surface

00:32:15.679 --> 00:32:18.399
<v Speaker 1>laptop, and it's beautiful. This is an amazing

00:32:18.399 --> 00:32:19.200
<v Speaker 1>laptop.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.879
<v Speaker 1>I'm not much of a fan of

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:24.960
<v Speaker 1>the aluminum

00:32:25.355 --> 00:32:27.355
<v Speaker 1>because it just makes it super heavy,

00:32:28.075 --> 00:32:30.155
<v Speaker 1>but it has a very premium feel. So

00:32:30.155 --> 00:32:31.355
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you like

00:32:31.595 --> 00:32:33.755
<v Speaker 1>the feel of a MacBook, this is like

00:32:33.755 --> 00:32:35.034
<v Speaker 1>a MacBook replacement.

00:32:35.675 --> 00:32:38.555
<v Speaker 1>But the ARM processor is amazing in it.

00:32:38.555 --> 00:32:39.275
<v Speaker 1>It's so cool.

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:42.510
<v Speaker 1>I've yet to really tap the powers of

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:44.909
<v Speaker 1>the AI stuff, the the built in MPU.

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:46.750
<v Speaker 1>But, anyway, so I bet so what I've

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:48.510
<v Speaker 1>done let me see if this is working

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:50.670
<v Speaker 1>right. Yeah. Have you done the benchmark share

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:52.830
<v Speaker 0>on that Snapdragon chip? Like, does it actually

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:53.950
<v Speaker 0>compete with the m,

00:32:54.455 --> 00:32:56.695
<v Speaker 0>the m three from Yeah. It Straight up

00:32:56.695 --> 00:32:58.934
<v Speaker 1>does. Straight up does. Yeah. It does. Awesome.

00:32:58.935 --> 00:32:59.894
<v Speaker 1>Pretty

00:33:00.215 --> 00:33:02.855
<v Speaker 1>much all the promises where it's like performance

00:33:02.855 --> 00:33:04.775
<v Speaker 1>wise, I think it like, there's m threes

00:33:04.775 --> 00:33:05.894
<v Speaker 1>that are faster.

00:33:06.375 --> 00:33:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Like, but for the most part, it's, like,

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.400
<v Speaker 1>between m two and m three. The battery

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.720
<v Speaker 1>life seems to be better than the Apple's

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:17.120
<v Speaker 1>from all the benchmarks. My personal experience is,

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:19.520
<v Speaker 1>like, I was on Intel devices for a

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:20.240
<v Speaker 1>long time

00:33:21.175 --> 00:33:23.255
<v Speaker 1>or Intel chips or whatever. So, like, my

00:33:23.255 --> 00:33:25.495
<v Speaker 1>last Intel was a twelfth gen Intel, which

00:33:25.495 --> 00:33:27.575
<v Speaker 1>apparently was the best one because after

00:33:27.575 --> 00:33:30.135
<v Speaker 1>that, apparently, they've just gone to crap,

00:33:30.855 --> 00:33:33.415
<v Speaker 1>like, reliability and stuff, I guess. But so

00:33:33.415 --> 00:33:34.775
<v Speaker 1>I was on the twelfth gen Intel,

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:38.139
<v Speaker 1>and I switched to an AMD.

00:33:38.299 --> 00:33:39.980
<v Speaker 1>The framework I have is an AMD, and

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:41.740
<v Speaker 1>I was blown away with the AMD processor.

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:43.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm like, this is way better than the

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:45.500
<v Speaker 1>Intel's. It was faster. The built in GPU

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:46.220
<v Speaker 1>is better.

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:49.304
<v Speaker 1>The battery life sucked, though. It's it's six

00:33:49.304 --> 00:33:50.905
<v Speaker 0>hours, I get, if I'm lucky when I'm

00:33:50.905 --> 00:33:51.544
<v Speaker 0>coding.

00:33:51.865 --> 00:33:54.025
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So it's like so, like, it was

00:33:54.025 --> 00:33:56.825
<v Speaker 1>really cool. Like, the AMD was way faster,

00:33:57.145 --> 00:33:59.225
<v Speaker 1>but the battery life sucked. Okay. So now

00:33:59.225 --> 00:34:00.265
<v Speaker 1>I switched to the Surface.

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.639
<v Speaker 1>The performance between the AMD and the Surface

00:34:04.639 --> 00:34:05.440
<v Speaker 1>laptop

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.800
<v Speaker 1>is, like, negative like, I don't notice any

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:11.920
<v Speaker 1>difference. I'm guessing maybe the the the Surface

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:13.040
<v Speaker 1>is faster,

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.400
<v Speaker 1>but it's like

00:34:15.135 --> 00:34:16.895
<v Speaker 1>like, I I wasn't I didn't feel like

00:34:16.895 --> 00:34:18.735
<v Speaker 1>I was limited by the AMD, to be

00:34:18.735 --> 00:34:20.574
<v Speaker 1>honest. Like, performance wise, I didn't feel like

00:34:20.574 --> 00:34:22.655
<v Speaker 1>like, like, I got enough performance out of

00:34:22.655 --> 00:34:23.935
<v Speaker 1>it. So I didn't feel like it was

00:34:23.935 --> 00:34:25.775
<v Speaker 1>already so, like, with the Surface laptop and

00:34:25.775 --> 00:34:28.094
<v Speaker 1>the the ARM processor, like, I also don't

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.360
<v Speaker 1>feel that way too. And I and I

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.960
<v Speaker 1>have 64 gig of RAM. I can still

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.600
<v Speaker 1>run, you know, VMs and all this other

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.160
<v Speaker 1>stuff. And so I'm super impressed with performance.

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:37.360
<v Speaker 1>But then on the flip side is the

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.320
<v Speaker 1>battery glass.

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:40.974
<v Speaker 1>So it's like it's amazing. Like, you you

00:34:40.974 --> 00:34:42.735
<v Speaker 1>can get like, if you're not coding,

00:34:42.895 --> 00:34:44.735
<v Speaker 1>you know, whatever, you can get, like,

00:34:45.375 --> 00:34:47.135
<v Speaker 1>I don't know, fifteen hours or something like

00:34:47.135 --> 00:34:48.815
<v Speaker 1>that. I don't know. I do a very

00:34:48.815 --> 00:34:49.695
<v Speaker 1>intensive

00:34:51.935 --> 00:34:53.215
<v Speaker 1>development or whatever.

00:34:53.455 --> 00:34:53.935
<v Speaker 1>And

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. I I I I get

00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:58.120
<v Speaker 1>I get enough hours that I can go

00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.360
<v Speaker 1>through a day without without really having to

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.080
<v Speaker 1>charge it

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:03.560
<v Speaker 1>because I'm typically just sitting on a laptop.

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.000
<v Speaker 1>So, yeah, the laptop I have Is this

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:05.960
<v Speaker 0>not just fanless?

00:35:07.484 --> 00:35:09.565
<v Speaker 0>If that's another picture of my framework, the

00:35:09.565 --> 00:35:11.085
<v Speaker 0>fans are so noisy.

00:35:11.404 --> 00:35:13.164
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Oh, yeah. The frame well, the framework,

00:35:13.164 --> 00:35:16.285
<v Speaker 1>the the the it's noisy, and it's hot.

00:35:16.444 --> 00:35:18.605
<v Speaker 1>Holy crap. That that thing is hot. No.

00:35:18.605 --> 00:35:20.924
<v Speaker 1>So the surface, it's not fanless, but they

00:35:20.924 --> 00:35:23.230
<v Speaker 1>they won't turn on for the I mean,

00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:25.550
<v Speaker 1>like, they do turn on if you were

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:27.310
<v Speaker 1>really pegging it because, like, I do

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:30.110
<v Speaker 1>you know, it's a whatever. Was compiling the

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:32.350
<v Speaker 1>l LLVM from scratch the other day, and

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:34.430
<v Speaker 1>that takes, like, hour. Well, I had a

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:36.275
<v Speaker 1>weird issue where it wouldn't. But but so

00:35:36.275 --> 00:35:37.795
<v Speaker 1>it's like, you can turn the fans on,

00:35:37.795 --> 00:35:39.475
<v Speaker 1>but they're pretty quiet. But the whole but,

00:35:39.475 --> 00:35:42.355
<v Speaker 1>generally, the device is silent and cool. It's

00:35:42.355 --> 00:35:43.955
<v Speaker 1>like it's not hot at all. It's a

00:35:43.955 --> 00:35:45.315
<v Speaker 1>really impressive laptop.

00:35:45.795 --> 00:35:48.195
<v Speaker 1>So I do have the the latest Surface.

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:52.070
<v Speaker 1>They call it the Surface Copilot Plus PC,

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:53.430
<v Speaker 1>which is terrible branding.

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:56.310
<v Speaker 1>But I have the the brand new latest

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:58.070
<v Speaker 1>one, the top of the line one, which

00:35:58.070 --> 00:36:00.550
<v Speaker 1>was, like, at 64 gig. It's, like, the

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:03.270
<v Speaker 1>black the black, like, developer. There was a

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:05.965
<v Speaker 1>special, like, brand new edition one or whatever.

00:36:05.965 --> 00:36:07.165
<v Speaker 1>I don't like, when I bought it when

00:36:07.165 --> 00:36:09.165
<v Speaker 1>I honestly, when I buy most laptops, I

00:36:09.165 --> 00:36:10.765
<v Speaker 1>kinda just scale everything all the way up

00:36:10.765 --> 00:36:12.765
<v Speaker 1>to the top. It's like, I want the

00:36:12.765 --> 00:36:13.965
<v Speaker 1>fastest investment.

00:36:14.285 --> 00:36:16.205
<v Speaker 0>I love that, but I'm gonna just say

00:36:16.205 --> 00:36:18.205
<v Speaker 0>all developers is that we always go for

00:36:18.205 --> 00:36:19.645
<v Speaker 0>the top of the line spec

00:36:31.365 --> 00:36:33.765
<v Speaker 1>the excuse that Go does a good job

00:36:33.765 --> 00:36:36.005
<v Speaker 1>of using all the cores in compilation.

00:36:36.485 --> 00:36:37.045
<v Speaker 1>So

00:36:37.445 --> 00:36:39.445
<v Speaker 1>although how often are you really compiling?

00:36:39.925 --> 00:36:41.445
<v Speaker 1>But that's my excuse of why I need

00:36:41.445 --> 00:36:42.325
<v Speaker 1>all the cores.

00:36:43.365 --> 00:36:44.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So let me show you. So I'm

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:45.880
<v Speaker 1>gonna switch over.

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.680
<v Speaker 1>So this should be on this side. Okay.

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:50.680
<v Speaker 1>So I this is RDP. I got an

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:51.960
<v Speaker 1>RDP set. Okay.

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:53.720
<v Speaker 1>So I'm doing

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.760
<v Speaker 1>remote desktop to that laptop so you can

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:58.525
<v Speaker 1>see my setup. Okay. So this is what

00:36:58.605 --> 00:37:00.845
<v Speaker 1>again, so very similar setup. I use a

00:37:00.845 --> 00:37:03.005
<v Speaker 1>black background. Like, I only work in black

00:37:03.005 --> 00:37:04.285
<v Speaker 1>or very dark gray.

00:37:05.805 --> 00:37:08.205
<v Speaker 1>And so what I've like, I have a

00:37:08.205 --> 00:37:10.445
<v Speaker 1>very it's very similar minimal setup. Like, I

00:37:10.445 --> 00:37:11.325
<v Speaker 1>don't like

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.280
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing. It's like, don't like

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:14.800
<v Speaker 1>a doc or anything like that, so I

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.200
<v Speaker 1>just hide it. I never see the taskbar.

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:20.480
<v Speaker 1>If I wanna switch between like, the I

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.760
<v Speaker 1>do the same thing in Linux. It's like,

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.280
<v Speaker 1>if I wanna find programs, I just alt

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:23.920
<v Speaker 1>tab,

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.795
<v Speaker 1>and then, you know, it's like if I

00:37:25.795 --> 00:37:27.395
<v Speaker 1>want that so it's like that's how I

00:37:27.395 --> 00:37:29.315
<v Speaker 1>know whatever I'm doing. Okay?

00:37:29.795 --> 00:37:30.435
<v Speaker 1>So

00:37:31.315 --> 00:37:32.675
<v Speaker 1>very minimal setup.

00:37:32.915 --> 00:37:35.155
<v Speaker 1>So when I launch terminal,

00:37:35.235 --> 00:37:36.195
<v Speaker 1>it just defaults

00:37:36.435 --> 00:37:38.035
<v Speaker 1>oh, did this shut down? Oh, yeah. It

00:37:38.035 --> 00:37:39.315
<v Speaker 1>probably shut down the

00:37:40.059 --> 00:37:42.859
<v Speaker 1>it shut down hyper the w sub out

00:37:42.859 --> 00:37:44.780
<v Speaker 1>too. It's normal. It doesn't take this long.

00:37:45.819 --> 00:37:46.460
<v Speaker 1>So

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:49.020
<v Speaker 1>where the heck is this? Okay. So when

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:51.020
<v Speaker 1>I launch the terminal, I just get Linux.

00:37:51.635 --> 00:37:53.795
<v Speaker 1>So it's like, I have the ex like,

00:37:53.795 --> 00:37:55.315
<v Speaker 1>I have the exact same,

00:37:55.795 --> 00:37:57.875
<v Speaker 1>like, Linux setup here.

00:37:58.515 --> 00:38:00.595
<v Speaker 1>So it's like so I just run Linux.

00:38:00.595 --> 00:38:02.035
<v Speaker 1>So now when I go and I run

00:38:02.994 --> 00:38:05.234
<v Speaker 1>so I don't I wouldn't typically click here

00:38:05.234 --> 00:38:07.490
<v Speaker 1>or whatever. But but it's like so if

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:08.930
<v Speaker 1>I run, like I was saying, like, I

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:11.250
<v Speaker 1>use JetBrains tools. So when I go and

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:12.930
<v Speaker 1>I and I run I'll I'll click it

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:15.170
<v Speaker 1>down here. When I run JetBrains here,

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:15.810
<v Speaker 1>this

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:20.450
<v Speaker 1>is running in limit in in WSL two.

00:38:20.505 --> 00:38:22.904
<v Speaker 1>It is not running natively on Windows. Like,

00:38:22.904 --> 00:38:25.144
<v Speaker 1>I do nothing in Windows. Like, I just

00:38:25.384 --> 00:38:28.105
<v Speaker 1>like, everything is in is in Linux.

00:38:29.384 --> 00:38:30.424
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. I don't know why I did

00:38:30.424 --> 00:38:33.065
<v Speaker 1>that. So so this is, like this is

00:38:33.065 --> 00:38:35.150
<v Speaker 1>this is mind blowing to me. So this

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:37.630
<v Speaker 1>is they're doing remote desktop. So the way

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:39.310
<v Speaker 1>this works is they're they're running

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:41.470
<v Speaker 1>this is running through x Wayland.

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:44.030
<v Speaker 1>So I'm running x, which then goes through

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:45.070
<v Speaker 1>x Wayland,

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:46.110
<v Speaker 1>and then Wayland

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:48.510
<v Speaker 1>they then translate Wayland to RDP,

00:38:49.025 --> 00:38:51.025
<v Speaker 1>and then they show RDP

00:38:51.105 --> 00:38:53.665
<v Speaker 1>like, so this is technically like a

00:38:55.025 --> 00:38:58.785
<v Speaker 1>like a windowless RDP screen sharing. Like, RDP

00:38:58.785 --> 00:39:00.385
<v Speaker 1>has the ability, you know, to

00:39:00.705 --> 00:39:02.545
<v Speaker 1>just do one window, like, not the whole

00:39:02.545 --> 00:39:05.200
<v Speaker 1>desktop. So it's like so the so this

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.040
<v Speaker 1>is the the crazy thing is, like,

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.520
<v Speaker 1>is there so many layers of madness going

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:10.160
<v Speaker 1>on here?

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:11.360
<v Speaker 1>But it works

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.560
<v Speaker 1>like, it's surprisingly responsive and works well and

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:16.240
<v Speaker 1>stuff. And so it's like, I'm doing my

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.120
<v Speaker 1>development in here.

00:39:18.325 --> 00:39:20.405
<v Speaker 1>And it's like, I do notice if I

00:39:20.405 --> 00:39:22.965
<v Speaker 1>switch from Linux to Windows is, like, the

00:39:22.965 --> 00:39:26.245
<v Speaker 1>response time on this is slightly less. It's

00:39:26.245 --> 00:39:27.845
<v Speaker 1>not enough that it's like

00:39:29.525 --> 00:39:31.605
<v Speaker 1>it's not enough that, like, it causes a

00:39:31.605 --> 00:39:32.165
<v Speaker 1>problem,

00:39:32.485 --> 00:39:35.570
<v Speaker 1>but it's just like Linux and XFCE is

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:38.530
<v Speaker 1>so ridiculously fast. Like, the there's just really

00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:40.210
<v Speaker 1>not you know, so, like, response time is

00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:41.010
<v Speaker 1>really fast.

00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:43.330
<v Speaker 1>So I do notice, but, like, I don't

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:45.010
<v Speaker 1>have any so it's like so the way

00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:47.895
<v Speaker 1>I work is, like so it's like my

00:39:47.975 --> 00:39:51.255
<v Speaker 1>Windows setup here is oops. That's weird. Is

00:39:51.895 --> 00:39:54.615
<v Speaker 1>is, like it's not really so it's, like,

00:39:54.935 --> 00:39:57.095
<v Speaker 1>it's not really any different in that

00:39:57.495 --> 00:39:58.855
<v Speaker 1>I've got

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:01.890
<v Speaker 1>I've got basically kind of the same things.

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:03.650
<v Speaker 1>I have a terminal. I have the browser,

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:06.050
<v Speaker 1>and, you know, and I'm using the exact

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:08.210
<v Speaker 1>same edge setup or whatever. So it's, like,

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:09.970
<v Speaker 1>the exact same experience, but I happen to

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:11.490
<v Speaker 1>be in in Windows. And, like, what I

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:13.525
<v Speaker 1>was saying before is, like, GUI apps that

00:40:13.525 --> 00:40:15.525
<v Speaker 1>I run, they tend to all be proprietary

00:40:15.525 --> 00:40:16.245
<v Speaker 1>things.

00:40:16.725 --> 00:40:18.645
<v Speaker 1>So all of all of those same apps

00:40:18.645 --> 00:40:20.725
<v Speaker 1>that I ran in Linux, the exact same

00:40:20.725 --> 00:40:22.005
<v Speaker 1>apps apps

00:40:22.085 --> 00:40:23.365
<v Speaker 1>exist in Windows,

00:40:23.445 --> 00:40:25.480
<v Speaker 1>but they happen to work better. But it's

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:27.560
<v Speaker 1>the exact same user experience and everything. So

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:29.640
<v Speaker 1>so oh, yeah. And then and then I

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:31.160
<v Speaker 1>set up this is this

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.560
<v Speaker 1>is PowerToys,

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:34.840
<v Speaker 1>PowerRun.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.720
<v Speaker 1>This is how I run most everything in

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:40.200
<v Speaker 1>in in so it's, like, in in,

00:40:41.055 --> 00:40:42.974
<v Speaker 1>let's see, in the what I was showing

00:40:42.974 --> 00:40:43.535
<v Speaker 1>with

00:40:44.175 --> 00:40:45.615
<v Speaker 1>in in XFCE,

00:40:45.775 --> 00:40:47.935
<v Speaker 1>I use, like, these little launcher things, which

00:40:47.935 --> 00:40:50.015
<v Speaker 1>are ugly and but they're functional.

00:40:50.734 --> 00:40:53.214
<v Speaker 1>But in Windows, basically, I use the PowerChoice

00:40:53.214 --> 00:40:54.860
<v Speaker 1>run or whatever. So

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.900
<v Speaker 1>so I can run, you know, whatever. So,

00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:59.900
<v Speaker 1>like, Slack, this you know, whatever. It's the

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:01.100
<v Speaker 1>same thing everyone has.

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:04.700
<v Speaker 1>So so the thing is it's like it's

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:06.460
<v Speaker 1>like, yes. This is technically Windows,

00:41:07.205 --> 00:41:09.365
<v Speaker 1>but it's like, I never leave I never

00:41:09.365 --> 00:41:11.445
<v Speaker 1>leave Linux. And and the other the other

00:41:11.445 --> 00:41:13.045
<v Speaker 1>thing is so let me show. It's like,

00:41:13.045 --> 00:41:14.885
<v Speaker 1>I have this kind of this setup where

00:41:14.885 --> 00:41:16.485
<v Speaker 1>I run sync things

00:41:18.005 --> 00:41:18.885
<v Speaker 1>that's

00:41:18.885 --> 00:41:21.845
<v Speaker 1>syncing basically, like, my source directory. This is

00:41:21.845 --> 00:41:24.700
<v Speaker 1>a weird arbitrary bins. And then, actually, my

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:25.660
<v Speaker 1>my bash,

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:27.820
<v Speaker 1>I put all my, like, dot files in

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:29.260
<v Speaker 1>here, and that's the way I manage them

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:31.740
<v Speaker 1>or whatever. But so I have synced things

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:33.820
<v Speaker 1>that are syncing these files back and forth.

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:36.815
<v Speaker 1>So I develop on on my desktop in

00:41:36.815 --> 00:41:38.735
<v Speaker 1>Linux, and then I just switch over to

00:41:38.735 --> 00:41:39.455
<v Speaker 1>Windows,

00:41:39.855 --> 00:41:41.135
<v Speaker 1>and I just pick up where I left

00:41:41.135 --> 00:41:43.295
<v Speaker 1>off. Like, because everything is just syncing back

00:41:43.295 --> 00:41:45.695
<v Speaker 1>and forth. And so it's like so this

00:41:45.695 --> 00:41:47.215
<v Speaker 1>is thing. It's like, I've been blown away

00:41:47.215 --> 00:41:47.695
<v Speaker 1>at, like

00:41:48.895 --> 00:41:49.615
<v Speaker 1>at that, like

00:41:50.769 --> 00:41:51.010
<v Speaker 1>I

00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:54.450
<v Speaker 1>because, like, I really like my XFCE setup

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:56.930
<v Speaker 1>that, like, I mimic the exact same thing

00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:57.890
<v Speaker 1>in Windows,

00:41:58.609 --> 00:42:00.210
<v Speaker 1>and I still get Linux. And, like and

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:02.690
<v Speaker 1>the cool thing about WSL two is, like,

00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:05.490
<v Speaker 1>it's very open, the whole platform, where it's

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:08.105
<v Speaker 1>like, if I wanna do crazy weird things,

00:42:08.105 --> 00:42:10.185
<v Speaker 1>like compile a custom kernel and do stuff

00:42:10.185 --> 00:42:12.105
<v Speaker 1>like you can do it too. Like, they

00:42:12.105 --> 00:42:14.665
<v Speaker 1>don't lock down anything. Like, it's all open.

00:42:14.665 --> 00:42:15.785
<v Speaker 1>It's surprisingly

00:42:15.945 --> 00:42:16.505
<v Speaker 1>open.

00:42:17.465 --> 00:42:20.010
<v Speaker 1>So it's like, I can so it's like,

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:22.330
<v Speaker 1>my brain doesn't really know that it's Windows,

00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:25.850
<v Speaker 1>and things just generally work better.

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:27.770
<v Speaker 1>And it's like so I don't know. So,

00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:29.690
<v Speaker 1>like, that's that's this is, like, the setup

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:31.690
<v Speaker 1>that that I that I use or whatever.

00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:34.055
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know. I'm I'm pretty darn

00:42:34.055 --> 00:42:35.815
<v Speaker 1>happy with the with the Windows. So it's

00:42:35.815 --> 00:42:38.135
<v Speaker 1>like, I'll probably stick with this where it's

00:42:38.135 --> 00:42:39.974
<v Speaker 1>like, I have Linux on the desktop and

00:42:39.974 --> 00:42:41.335
<v Speaker 1>Windows on the laptop

00:42:41.575 --> 00:42:43.895
<v Speaker 1>because from a laptop perspective, it just works

00:42:43.895 --> 00:42:45.974
<v Speaker 1>significantly better. Like, I'll give you, like, another

00:42:45.974 --> 00:42:47.415
<v Speaker 1>example of something that drives me nuts. It's

00:42:47.415 --> 00:42:50.010
<v Speaker 1>like full disk encryption. On a laptop, I

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:52.010
<v Speaker 1>want full disk encryption because, like, I use

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:54.650
<v Speaker 1>it for work. It's a good security thing

00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:55.370
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.

00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:58.170
<v Speaker 1>Full disk encryption in Linux drives me nuts.

00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:02.075
<v Speaker 1>Like, it because, like, it never, like, there's

00:43:02.075 --> 00:43:04.875
<v Speaker 1>always weird caveats and issues.

00:43:05.115 --> 00:43:06.795
<v Speaker 1>So you can do, like, the full disk

00:43:06.795 --> 00:43:07.595
<v Speaker 1>encryption,

00:43:07.914 --> 00:43:09.914
<v Speaker 1>which which then Linux will require you to

00:43:09.914 --> 00:43:12.075
<v Speaker 1>type a password on the boot manager,

00:43:12.234 --> 00:43:13.835
<v Speaker 1>or you can do the, like, the home

00:43:13.835 --> 00:43:14.795
<v Speaker 1>directory encryption,

00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:17.970
<v Speaker 1>which is integrated with the login, but then

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:20.690
<v Speaker 1>there's other trade offs of performance and whatnot

00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:22.210
<v Speaker 1>and what EcryptFS

00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:24.210
<v Speaker 1>or whatever the current thing is. I I

00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:25.410
<v Speaker 1>haven't been following it for a while. I

00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:26.690
<v Speaker 1>don't know what the current way people are

00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:29.810
<v Speaker 1>encrypting things. But, like, in Windows and Mac,

00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:31.250
<v Speaker 1>it's like you just flip the setting, and

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:31.650
<v Speaker 1>it works.

00:43:32.714 --> 00:43:34.075
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's just on.

00:43:34.394 --> 00:43:35.994
<v Speaker 1>Like so those are the things that, like,

00:43:35.994 --> 00:43:38.315
<v Speaker 1>I like about, like, being like, in the

00:43:38.315 --> 00:43:39.515
<v Speaker 1>Windows, there's, like

00:43:40.394 --> 00:43:42.634
<v Speaker 1>there's all these things that that just kind

00:43:42.634 --> 00:43:44.555
<v Speaker 1>of work that you forgot about in the

00:43:44.555 --> 00:43:47.700
<v Speaker 1>Linux land. Like, I really like biometric login.

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:49.460
<v Speaker 1>So it's like that Surface laptop just does

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.700
<v Speaker 1>face ID. I open it up. It scans

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:53.380
<v Speaker 1>my face. I'm logged in. I never type

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.540
<v Speaker 1>my password. Like, I like fingerprint, and I

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:56.820
<v Speaker 1>try to use it in Linux, but it

00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:58.020
<v Speaker 1>sucks most of the time.

00:43:58.500 --> 00:43:59.780
<v Speaker 1>But it's like those things, they just work.

00:44:00.005 --> 00:44:01.685
<v Speaker 1>Like, they just work. And so it's like

00:44:01.845 --> 00:44:03.445
<v Speaker 1>I I don't know. So

00:44:04.245 --> 00:44:05.525
<v Speaker 2>Are you using Yeah.

00:44:06.005 --> 00:44:08.005
<v Speaker 0>Sorry. How do you go? Are you using

00:44:08.005 --> 00:44:10.005
<v Speaker 2>systemd and WSO?

00:44:10.165 --> 00:44:12.725
<v Speaker 1>Yes. Because, like, you just can't avoid it.

00:44:12.965 --> 00:44:13.525
<v Speaker 1>So

00:44:13.765 --> 00:44:14.485
<v Speaker 1>I hate it.

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:17.869
<v Speaker 1>You can see, like I don't even know

00:44:17.869 --> 00:44:18.990
<v Speaker 1>why I have Snap.

00:44:19.309 --> 00:44:22.109
<v Speaker 0>Oh, what am I doing? Like, man, I

00:44:22.109 --> 00:44:24.589
<v Speaker 1>feel bad. I almost always uninstall Snap, but

00:44:24.589 --> 00:44:24.990
<v Speaker 1>there's

00:44:26.349 --> 00:44:28.030
<v Speaker 1>oh, I know why. I was trying to

00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:29.915
<v Speaker 1>do something with Chromium, and I

00:44:30.635 --> 00:44:32.075
<v Speaker 1>I I found out that, like

00:44:33.195 --> 00:44:35.035
<v Speaker 1>because this is an ARM laptop

00:44:35.435 --> 00:44:38.395
<v Speaker 1>so Windows on ARM works surprisingly well. You

00:44:38.395 --> 00:44:41.915
<v Speaker 1>very don't really notice that you're using ARM,

00:44:42.555 --> 00:44:46.050
<v Speaker 1>except for gaming. Gaming kinda sucks. But Linux

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:49.010
<v Speaker 1>on ARM, you run more issues. And so,

00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:51.010
<v Speaker 1>specifically, the issue I found out when I

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:53.490
<v Speaker 1>switched to this is there's, like, no upstream

00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:55.890
<v Speaker 1>support for browsers in Linux.

00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:58.370
<v Speaker 1>So the majority of the time, I'm running

00:44:58.370 --> 00:45:00.050
<v Speaker 1>the browser natively in Windows,

00:45:01.835 --> 00:45:03.194
<v Speaker 1>but I have use cases where I need

00:45:03.194 --> 00:45:04.795
<v Speaker 1>to run a browser in Linux. And so,

00:45:04.795 --> 00:45:07.035
<v Speaker 1>like, that sucks. There's no upstream

00:45:07.035 --> 00:45:07.915
<v Speaker 1>ARM

00:45:08.075 --> 00:45:09.515
<v Speaker 1>64 browsers

00:45:09.515 --> 00:45:11.194
<v Speaker 1>that I'm aware of. You have to install

00:45:11.194 --> 00:45:13.595
<v Speaker 1>open source stuff, and then then you have

00:45:13.595 --> 00:45:14.714
<v Speaker 1>all other issues.

00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:18.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Google Google Chrome for ARM, I think,

00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:19.490
<v Speaker 2>is in beta.

00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:22.290
<v Speaker 1>For for oh, really?

00:45:22.450 --> 00:45:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I'll check that out because, like I

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:25.970
<v Speaker 1>said, I would've for what because I was

00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:28.370
<v Speaker 1>trying to do browser automation type stuff. And

00:45:27.984 --> 00:45:30.065
<v Speaker 1>so for browser automation, Chrome is actually the

00:45:30.065 --> 00:45:32.545
<v Speaker 1>desirable thing, but I couldn't even find Chrome.

00:45:32.545 --> 00:45:34.145
<v Speaker 1>But maybe maybe if I went to the

00:45:34.145 --> 00:45:35.984
<v Speaker 1>beta or developer channel or something like that

00:45:35.984 --> 00:45:38.224
<v Speaker 1>because I couldn't find it. But Yeah. But,

00:45:38.224 --> 00:45:39.425
<v Speaker 1>yeah, I do run

00:45:39.665 --> 00:45:40.705
<v Speaker 1>system d,

00:45:41.025 --> 00:45:41.744
<v Speaker 0>which is annoying,

00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:44.590
<v Speaker 1>but not really. Because, like, the thing is

00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:46.350
<v Speaker 1>is, like, as much as I complain about

00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:47.310
<v Speaker 1>system d,

00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:48.270
<v Speaker 1>like

00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:51.230
<v Speaker 1>like, all my complaints about system d are

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:52.590
<v Speaker 1>more of, like, I just think it's a

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:56.095
<v Speaker 1>terrible architecture and design. But, functionally, it works.

00:45:56.095 --> 00:45:56.735
<v Speaker 1>Like,

00:45:57.535 --> 00:45:59.935
<v Speaker 1>it works. And and and and the thing

00:45:59.935 --> 00:46:01.775
<v Speaker 1>is, like, if you if you actually, like,

00:46:01.775 --> 00:46:03.855
<v Speaker 1>drink the Kool Aid on system d and

00:46:03.855 --> 00:46:06.655
<v Speaker 1>go 100% in on system d, it's a

00:46:06.655 --> 00:46:07.455
<v Speaker 1>pretty slick system.

00:46:09.069 --> 00:46:10.270
<v Speaker 1>It's just like

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:13.630
<v Speaker 1>as, like, a grumpy old Unix user,

00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:14.590
<v Speaker 1>it's

00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:15.870
<v Speaker 1>different.

00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:18.510
<v Speaker 1>You know? So it's like it's hard to

00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:19.150
<v Speaker 1>accept.

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:20.670
<v Speaker 1>But it

00:46:21.165 --> 00:46:23.485
<v Speaker 1>but it you know, whatever. It works. So,

00:46:23.485 --> 00:46:25.085
<v Speaker 1>like, it doesn't really cause much problems running

00:46:25.085 --> 00:46:26.845
<v Speaker 1>system d because system d is really lightweight

00:46:26.845 --> 00:46:29.325
<v Speaker 1>in general. The biggest issue

00:46:29.485 --> 00:46:31.005
<v Speaker 1>I ran into, but

00:46:32.605 --> 00:46:34.125
<v Speaker 1>was I I got into some weird

00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:36.790
<v Speaker 1>for some reason, system d was trying to

00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:37.910
<v Speaker 1>manage my DNS,

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:39.510
<v Speaker 1>which was, like, the worst thing ever.

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:40.470
<v Speaker 1>But

00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:42.630
<v Speaker 1>but I fixed that or whatever. So

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:45.349
<v Speaker 1>yeah. Oh, yeah. And I run I just

00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:47.925
<v Speaker 1>I run Docker just directly in WSL. I

00:46:47.925 --> 00:46:49.925
<v Speaker 1>don't use Docker for desktop. I don't understand

00:46:49.925 --> 00:46:51.925
<v Speaker 1>the value of it on Window. Like, I

00:46:51.925 --> 00:46:54.485
<v Speaker 1>just run Docker. So it's like whatever.

00:46:55.365 --> 00:46:57.125
<v Speaker 1>But yeah. So it's like with WSL too,

00:46:57.125 --> 00:46:58.725
<v Speaker 1>it's like you can do Docker and Kubernetes

00:46:58.725 --> 00:47:00.645
<v Speaker 1>and all your fancy stuff. Like, I was

00:47:00.645 --> 00:47:02.885
<v Speaker 1>I was chatting with someone recently on Twitter

00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:05.290
<v Speaker 1>about, like well, I went through, like, this

00:47:05.290 --> 00:47:06.650
<v Speaker 1>short phase where I was trying to get

00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:08.330
<v Speaker 1>Chrome OS to work. And so I have

00:47:08.330 --> 00:47:10.010
<v Speaker 1>a Pixelbook, and I have, like, a high

00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:10.970
<v Speaker 1>end Pixelbook.

00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:12.250
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to get Chrome OS to

00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:13.770
<v Speaker 1>work because I look because I was so

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:15.690
<v Speaker 1>excited about what they were doing with Crostini,

00:47:16.674 --> 00:47:19.474
<v Speaker 1>which is their equivalent of WSL. It's like

00:47:19.474 --> 00:47:21.635
<v Speaker 1>Linux inside of Chrome OS.

00:47:23.555 --> 00:47:26.035
<v Speaker 1>But they totally botched it because they locked

00:47:26.035 --> 00:47:28.115
<v Speaker 1>it down. Like, you cannot

00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:30.910
<v Speaker 1>screw with any of the Linux stuff. So

00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:32.830
<v Speaker 1>they don't even allow real root,

00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:35.310
<v Speaker 1>which just so it's like you can't run

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:36.190
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes

00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:37.710
<v Speaker 1>inside of the Linux

00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:39.950
<v Speaker 1>that's on Chrome OS,

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:42.555
<v Speaker 1>whereas on WSL two, they do. And so,

00:47:42.555 --> 00:47:44.474
<v Speaker 1>like like, those things just drive me nuts.

00:47:44.474 --> 00:47:45.835
<v Speaker 1>Said, why'd you lock it down? But, anyways

00:47:45.994 --> 00:47:47.515
<v Speaker 1>so it's like, I was really hopeful for

00:47:47.515 --> 00:47:49.435
<v Speaker 1>Chrome OS because I really like the stuff

00:47:49.435 --> 00:47:51.755
<v Speaker 1>they're doing. It's like, if you wanna see,

00:47:51.755 --> 00:47:52.315
<v Speaker 1>like,

00:47:52.555 --> 00:47:54.715
<v Speaker 1>the most bleeding edge crazy

00:47:54.795 --> 00:47:55.675
<v Speaker 1>Linux stuff,

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Chrome OS is doing it. Like, they have

00:47:59.599 --> 00:48:01.680
<v Speaker 1>like, the stuff they do with the kernel

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:04.880
<v Speaker 1>and the security stuff is, like, mind blowingly

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:05.600
<v Speaker 1>cool,

00:48:06.079 --> 00:48:08.480
<v Speaker 1>yet they screwed up the Linux user experience,

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:09.359
<v Speaker 1>which irritated

00:48:09.359 --> 00:48:09.599
<v Speaker 1>me.

00:48:10.265 --> 00:48:12.985
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. In 2020, I tried to go full

00:48:13.225 --> 00:48:14.345
<v Speaker 0>Chrome OS,

00:48:14.745 --> 00:48:17.305
<v Speaker 0>and I had nothing but pain with Christina.

00:48:17.305 --> 00:48:19.385
<v Speaker 0>It's a good idea, but it was frustrating

00:48:19.385 --> 00:48:22.265
<v Speaker 0>because Chrome OS is Linux. But then to

00:48:22.265 --> 00:48:23.865
<v Speaker 0>do Linux, I have to put it through

00:48:23.865 --> 00:48:25.880
<v Speaker 0>a virtual machine where

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:27.960
<v Speaker 0>the the there was not even any GPU

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:30.120
<v Speaker 0>support for, like, graphical apps or running Versus

00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:32.920
<v Speaker 0>code, which is Yeah. Relatively slow. It was

00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:35.240
<v Speaker 0>really frustrating. But I I love the idea

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:37.994
<v Speaker 0>of going all in on Chrome OS. And

00:48:37.994 --> 00:48:39.434
<v Speaker 0>I don't think I've ever really fixed that

00:48:39.434 --> 00:48:41.435
<v Speaker 0>performance, at least not to my knowledge.

00:48:41.755 --> 00:48:43.194
<v Speaker 1>And this is the weird thing is just,

00:48:43.194 --> 00:48:44.875
<v Speaker 1>like, some of the best

00:48:45.115 --> 00:48:46.954
<v Speaker 1>some of the best uses of Linux are

00:48:46.954 --> 00:48:49.035
<v Speaker 1>from the proprietary people, which is weird. So

00:48:49.035 --> 00:48:50.875
<v Speaker 1>it's like because you look at, like, the

00:48:50.875 --> 00:48:52.875
<v Speaker 1>cool stuff that Chrome OS or Android does

00:48:52.875 --> 00:48:54.930
<v Speaker 1>with Linux. And then, like, if you look

00:48:54.930 --> 00:48:56.930
<v Speaker 1>at WSL, like, the stuff they're doing with

00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:57.890
<v Speaker 1>WSLG,

00:48:57.890 --> 00:49:00.369
<v Speaker 1>because they have GPU pass through support too,

00:49:00.369 --> 00:49:02.290
<v Speaker 1>which is amazing. They're like, it's really geeky

00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:03.810
<v Speaker 1>cool, like, the way they're doing the pass

00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:04.610
<v Speaker 1>through support

00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:07.605
<v Speaker 1>and stuff. And then, like, on macOS,

00:49:07.605 --> 00:49:09.045
<v Speaker 1>the way they did, like, the

00:49:10.565 --> 00:49:13.925
<v Speaker 1>they they have support for within an ARM

00:49:13.925 --> 00:49:15.205
<v Speaker 1>VM. You can

00:49:15.525 --> 00:49:17.925
<v Speaker 1>what is it? You can run x 86

00:49:17.925 --> 00:49:19.285
<v Speaker 1>code through Rosetta.

00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:22.480
<v Speaker 1>Like, they do some so it's like they're

00:49:22.559 --> 00:49:24.240
<v Speaker 1>like, some of the coolest stuff is actually

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:25.599
<v Speaker 1>capping with the way, like, the kind of

00:49:25.599 --> 00:49:28.080
<v Speaker 1>the proprietary people are are integrating with it.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:30.560
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:49:32.079 --> 00:49:33.840
<v Speaker 0>It's a pretty compelling setup.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:34.960
<v Speaker 0>Like, I may

00:49:35.735 --> 00:49:36.855
<v Speaker 0>I I don't know if I could bring

00:49:36.855 --> 00:49:38.295
<v Speaker 0>myself to do it, but I'm tempted to

00:49:38.295 --> 00:49:40.615
<v Speaker 0>just for force myself on Windows 11 for

00:49:40.615 --> 00:49:42.375
<v Speaker 0>a little bit just because I want that

00:49:42.535 --> 00:49:44.535
<v Speaker 0>that kind of vertical integration where things do

00:49:44.535 --> 00:49:45.975
<v Speaker 0>just work. That's what I miss the most

00:49:45.975 --> 00:49:47.815
<v Speaker 0>about Mac is that

00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:50.190
<v Speaker 0>the same container's

00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:51.710
<v Speaker 0>up with Docker Desktop,

00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:53.870
<v Speaker 0>but you can get around that with with

00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:55.790
<v Speaker 0>other things. But things just worked.

00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:56.990
<v Speaker 0>And if I don't like it, because I

00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:58.270
<v Speaker 0>feel like I'm it's like a it's like

00:49:58.270 --> 00:50:00.190
<v Speaker 0>a thousand paper cuts. Like, nothing is gonna,

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:03.005
<v Speaker 0>like, scare me away, but actually, it would

00:50:03.005 --> 00:50:04.125
<v Speaker 0>be nice to have a day without those

00:50:04.125 --> 00:50:05.725
<v Speaker 0>paper cuts. But but when you think about

00:50:05.725 --> 00:50:07.565
<v Speaker 1>the things those paper cuts that you run

00:50:07.565 --> 00:50:10.445
<v Speaker 1>into are, like they're not the core thing

00:50:10.445 --> 00:50:12.445
<v Speaker 1>that you're using Linux. Like, well, I mean,

00:50:12.445 --> 00:50:13.805
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. Whatever. If you if you

00:50:13.805 --> 00:50:16.800
<v Speaker 1>just enjoy all the but it's, like, it's

00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:18.800
<v Speaker 1>it's all these, like, kind of tangential

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:21.360
<v Speaker 1>little things, audio, screen sharing,

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:24.000
<v Speaker 1>you know, sleep, wake, Bluetooth.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000
<v Speaker 1>Like, screw Bluetooth. It just never works. I've

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.640
<v Speaker 1>just never ever gotten Bluetooth to work well

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:29.200
<v Speaker 1>in Linux,

00:50:29.795 --> 00:50:32.595
<v Speaker 1>which is ironic because the the entire, like,

00:50:32.595 --> 00:50:36.035
<v Speaker 1>Android Bluetooth stack is should be written in

00:50:36.275 --> 00:50:37.955
<v Speaker 1>maybe they have a custom stack. Maybe that's

00:50:37.955 --> 00:50:39.795
<v Speaker 1>what it is. I don't I don't know.

00:50:41.315 --> 00:50:44.060
<v Speaker 1>But but when because I'm I'm kinda like,

00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:45.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm at the point, like so it's like,

00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:48.860
<v Speaker 1>actively I, like, actively deter people away from

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:49.980
<v Speaker 1>from Linux.

00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:52.140
<v Speaker 1>But, like because I don't try like, it's

00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:53.980
<v Speaker 1>just a this, like, personal thing where it's

00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:55.580
<v Speaker 1>like, I don't try to sell people. I'm

00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:57.020
<v Speaker 1>like, look. You should use my setup.

00:50:58.095 --> 00:50:59.855
<v Speaker 1>But I am curious of, like,

00:51:00.575 --> 00:51:02.495
<v Speaker 1>specific you know, it's like, for someone who,

00:51:02.495 --> 00:51:04.415
<v Speaker 1>like, just wants things just to work, it's

00:51:04.415 --> 00:51:04.975
<v Speaker 1>like

00:51:05.535 --> 00:51:08.575
<v Speaker 1>it's like, why would you not try WSL

00:51:08.575 --> 00:51:10.735
<v Speaker 1>two? Because, like because you think about it

00:51:10.735 --> 00:51:12.970
<v Speaker 1>from this perspective is is most people are

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:14.010
<v Speaker 1>on macOS.

00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:17.050
<v Speaker 1>And so like, most developers are on macOS.

00:51:17.130 --> 00:51:19.290
<v Speaker 1>And what macOS did was, like, they gave

00:51:19.290 --> 00:51:21.370
<v Speaker 1>you a terminal that's not Linux, but it's

00:51:21.370 --> 00:51:23.210
<v Speaker 1>pretty darn close to Linux. And then the

00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:26.984
<v Speaker 1>the the the the community bridge the gap

00:51:26.984 --> 00:51:28.984
<v Speaker 1>with Brew and whatnot and brought all the

00:51:28.984 --> 00:51:30.105
<v Speaker 1>Linux ecosystem

00:51:30.105 --> 00:51:32.905
<v Speaker 1>to the, you know, Bock or whatever

00:51:33.305 --> 00:51:34.185
<v Speaker 1>Darwin

00:51:34.664 --> 00:51:35.224
<v Speaker 1>stuff.

00:51:35.464 --> 00:51:37.464
<v Speaker 1>So it's like so you're getting this thing

00:51:37.464 --> 00:51:40.185
<v Speaker 1>where it's like, was fully proprietary OS

00:51:40.424 --> 00:51:41.305
<v Speaker 1>and then

00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:43.900
<v Speaker 1>a terminal which is close to Linux but

00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:45.740
<v Speaker 1>not exactly Linux, but you would most likely

00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:47.500
<v Speaker 1>prefer to run a Linux terminal.

00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:49.500
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Windows gives you kind of the same

00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:51.340
<v Speaker 1>thing. But I think a lot of people

00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:53.740
<v Speaker 1>have just, Windows PTSD.

00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:57.805
<v Speaker 1>It's just, like, twenty years of crap, and

00:51:57.805 --> 00:52:00.045
<v Speaker 1>especially if you live through, like, Vista

00:52:00.204 --> 00:52:01.724
<v Speaker 1>or Windows eight,

00:52:02.125 --> 00:52:03.964
<v Speaker 1>which were just garbage you know, like, those

00:52:03.964 --> 00:52:05.805
<v Speaker 1>things where they just really screwed it up.

00:52:05.805 --> 00:52:07.805
<v Speaker 1>But, like, seven I think seven and eleven

00:52:07.805 --> 00:52:09.680
<v Speaker 1>have been good. Like,

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:11.920
<v Speaker 1>10 was alright, but I really like Windows

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:12.480
<v Speaker 1>11.

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:14.799
<v Speaker 0>I think my challenge would be the lack

00:52:14.799 --> 00:52:16.880
<v Speaker 0>of automation. I know they've got one get

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:18.640
<v Speaker 0>now, so, like, it's kinda like their version

00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:19.839
<v Speaker 0>of. So

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:22.079
<v Speaker 1>this is actually so this is one thing

00:52:22.079 --> 00:52:24.319
<v Speaker 1>that I've actually come to appreciate and like

00:52:24.285 --> 00:52:27.645
<v Speaker 1>is I use this this program called UniGit.

00:52:27.645 --> 00:52:28.285
<v Speaker 1>So

00:52:28.684 --> 00:52:30.924
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to Windows, the only way

00:52:30.924 --> 00:52:34.845
<v Speaker 1>I install anything in Windows is through UniGit.

00:52:35.085 --> 00:52:36.924
<v Speaker 1>And so you can go and you can

00:52:36.924 --> 00:52:39.724
<v Speaker 1>search for whatever crap you want, like Steam.

00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:42.120
<v Speaker 1>So

00:52:42.359 --> 00:52:43.960
<v Speaker 1>and it will find it. And what this

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:46.040
<v Speaker 1>is doing is it's going across all the

00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:48.920
<v Speaker 1>different ecosystems of Wingate, Chocolatey,

00:52:49.079 --> 00:52:51.079
<v Speaker 1>Scoop. I have some turned off because I

00:52:51.079 --> 00:52:53.079
<v Speaker 1>pretty much only care about Wingate and Chocolatey.

00:52:54.375 --> 00:52:56.215
<v Speaker 1>But and so what I do is, like,

00:52:56.215 --> 00:52:57.415
<v Speaker 1>I'll just pick the ones that are from

00:52:57.415 --> 00:52:59.975
<v Speaker 1>Wingate. So then the cool thing is is

00:53:00.855 --> 00:53:01.575
<v Speaker 1>this

00:53:01.895 --> 00:53:04.215
<v Speaker 1>I install everything through this, and then it's

00:53:04.215 --> 00:53:04.855
<v Speaker 1>set up

00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:09.060
<v Speaker 1>to auto update. So in the background, like,

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:11.060
<v Speaker 1>you can see, like, this weather there's errors.

00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:13.140
<v Speaker 1>There's there it's trying to update something or

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:13.700
<v Speaker 1>whatever.

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:16.500
<v Speaker 1>So it

00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:18.660
<v Speaker 1>will just auto update everything in the background.

00:53:18.735 --> 00:53:21.375
<v Speaker 1>So it's just always upgrading everything. But then

00:53:21.375 --> 00:53:23.535
<v Speaker 1>it has this thing where let me see

00:53:23.535 --> 00:53:24.575
<v Speaker 1>if can find it.

00:53:25.375 --> 00:53:26.895
<v Speaker 1>I think it's documents.

00:53:29.215 --> 00:53:29.855
<v Speaker 1>Winget.

00:53:31.329 --> 00:53:34.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. So it's basically it's backing up

00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:36.849
<v Speaker 1>all the packages that I have. So it's

00:53:36.849 --> 00:53:38.130
<v Speaker 1>like, it has this

00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:40.450
<v Speaker 1>if I open up this,

00:53:41.089 --> 00:53:42.690
<v Speaker 1>this should go into VSCode probably.

00:53:43.644 --> 00:53:45.325
<v Speaker 1>So it has this thing which has all

00:53:45.325 --> 00:53:47.005
<v Speaker 1>the packages that are installed.

00:53:47.085 --> 00:53:49.244
<v Speaker 1>So if I go over to another machine,

00:53:51.164 --> 00:53:52.924
<v Speaker 1>if I go to another machine, I just

00:53:52.924 --> 00:53:55.565
<v Speaker 1>open up UniGet and then, like, just open

00:53:55.565 --> 00:53:57.484
<v Speaker 1>up this file, and then it installs all

00:53:57.484 --> 00:53:58.285
<v Speaker 1>the same applications.

00:53:59.010 --> 00:53:59.570
<v Speaker 1>So

00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:01.650
<v Speaker 1>so the thing is this, like,

00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:06.690
<v Speaker 1>the you can you can 100

00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:07.650
<v Speaker 1>automate

00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:10.370
<v Speaker 1>the setup of a Windows machine. The

00:54:11.010 --> 00:54:11.810
<v Speaker 1>downside

00:54:11.810 --> 00:54:13.250
<v Speaker 1>is it's primarily

00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:13.890
<v Speaker 1>PowerShell,

00:54:14.244 --> 00:54:17.445
<v Speaker 1>and I don't understand PowerShell. That is madness.

00:54:17.525 --> 00:54:19.445
<v Speaker 1>It is it is so weird.

00:54:19.765 --> 00:54:21.925
<v Speaker 1>I've tried. One day, maybe I'll learn it,

00:54:21.925 --> 00:54:24.244
<v Speaker 1>but I just don't care to or whatever.

00:54:24.244 --> 00:54:25.765
<v Speaker 1>So that's what kinda sucks is if you

00:54:25.765 --> 00:54:27.845
<v Speaker 1>wanna automate, you have to use PowerShell.

00:54:28.325 --> 00:54:29.445
<v Speaker 1>Hayden, were you gonna say something?

00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:30.780
<v Speaker 2>So

00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:32.220
<v Speaker 2>UniGet is great,

00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:34.940
<v Speaker 2>and it's awesome that it pulls from the

00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:38.380
<v Speaker 2>various package managers available for Windows. But, yes,

00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:40.060
<v Speaker 2>you're bringing up Dev Home.

00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:42.540
<v Speaker 2>And Dev Home is

00:54:42.975 --> 00:54:46.735
<v Speaker 2>building out its ability to import configuration files.

00:54:46.735 --> 00:54:47.455
<v Speaker 2>They use

00:54:48.015 --> 00:54:50.895
<v Speaker 2>a methodology called desired state configuration,

00:54:50.895 --> 00:54:52.175
<v Speaker 2>DSC files.

00:54:53.135 --> 00:54:54.255
<v Speaker 2>And these are

00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:58.380
<v Speaker 2>now integrated with Winget and allow you to,

00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:01.660
<v Speaker 2>basically, not only do what UniGet does,

00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:02.220
<v Speaker 2>but

00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:04.700
<v Speaker 2>you'll be able to go even further and,

00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:08.300
<v Speaker 2>like, preset window settings and, like Yeah. Automatic

00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:10.380
<v Speaker 2>auto automatically set it. What what is that

00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:10.620
<v Speaker 0>form?

00:55:11.635 --> 00:55:12.355
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:55:12.595 --> 00:55:13.795
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Do you want me to take that

00:55:13.795 --> 00:55:15.795
<v Speaker 2>one? Yeah. Go for it. Try to explain

00:55:15.795 --> 00:55:16.675
<v Speaker 1>Dev Home.

00:55:17.075 --> 00:55:18.675
<v Speaker 2>Dev Home is a

00:55:20.195 --> 00:55:22.595
<v Speaker 2>all in one tool for getting started

00:55:22.755 --> 00:55:24.035
<v Speaker 2>developing on Windows.

00:55:24.369 --> 00:55:26.849
<v Speaker 2>It's from the same team that built WSL,

00:55:26.849 --> 00:55:28.530
<v Speaker 2>terminal, PowerToys.

00:55:29.330 --> 00:55:31.730
<v Speaker 2>It lets you monitor it gives you a

00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:33.650
<v Speaker 2>dashboard for your GitHub repos,

00:55:33.810 --> 00:55:35.570
<v Speaker 2>gives you resource utilization,

00:55:37.075 --> 00:55:40.275
<v Speaker 2>allows you to create these machine configuration files,

00:55:41.155 --> 00:55:43.315
<v Speaker 2>allows you to there's a currently a feature

00:55:43.315 --> 00:55:46.515
<v Speaker 2>in beta that allows you to define

00:55:46.915 --> 00:55:48.915
<v Speaker 2>dev environment with natural language,

00:55:49.635 --> 00:55:50.195
<v Speaker 2>using

00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:53.060
<v Speaker 2>open API key.

00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:54.820
<v Speaker 2>So you can actually go ahead and say,

00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:56.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna build, you know,

00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:59.860
<v Speaker 2>this node app with this and this,

00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:02.420
<v Speaker 2>and it will spin up a Docker container

00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:03.460
<v Speaker 2>with everything

00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:04.580
<v Speaker 2>preinstalled

00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:05.540
<v Speaker 2>ready to go for you.

00:56:06.635 --> 00:56:09.755
<v Speaker 2>It also has they've also migrated a number

00:56:09.755 --> 00:56:10.395
<v Speaker 2>of

00:56:11.435 --> 00:56:13.195
<v Speaker 2>tools that used to just be in power

00:56:13.195 --> 00:56:14.795
<v Speaker 2>tools over

00:56:15.115 --> 00:56:16.955
<v Speaker 2>into Dev Home. So they're now

00:56:18.075 --> 00:56:20.315
<v Speaker 2>basically

00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:19.920
<v Speaker 2>preinstalled

00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:21.040
<v Speaker 2>on Windows

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:22.640
<v Speaker 2>through Dev Home.

00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.640
<v Speaker 1>So so this,

00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:26.880
<v Speaker 1>what people don't realize is, like, there's this

00:56:27.119 --> 00:56:30.240
<v Speaker 1>within Windows, there's, like there apparently seems to

00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:31.920
<v Speaker 1>be a group of developers or whatever who

00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:33.599
<v Speaker 1>kinda, like, drank the Linux Kool Aid or

00:56:33.599 --> 00:56:35.975
<v Speaker 1>whatever. It's, like, all of the cool things

00:56:35.975 --> 00:56:37.735
<v Speaker 1>that we've been doing in Linux of, like,

00:56:37.735 --> 00:56:40.295
<v Speaker 1>declarative management of setting up our machines and

00:56:40.295 --> 00:56:43.255
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that, they're they're supporting they're they're

00:56:43.255 --> 00:56:45.095
<v Speaker 1>bringing it all over to Windows,

00:56:45.415 --> 00:56:47.255
<v Speaker 1>but it's, like, it's going at the pay

00:56:47.415 --> 00:56:49.335
<v Speaker 1>like, it's like, Dev Home, when they first

00:56:49.335 --> 00:56:50.375
<v Speaker 1>announced it, was, like,

00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:52.880
<v Speaker 1>was very underwhelming,

00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:55.119
<v Speaker 1>and it's slowly getting better. And I expect

00:56:55.119 --> 00:56:56.720
<v Speaker 1>to know because, like, the problem I have

00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:57.920
<v Speaker 1>with Dev Home, the reason why I haven't

00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:00.319
<v Speaker 1>got into it is, like because I'm I'm

00:57:00.319 --> 00:57:01.920
<v Speaker 1>a super lazy person, and I and I

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:04.160
<v Speaker 1>definitely don't wanna spend, like, a significant amount

00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:06.445
<v Speaker 1>of time trying to learn, like, Windows specific

00:57:06.445 --> 00:57:07.005
<v Speaker 1>things.

00:57:07.325 --> 00:57:09.244
<v Speaker 1>So the cool thing about that I liked

00:57:09.244 --> 00:57:11.244
<v Speaker 1>about UniGet was that, like, I can click

00:57:11.244 --> 00:57:13.165
<v Speaker 1>and install packages, and then it backs up

00:57:13.165 --> 00:57:14.525
<v Speaker 1>and restores the state.

00:57:14.845 --> 00:57:17.165
<v Speaker 1>Whereas right now in Dev Home,

00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:19.260
<v Speaker 1>the machine configuration

00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:20.540
<v Speaker 1>is

00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:23.580
<v Speaker 1>you've gotta learn this DSC thing,

00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:25.900
<v Speaker 1>and I have yet to figure this out.

00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:28.700
<v Speaker 1>Like, I like, you know, feedback for the

00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Windows people or whatever is, like

00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:31.820
<v Speaker 1>like, the

00:57:32.424 --> 00:57:35.385
<v Speaker 1>it seems like, I don't understand. Like, maybe

00:57:35.385 --> 00:57:37.305
<v Speaker 1>if you come from a Windows background, these

00:57:37.305 --> 00:57:39.625
<v Speaker 1>YAML files make sense to you or whatever,

00:57:39.865 --> 00:57:40.905
<v Speaker 1>but they don't

00:57:41.065 --> 00:57:41.785
<v Speaker 1>to me.

00:57:42.105 --> 00:57:43.464
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't know how to, like,

00:57:43.464 --> 00:57:45.704
<v Speaker 1>just type and create one, and then there's

00:57:45.704 --> 00:57:48.720
<v Speaker 1>no tooling to create or manage them. So

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:50.560
<v Speaker 1>then it like, it's, like, a significant amount

00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:52.560
<v Speaker 1>of effort of trying to do this

00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:55.040
<v Speaker 1>this YAML based approach.

00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:56.720
<v Speaker 1>But, anyways but it but it is but

00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:58.160
<v Speaker 1>it is there or whatever. So it's like

00:57:58.320 --> 00:57:59.520
<v Speaker 1>this is kinda like the

00:57:59.964 --> 00:58:02.444
<v Speaker 1>the thing you know, it's like they're doing

00:58:02.444 --> 00:58:03.885
<v Speaker 1>surprisingly good things,

00:58:04.765 --> 00:58:07.085
<v Speaker 1>the the Windows team,

00:58:07.325 --> 00:58:08.605
<v Speaker 1>to do that. So it's like you could

00:58:08.605 --> 00:58:09.965
<v Speaker 1>do it. But, like

00:58:10.605 --> 00:58:12.045
<v Speaker 0>but, Hayden, but things that, like because things

00:58:12.045 --> 00:58:14.130
<v Speaker 0>that do drive me nuts is, like, when

00:58:14.130 --> 00:58:16.130
<v Speaker 1>I log in like, if I create a

00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:19.010
<v Speaker 1>new Windows machine, it's like, I've gotta reconfigure

00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:20.690
<v Speaker 1>the taskbar to be the way I want

00:58:20.690 --> 00:58:23.329
<v Speaker 1>it to. There's there's, like, a handful of

00:58:23.329 --> 00:58:25.170
<v Speaker 1>settings that I I I'll click around and

00:58:25.170 --> 00:58:27.010
<v Speaker 1>and I'll I'll tweak. Like, not a huge

00:58:27.010 --> 00:58:29.010
<v Speaker 1>amount of them. So it's like, it's not

00:58:28.485 --> 00:58:29.685
<v Speaker 1>that big of a deal because I could

00:58:29.685 --> 00:58:30.885
<v Speaker 1>do it really quickly. It's like, I know

00:58:30.885 --> 00:58:32.245
<v Speaker 1>I want this, this, and this.

00:58:32.965 --> 00:58:34.805
<v Speaker 1>But it's like, will it even manage those

00:58:34.805 --> 00:58:35.525
<v Speaker 1>things,

00:58:35.845 --> 00:58:37.445
<v Speaker 1>like taskbar settings and

00:58:38.965 --> 00:58:40.165
<v Speaker 2>It's it's getting there.

00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:43.500
<v Speaker 2>You know, the thing the interesting thing about

00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:45.740
<v Speaker 2>the team that that built WSL,

00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:46.700
<v Speaker 2>PowerToys,

00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:49.900
<v Speaker 2>Dev Home, Pseudo for Windows is that they're

00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:53.260
<v Speaker 2>most of these projects are fully open source,

00:58:53.575 --> 00:58:55.655
<v Speaker 2>and they're heavily community driven.

00:58:55.895 --> 00:58:56.375
<v Speaker 2>So

00:58:57.495 --> 00:58:59.815
<v Speaker 2>a lot most of the PowerToys

00:58:59.815 --> 00:59:01.335
<v Speaker 2>have come from the community

00:59:02.775 --> 00:59:03.575
<v Speaker 2>and

00:59:03.895 --> 00:59:06.615
<v Speaker 2>get promoted and then included in PowerToys.

00:59:06.775 --> 00:59:07.255
<v Speaker 2>And

00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:10.510
<v Speaker 2>feedback on things like are

00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:12.190
<v Speaker 2>pushing it along

00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:13.869
<v Speaker 2>quickly.

00:59:13.869 --> 00:59:17.070
<v Speaker 2>So, like, the ability to more easily create

00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:20.270
<v Speaker 2>DSD files from your current install,

00:59:20.855 --> 00:59:23.414
<v Speaker 2>that they've heard that feedback, and that's that's

00:59:23.414 --> 00:59:25.175
<v Speaker 2>being worked on. So

00:59:26.055 --> 00:59:28.214
<v Speaker 2>it you know, when these things first, like,

00:59:28.214 --> 00:59:30.375
<v Speaker 2>get announced at build, you know, you see

00:59:30.375 --> 00:59:31.494
<v Speaker 2>the first draft,

00:59:32.295 --> 00:59:33.095
<v Speaker 2>but they're really

00:59:34.210 --> 00:59:35.810
<v Speaker 2>building in the open

00:59:36.050 --> 00:59:37.570
<v Speaker 2>in contrast with,

00:59:38.370 --> 00:59:40.290
<v Speaker 2>you know, where Microsoft would spend a lot

00:59:40.290 --> 00:59:42.450
<v Speaker 2>of time and then announce it and then

00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:44.210
<v Speaker 2>say this is just it,

00:59:45.090 --> 00:59:45.650
<v Speaker 2>particularly

00:59:45.890 --> 00:59:46.770
<v Speaker 2>this team

00:59:47.490 --> 00:59:48.370
<v Speaker 2>at Microsoft.

00:59:49.595 --> 00:59:51.515
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Like, what I'm surprised

00:59:51.515 --> 00:59:53.755
<v Speaker 1>with Microsoft is, like, the weird thing is,

00:59:53.755 --> 00:59:55.674
<v Speaker 1>like, when I started in Linux, it was

00:59:55.674 --> 00:59:57.755
<v Speaker 1>like Microsoft was the devil. Like, you hated

00:59:57.755 --> 01:00:00.635
<v Speaker 1>Microsoft. Right? Like, they were anti open source.

01:00:00.635 --> 01:00:02.795
<v Speaker 1>They were and, like and that that that

01:00:02.795 --> 01:00:04.714
<v Speaker 1>opinion has basically stuck with a lot of

01:00:04.714 --> 01:00:06.770
<v Speaker 1>Linux people, which is like but, like, the

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:08.770
<v Speaker 1>weird thing is, like, in these days, if

01:00:08.770 --> 01:00:10.130
<v Speaker 1>you look at the companies,

01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:12.850
<v Speaker 1>Microsoft is actually the biggest,

01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:16.050
<v Speaker 1>like, contri like, they're the most

01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:19.170
<v Speaker 1>most embracing open source,

01:00:19.965 --> 01:00:21.805
<v Speaker 1>I think, of any of the companies, like,

01:00:21.805 --> 01:00:23.965
<v Speaker 1>going forward. Like, Google had a good run

01:00:23.965 --> 01:00:25.885
<v Speaker 1>where they were, like, really big into open

01:00:25.885 --> 01:00:26.445
<v Speaker 1>source,

01:00:26.765 --> 01:00:27.565
<v Speaker 1>but I don't

01:00:28.045 --> 01:00:30.365
<v Speaker 1>didn't seem like it financially really worked out

01:00:30.365 --> 01:00:31.645
<v Speaker 1>with them that it seems like the tides

01:00:31.645 --> 01:00:32.365
<v Speaker 1>are changing there.

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:36.180
<v Speaker 1>But, like, Microsoft is, like, all in because,

01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:38.740
<v Speaker 1>like, I'm surprised at things where it's like

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:40.820
<v Speaker 1>for example, like, they're they're like, you know,

01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:43.220
<v Speaker 1>it took Microsoft apparently a couple decades to

01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:44.740
<v Speaker 1>have a decent terminal, but they have a

01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:46.980
<v Speaker 1>decent terminal now. That's what I was showing

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:47.220
<v Speaker 1>here.

01:00:48.585 --> 01:00:49.705
<v Speaker 1>But it's like things like

01:00:50.345 --> 01:00:52.905
<v Speaker 1>I I believe, like, terminal is completely open

01:00:52.905 --> 01:00:53.545
<v Speaker 1>source.

01:00:53.865 --> 01:00:56.185
<v Speaker 2>It is. So is sudo. So is power

01:00:56.185 --> 01:00:56.825
<v Speaker 2>toys.

01:00:57.065 --> 01:00:58.745
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It it's like all

01:00:59.305 --> 01:01:01.224
<v Speaker 1>of the new stuff that they're doing that

01:01:01.224 --> 01:01:03.470
<v Speaker 1>I seem to care about is open source,

01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:04.350
<v Speaker 1>which I love,

01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:07.470
<v Speaker 1>because I can't stand it if I can't,

01:01:07.470 --> 01:01:09.950
<v Speaker 1>like, you know, dig in and figure out

01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:11.790
<v Speaker 1>how things work or whatever. But

01:01:12.109 --> 01:01:14.190
<v Speaker 1>but yeah. But, I mean, Microsoft

01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:16.109
<v Speaker 1>just has, this unfortunately,

01:01:16.109 --> 01:01:17.230
<v Speaker 1>they have to deal with their

01:01:18.125 --> 01:01:19.085
<v Speaker 1>legacy

01:01:20.125 --> 01:01:22.845
<v Speaker 1>of of, you know, some maybe some bad

01:01:22.845 --> 01:01:25.565
<v Speaker 1>things or people not liking them or whatever.

01:01:26.444 --> 01:01:27.085
<v Speaker 1>So

01:01:27.724 --> 01:01:30.440
<v Speaker 2>Yep. And it not just on the, like,

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:31.800
<v Speaker 2>Windows dev experience

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:34.760
<v Speaker 2>either, but also in the AI space.

01:01:36.119 --> 01:01:38.200
<v Speaker 2>Microsoft is constantly releasing

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:40.599
<v Speaker 2>new AI tools. I know you have some

01:01:40.599 --> 01:01:42.519
<v Speaker 2>gripes about it, but things like the Onyx

01:01:42.519 --> 01:01:43.079
<v Speaker 2>runtime

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:45.695
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand the ONNX. But yeah. I

01:01:45.935 --> 01:01:47.615
<v Speaker 1>but, like, the yeah. Oh.

01:01:49.295 --> 01:01:50.895
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I think we lost him.

01:01:51.375 --> 01:01:51.935
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:01:52.655 --> 01:01:55.775
<v Speaker 1>He's at he's at Vienna right now. People

01:01:56.655 --> 01:01:57.055
<v Speaker 1>watching.

01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:59.590
<v Speaker 1>But, like, I this doesn't need to be,

01:01:59.590 --> 01:02:01.430
<v Speaker 1>like, a a like, we're I'm not trying

01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:04.150
<v Speaker 1>to sell everyone on Windows or whatever. But,

01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:07.350
<v Speaker 1>like but but it's, like, the the like,

01:02:07.350 --> 01:02:08.710
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to do this of, like, show

01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:10.790
<v Speaker 1>how I'm using Windows and and try to

01:02:10.790 --> 01:02:12.310
<v Speaker 1>not lose my Linux street cred.

01:02:13.235 --> 01:02:15.315
<v Speaker 1>Like, trust me. I'm still a die but

01:02:15.315 --> 01:02:17.235
<v Speaker 1>it but it's been an interesting experience for

01:02:17.235 --> 01:02:17.715
<v Speaker 1>me.

01:02:18.275 --> 01:02:20.675
<v Speaker 0>And you I think it's I think it's

01:02:20.675 --> 01:02:22.755
<v Speaker 0>just really interesting to see that workflow and

01:02:22.755 --> 01:02:23.955
<v Speaker 0>how it works because,

01:02:24.355 --> 01:02:25.395
<v Speaker 0>like I said, there are a lot of

01:02:25.395 --> 01:02:26.915
<v Speaker 0>paper cuts on Windows. Like, right now,

01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:29.230
<v Speaker 0>I'm 95%

01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:30.910
<v Speaker 0>running everything on Wayland,

01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:32.910
<v Speaker 0>but then there's always that random x 11

01:02:32.910 --> 01:02:35.310
<v Speaker 0>application that has to run through x Wayland.

01:02:35.549 --> 01:02:37.869
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. And that it looks weird. The scaling's

01:02:37.869 --> 01:02:38.510
<v Speaker 0>different.

01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:40.670
<v Speaker 0>And then there's even the fragmentation

01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:42.510
<v Speaker 0>between you know, I run

01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:45.365
<v Speaker 0>GNOME and GTK for most apps, but then

01:02:45.365 --> 01:02:47.285
<v Speaker 0>a random QT app pops up, and that

01:02:47.285 --> 01:02:48.725
<v Speaker 0>looks like dog shit too, and then I'm

01:02:48.725 --> 01:02:50.645
<v Speaker 0>fighting with that. And Oh, yeah. And I

01:02:50.885 --> 01:02:53.445
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just I I'm sorry. Like, I

01:02:53.445 --> 01:02:56.565
<v Speaker 1>I hate the UX design of GNOME apps.

01:02:56.725 --> 01:02:57.765
<v Speaker 1>I just cannot.

01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:01.020
<v Speaker 1>I think they are the most confusing. Like,

01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:03.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm a very like, I like, anyone who's

01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:06.140
<v Speaker 1>anyone who's worked with me on developing UIs

01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:07.740
<v Speaker 1>for, like, our programs or apps and stuff

01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:09.260
<v Speaker 1>like that knows how

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:11.500
<v Speaker 1>frustrated I get with UIs.

01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:13.285
<v Speaker 1>Where where it's just like, I open it

01:03:13.285 --> 01:03:15.045
<v Speaker 1>up, and it's illogical to me. And it's

01:03:15.045 --> 01:03:16.725
<v Speaker 1>like, why? Why in the world did you

01:03:16.725 --> 01:03:19.285
<v Speaker 1>put, like like, the way GNOME does their

01:03:19.285 --> 01:03:22.245
<v Speaker 1>UX is basically, like, they just randomly throw

01:03:22.245 --> 01:03:23.685
<v Speaker 1>icons in the top bar.

01:03:23.925 --> 01:03:26.099
<v Speaker 1>It's just like random icons in the top

01:03:26.099 --> 01:03:26.660
<v Speaker 1>bar,

01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:27.940
<v Speaker 1>no description,

01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:29.700
<v Speaker 1>don't know what they do. We have no

01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:30.900
<v Speaker 1>idea why in the world they're in the

01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:31.619
<v Speaker 1>top bar,

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:34.500
<v Speaker 1>but they're they're just there. But, anyways

01:03:37.245 --> 01:03:38.205
<v Speaker 1>But, like,

01:03:38.605 --> 01:03:40.445
<v Speaker 1>Weyland Weyland is one of those things that

01:03:40.445 --> 01:03:42.525
<v Speaker 1>irritates me too is is the fact that,

01:03:42.525 --> 01:03:44.685
<v Speaker 1>like, every time I try to use Weyland,

01:03:44.685 --> 01:03:45.725
<v Speaker 1>I run into issues.

01:03:45.965 --> 01:03:47.005
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,

01:03:47.245 --> 01:03:50.125
<v Speaker 1>you know, it's like, probably in another, like,

01:03:50.125 --> 01:03:53.250
<v Speaker 1>five years, it will they've we'll finally ironed

01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:55.170
<v Speaker 1>out everything. Like, I I think we're finally

01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:56.690
<v Speaker 1>getting there. But you but you realize, has

01:03:56.690 --> 01:03:58.130
<v Speaker 1>been in development for

01:03:58.610 --> 01:04:00.370
<v Speaker 1>over ten years, I think.

01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:02.130
<v Speaker 1>So it's like Yeah.

01:04:02.370 --> 01:04:03.730
<v Speaker 1>So so this is what you have to

01:04:03.730 --> 01:04:05.410
<v Speaker 1>get like, with Linux is, like, you gotta

01:04:05.410 --> 01:04:06.865
<v Speaker 1>be in it for the long haul because

01:04:06.865 --> 01:04:07.665
<v Speaker 1>it's, like,

01:04:08.305 --> 01:04:09.905
<v Speaker 1>you know, it's it's not gonna be good

01:04:09.905 --> 01:04:11.185
<v Speaker 1>for a couple decades.

01:04:11.265 --> 01:04:13.265
<v Speaker 1>It's, like, it's literally how it's, like, it's

01:04:13.265 --> 01:04:15.025
<v Speaker 1>literally, like, a decade for because, like, Gnome

01:04:15.025 --> 01:04:17.825
<v Speaker 1>three, for example, was it was like, they

01:04:17.825 --> 01:04:20.305
<v Speaker 1>started it, and it took about ten years

01:04:20.305 --> 01:04:22.170
<v Speaker 1>for it to get back to the same

01:04:22.170 --> 01:04:24.250
<v Speaker 1>level as GNOME two in terms functionality.

01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:26.170
<v Speaker 1>And now within the last couple of years,

01:04:26.170 --> 01:04:28.490
<v Speaker 1>like, GNOME three is actually really quite good.

01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:30.330
<v Speaker 1>Like, it's really taken off in the last

01:04:30.330 --> 01:04:31.690
<v Speaker 1>couple of years. There was some point in,

01:04:31.690 --> 01:04:33.210
<v Speaker 1>like, Fedora 38.

01:04:33.210 --> 01:04:35.154
<v Speaker 1>I I can't remember which version. There's there's

01:04:35.154 --> 01:04:37.234
<v Speaker 1>one version where it was very specifically, like,

01:04:37.234 --> 01:04:38.835
<v Speaker 1>where it's like, oh, wow. Like, gnome has

01:04:38.835 --> 01:04:40.355
<v Speaker 1>really gotten a lot better.

01:04:41.555 --> 01:04:44.674
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I mean, I'm I I definitely think

01:04:44.674 --> 01:04:46.755
<v Speaker 0>gnome three is the way forward. KDE is

01:04:46.755 --> 01:04:48.194
<v Speaker 0>really nice. I actually like what the dumbest

01:04:48.194 --> 01:04:51.130
<v Speaker 0>version of plasma, but it's too for

01:04:51.130 --> 01:04:53.370
<v Speaker 0>me. And I like I actually like gnomes

01:04:53.370 --> 01:04:55.290
<v Speaker 0>UX with the buttons and the the the

01:04:55.290 --> 01:04:57.690
<v Speaker 0>CSD and stuff like that. Yeah. But

01:04:58.490 --> 01:05:00.330
<v Speaker 0>I'm I'm putting a lot of hope in

01:05:00.330 --> 01:05:03.210
<v Speaker 0>Cosmic right now. I'm really excited to see

01:05:03.210 --> 01:05:05.805
<v Speaker 0>what they bring out. And but is still

01:05:05.805 --> 01:05:08.125
<v Speaker 0>a huge pain point because,

01:05:09.005 --> 01:05:11.085
<v Speaker 0>you know, as Flatpak takes like, Flatpak is

01:05:11.085 --> 01:05:12.845
<v Speaker 0>secure. It is great. Is secure. It is

01:05:12.845 --> 01:05:14.525
<v Speaker 0>great. But getting the two to work together,

01:05:14.525 --> 01:05:16.445
<v Speaker 0>like, you can't have the one password desktop

01:05:16.445 --> 01:05:17.165
<v Speaker 0>speak

01:05:17.790 --> 01:05:20.110
<v Speaker 0>speak to the the CLI process when it

01:05:20.110 --> 01:05:21.790
<v Speaker 0>runs on because of all the sandbox, and

01:05:21.790 --> 01:05:23.310
<v Speaker 0>then they have to build all these different

01:05:23.310 --> 01:05:25.230
<v Speaker 0>portals. But those are coming out. It takes

01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:27.390
<v Speaker 0>five years per portal if you look at

01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:29.150
<v Speaker 0>all the issues that are open. Yeah. Yeah.

01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:30.350
<v Speaker 0>Progress is so slow.

01:05:31.475 --> 01:05:33.235
<v Speaker 1>So the the thing is because, yes, sir.

01:05:33.235 --> 01:05:35.475
<v Speaker 1>Like, the problem with kinda, like, Linux community

01:05:35.475 --> 01:05:37.475
<v Speaker 1>open source driven things is that, like,

01:05:37.875 --> 01:05:40.755
<v Speaker 1>you know, open source is it's volunteers. Like,

01:05:40.835 --> 01:05:42.995
<v Speaker 1>a real community of you know, so volunteers

01:05:42.995 --> 01:05:44.835
<v Speaker 1>are gonna work on fun shiny things. They

01:05:44.835 --> 01:05:46.915
<v Speaker 1>don't work on, like, the annoying little bugs.

01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:49.870
<v Speaker 1>So it's like that's it's like you kinda

01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:52.510
<v Speaker 1>have to have, like, a corporate

01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:55.390
<v Speaker 1>like, a paid person to then squash all

01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:57.470
<v Speaker 1>those little bugs. And so it's like that's

01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:59.550
<v Speaker 1>why you like, you know, it's like Canonical

01:05:59.550 --> 01:06:01.630
<v Speaker 1>did a decent job with, like, their thousand

01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:03.845
<v Speaker 1>paper cuts project and stuff like that of

01:06:03.845 --> 01:06:05.685
<v Speaker 1>squashing all the little annoying things.

01:06:05.845 --> 01:06:09.125
<v Speaker 1>So Cosmic, I think, has a decent chance

01:06:09.125 --> 01:06:11.525
<v Speaker 1>of becoming good because there is a financial

01:06:11.525 --> 01:06:13.525
<v Speaker 1>incentive for them to squash all those bugs.

01:06:13.525 --> 01:06:16.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like to actually, like, pay developers and

01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:18.140
<v Speaker 1>fix all those annoying little things that that

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:19.740
<v Speaker 1>drive people nuts because they need to sell

01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:20.460
<v Speaker 1>hardware.

01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:22.300
<v Speaker 1>So it's like, I

01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:25.740
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of hope in Cosmic.

01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:28.700
<v Speaker 1>I unfortunately think they're making all the same

01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:29.900
<v Speaker 1>mistakes that most

01:06:30.875 --> 01:06:31.675
<v Speaker 1>engineers

01:06:31.675 --> 01:06:33.275
<v Speaker 1>have done in this space,

01:06:33.835 --> 01:06:35.115
<v Speaker 1>which is basically,

01:06:36.875 --> 01:06:38.395
<v Speaker 1>you know, rewriting

01:06:38.555 --> 01:06:40.635
<v Speaker 1>things that don't need to be rewritten,

01:06:41.115 --> 01:06:42.954
<v Speaker 1>like, taking on too much. They're, like, they're

01:06:42.954 --> 01:06:44.954
<v Speaker 1>taking on so much that it scares me

01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:47.820
<v Speaker 1>that I don't understand how they're gonna succeed

01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:48.700
<v Speaker 1>because, like

01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:52.460
<v Speaker 1>yeah. You you start to realize, like,

01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:56.620
<v Speaker 1>the amount of stuff they

01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:59.275
<v Speaker 1>they need to, like, by going this route

01:06:59.275 --> 01:07:00.955
<v Speaker 1>of, like, having their own high like, their

01:07:00.955 --> 01:07:02.795
<v Speaker 1>own text editor, their own terminal, their own

01:07:02.795 --> 01:07:04.715
<v Speaker 1>whatever. It's a lot of work. It's like

01:07:04.875 --> 01:07:07.115
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. But that I think the reason they're

01:07:07.115 --> 01:07:09.515
<v Speaker 0>doing that, though, is that I just complained

01:07:09.515 --> 01:07:11.835
<v Speaker 0>about how I run GNOME and QT apps

01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:13.180
<v Speaker 0>annoy me. And they've probably came to the

01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:15.740
<v Speaker 0>same conclusion because Cosmic doesn't use GTK or

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:17.420
<v Speaker 0>QT. They built their own

01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:19.980
<v Speaker 0>entire UI rendering

01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:22.060
<v Speaker 0>layer. Yeah. But now they're built on other

01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:22.860
<v Speaker 0>applications

01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:24.860
<v Speaker 0>to use that layer, and it's

01:07:25.135 --> 01:07:27.535
<v Speaker 1>So so this is so, you know, I

01:07:27.535 --> 01:07:29.215
<v Speaker 1>mean, I'll see how it it it turns

01:07:29.215 --> 01:07:31.695
<v Speaker 1>out because, like, basically, this is so

01:07:32.095 --> 01:07:34.655
<v Speaker 1>I like, because Canonical did the same thing

01:07:34.655 --> 01:07:36.255
<v Speaker 1>where there was, like, they're basically kind of

01:07:36.255 --> 01:07:38.015
<v Speaker 1>like, screw the community. We're gonna build our

01:07:38.015 --> 01:07:38.655
<v Speaker 1>own technology.

01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Like, the thing that's weird is, like, the

01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:43.380
<v Speaker 1>community seems to be much more accepting of

01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:45.220
<v Speaker 1>the way System seventy six is going about

01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:47.300
<v Speaker 1>this, whereas Canonical did it. It's probably just

01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:50.180
<v Speaker 1>personality and branding and whatnot. But so but

01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:51.700
<v Speaker 1>Canonical did basically the same thing where they're

01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:53.220
<v Speaker 1>like they're like, we're just gonna build our

01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:55.220
<v Speaker 1>own thing, and that's what, like, Unity was.

01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:57.035
<v Speaker 1>And they did Juju, and they've done a

01:07:57.035 --> 01:07:58.714
<v Speaker 1>lot of Snap, a lot of projects, but

01:07:58.714 --> 01:08:00.075
<v Speaker 1>they're just like, we're gonna do our own

01:08:00.075 --> 01:08:03.595
<v Speaker 1>thing. And so the problem that happens is

01:08:03.835 --> 01:08:05.515
<v Speaker 1>if you do your own thing

01:08:05.755 --> 01:08:07.595
<v Speaker 1>and you don't get the community on board,

01:08:07.970 --> 01:08:10.210
<v Speaker 1>the community is gonna end up destroying you.

01:08:10.210 --> 01:08:12.849
<v Speaker 1>Like, because they can always like, over a

01:08:12.849 --> 01:08:14.930
<v Speaker 1>decade or whatever, they'll continue to grow to

01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:17.170
<v Speaker 1>the point where it's like, now you're you've

01:08:17.170 --> 01:08:19.649
<v Speaker 1>you've fragmented or whatever. So, like so I

01:08:19.649 --> 01:08:21.095
<v Speaker 1>don't know what the like, I don't know

01:08:21.095 --> 01:08:23.255
<v Speaker 1>why they needed to change GTK, but I

01:08:23.255 --> 01:08:25.095
<v Speaker 1>do know on like, I can totally understand

01:08:25.095 --> 01:08:26.615
<v Speaker 1>Gnome Shell had a lot of issues. But

01:08:26.615 --> 01:08:28.854
<v Speaker 1>why GTK? Why the whole thing? Why a

01:08:28.854 --> 01:08:29.895
<v Speaker 1>text renderer?

01:08:30.375 --> 01:08:32.135
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. I mean, I'm sure there's

01:08:32.135 --> 01:08:33.895
<v Speaker 1>tech but but the problem is, like so

01:08:33.895 --> 01:08:35.655
<v Speaker 1>it's, I really hope because

01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:38.239
<v Speaker 1>System seventy six is the only company I

01:08:38.239 --> 01:08:40.479
<v Speaker 1>see in the Linux ecosystem that has any

01:08:40.479 --> 01:08:43.039
<v Speaker 1>chance of succeeding right now of, like, making

01:08:43.039 --> 01:08:44.319
<v Speaker 1>the desktop usable.

01:08:46.319 --> 01:08:46.879
<v Speaker 1>But,

01:08:47.359 --> 01:08:48.800
<v Speaker 1>like, they're they're doing all the same things

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:50.159
<v Speaker 1>that everyone's done in the past that have

01:08:50.159 --> 01:08:52.045
<v Speaker 1>kind of failed. So it's like, whatever. I

01:08:52.045 --> 01:08:53.404
<v Speaker 1>mean, maybe they'll finally be the one that

01:08:53.404 --> 01:08:55.724
<v Speaker 1>succeeds, and I really hope they do. I

01:08:55.724 --> 01:08:58.684
<v Speaker 1>really like the, you know, the current version

01:08:58.684 --> 01:09:01.324
<v Speaker 1>of PopOS. So if they can reproduce that

01:09:01.324 --> 01:09:01.965
<v Speaker 1>with Cosmic

01:09:02.764 --> 01:09:05.164
<v Speaker 1>but I've I've I tried Cosmic about every

01:09:05.490 --> 01:09:07.330
<v Speaker 1>couple weeks or whatever because, like, they made

01:09:07.330 --> 01:09:08.370
<v Speaker 1>it ridiculously

01:09:08.370 --> 01:09:10.850
<v Speaker 1>easy to compile and run.

01:09:12.370 --> 01:09:14.690
<v Speaker 1>And it's it's got a it's it's got

01:09:14.690 --> 01:09:16.370
<v Speaker 1>a lot of bugs. It's got a lot

01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:17.090
<v Speaker 1>of bugs.

01:09:17.490 --> 01:09:19.535
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I mean, it's still really early. I

01:09:19.535 --> 01:09:21.615
<v Speaker 0>mean, they only just added multi not multi

01:09:21.615 --> 01:09:24.015
<v Speaker 0>monitor support, but the monitors have different scaling

01:09:24.015 --> 01:09:25.375
<v Speaker 0>now, which I think is a really cool

01:09:25.375 --> 01:09:27.295
<v Speaker 0>addition because not everyone that buys the same

01:09:27.295 --> 01:09:29.055
<v Speaker 0>monitor twice if they have two or three

01:09:29.055 --> 01:09:29.535
<v Speaker 0>or whatever.

01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:32.460
<v Speaker 1>But but it's it's that typical engineer thing

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:33.740
<v Speaker 1>where it's like, oh, I'm gonna write this

01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:36.060
<v Speaker 1>software, and you do the first eighty percent,

01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:38.380
<v Speaker 1>and then you realize, like, the next 80%

01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:40.220
<v Speaker 1>is where you spend all your time. It's

01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:42.620
<v Speaker 1>like, you you can get the vast majority

01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:44.814
<v Speaker 1>of the features that are like, oh, yeah.

01:09:44.814 --> 01:09:46.895
<v Speaker 1>Look. It's almost done. And then that that

01:09:46.895 --> 01:09:49.534
<v Speaker 1>last bit of just ironing out all of

01:09:49.534 --> 01:09:51.054
<v Speaker 1>the issues and stuff is, like, what takes

01:09:51.054 --> 01:09:53.375
<v Speaker 1>a significant amount of time. And so they've

01:09:53.375 --> 01:09:55.534
<v Speaker 1>spread themselves really thin with the amount of

01:09:55.534 --> 01:09:58.255
<v Speaker 1>stuff where it's, like, the amount of like

01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:01.780
<v Speaker 1>like, you don't realize how much effort

01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:06.260
<v Speaker 1>like like, if you look at the the

01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:09.300
<v Speaker 1>like, the notes app in

01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:10.579
<v Speaker 1>macOS.

01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:13.135
<v Speaker 1>The notes app in in Mac OS is

01:10:13.135 --> 01:10:15.295
<v Speaker 1>amazing, the amount of functionality that's in there.

01:10:15.295 --> 01:10:17.695
<v Speaker 1>Like, try doing drawing on especially on your

01:10:17.695 --> 01:10:20.335
<v Speaker 1>phone or whatever. Like so you don't realize,

01:10:20.335 --> 01:10:22.255
<v Speaker 1>like, these, like, these bigger companies, the amount

01:10:22.255 --> 01:10:24.895
<v Speaker 1>of effort in engineering they put into these

01:10:24.895 --> 01:10:27.190
<v Speaker 1>dumb side things. Microsoft's a little different with

01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:29.190
<v Speaker 1>Notepad, but they have a whole replacement for

01:10:29.190 --> 01:10:31.110
<v Speaker 1>it that's coming very soon. Right? Like, aren't

01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:32.790
<v Speaker 1>they finally replacing Notepad?

01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:33.830
<v Speaker 1>But

01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:37.510
<v Speaker 1>it's like but but the amount of effort

01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:40.150
<v Speaker 1>they put into these these little things, it's,

01:10:40.150 --> 01:10:41.750
<v Speaker 1>like, significant. And so it's like, I just

01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:43.885
<v Speaker 1>I really think they've underestimated. But, hopefully, they

01:10:43.885 --> 01:10:45.165
<v Speaker 1>prove me wrong. I mean, I want them

01:10:45.165 --> 01:10:46.685
<v Speaker 1>to prove me wrong because, like, that was

01:10:46.685 --> 01:10:48.045
<v Speaker 1>what I was hoping on. And then I

01:10:48.765 --> 01:10:50.845
<v Speaker 1>once I started trying out the alpha build,

01:10:50.845 --> 01:10:52.365
<v Speaker 1>I got really disenchanted.

01:10:52.365 --> 01:10:54.285
<v Speaker 1>Just like, oh, crap. They've got a long

01:10:54.285 --> 01:10:54.765
<v Speaker 1>way to go.

01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:57.410
<v Speaker 1>You know? Yeah. I I mean, I think

01:10:57.410 --> 01:10:59.090
<v Speaker 0>it's gonna be amazing, but it is definitely

01:10:59.090 --> 01:11:00.050
<v Speaker 0>still early.

01:11:01.330 --> 01:11:03.730
<v Speaker 0>But they're rewriting it in Rust, which gets

01:11:03.730 --> 01:11:05.250
<v Speaker 0>them a lot of kudos too. Right? So

01:11:05.330 --> 01:11:06.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I I honestly

01:11:07.490 --> 01:11:09.490
<v Speaker 1>I always complain about Rust, and I'm like,

01:11:10.985 --> 01:11:13.625
<v Speaker 1>I I always, like, crap on Rust nonstop

01:11:13.625 --> 01:11:16.025
<v Speaker 1>on Twitter. But I think Rust is the

01:11:16.025 --> 01:11:18.745
<v Speaker 1>perfect replacement for the Linux user space of,

01:11:18.745 --> 01:11:20.905
<v Speaker 1>like, we have all of this legacy

01:11:20.905 --> 01:11:22.585
<v Speaker 1>GNU style c code,

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:25.480
<v Speaker 1>which, you know, I don't think a modern

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:27.560
<v Speaker 1>engine like, you have to be a very

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:29.960
<v Speaker 1>unique individual if you like that style and

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:32.600
<v Speaker 1>you wanna maintain that. Like so it's like,

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:33.719
<v Speaker 1>I'm all for

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:36.455
<v Speaker 1>bringing in kind of, like, new blood or

01:11:36.455 --> 01:11:38.455
<v Speaker 1>whatever and just rewrite the whole Linux user

01:11:38.455 --> 01:11:40.375
<v Speaker 1>space in Rust. It's a perfect fit

01:11:40.695 --> 01:11:41.495
<v Speaker 1>because

01:11:41.495 --> 01:11:44.215
<v Speaker 1>no other language is really a good switch

01:11:44.215 --> 01:11:44.855
<v Speaker 1>from

01:11:45.015 --> 01:11:46.855
<v Speaker 1>all this code that really kinda needs to

01:11:46.855 --> 01:11:48.295
<v Speaker 1>be c or c plus plus or whatever.

01:11:48.295 --> 01:11:49.495
<v Speaker 1>It's like, you can't do it in Go.

01:11:49.495 --> 01:11:51.110
<v Speaker 1>It just isn't it's not the right, you

01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:53.670
<v Speaker 1>know. So, Rust, I'm I'm actually all for

01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:55.750
<v Speaker 1>everyone doing all this this this stuff in

01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Rust. So I'm I'm like, I I love

01:11:57.670 --> 01:11:59.590
<v Speaker 1>all the the stuff that's

01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:02.230
<v Speaker 1>that people have been doing. I think you've

01:12:02.230 --> 01:12:04.150
<v Speaker 0>angered a few people by saying that System

01:12:04.150 --> 01:12:06.395
<v Speaker 0>seventy six is the only I can't remember

01:12:06.395 --> 01:12:08.075
<v Speaker 0>what your phrase was, but the only company

01:12:08.075 --> 01:12:10.235
<v Speaker 0>that stands a chance. Well, who

01:12:11.114 --> 01:12:13.515
<v Speaker 0>sat in the So Alan says that Canonical's

01:12:13.515 --> 01:12:15.755
<v Speaker 0>at their biggest head count they've ever been.

01:12:16.075 --> 01:12:16.875
<v Speaker 0>Oh, okay. Okay.

01:12:19.610 --> 01:12:22.090
<v Speaker 2>Let me let me let me defend here.

01:12:22.090 --> 01:12:22.730
<v Speaker 2>And and

01:12:23.210 --> 01:12:23.690
<v Speaker 2>so

01:12:24.330 --> 01:12:26.410
<v Speaker 2>I I think his point

01:12:26.890 --> 01:12:29.929
<v Speaker 2>was in response to, you know, the one,

01:12:30.170 --> 01:12:33.225
<v Speaker 2>Linux is just volunteers because Oh. Oh. Yeah.

01:12:33.304 --> 01:12:34.665
<v Speaker 2>Companies like Canonical,

01:12:34.665 --> 01:12:35.624
<v Speaker 2>Red Hat,

01:12:35.945 --> 01:12:36.744
<v Speaker 2>SUSE,

01:12:37.545 --> 01:12:39.624
<v Speaker 2>you know, they're investing a lot in,

01:12:39.785 --> 01:12:42.425
<v Speaker 2>you know, upstream things, system d,

01:12:42.665 --> 01:12:43.465
<v Speaker 2>GNOME,

01:12:43.545 --> 01:12:45.739
<v Speaker 2>the user experience. I mean, when I was

01:12:45.739 --> 01:12:48.380
<v Speaker 2>at Canonical and even after then, there was

01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:50.380
<v Speaker 2>an engineer who did a lot of work

01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:51.659
<v Speaker 2>upstream in Gnome

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:53.340
<v Speaker 2>to improve performance

01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:56.539
<v Speaker 2>and and squash bugs there.

01:12:57.660 --> 01:12:59.260
<v Speaker 2>So that was his first point that that

01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:00.219
<v Speaker 2>it's all volunteers.

01:13:00.795 --> 01:13:03.755
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. And then Sure. Yeah. I mean, I

01:13:03.755 --> 01:13:04.715
<v Speaker 2>think it's a

01:13:05.195 --> 01:13:06.475
<v Speaker 2>interesting sustainability

01:13:06.475 --> 01:13:10.395
<v Speaker 2>question about whether or not 10 ish engineers

01:13:11.355 --> 01:13:11.995
<v Speaker 2>like,

01:13:12.155 --> 01:13:14.715
<v Speaker 2>should we should we generally follow

01:13:15.195 --> 01:13:17.010
<v Speaker 2>what Canonical,

01:13:17.170 --> 01:13:20.610
<v Speaker 2>Red Hat, SUSE, and others are investing in

01:13:20.770 --> 01:13:22.850
<v Speaker 2>GNOME kind of in that direction,

01:13:23.250 --> 01:13:25.570
<v Speaker 2>or should a small team break out and

01:13:25.570 --> 01:13:27.090
<v Speaker 2>and do their own thing?

01:13:27.810 --> 01:13:30.155
<v Speaker 2>And he he adds that he loves their

01:13:30.635 --> 01:13:32.795
<v Speaker 2>that they're innovating on the desktop, but it's

01:13:32.795 --> 01:13:33.995
<v Speaker 2>an interesting sustainability

01:13:33.995 --> 01:13:36.395
<v Speaker 2>question in the long term. Yeah. And and

01:13:36.395 --> 01:13:37.835
<v Speaker 1>and I think that because

01:13:38.795 --> 01:13:39.434
<v Speaker 1>I

01:13:39.995 --> 01:13:40.715
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. Like,

01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:44.020
<v Speaker 1>canonicals like, I don't understand canonicals,

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:44.500
<v Speaker 1>like,

01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:46.980
<v Speaker 1>what's going on with the with the desktop

01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:48.340
<v Speaker 1>there because it's like,

01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:51.940
<v Speaker 1>they scaled back significantly

01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:53.060
<v Speaker 1>in terms of, like

01:13:54.825 --> 01:13:56.185
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. So, I mean, it it

01:13:56.265 --> 01:13:59.065
<v Speaker 1>Alan does Alan work for for for

01:13:59.545 --> 01:14:00.745
<v Speaker 1>for Canonical?

01:14:00.985 --> 01:14:02.825
<v Speaker 0>I think he used to. Previously did. We

01:14:02.825 --> 01:14:04.745
<v Speaker 2>worked together. Oh, no. You used to work

01:14:04.745 --> 01:14:06.025
<v Speaker 1>for him or whatever. Where it's like

01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:08.780
<v Speaker 1>you know, it's kind of like they they

01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:11.100
<v Speaker 1>they're no longer, like, leading because I don't

01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:12.219
<v Speaker 1>like, because

01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:14.780
<v Speaker 1>Ubuntu is no longer

01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:19.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't I don't really it's like Ubuntu

01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:21.820
<v Speaker 1>still has the most practical polish of, like,

01:14:22.065 --> 01:14:24.945
<v Speaker 1>because they still seem, like, hardware compatibility,

01:14:24.945 --> 01:14:27.665
<v Speaker 1>like, squash. So Ubuntu is still doing all

01:14:27.665 --> 01:14:29.025
<v Speaker 1>the grunt work,

01:14:29.425 --> 01:14:31.824
<v Speaker 1>but they don't have, like, the best out

01:14:31.824 --> 01:14:33.744
<v Speaker 1>of the box experience anymore

01:14:34.065 --> 01:14:37.010
<v Speaker 1>where other distributions have, like, start like, because

01:14:37.010 --> 01:14:38.770
<v Speaker 1>it used to be, like, Ubuntu. Like, every

01:14:38.770 --> 01:14:40.690
<v Speaker 1>new version, it was kind of, like, exciting

01:14:40.690 --> 01:14:43.730
<v Speaker 1>about how the desktop is changing. And Fedora

01:14:43.730 --> 01:14:46.770
<v Speaker 1>has really taken over that, where, like, Fedora

01:14:46.770 --> 01:14:49.410
<v Speaker 1>is now the gold standard of the, really,

01:14:49.410 --> 01:14:50.449
<v Speaker 1>the GNOME experience,

01:14:51.055 --> 01:14:54.494
<v Speaker 1>But we're I think Fedora fails is

01:14:54.655 --> 01:14:56.974
<v Speaker 1>is in of all of those tiny little,

01:14:57.295 --> 01:14:59.615
<v Speaker 1>like, kind of paper cuts that canonical addresses.

01:14:59.615 --> 01:15:01.935
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I stuck with with Ubuntu

01:15:01.935 --> 01:15:03.535
<v Speaker 1>is because for the most part, it just

01:15:03.535 --> 01:15:05.535
<v Speaker 1>works. Like, it's it's pretty hands off. You

01:15:05.535 --> 01:15:07.330
<v Speaker 1>can just stick an LTS,

01:15:07.570 --> 01:15:09.970
<v Speaker 1>you know, keep auto upgrading the system, you

01:15:09.970 --> 01:15:12.930
<v Speaker 1>know, the system packages, and and it works.

01:15:13.090 --> 01:15:13.650
<v Speaker 2>So

01:15:14.210 --> 01:15:15.330
<v Speaker 2>What what I Yeah.

01:15:16.050 --> 01:15:17.970
<v Speaker 2>And I and I don't speak for canonical.

01:15:18.290 --> 01:15:20.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. But what I see happening

01:15:21.625 --> 01:15:22.344
<v Speaker 2>is,

01:15:23.065 --> 01:15:25.145
<v Speaker 2>you know, Unity desktop was very popular, but

01:15:25.145 --> 01:15:27.705
<v Speaker 2>they ultimately made the economic decision

01:15:28.345 --> 01:15:31.625
<v Speaker 2>to shift and kind of follow the pack

01:15:31.945 --> 01:15:34.930
<v Speaker 2>and be more consistent with with the other

01:15:34.930 --> 01:15:37.010
<v Speaker 2>distros and then bring their

01:15:37.650 --> 01:15:39.730
<v Speaker 2>polish to that. So for example, it's not

01:15:39.730 --> 01:15:41.490
<v Speaker 2>default. It's not gonna be the same default

01:15:41.490 --> 01:15:43.810
<v Speaker 2>GNOME setup. It it still has the

01:15:44.370 --> 01:15:46.770
<v Speaker 2>dash to dock extension preinstalled.

01:15:46.770 --> 01:15:48.210
<v Speaker 2>It has its own it has a brand

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:48.370
<v Speaker 2>new

01:15:49.875 --> 01:15:51.314
<v Speaker 2>out of box installer

01:15:51.715 --> 01:15:52.594
<v Speaker 2>that's

01:15:52.914 --> 01:15:54.274
<v Speaker 2>Flutter based, actually.

01:15:55.315 --> 01:15:56.835
<v Speaker 2>You know? And and at a certain point,

01:15:56.835 --> 01:15:58.594
<v Speaker 2>like, there's certain things that just aren't, like,

01:15:58.594 --> 01:16:00.594
<v Speaker 2>super exciting. But, like, it's got one click

01:16:00.594 --> 01:16:02.820
<v Speaker 2>active directory join when you set up a

01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:04.980
<v Speaker 2>new Oh, next. So just that. I was

01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:07.220
<v Speaker 1>I was very impressed with the active directory

01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:09.620
<v Speaker 1>join that they that I was just installing.

01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:11.460
<v Speaker 1>Because I just installed 202404

01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:13.300
<v Speaker 1>on on something or whatever. So I don't

01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:14.180
<v Speaker 0>know. You know, it's like

01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:16.820
<v Speaker 1>it's kinda weird because it's like

01:16:21.175 --> 01:16:23.414
<v Speaker 1>I I just don't get the impression,

01:16:24.775 --> 01:16:27.574
<v Speaker 1>but but maybe I'm wrong. It's like because

01:16:27.815 --> 01:16:31.255
<v Speaker 1>the there's kind of, like, no active marketing.

01:16:31.494 --> 01:16:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Like, I feel like canonical is is kinda

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.519
<v Speaker 1>stopped trying to

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:38.640
<v Speaker 1>get desktop users. Like, I just don't see

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:41.679
<v Speaker 1>the active whereas, like, system 76 is making

01:16:41.679 --> 01:16:43.520
<v Speaker 1>a bigger deal about it or whatever. So

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:46.239
<v Speaker 1>it's like so because, you know, like,

01:16:46.755 --> 01:16:48.355
<v Speaker 1>Linux is at a, you know, a very

01:16:48.355 --> 01:16:49.875
<v Speaker 1>small percentage of of the mark. So it's

01:16:49.875 --> 01:16:51.874
<v Speaker 1>like, how to get it to a larger

01:16:52.514 --> 01:16:53.715
<v Speaker 1>market of people.

01:16:55.235 --> 01:16:57.475
<v Speaker 2>I don't I think I I think that's

01:16:57.475 --> 01:16:58.114
<v Speaker 2>partly

01:16:58.435 --> 01:17:01.250
<v Speaker 2>just from our place as as geeks. You

01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:02.930
<v Speaker 2>know, we see systems at v six. We

01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:05.090
<v Speaker 2>see framework. But what we don't see

01:17:05.570 --> 01:17:07.650
<v Speaker 2>and, you know, you talk about Ubuntu's

01:17:08.530 --> 01:17:09.250
<v Speaker 2>kernel

01:17:09.410 --> 01:17:11.410
<v Speaker 2>support is Ubuntu

01:17:11.410 --> 01:17:14.290
<v Speaker 2>is one of the few companies

01:17:14.605 --> 01:17:16.844
<v Speaker 2>who are partnering with the hardware companies and

01:17:16.844 --> 01:17:19.485
<v Speaker 2>shipping Ubuntu certified hardware.

01:17:19.565 --> 01:17:22.525
<v Speaker 2>So while yes. Framework is great. Love system

01:17:22.525 --> 01:17:23.564
<v Speaker 2>76.

01:17:24.445 --> 01:17:25.885
<v Speaker 2>In terms of scale,

01:17:26.445 --> 01:17:29.085
<v Speaker 2>in terms of actually who's still shipping the

01:17:29.085 --> 01:17:29.644
<v Speaker 2>most

01:17:30.170 --> 01:17:33.449
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. You know, Linux workstations and laptops

01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:34.889
<v Speaker 2>through Lenovo,

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:36.170
<v Speaker 2>through HP,

01:17:36.810 --> 01:17:37.849
<v Speaker 2>through Dell,

01:17:39.050 --> 01:17:41.449
<v Speaker 2>you know, it's it's still Ubuntu. And that's

01:17:41.449 --> 01:17:43.209
<v Speaker 2>that's where the hardware

01:17:43.690 --> 01:17:45.965
<v Speaker 2>support comes from. Is that is those is

01:17:45.965 --> 01:17:47.405
<v Speaker 2>those prerelease units,

01:17:47.725 --> 01:17:48.364
<v Speaker 2>you know,

01:17:49.005 --> 01:17:52.605
<v Speaker 2>going to Ubuntu and then enabling those and

01:17:52.605 --> 01:17:54.844
<v Speaker 2>certifying them prior to release.

01:17:55.965 --> 01:17:58.125
<v Speaker 1>But, like, I I don't see Ubuntu changing

01:17:58.125 --> 01:18:00.610
<v Speaker 1>the trajectory. I think that's, like, the it's

01:18:00.610 --> 01:18:01.089
<v Speaker 1>like,

01:18:01.889 --> 01:18:04.449
<v Speaker 1>you know, maybe it's a slow growth business

01:18:04.449 --> 01:18:07.170
<v Speaker 1>over over time or whatever. It's like, I

01:18:07.170 --> 01:18:08.689
<v Speaker 1>just don't see it changing

01:18:09.090 --> 01:18:10.530
<v Speaker 1>the land. It's just

01:18:10.929 --> 01:18:12.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. There's just nothing of, like,

01:18:12.530 --> 01:18:12.929
<v Speaker 1>why

01:18:14.715 --> 01:18:17.755
<v Speaker 1>why would the Linux desktop, like, more people

01:18:19.355 --> 01:18:20.474
<v Speaker 1>switch to it?

01:18:21.355 --> 01:18:24.155
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. It's it's it's a weird

01:18:24.315 --> 01:18:25.994
<v Speaker 1>like, like, at least, like

01:18:26.850 --> 01:18:28.530
<v Speaker 1>yeah. Because, I mean, there's there's kind of

01:18:28.530 --> 01:18:30.690
<v Speaker 1>zero chance that, like, Linux will ever be

01:18:30.690 --> 01:18:33.330
<v Speaker 1>super popular with a a consumer

01:18:33.490 --> 01:18:35.570
<v Speaker 1>a large consumer base because it's just, at

01:18:35.570 --> 01:18:37.650
<v Speaker 1>this point in time, like, why most people

01:18:37.650 --> 01:18:40.449
<v Speaker 1>aren't are going away from laptops. Like, a

01:18:40.450 --> 01:18:42.210
<v Speaker 1>lot of people don't even own a laptop,

01:18:42.210 --> 01:18:43.534
<v Speaker 1>so it's like why

01:18:44.574 --> 01:18:45.855
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know. I guess you can

01:18:45.855 --> 01:18:46.815
<v Speaker 1>almost look at it from a, like, a

01:18:46.815 --> 01:18:49.135
<v Speaker 1>doomsday perspective there. Like, it's a dying market

01:18:49.135 --> 01:18:51.215
<v Speaker 1>anyways, and so Ubuntu will just continue to

01:18:51.215 --> 01:18:53.534
<v Speaker 1>con to grab whatever they can out of

01:18:53.534 --> 01:18:55.135
<v Speaker 1>it, and there's just no shop for anyone.

01:18:55.230 --> 01:18:57.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. Well, I mean, Ubuntu is

01:18:57.390 --> 01:18:59.630
<v Speaker 2>still the default on the major clouds. You

01:18:59.630 --> 01:19:01.630
<v Speaker 2>know? It's still Oh, no. No. I mean,

01:19:01.630 --> 01:19:03.630
<v Speaker 1>that that's a whole different deal. Because, like,

01:19:03.630 --> 01:19:05.150
<v Speaker 1>that's that's why I feel like is is

01:19:05.150 --> 01:19:07.710
<v Speaker 1>that that canonical. Like, I'm not, like, pessimistic

01:19:07.710 --> 01:19:10.285
<v Speaker 1>on canonical in general. I think the desktop,

01:19:10.285 --> 01:19:12.525
<v Speaker 1>the on the lap laptop, I think because

01:19:12.525 --> 01:19:13.485
<v Speaker 1>they've clearly

01:19:13.725 --> 01:19:16.364
<v Speaker 1>you know, they they have the server side,

01:19:16.525 --> 01:19:18.205
<v Speaker 1>and I feel like canonical has put a

01:19:18.205 --> 01:19:19.725
<v Speaker 1>lot of effort into the

01:19:20.525 --> 01:19:21.165
<v Speaker 1>IoT,

01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:23.820
<v Speaker 1>you know, smart device and stuff like that,

01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:25.340
<v Speaker 1>and so they have a good business there.

01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Like, their ARM support like, they were always

01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:29.100
<v Speaker 1>the best for ARM support. So it's, like,

01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:31.340
<v Speaker 1>Canonical in general. I think these other areas

01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:34.965
<v Speaker 1>is, like, really it's like, I use Ubuntu

01:19:35.125 --> 01:19:37.445
<v Speaker 1>like, that's the only distribution I really

01:19:37.685 --> 01:19:38.405
<v Speaker 1>actually

01:19:38.565 --> 01:19:40.485
<v Speaker 1>use. It's like going going to the cloud,

01:19:40.485 --> 01:19:42.885
<v Speaker 1>desktop, whatever, whereas, you know, with all of

01:19:42.885 --> 01:19:46.005
<v Speaker 1>these. Yeah. Yeah. Let's tackle something that George

01:19:46.005 --> 01:19:47.844
<v Speaker 0>has brought up now. So he he said

01:19:47.844 --> 01:19:49.605
<v Speaker 0>that we've not talked about economics,

01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:52.599
<v Speaker 0>which is true. And then he also says

01:19:52.599 --> 01:19:54.439
<v Speaker 0>that we're terrible customers.

01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:55.399
<v Speaker 0>And

01:19:57.239 --> 01:19:59.000
<v Speaker 0>now you're using Windows,

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.760
<v Speaker 0>which is a paid for operating system and

01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:02.760
<v Speaker 0>a ton of proprietary software of which you're

01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:03.639
<v Speaker 0>probably paying for.

01:20:04.395 --> 01:20:06.474
<v Speaker 0>But he's right. Like, where is the money

01:20:06.474 --> 01:20:08.954
<v Speaker 0>flowing into Linux? Like, I'm not paying for

01:20:08.954 --> 01:20:10.394
<v Speaker 0>GNOME. I'm not paying

01:20:10.715 --> 01:20:13.274
<v Speaker 0>for, you know, my Silver Blue install.

01:20:13.275 --> 01:20:13.834
<v Speaker 0>Like,

01:20:14.395 --> 01:20:16.875
<v Speaker 0>is is this an economic problem? Like, should

01:20:16.875 --> 01:20:18.960
<v Speaker 0>we be paying up more money for a

01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:20.800
<v Speaker 0>better Linux desktop experience?

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:22.560
<v Speaker 1>Well, I mean, obviously, yeah, it'd be great

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:24.240
<v Speaker 1>if people pay, but, like, the but the

01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:26.000
<v Speaker 1>thing is is nobody pays for an OS,

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.520
<v Speaker 1>really. So, I mean, that's kind of the

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:30.160
<v Speaker 1>that's the basic problem where it's like, sure.

01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:31.680
<v Speaker 1>Like, all of you can get all the

01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Linux nerds out there to feel guilty and

01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:35.165
<v Speaker 1>pay money or, you know, we wanna help

01:20:35.165 --> 01:20:36.605
<v Speaker 1>the world to pay money, but it doesn't

01:20:36.605 --> 01:20:38.125
<v Speaker 1>really matter because the the rest of it

01:20:38.205 --> 01:20:38.685
<v Speaker 1>like,

01:20:39.005 --> 01:20:40.845
<v Speaker 1>it's not it's not enough money. Like, the

01:20:40.845 --> 01:20:43.165
<v Speaker 1>larger market of people like, so it's like

01:20:43.325 --> 01:20:44.685
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird thing that's happened with the

01:20:44.685 --> 01:20:46.925
<v Speaker 1>entire software industry or whatever. It's like you

01:20:46.925 --> 01:20:49.120
<v Speaker 1>don't make money on software. You just don't.

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:51.280
<v Speaker 1>Like like, there's of of course, the legacy

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:53.280
<v Speaker 1>people, like, the the old proprietor, you know,

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:55.360
<v Speaker 1>Oracle or whatever who are still printing money

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:56.400
<v Speaker 1>off of software.

01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:59.600
<v Speaker 1>But, like, the majority of software development these

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:01.680
<v Speaker 1>days is, like, you don't make money off

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:03.680
<v Speaker 1>of it, and it's like

01:21:05.275 --> 01:21:08.794
<v Speaker 1>the and and ironically, the most challenging, difficult

01:21:09.675 --> 01:21:11.594
<v Speaker 1>the hardest technical problems you can solve in

01:21:11.594 --> 01:21:13.675
<v Speaker 1>software is all given away for free now.

01:21:13.675 --> 01:21:15.355
<v Speaker 1>It's all done in open source, and there's

01:21:15.355 --> 01:21:17.050
<v Speaker 1>zero value to it. So it's like, it's

01:21:17.050 --> 01:21:18.330
<v Speaker 1>this weird thing. It's like, well, should you

01:21:18.330 --> 01:21:19.690
<v Speaker 1>be paying for it? It's like, yeah. But,

01:21:19.690 --> 01:21:21.929
<v Speaker 1>like, nobody pays for it. So, like, why

01:21:21.929 --> 01:21:24.570
<v Speaker 1>do like yeah. Enter.

01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:27.449
<v Speaker 1>No. But these guys are, like, basically it's

01:21:27.449 --> 01:21:28.330
<v Speaker 1>like the

01:21:29.449 --> 01:21:30.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah. I mean,

01:21:31.915 --> 01:21:34.075
<v Speaker 1>yeah, Valve and and Adobe.

01:21:35.275 --> 01:21:36.875
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's the thing it's like the

01:21:36.875 --> 01:21:38.395
<v Speaker 1>the same people who have always been make

01:21:38.555 --> 01:21:40.075
<v Speaker 1>making money off of software are still making

01:21:40.235 --> 01:21:42.475
<v Speaker 1>but, like, anything that's, like, new.

01:21:43.035 --> 01:21:44.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I mean, I think we also have

01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:46.160
<v Speaker 0>to accept that the quality of the software

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:48.080
<v Speaker 0>is different. Right? When I was on a

01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:49.760
<v Speaker 0>Mac, I was paying for Raycast, which is

01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:51.360
<v Speaker 0>probably the greatest launcher and the only piece

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:52.880
<v Speaker 0>of software I generally miss

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:55.440
<v Speaker 0>from my Mac. And I paid for monthly

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:56.000
<v Speaker 0>subscription.

01:21:56.615 --> 01:21:58.135
<v Speaker 0>And I look at my Linux app, and

01:21:58.135 --> 01:22:00.055
<v Speaker 0>I don't think there's any software I'd probably

01:22:00.055 --> 01:22:02.935
<v Speaker 0>even pay for just because they're not as

01:22:02.935 --> 01:22:04.615
<v Speaker 0>good. And I don't know if that's because

01:22:04.615 --> 01:22:06.935
<v Speaker 0>they're all contributed to by volunteers and time

01:22:06.935 --> 01:22:09.335
<v Speaker 0>is limited and such. Yeah. But nobody's ever

01:22:09.335 --> 01:22:10.935
<v Speaker 0>entered, like, the actual

01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:14.469
<v Speaker 0>proprietary software thing. So I think you're right

01:22:14.469 --> 01:22:16.070
<v Speaker 0>to say there's no money in software, especially

01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:17.989
<v Speaker 0>in a Linux ecosystem, but it doesn't mean

01:22:17.989 --> 01:22:19.750
<v Speaker 0>that there shouldn't be longer term.

01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:23.670
<v Speaker 1>The there's this this kinda sad, like, reality

01:22:23.670 --> 01:22:26.345
<v Speaker 1>with open source stuff where it's like people

01:22:26.345 --> 01:22:28.265
<v Speaker 1>spend a lot of time in open source

01:22:28.265 --> 01:22:29.145
<v Speaker 1>developing.

01:22:29.225 --> 01:22:30.425
<v Speaker 1>And so they're like, well, I should be

01:22:30.425 --> 01:22:32.745
<v Speaker 1>compensated for that time. So they kind of

01:22:32.825 --> 01:22:34.265
<v Speaker 1>they said, look. My time should be worth

01:22:34.265 --> 01:22:36.025
<v Speaker 1>this much. Therefore, you should be paying for

01:22:36.025 --> 01:22:38.105
<v Speaker 1>that. But, like, unfortunately, it's like that's not

01:22:38.105 --> 01:22:38.745
<v Speaker 1>the way, like,

01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:41.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know, economics works or whatever. It's

01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:43.900
<v Speaker 1>like, what you'll find is if you take

01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:45.580
<v Speaker 1>your software that you've been giving away from

01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:46.139
<v Speaker 1>free,

01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:48.699
<v Speaker 1>like, make it proprietary and say you have

01:22:48.699 --> 01:22:50.219
<v Speaker 1>to pay $5 and see how many people

01:22:50.219 --> 01:22:52.455
<v Speaker 1>will pay for it. Not many people will

01:22:52.455 --> 01:22:54.535
<v Speaker 1>will pay for it because they don't value

01:22:54.535 --> 01:22:56.775
<v Speaker 1>it. That's unfortunate. Like, that's the unfortunate reality

01:22:56.775 --> 01:22:59.095
<v Speaker 1>is, like, people will use software that's free,

01:22:59.095 --> 01:23:00.215
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as you have to pay

01:23:00.215 --> 01:23:03.349
<v Speaker 1>for it, like, they they they won't. And

01:23:03.429 --> 01:23:04.869
<v Speaker 1>but it really does come down to the

01:23:04.869 --> 01:23:06.389
<v Speaker 1>fact that they don't get enough value out

01:23:06.389 --> 01:23:08.709
<v Speaker 1>of it to pay for it. Well

01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:10.709
<v Speaker 2>yeah. And the

01:23:10.949 --> 01:23:11.989
<v Speaker 2>thing is is

01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:13.510
<v Speaker 2>right now,

01:23:13.829 --> 01:23:14.469
<v Speaker 2>the

01:23:14.869 --> 01:23:17.510
<v Speaker 2>number one customer who pays for Linux, even

01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:20.355
<v Speaker 2>on Linux on the desktop, is enterprise.

01:23:20.995 --> 01:23:21.554
<v Speaker 2>And

01:23:21.875 --> 01:23:23.715
<v Speaker 2>as long as that continues,

01:23:24.035 --> 01:23:26.594
<v Speaker 2>with maybe the exception of, like, system 76,

01:23:28.675 --> 01:23:30.675
<v Speaker 2>as long as that continues, it's going to

01:23:30.675 --> 01:23:32.915
<v Speaker 2>be their issues that get prioritized.

01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:35.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I mean, that's just it. That's just

01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:36.340
<v Speaker 2>it. So,

01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:37.860
<v Speaker 2>you know, when I started

01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:40.420
<v Speaker 2>Penguin Linux, which was

01:23:40.740 --> 01:23:43.699
<v Speaker 2>bespoke WSL distro for WSL,

01:23:43.940 --> 01:23:44.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,

01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:47.620
<v Speaker 2>we we charged 5. I think the

01:23:48.805 --> 01:23:49.925
<v Speaker 2>it's now 10.

01:23:51.285 --> 01:23:53.845
<v Speaker 2>But we basically offered a social contract with

01:23:53.845 --> 01:23:56.005
<v Speaker 2>our customers where, yes, we know you could

01:23:56.005 --> 01:23:56.965
<v Speaker 2>go download

01:23:57.125 --> 01:23:59.205
<v Speaker 2>Debian or Ubuntu for free,

01:23:59.685 --> 01:24:02.005
<v Speaker 2>but give us $510

01:24:02.005 --> 01:24:02.485
<v Speaker 2>for this.

01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:05.920
<v Speaker 2>We give you best effort support,

01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:08.080
<v Speaker 2>and, you know, we we make all these

01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:10.880
<v Speaker 2>cool customizations optimized for WSL. This was also

01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:12.960
<v Speaker 2>WSL one days when you needed a lot

01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:14.400
<v Speaker 2>of those. And,

01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:17.280
<v Speaker 2>basically, we were committed

01:24:17.725 --> 01:24:18.284
<v Speaker 2>to

01:24:19.165 --> 01:24:20.445
<v Speaker 2>what the community

01:24:21.085 --> 01:24:23.165
<v Speaker 2>wanted who'd who'd who'd paid for it. And

01:24:23.165 --> 01:24:24.685
<v Speaker 2>we were able to do that by putting

01:24:24.685 --> 01:24:26.925
<v Speaker 2>it in the Microsoft Store.

01:24:27.405 --> 01:24:30.445
<v Speaker 2>And as Alan brings up, right now, there's

01:24:30.445 --> 01:24:34.605
<v Speaker 2>really no way to do that for Linux

01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:35.139
<v Speaker 2>end user software.

01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:37.540
<v Speaker 2>There's there's I mean, it's just

01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:38.980
<v Speaker 2>not possible.

01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:41.380
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. With the Mac, you've got the you've

01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:43.220
<v Speaker 0>got the Mac App Store, Windows you've got

01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:45.220
<v Speaker 0>the Windows App Store at Linux. I know

01:24:45.220 --> 01:24:47.700
<v Speaker 0>George says that they're working on FlatHub support

01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:48.980
<v Speaker 0>and payments. But

01:24:49.324 --> 01:24:51.565
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. But, like but it's it's very tricky

01:24:51.565 --> 01:24:52.205
<v Speaker 1>of,

01:24:53.324 --> 01:24:54.045
<v Speaker 1>because it's,

01:24:54.605 --> 01:24:55.405
<v Speaker 1>because

01:24:55.485 --> 01:24:57.885
<v Speaker 1>if you build up an open source software

01:24:57.885 --> 01:24:59.725
<v Speaker 1>and then you accept accept

01:24:59.885 --> 01:25:02.045
<v Speaker 1>expect people to pay after the fact, like,

01:25:02.590 --> 01:25:04.110
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's been open source, and then

01:25:04.110 --> 01:25:06.990
<v Speaker 1>that like, people most likely won't pay. You

01:25:06.990 --> 01:25:09.310
<v Speaker 1>know, it's like, it works better if, like,

01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:11.230
<v Speaker 1>you know, it's like you're kind of charging

01:25:11.230 --> 01:25:13.630
<v Speaker 1>from day one. You've you set that expert.

01:25:13.630 --> 01:25:15.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. It's like charging for open

01:25:15.550 --> 01:25:17.710
<v Speaker 1>source software is extremely difficult. I mean, it's

01:25:17.625 --> 01:25:20.425
<v Speaker 1>that's why, like, the startup I'm currently in,

01:25:20.425 --> 01:25:22.505
<v Speaker 1>the startup previously did, we we do open

01:25:22.505 --> 01:25:24.585
<v Speaker 1>source software. Like, I love open source.

01:25:25.385 --> 01:25:27.864
<v Speaker 1>But selling it is it's a very

01:25:28.265 --> 01:25:29.145
<v Speaker 1>difficult,

01:25:29.225 --> 01:25:29.945
<v Speaker 1>tricky thing.

01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:32.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:34.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. Like, I I I don't

01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:36.900
<v Speaker 1>think because it's, like, going back to, like,

01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:38.420
<v Speaker 1>what I was saying before is, like, why

01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:40.580
<v Speaker 1>I thought, like, set system 76 had, like,

01:25:40.580 --> 01:25:42.740
<v Speaker 1>the best chance or whatever is, like the

01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:44.420
<v Speaker 1>reason why I I I put most of

01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:45.940
<v Speaker 1>is because they're selling hardware.

01:25:46.864 --> 01:25:49.824
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's that's the biggest thing. But,

01:25:49.824 --> 01:25:51.905
<v Speaker 1>you know, maybe Canonical can do it with

01:25:51.905 --> 01:25:54.225
<v Speaker 1>partnering with people, but it's still there's this

01:25:54.225 --> 01:25:55.745
<v Speaker 1>weird thing that I don't think I don't

01:25:55.745 --> 01:25:58.225
<v Speaker 1>think the hardware vendors are incentivized enough to

01:25:58.225 --> 01:26:00.820
<v Speaker 1>make like, they're kind of too much in

01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:02.260
<v Speaker 1>bed with with Windows

01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:04.260
<v Speaker 1>that I don't know. Maybe it's not true.

01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:05.940
<v Speaker 1>But, like, I don't know if things that

01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:08.820
<v Speaker 1>are really incentivized enough to make Linux good

01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:10.420
<v Speaker 1>on their devices.

01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:15.295
<v Speaker 1>But ThinkPads, they do it. Like, ThinkPads are

01:26:15.295 --> 01:26:16.574
<v Speaker 1>amazing with Linux.

01:26:17.615 --> 01:26:20.015
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. And and there's there's some, you know,

01:26:20.015 --> 01:26:21.055
<v Speaker 2>$4,050,000

01:26:21.055 --> 01:26:25.055
<v Speaker 2>dollar, you know, ML workstation that from Lenovo

01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:27.320
<v Speaker 2>that Oh. Come with Ubuntu.

01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:29.559
<v Speaker 2>So, I mean, it it goes all

01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:31.960
<v Speaker 2>the way up up up the market. So

01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. But it's a tough it's a tough

01:26:34.119 --> 01:26:36.280
<v Speaker 1>it's a really tough business. So I definitely

01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:38.545
<v Speaker 1>would not wanna be in. Yeah. I mean,

01:26:38.545 --> 01:26:39.825
<v Speaker 1>I worked at SUSE for a while or

01:26:39.825 --> 01:26:41.025
<v Speaker 1>whatever. It's, like, just seeing, like, the whole

01:26:41.025 --> 01:26:42.785
<v Speaker 1>Linux business. It's a very it's a tough

01:26:42.785 --> 01:26:43.425
<v Speaker 1>business.

01:26:44.865 --> 01:26:45.265
<v Speaker 1>It's

01:26:48.145 --> 01:26:51.505
<v Speaker 1>because, like, the most most Linux

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.079
<v Speaker 1>companies, what they're selling is

01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:54.360
<v Speaker 1>certification.

01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:57.639
<v Speaker 1>It's hardware certification or compliance,

01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:59.720
<v Speaker 1>like, with with that's that's really what they're

01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:00.360
<v Speaker 1>selling.

01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:02.920
<v Speaker 1>It's it's,

01:27:03.364 --> 01:27:05.605
<v Speaker 1>you know, because that's what people require you

01:27:05.605 --> 01:27:07.925
<v Speaker 1>know, so they're, like, not really selling the

01:27:08.405 --> 01:27:10.324
<v Speaker 1>the software because it's all open source and

01:27:10.324 --> 01:27:13.525
<v Speaker 1>commoditized and freely available, but, like, companies need

01:27:13.525 --> 01:27:15.685
<v Speaker 1>the certification and stuff or whatever. You know?

01:27:15.685 --> 01:27:17.605
<v Speaker 1>And it yeah. It's a it's a weird

01:27:17.605 --> 01:27:17.765
<v Speaker 1>thing.

01:27:18.570 --> 01:27:20.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. The support, the FIPS

01:27:20.890 --> 01:27:21.690
<v Speaker 2>certification

01:27:21.770 --> 01:27:24.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. Those kind of thing. Yeah.

01:27:24.650 --> 01:27:26.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's what people end up paying

01:27:26.170 --> 01:27:26.730
<v Speaker 1>for.

01:27:27.130 --> 01:27:27.770
<v Speaker 1>But

01:27:28.170 --> 01:27:28.730
<v Speaker 1>yeah.

01:27:29.690 --> 01:27:30.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.

01:27:31.555 --> 01:27:33.475
<v Speaker 0>What's been Well It's been fun. I'm sure

01:27:33.475 --> 01:27:34.835
<v Speaker 1>it pissed off enough people.

01:27:36.115 --> 01:27:38.835
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. We've gone way over what we intended

01:27:38.835 --> 01:27:40.515
<v Speaker 0>to do, but, you know, I think we've

01:27:40.515 --> 01:27:41.795
<v Speaker 0>had some good discussions.

01:27:42.275 --> 01:27:44.115
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. There's there's a lot of work that

01:27:44.115 --> 01:27:45.555
<v Speaker 0>needs to go for Linux to have that

01:27:45.555 --> 01:27:47.290
<v Speaker 0>year of of the desktop. I think you

01:27:47.290 --> 01:27:49.530
<v Speaker 0>should abandon your AI project and go build

01:27:49.530 --> 01:27:52.090
<v Speaker 0>a software store for for Linux now.

01:27:52.650 --> 01:27:54.490
