00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
<v Speaker 0>This even though I've never done it before.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.279
<v Speaker 0>So this is either gonna go really, really

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.040
<v Speaker 0>well or extremely poorly.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.519
<v Speaker 0>I was checking out the community

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.360
<v Speaker 0>forums where we get a lot of really

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:16.574
<v Speaker 0>interesting and awesome questions.

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:18.894
<v Speaker 0>And I came across

00:00:18.895 --> 00:00:19.855
<v Speaker 0>this one

00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:21.695
<v Speaker 0>that was asked yesterday.

00:00:22.895 --> 00:00:25.855
<v Speaker 0>What this user wants to do is to

00:00:25.855 --> 00:00:27.855
<v Speaker 0>be able to pull in some data from

00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:29.615
<v Speaker 0>a SQLite database

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.479
<v Speaker 0>so that when they're querying their time series

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.000
<v Speaker 0>data from InfluxDB,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.200
<v Speaker 0>they can actually

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.360
<v Speaker 0>either map some

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.800
<v Speaker 0>identifiers or and the time series data to

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.520
<v Speaker 0>more descriptive values or maybe stored in a

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.845
<v Speaker 0>relational store like SQL deep like SQLite. Sorry.

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:50.045
<v Speaker 0>So it's quite a new use case that

00:00:50.045 --> 00:00:53.245
<v Speaker 0>is powered or enabled by the flux language

00:00:53.245 --> 00:00:55.245
<v Speaker 0>that our company and our flux team have

00:00:55.245 --> 00:00:56.445
<v Speaker 0>been working on now for a couple of

00:00:56.445 --> 00:00:56.765
<v Speaker 0>years

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.480
<v Speaker 0>so that you don't need to store your

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.760
<v Speaker 0>time series data

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.040
<v Speaker 0>with too many indexed fields.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.120
<v Speaker 0>You know, some data as naturally relational

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.335
<v Speaker 0>and being able to look that up and

00:01:11.335 --> 00:01:13.415
<v Speaker 0>augment it or, you know, join it or

00:01:13.415 --> 00:01:15.494
<v Speaker 0>correlate it to time series data, opens up

00:01:15.494 --> 00:01:17.494
<v Speaker 0>a lot of flexibility and power with your

00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:18.935
<v Speaker 0>queries and dashboarding.

00:01:19.255 --> 00:01:21.094
<v Speaker 0>So what I thought I would do

00:01:21.494 --> 00:01:22.295
<v Speaker 0>is

00:01:22.295 --> 00:01:23.015
<v Speaker 0>just

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.020
<v Speaker 0>try and put something together that uses us

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.220
<v Speaker 0>as an example.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.540
<v Speaker 0>Add that to my influx DB examples repository

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.300
<v Speaker 0>so that a user can, you know, go

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.660
<v Speaker 0>check it out, see how it works, and

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.785
<v Speaker 0>use it for themselves.

00:01:36.185 --> 00:01:37.625
<v Speaker 0>But of course, step one is for me

00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:39.385
<v Speaker 0>to actually work out how to do this

00:01:39.385 --> 00:01:40.425
<v Speaker 0>and get it working.

00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:44.665
<v Speaker 0>So what I'll try and do is

00:01:44.905 --> 00:01:46.585
<v Speaker 0>get m flux d b two set up

00:01:46.585 --> 00:01:47.385
<v Speaker 0>and running.

00:01:47.705 --> 00:01:49.945
<v Speaker 0>We'll pull in some data using telegraph.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.140
<v Speaker 0>Then when I'm able to query that data

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.540
<v Speaker 0>in the UI, we'll try and identify something

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.580
<v Speaker 0>that could be

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.140
<v Speaker 0>swapped out for data from a SQL store

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.580
<v Speaker 0>even if we have to make that rather

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.460
<v Speaker 0>contrived.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.660
<v Speaker 0>Then we'll do that.

00:02:04.585 --> 00:02:07.305
<v Speaker 0>So let's go to step one. Let's just

00:02:07.305 --> 00:02:09.625
<v Speaker 0>get our basic stack up and running.

00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:13.625
<v Speaker 0>So for that, I'm just gonna use Docker

00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:15.944
<v Speaker 0>Compose because I've done this a million times.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.340
<v Speaker 0>We'll have our InfluxDB

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.140
<v Speaker 0>service,

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.540
<v Speaker 0>and we're gonna use the Query.io

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.180
<v Speaker 0>InfluxDB,

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.340
<v Speaker 0>and we have a 2.2

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.540
<v Speaker 0>beta image available.

00:02:31.275 --> 00:02:32.715
<v Speaker 0>Now I wanna be able to browse this

00:02:32.715 --> 00:02:33.995
<v Speaker 0>on my local machine,

00:02:34.635 --> 00:02:36.635
<v Speaker 0>so I'm just gonna do some port mapping.

00:02:38.635 --> 00:02:41.275
<v Speaker 0>And I said I wanted Telegraph.

00:02:41.355 --> 00:02:43.435
<v Speaker 0>So for this, we'll just use the official

00:02:43.435 --> 00:02:44.315
<v Speaker 0>Docker images,

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.860
<v Speaker 0>And I wanna pass in a config.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:49.340
<v Speaker 0>So

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.700
<v Speaker 0>telegraph.conf.

00:02:58.975 --> 00:03:00.415
<v Speaker 0>And that

00:03:01.295 --> 00:03:03.775
<v Speaker 0>will get me halfway there.

00:03:04.095 --> 00:03:08.735
<v Speaker 0>So now we need a telegraph.conf.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.050
<v Speaker 0>So I'm gonna wanna see data pretty quickly,

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.170
<v Speaker 0>so let's go with a two second interval

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.170
<v Speaker 0>and a flush.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.250
<v Speaker 0>Can't type. That's because I'm streaming.

00:03:25.275 --> 00:03:27.835
<v Speaker 0>We will enable our outputs

00:03:27.995 --> 00:03:30.315
<v Speaker 0>for influx d b b two,

00:03:30.395 --> 00:03:32.395
<v Speaker 0>not v three. That's a bit ambitious.

00:03:33.355 --> 00:03:35.755
<v Speaker 0>And what do we need here? We need

00:03:35.755 --> 00:03:37.035
<v Speaker 0>a URL.

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:40.310
<v Speaker 0>This This is going to be our service

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.870
<v Speaker 0>name on port nine nine nine nine. We

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.230
<v Speaker 0>need an organization,

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.350
<v Speaker 0>and we need a token, and we need

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.150
<v Speaker 0>a bucket.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.230
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So what are these values?

00:03:51.105 --> 00:03:51.745
<v Speaker 0>Well,

00:03:53.105 --> 00:03:55.185
<v Speaker 0>we need to set up InfluxDB when we

00:03:55.185 --> 00:03:57.265
<v Speaker 0>spin it up. So what we're gonna do

00:03:57.265 --> 00:03:59.345
<v Speaker 0>here is just have a target and a

00:03:59.345 --> 00:04:00.225
<v Speaker 0>makefile,

00:04:00.945 --> 00:04:02.865
<v Speaker 0>where we'll run Docker Compose,

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.680
<v Speaker 0>execute

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.680
<v Speaker 0>in our influx DB container,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.720
<v Speaker 0>and we're gonna execute setup command.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.960
<v Speaker 0>I can be the user.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.160
<v Speaker 0>Super secure password.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.720
<v Speaker 0>Our organization name will just be my name

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.120
<v Speaker 0>again.

00:04:18.765 --> 00:04:20.765
<v Speaker 0>We need a bucket,

00:04:23.005 --> 00:04:24.365
<v Speaker 0>which we'll call default,

00:04:24.445 --> 00:04:27.005
<v Speaker 0>and we need a retention

00:04:28.765 --> 00:04:30.045
<v Speaker 0>period policy.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.260
<v Speaker 0>Just retention. There we go. And if we

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.100
<v Speaker 0>set that to zero or less, it will

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.140
<v Speaker 0>be infinite.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.940
<v Speaker 0>So we have user password.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.139
<v Speaker 0>Oh, we need a token.

00:04:44.475 --> 00:04:46.395
<v Speaker 0>And the token is just gonna be Rawkode

00:04:46.395 --> 00:04:48.395
<v Speaker 0>as well. So now we have a setup

00:04:48.395 --> 00:04:51.035
<v Speaker 0>target that should configure NfoxDB when I get

00:04:51.035 --> 00:04:51.755
<v Speaker 0>it running.

00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:55.035
<v Speaker 0>What we're also gonna do is just configure

00:04:55.035 --> 00:04:57.275
<v Speaker 0>these here with the same values that we

00:04:57.275 --> 00:04:58.235
<v Speaker 0>used in that target.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.300
<v Speaker 0>So if I have done this correctly, we

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.620
<v Speaker 0>should be able to spin the stack up.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.300
<v Speaker 0>Maybe I should have pre pulled the images.

00:05:19.415 --> 00:05:21.335
<v Speaker 0>And I wonder if I can get Twitch

00:05:21.335 --> 00:05:23.095
<v Speaker 0>on my phone so I can see if

00:05:23.095 --> 00:05:25.735
<v Speaker 0>anyone is chatting to me or if I'm

00:05:25.735 --> 00:05:27.590
<v Speaker 0>just talking to myself.

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:31.669
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'm not a great singer.

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:33.990
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We'll leave that there just now while

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.870
<v Speaker 0>it installs.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.910
<v Speaker 0>So if I do docker compose p s,

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.629
<v Speaker 0>telegraphed at exit. Let's see why before we

00:05:42.015 --> 00:05:42.815
<v Speaker 0>continue.

00:05:45.215 --> 00:05:46.175
<v Speaker 0>URL.

00:05:46.815 --> 00:05:47.455
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:05:48.015 --> 00:05:50.175
<v Speaker 0>Let's go check out the docs. So

00:05:51.615 --> 00:05:52.575
<v Speaker 0>telegraph

00:05:54.575 --> 00:05:55.535
<v Speaker 0>outputs.

00:05:55.535 --> 00:05:56.175
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.960
<v Speaker 0>Once a a URL of influx d b's.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:04.600
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.320
<v Speaker 0>URLs.

00:06:10.765 --> 00:06:13.885
<v Speaker 0>And let's try to spinning that back up.

00:06:21.245 --> 00:06:22.925
<v Speaker 0>Yep. We have Twitch installed.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.040
<v Speaker 0>Maybe a pain in the ass to log

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.800
<v Speaker 0>in because of the two factor.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.480
<v Speaker 0>Twitch.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.800
<v Speaker 0>Take my picture. There we go.

00:06:37.294 --> 00:06:38.095
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:06:38.495 --> 00:06:39.695
<v Speaker 0>Get code.

00:06:44.815 --> 00:06:46.735
<v Speaker 0>I feel like I'm just mumbling to myself

00:06:46.735 --> 00:06:47.134
<v Speaker 0>now.

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:51.340
<v Speaker 0>And submit.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.900
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's do a DS.

00:07:07.155 --> 00:07:09.315
<v Speaker 0>Guess they don't really need my headphones there.

00:07:10.194 --> 00:07:10.995
<v Speaker 0>Hi.

00:07:13.875 --> 00:07:16.115
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I think I'm talking to myself. That's

00:07:16.115 --> 00:07:16.514
<v Speaker 0>all good.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.490
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's check out the logs. What have

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:21.610
<v Speaker 0>we got this time?

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.770
<v Speaker 0>Org is not defined.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:24.650
<v Speaker 0>Organization.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.650
<v Speaker 0>Token and bucket.

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:30.650
<v Speaker 0>So I get for using the short version.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.169
<v Speaker 0>Org organization.

00:07:33.955 --> 00:07:36.275
<v Speaker 0>And spin that up one more time.

00:07:39.235 --> 00:07:40.835
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you're joking.

00:07:43.634 --> 00:07:45.890
<v Speaker 0>No inputs found. Alright. Perfect.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.650
<v Speaker 0>So let's just enable internal,

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.770
<v Speaker 0>which just gives us some stats about telegraph

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:53.570
<v Speaker 0>itself.

00:07:58.585 --> 00:07:59.305
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:07:59.705 --> 00:08:00.585
<v Speaker 0>So

00:08:02.025 --> 00:08:03.465
<v Speaker 0>we should

00:08:07.944 --> 00:08:09.784
<v Speaker 0>oh, we didn't run our setup command. Let's

00:08:09.784 --> 00:08:11.705
<v Speaker 0>do that. Make

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:12.210
<v Speaker 0>setup.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.970
<v Speaker 0>And I got user wrong.

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.090
<v Speaker 0>Oh, names.

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:24.690
<v Speaker 0>That's a dreadful name for that argument.

00:08:31.634 --> 00:08:34.515
<v Speaker 0>Please type oh, no. Wait. Username. Hold

00:08:37.635 --> 00:08:38.995
<v Speaker 0>on a minute. So

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.539
<v Speaker 0>config

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:43.020
<v Speaker 0>name. That's a new feature, actually.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.500
<v Speaker 0>I don't think that had made any of

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.500
<v Speaker 0>the releases yet, but you can actually have

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.140
<v Speaker 0>multiple configs like a kubectl config.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.820
<v Speaker 0>Pretty cool, but we don't need that for

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:52.220
<v Speaker 0>just now.

00:08:53.525 --> 00:08:56.325
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So let's go back here. This should

00:08:56.325 --> 00:08:58.885
<v Speaker 0>tell us it's already been set up. Perfect.

00:08:58.885 --> 00:09:00.885
<v Speaker 0>Let's go and log in.

00:09:01.125 --> 00:09:03.285
<v Speaker 0>Rawkode one two three.

00:09:04.485 --> 00:09:04.885
<v Speaker 0>And

00:09:06.005 --> 00:09:07.045
<v Speaker 0>if we're lucky,

00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:08.870
<v Speaker 0>which we're not,

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:13.430
<v Speaker 0>we should see Telegraph writing some data here

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:14.230
<v Speaker 0>pretty quickly.

00:09:20.815 --> 00:09:23.295
<v Speaker 0>So when was that? 11:33.

00:09:25.295 --> 00:09:26.175
<v Speaker 0>InfluxDB,

00:09:26.175 --> 00:09:27.535
<v Speaker 0>host not found.

00:09:28.095 --> 00:09:29.295
<v Speaker 0>That's annoying.

00:09:30.815 --> 00:09:31.775
<v Speaker 0>InfluxDB.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:36.450
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.450
<v Speaker 0>What have I messed up?

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:49.410
<v Speaker 0>Nothing.

00:09:55.545 --> 00:09:57.545
<v Speaker 0>So it does resolve it.

00:09:59.305 --> 00:10:02.825
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's jump inside of telegraph.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.380
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. You don't need to interact flags.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:11.780
<v Speaker 0>Let's install

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:12.820
<v Speaker 0>curl.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:13.860
<v Speaker 0>Oh, there we go.

00:10:17.564 --> 00:10:20.204
<v Speaker 0>And it's like DB9999.

00:10:21.165 --> 00:10:21.964
<v Speaker 0>Health.

00:10:24.605 --> 00:10:25.485
<v Speaker 0>Interesting.

00:10:27.964 --> 00:10:29.964
<v Speaker 0>Even though I can browse to it.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.200
<v Speaker 0>This is not where I expected to get

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:42.600
<v Speaker 0>stuck.

00:10:50.055 --> 00:10:50.855
<v Speaker 0>So

00:10:53.655 --> 00:10:58.615
<v Speaker 0>maybe this is a new change

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:06.899
<v Speaker 0>where nFlux d only lessens on localhost.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.980
<v Speaker 0>So let's try

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:14.019
<v Speaker 0>this.

00:11:15.055 --> 00:11:16.975
<v Speaker 0>Although it says the default is

00:11:18.095 --> 00:11:18.894
<v Speaker 0>any and all.

00:11:45.175 --> 00:11:47.015
<v Speaker 0>Why is that not working?

00:11:52.055 --> 00:11:52.695
<v Speaker 0>Think, David.

00:12:01.149 --> 00:12:03.149
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Even though that says

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:04.990
<v Speaker 0>it's the default,

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:07.950
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna check.

00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:12.515
<v Speaker 0>So that parameter was

00:12:13.075 --> 00:12:14.835
<v Speaker 0>h to b paint address

00:12:20.675 --> 00:12:21.475
<v Speaker 0>equals

00:12:21.475 --> 00:12:23.315
<v Speaker 0>zero dot zero dot zero dot zero,

00:12:25.379 --> 00:12:26.180
<v Speaker 0>and

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.220
<v Speaker 0>we'll

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.500
<v Speaker 0>just stop

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.459
<v Speaker 0>everything.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:37.699
<v Speaker 0>Let's bring that back up.

00:12:42.805 --> 00:12:43.685
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:12:44.885 --> 00:12:48.005
<v Speaker 0>And let's go back

00:12:48.005 --> 00:12:49.365
<v Speaker 0>to telegraph.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.000
<v Speaker 0>Still not working.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.440
<v Speaker 0>Oh, trying.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.320
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.760
<v Speaker 0>we have an error.

00:13:11.325 --> 00:13:13.965
<v Speaker 0>So the bank address needs a port too.

00:13:16.605 --> 00:13:18.445
<v Speaker 0>So let's bring that up.

00:13:20.285 --> 00:13:22.380
<v Speaker 0>We'll view the influx DB logs, Make sure

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.260
<v Speaker 0>it actually gets into happy, healthy state.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:28.940
<v Speaker 0>Oh, hello.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.060
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you're clean.

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:33.740
<v Speaker 0>Don't know if I'm saying that right. I

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.820
<v Speaker 0>can barely read the tiny text on my

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:37.340
<v Speaker 0>my phone.

00:13:37.875 --> 00:13:41.155
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So that seems okay now.

00:13:44.035 --> 00:13:44.595
<v Speaker 0>Come on.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.200
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's take a look at one I've

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:56.760
<v Speaker 0>done before.

00:14:05.945 --> 00:14:07.865
<v Speaker 0>It's all InfluxDB one.

00:14:09.305 --> 00:14:12.505
<v Speaker 0>Some of these are InfluxDB two. This one

00:14:12.505 --> 00:14:13.625
<v Speaker 0>definitely is.

00:14:15.865 --> 00:14:16.265
<v Speaker 0>So

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:20.710
<v Speaker 0>that's pretty simple.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:26.550
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:27.910
<v Speaker 0>don't break it.

00:14:35.855 --> 00:14:38.655
<v Speaker 0>You know what? I know what it is.

00:14:39.695 --> 00:14:40.895
<v Speaker 0>No. I don't.

00:14:43.295 --> 00:14:45.855
<v Speaker 0>Maybe it's the order of the containers.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.790
<v Speaker 0>So let's try depends on

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:51.230
<v Speaker 0>influx

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:52.110
<v Speaker 0>DB

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:53.630
<v Speaker 0>condition

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:56.190
<v Speaker 0>service

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:57.070
<v Speaker 0>started.

00:15:00.735 --> 00:15:02.495
<v Speaker 0>Destroy the world.

00:15:02.655 --> 00:15:03.295
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

00:15:03.535 --> 00:15:04.815
<v Speaker 0>what should be an array?

00:15:06.815 --> 00:15:07.535
<v Speaker 0>It

00:15:09.695 --> 00:15:10.495
<v Speaker 0>should be a string.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.840
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Go away.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:20.680
<v Speaker 0>Come back.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.560
<v Speaker 0>Let's check out our logs on Telegraph.

00:15:34.514 --> 00:15:35.235
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:15:42.834 --> 00:15:44.150
<v Speaker 0>Does it hit me?

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:51.190
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

00:16:03.345 --> 00:16:04.225
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:16:04.225 --> 00:16:05.985
<v Speaker 0>Let's start poking around.

00:16:07.824 --> 00:16:13.340
<v Speaker 0>Let's try curl 1722003999.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.740
<v Speaker 0>That's probably localhost, isn't it?

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.700
<v Speaker 0>Well, it does resolve.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.940
<v Speaker 0>17220029999.

00:16:32.785 --> 00:16:34.945
<v Speaker 0>I must have done something really daft.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.620
<v Speaker 0>Definitely running on that port.

00:16:49.579 --> 00:16:51.420
<v Speaker 0>Can I do it from local host?

00:16:51.819 --> 00:16:53.579
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Because I got the browser at it.

00:17:02.115 --> 00:17:03.635
<v Speaker 0>So just

00:17:05.075 --> 00:17:06.275
<v Speaker 0>because I'm

00:17:06.515 --> 00:17:07.635
<v Speaker 0>so confused,

00:17:07.635 --> 00:17:09.234
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna remove

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:12.459
<v Speaker 0>this port mapping

00:17:14.299 --> 00:17:15.579
<v Speaker 0>and try again.

00:17:19.179 --> 00:17:21.179
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So there,

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:23.899
<v Speaker 0>both healthy,

00:17:25.775 --> 00:17:26.335
<v Speaker 0>Curl.

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:40.460
<v Speaker 0>Let's start again.

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.540
<v Speaker 0>Maybe someone's helping me.

00:17:56.085 --> 00:17:58.085
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Some confusion there too.

00:18:00.005 --> 00:18:02.165
<v Speaker 0>So remember when I was so confident at

00:18:02.165 --> 00:18:03.445
<v Speaker 0>the start, I said I've done this a

00:18:03.445 --> 00:18:04.245
<v Speaker 0>thousand times.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:06.979
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I have.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.700
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's send all

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.379
<v Speaker 0>of my examples.

00:18:19.539 --> 00:18:20.820
<v Speaker 0>Let me use

00:18:21.235 --> 00:18:24.034
<v Speaker 0>Koli. So let's go with

00:18:24.434 --> 00:18:25.075
<v Speaker 0>that

00:18:32.515 --> 00:18:33.794
<v Speaker 0>runs that one.

00:18:34.755 --> 00:18:35.395
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes.

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:39.610
<v Speaker 0>No. That's just the image on that manifest.

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:40.810
<v Speaker 0>Let's not do that.

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:44.890
<v Speaker 0>Let's just copy this one then.

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:47.450
<v Speaker 0>Or the comparison one. Let's see what's in

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:47.690
<v Speaker 0>there.

00:18:52.264 --> 00:18:53.224
<v Speaker 0>Copy.

00:18:53.945 --> 00:18:54.904
<v Speaker 0>Paste.

00:18:55.625 --> 00:18:56.344
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

00:18:56.904 --> 00:18:58.985
<v Speaker 0>the version. I wonder what changed between two

00:18:58.985 --> 00:19:00.104
<v Speaker 0>and two point four.

00:19:01.784 --> 00:19:02.825
<v Speaker 0>Just for giggles.

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.559
<v Speaker 0>Let's spin this back up with that.

00:19:11.919 --> 00:19:13.839
<v Speaker 0>I can't believe I'm stuck on this.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.879
<v Speaker 0>And plus d v two

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.735
<v Speaker 0>and SQLite.

00:19:20.735 --> 00:19:21.375
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:19:26.255 --> 00:19:27.375
<v Speaker 0>We have

00:19:28.095 --> 00:19:29.695
<v Speaker 0>things looking normal.

00:19:31.295 --> 00:19:33.135
<v Speaker 0>And telegraph

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.720
<v Speaker 0>still has this no route to hosting.

00:19:41.039 --> 00:19:45.039
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's just put this in. Delete chronograph.

00:19:45.039 --> 00:19:46.320
<v Speaker 0>We don't need

00:19:46.934 --> 00:19:49.414
<v Speaker 0>we don't need influx DB one. Maybe I'm

00:19:49.414 --> 00:19:51.174
<v Speaker 0>getting dishware enough to switch to that.

00:19:52.695 --> 00:19:54.534
<v Speaker 0>I'll try the alpha next.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.179
<v Speaker 0>We still wanna use telegraph one thirteen on

00:20:02.179 --> 00:20:05.059
<v Speaker 0>the m only mounting in the config.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.659
<v Speaker 0>We got rid of Prometheus.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.220
<v Speaker 0>We'll call this influx b b.

00:20:13.175 --> 00:20:15.015
<v Speaker 0>And I'm pretty sure that's the exact same

00:20:15.015 --> 00:20:16.934
<v Speaker 0>as what I had a second ago anyway.

00:20:18.855 --> 00:20:19.655
<v Speaker 0>But I'm desperate.

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:31.770
<v Speaker 0>Check your networks with DC config.

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:34.170
<v Speaker 0>Okay. We can do that in a second.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:40.090
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So we're still getting Norita host.

00:20:41.445 --> 00:20:42.085
<v Speaker 0>So

00:20:42.485 --> 00:20:44.485
<v Speaker 0>let's jump to the alpha,

00:20:44.485 --> 00:20:46.165
<v Speaker 0>and that well needs to download, so we'll

00:20:46.165 --> 00:20:47.284
<v Speaker 0>give that a minute.

00:20:50.325 --> 00:20:51.365
<v Speaker 0>Hold on.

00:20:52.245 --> 00:20:53.045
<v Speaker 0>Definitely

00:20:53.045 --> 00:20:55.125
<v Speaker 0>Docker Compose and not Podman Compose.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.099
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Start pulling that image.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.419
<v Speaker 0>Simplest compose fail ever.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.580
<v Speaker 0>Let's try

00:21:13.335 --> 00:21:15.494
<v Speaker 0>And let's just call it something different.

00:21:17.015 --> 00:21:20.054
<v Speaker 0>Still run the same image and put giggles.

00:21:20.054 --> 00:21:22.534
<v Speaker 0>Let's just get Elasticsearch

00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:23.335
<v Speaker 0>running too.

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:28.470
<v Speaker 0>That might work.

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:35.029
<v Speaker 0>It did work. Cool.

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:37.110
<v Speaker 0>And let's get another tab,

00:21:39.895 --> 00:21:41.815
<v Speaker 0>and let's go inside.

00:21:42.375 --> 00:21:44.135
<v Speaker 0>Use the long version.

00:21:45.095 --> 00:21:46.855
<v Speaker 0>Seven

00:21:47.015 --> 00:21:47.895
<v Speaker 0>d.

00:21:48.535 --> 00:21:50.935
<v Speaker 0>Nope. Let's go and telegraph. 38

00:21:50.935 --> 00:21:51.335
<v Speaker 0>dash.

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:54.580
<v Speaker 0>So we should have

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.059
<v Speaker 0>available on 9999.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:58.659
<v Speaker 0>We

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.059
<v Speaker 0>should have available there.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:02.179
<v Speaker 0>Bailed.

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:06.020
<v Speaker 0>We should have elastic search available on 5

00:22:06.179 --> 00:22:09.574
<v Speaker 0>no. That's the wrong port. 920.

00:22:11.575 --> 00:22:12.534
<v Speaker 0>Right.

00:22:14.534 --> 00:22:16.854
<v Speaker 0>This is all of my containers.

00:22:17.894 --> 00:22:18.934
<v Speaker 0>I suspect

00:22:18.934 --> 00:22:20.374
<v Speaker 0>something is

00:22:21.495 --> 00:22:22.534
<v Speaker 0>well and truly fucked.

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.700
<v Speaker 0>So let's spin up an example I've used

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:26.659
<v Speaker 0>before.

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.899
<v Speaker 0>There's no docker compose there. Let's go to

00:22:32.899 --> 00:22:34.580
<v Speaker 0>my demo from influx days,

00:22:35.865 --> 00:22:38.825
<v Speaker 0>which is under telegraph influx days

00:22:42.505 --> 00:22:43.945
<v Speaker 0>d c apt dash d.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.399
<v Speaker 0>Restart docker.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:53.999
<v Speaker 0>Good call.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.840
<v Speaker 0>System control.

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:58.960
<v Speaker 0>Restart docker.

00:23:05.105 --> 00:23:05.745
<v Speaker 0>So

00:23:06.145 --> 00:23:08.945
<v Speaker 0>let's go back here. As that fixes it,

00:23:08.945 --> 00:23:10.945
<v Speaker 0>I'll be happy and mortifies it at the

00:23:10.945 --> 00:23:11.745
<v Speaker 0>same time.

00:23:15.585 --> 00:23:16.785
<v Speaker 0>TCPF.

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:24.049
<v Speaker 0>DC logs telegraph.

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:29.169
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's not fixed in it. Docker network.

00:23:36.914 --> 00:23:38.034
<v Speaker 0>Man, I'll explain.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:48.140
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's just forget Docker Compose.

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:50.460
<v Speaker 0>Let's just do this also to make targets.

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:51.980
<v Speaker 0>Let's not I'm not gonna waste time on

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:52.460
<v Speaker 0>this.

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:55.900
<v Speaker 0>Any more time on this. So let's run.

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.340
<v Speaker 0>In fact, DB container

00:23:59.340 --> 00:23:59.580
<v Speaker 0>run.

00:24:00.205 --> 00:24:01.485
<v Speaker 0>Just kill it.

00:24:03.725 --> 00:24:05.725
<v Speaker 0>And we're gonna have to give this a

00:24:05.725 --> 00:24:07.565
<v Speaker 0>name because we're not using the network.

00:24:11.645 --> 00:24:13.485
<v Speaker 0>Publish the port

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.799
<v Speaker 0>and the image name.

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.880
<v Speaker 0>Telegraph, we'll do the same.

00:24:28.905 --> 00:24:31.465
<v Speaker 0>Doesn't need a name. It needs volume.

00:24:40.105 --> 00:24:42.665
<v Speaker 0>It needs a link and flux DB

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:45.890
<v Speaker 0>an image.

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:50.370
<v Speaker 0>And my setup command,

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:52.690
<v Speaker 0>container,

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:55.650
<v Speaker 0>exe c, we'll need IT,

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:56.530
<v Speaker 0>and flex DB,

00:24:56.914 --> 00:24:58.835
<v Speaker 0>blah blah blah blah blah. Okay.

00:25:00.355 --> 00:25:01.874
<v Speaker 0>If this doesn't work,

00:25:03.154 --> 00:25:04.354
<v Speaker 0>I'm in trouble.

00:25:04.674 --> 00:25:06.754
<v Speaker 0>So influxDB.

00:25:08.995 --> 00:25:10.595
<v Speaker 0>I didn't attach them, did I?

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.159
<v Speaker 0>Okay. ALS

00:25:21.799 --> 00:25:22.519
<v Speaker 0>running.

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.440
<v Speaker 0>Make telegraph.

00:25:27.675 --> 00:25:28.475
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:25:29.275 --> 00:25:30.555
<v Speaker 0>What did I get wrong here?

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:48.510
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's have it echo out of this

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:50.110
<v Speaker 0>command so I can actually see.

00:25:55.095 --> 00:25:55.894
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

00:26:00.295 --> 00:26:02.534
<v Speaker 0>wait. This is make. There

00:26:04.295 --> 00:26:05.015
<v Speaker 0>we go.

00:26:05.735 --> 00:26:06.615
<v Speaker 0>Perfect.

00:26:09.175 --> 00:26:10.295
<v Speaker 0>So

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:13.090
<v Speaker 0>let's get set up.

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:17.730
<v Speaker 0>Docker container

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:18.770
<v Speaker 0>logs.

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:24.210
<v Speaker 0>We want.

00:26:26.095 --> 00:26:27.135
<v Speaker 0>Oh, motherfucker.

00:26:40.159 --> 00:26:41.840
<v Speaker 0>Let's not use containers.

00:26:46.559 --> 00:26:49.200
<v Speaker 0>So we'll install Telegraph. I do have nflux

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.200
<v Speaker 0>d v two available already.

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.799
<v Speaker 0>I wonder if there's a Telegraph bin package.

00:26:57.785 --> 00:27:00.025
<v Speaker 0>Yes. There we go. That should be fast.

00:27:04.665 --> 00:27:06.585
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I mean, I definitely could use host

00:27:06.585 --> 00:27:07.065
<v Speaker 0>networking.

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:10.540
<v Speaker 0>Let's just go

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:12.060
<v Speaker 0>with the binaries.

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:15.420
<v Speaker 0>There's clearly something broken with my Docker setup

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:16.620
<v Speaker 0>on this machine.

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:21.420
<v Speaker 0>So I'll probably just uninstall Docker after this

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:21.820
<v Speaker 0>stream.

00:27:24.855 --> 00:27:26.295
<v Speaker 0>Never seen that before.

00:27:27.255 --> 00:27:28.215
<v Speaker 0>Very weird.

00:27:28.855 --> 00:27:30.695
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we

00:27:32.615 --> 00:27:33.735
<v Speaker 0>do have

00:27:34.775 --> 00:27:36.295
<v Speaker 0>here.

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:39.309
<v Speaker 0>So I should be able to just run

00:27:39.309 --> 00:27:41.070
<v Speaker 0>that. Oh, maybe let's just

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:45.149
<v Speaker 0>run that here.

00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:48.429
<v Speaker 0>I'll wait for that to be healthy.

00:27:54.045 --> 00:27:55.725
<v Speaker 0>Bain address in use.

00:27:56.125 --> 00:27:58.125
<v Speaker 0>My containers will still be running one there.

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:03.629
<v Speaker 0>Nine f and five b.

00:28:07.309 --> 00:28:07.950
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:14.350
<v Speaker 0>Now we have influx.

00:28:16.335 --> 00:28:18.895
<v Speaker 0>Scan my finger, install Telegraph. Now we have

00:28:18.895 --> 00:28:19.695
<v Speaker 0>Telegraph.

00:28:20.735 --> 00:28:22.735
<v Speaker 0>So we don't need any of that crap.

00:28:22.815 --> 00:28:25.855
<v Speaker 0>We just need to point this to local

00:28:25.855 --> 00:28:26.655
<v Speaker 0>host.

00:28:26.815 --> 00:28:29.375
<v Speaker 0>We're still gonna set this up the same,

00:28:29.375 --> 00:28:30.575
<v Speaker 0>only we don't need

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:33.669
<v Speaker 0>any container stuff.

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:38.870
<v Speaker 0>Let's do make setup.

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:40.710
<v Speaker 0>Perfect.

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:41.510
<v Speaker 0>And

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:43.990
<v Speaker 0>dash dash config.

00:28:45.125 --> 00:28:45.925
<v Speaker 0>Come on.

00:28:46.885 --> 00:28:48.325
<v Speaker 0>Give me some data.

00:28:52.885 --> 00:28:55.685
<v Speaker 0>Flash interval two seconds, which means that should

00:28:56.725 --> 00:28:57.365
<v Speaker 0>be working.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:00.520
<v Speaker 0>Rawkode.

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:01.480
<v Speaker 0>One, three.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.000
<v Speaker 0>We have data.

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.280
<v Speaker 0>Fucking hell. That was tough.

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.640
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Okay. So let's just look at the

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.545
<v Speaker 0>last five minutes. Refresh every five seconds. We

00:29:16.545 --> 00:29:18.784
<v Speaker 0>have data going up on a nice nice

00:29:19.665 --> 00:29:22.785
<v Speaker 0>linear progression there. So let's go back to

00:29:22.785 --> 00:29:24.544
<v Speaker 0>what we actually wanted to accomplish.

00:29:26.705 --> 00:29:28.465
<v Speaker 0>We have this post on the influx to

00:29:28.465 --> 00:29:29.265
<v Speaker 0>be community site.

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:32.510
<v Speaker 0>The person is asking how they can, using

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:35.070
<v Speaker 0>the flux query language, pull in some values

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:36.750
<v Speaker 0>from SQLite to

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:39.710
<v Speaker 0>augment that augment our time series data with

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:40.110
<v Speaker 0>it.

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:41.470
<v Speaker 0>So

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:44.015
<v Speaker 0>first, I guess, now that we have influx

00:29:44.015 --> 00:29:45.215
<v Speaker 0>running telegraph,

00:29:45.215 --> 00:29:46.495
<v Speaker 0>we have some data.

00:29:47.375 --> 00:29:48.575
<v Speaker 0>We can take a look at that in

00:29:48.575 --> 00:29:49.774
<v Speaker 0>raw fashion.

00:29:50.575 --> 00:29:53.375
<v Speaker 0>And let's assume what we wanna do is

00:29:53.935 --> 00:29:55.455
<v Speaker 0>update the name of the host.

00:29:56.059 --> 00:29:58.059
<v Speaker 0>So we have Arch right now.

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.779
<v Speaker 0>Maybe we actually wanna give that a nicer

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.860
<v Speaker 0>name, and we wanna fetch that from a

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:04.620
<v Speaker 0>relational database of some sort. And we're gonna

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:05.739
<v Speaker 0>use SQLite.

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:09.019
<v Speaker 0>So what do I need to do?

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:11.900
<v Speaker 0>First, I'm gonna need some SQLite

00:30:11.265 --> 00:30:12.065
<v Speaker 0>data.

00:30:14.145 --> 00:30:16.705
<v Speaker 0>So let's go back to this directory.

00:30:18.225 --> 00:30:19.585
<v Speaker 0>SQLite

00:30:20.065 --> 00:30:20.784
<v Speaker 0>browser.

00:30:21.025 --> 00:30:21.905
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:30:24.545 --> 00:30:25.745
<v Speaker 0>Get that installed.

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:32.259
<v Speaker 0>Create a database.

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.259
<v Speaker 0>Code source.

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:39.059
<v Speaker 0>GitLab.

00:30:40.925 --> 00:30:43.245
<v Speaker 0>I should've used something in the top there,

00:30:43.245 --> 00:30:43.884
<v Speaker 0>or should've.

00:30:45.085 --> 00:30:48.845
<v Speaker 0>We're learning lots today. That's good. Alright. Main

00:30:48.845 --> 00:30:49.725
<v Speaker 0>SQLite

00:30:49.725 --> 00:30:50.445
<v Speaker 0>three.

00:30:50.525 --> 00:30:52.044
<v Speaker 0>I think that's extension.

00:30:53.165 --> 00:30:54.365
<v Speaker 0>We'll call this host.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:57.460
<v Speaker 0>We'll give it a ID,

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:00.340
<v Speaker 0>which we're gonna make it string,

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:03.380
<v Speaker 0>non null primary key,

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:04.740
<v Speaker 0>all the happy stuff.

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:07.540
<v Speaker 0>We'll give this a nice name

00:31:08.485 --> 00:31:09.684
<v Speaker 0>text

00:31:09.924 --> 00:31:11.524
<v Speaker 0>also can't be null

00:31:11.605 --> 00:31:14.884
<v Speaker 0>and that's hopefully enough to get started.

00:31:15.365 --> 00:31:17.284
<v Speaker 0>How do I add data?

00:31:21.764 --> 00:31:22.565
<v Speaker 0>Oh, there we go.

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:28.670
<v Speaker 0>So we wanna enter arch as the ID

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:29.630
<v Speaker 0>and

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:32.190
<v Speaker 0>we're gonna give this a nice name of

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:33.309
<v Speaker 0>awesome

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:34.750
<v Speaker 0>arch machine.

00:31:39.535 --> 00:31:40.255
<v Speaker 0>Right.

00:31:42.095 --> 00:31:42.815
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:31:43.055 --> 00:31:44.415
<v Speaker 0>I guess that's it.

00:31:44.975 --> 00:31:47.135
<v Speaker 0>Wonder what SQLite fail looks like.

00:31:49.295 --> 00:31:49.935
<v Speaker 0>Is that it?

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:54.790
<v Speaker 0>When do they get that syntax in it?

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:55.830
<v Speaker 0>No. Okay.

00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:58.789
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Regardless.

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:02.310
<v Speaker 0>So we wanna start using this inside

00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:04.230
<v Speaker 0>of our data explorer.

00:32:04.684 --> 00:32:06.524
<v Speaker 0>So what I'm gonna do

00:32:07.325 --> 00:32:09.404
<v Speaker 0>is jump over to the script editor.

00:32:09.885 --> 00:32:11.885
<v Speaker 0>We can keep running that query, get a

00:32:11.885 --> 00:32:12.605
<v Speaker 0>graph.

00:32:12.924 --> 00:32:14.764
<v Speaker 0>I know. Let's just comment that out.

00:32:15.645 --> 00:32:17.244
<v Speaker 0>Jump back to this post

00:32:17.405 --> 00:32:20.445
<v Speaker 0>and just start by copying what they have.

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:25.059
<v Speaker 0>So import

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.059
<v Speaker 0>from SQL.

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:32.820
<v Speaker 0>My file is called main dot SQLite three,

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:35.539
<v Speaker 0>and I called that.

00:32:40.555 --> 00:32:41.595
<v Speaker 0>Hosts.

00:32:44.635 --> 00:32:46.395
<v Speaker 0>I'm seeing the raw data.

00:32:46.475 --> 00:32:47.115
<v Speaker 0>Go.

00:32:47.595 --> 00:32:49.835
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Now that's the same error.

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:54.010
<v Speaker 0>I'm sure.

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:56.330
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That they got.

00:32:57.610 --> 00:32:59.370
<v Speaker 0>So I mean the main thing I'm thinking

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:01.850
<v Speaker 0>right now is just that this path is

00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:03.850
<v Speaker 0>not a path. It's just a filename.

00:33:05.455 --> 00:33:07.215
<v Speaker 0>I can't even remember if it's the same

00:33:07.215 --> 00:33:09.215
<v Speaker 0>directory I run influx d from.

00:33:10.095 --> 00:33:12.895
<v Speaker 0>So, actually, I'm now really gonna regret this

00:33:12.895 --> 00:33:15.295
<v Speaker 0>path, but let's grab this.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.399
<v Speaker 0>Try main SQL eight three.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.000
<v Speaker 0>Still broken.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.320
<v Speaker 0>Right. Let's simplify that path then.

00:33:34.394 --> 00:33:36.874
<v Speaker 0>In fact, we'll copy it to temp

00:33:37.434 --> 00:33:38.475
<v Speaker 0>main.db

00:33:38.475 --> 00:33:40.394
<v Speaker 0>just because that's what they called theirs.

00:33:41.434 --> 00:33:42.874
<v Speaker 0>Main.db.

00:33:43.355 --> 00:33:44.394
<v Speaker 0>Let's try that.

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:51.299
<v Speaker 0>TMP main

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:53.539
<v Speaker 0>d p.

00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:59.140
<v Speaker 0>Still broken. No. Failed pass. When you use

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:00.260
<v Speaker 0>this format,

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:04.205
<v Speaker 0>sometimes one, sometimes two, sometimes three. Let's try

00:34:04.205 --> 00:34:05.005
<v Speaker 0>them all.

00:34:09.005 --> 00:34:10.765
<v Speaker 0>No. Definitely broken.

00:34:13.804 --> 00:34:14.525
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:34:14.685 --> 00:34:15.725
<v Speaker 0>So this

00:34:16.685 --> 00:34:18.719
<v Speaker 0>uses the go

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.640
<v Speaker 0>SQL library,

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:24.080
<v Speaker 0>I believe.

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.679
<v Speaker 0>Let's see if we can find an example

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:28.320
<v Speaker 0>from that.

00:34:30.684 --> 00:34:32.764
<v Speaker 0>Let me just check the cool mod fail

00:34:42.045 --> 00:34:43.005
<v Speaker 0>that sucks

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:46.710
<v Speaker 0>Flux.

00:34:49.350 --> 00:34:51.110
<v Speaker 0>Oh, that is a good point.

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:54.310
<v Speaker 0>Is this only available in Flux Rapple, or

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:55.510
<v Speaker 0>will it be available

00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:58.070
<v Speaker 0>in in FluxDB?

00:35:03.525 --> 00:35:06.085
<v Speaker 0>Alright. It looks like it may work. Okay.

00:35:07.445 --> 00:35:09.045
<v Speaker 0>Go mod. Go mod.

00:35:11.365 --> 00:35:12.245
<v Speaker 0>SQL.

00:35:12.485 --> 00:35:13.205
<v Speaker 0>Here we go.

00:35:17.809 --> 00:35:19.490
<v Speaker 0>Go SQL nine three.

00:35:28.815 --> 00:35:29.935
<v Speaker 0>Hey, Kieran.

00:35:32.015 --> 00:35:34.415
<v Speaker 0>Alright. How does this fucking work?

00:35:38.335 --> 00:35:38.975
<v Speaker 0>So

00:35:40.175 --> 00:35:40.974
<v Speaker 0>what is that?

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:42.280
<v Speaker 0>It?

00:35:42.599 --> 00:35:44.279
<v Speaker 0>I'm getting really fed up with seeing that

00:35:44.279 --> 00:35:44.920
<v Speaker 0>example.

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.240
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't

00:35:47.319 --> 00:35:48.440
<v Speaker 0>mean anything.

00:35:49.319 --> 00:35:50.359
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.599
<v Speaker 0>Let's search for a fail.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.760
<v Speaker 0>Seems to be the keyword here.

00:35:58.035 --> 00:35:59.555
<v Speaker 0>I

00:36:07.155 --> 00:36:08.195
<v Speaker 0>mean, that was

00:36:08.915 --> 00:36:09.715
<v Speaker 0>thoroughly useless.

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:12.950
<v Speaker 0>Let's try

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:15.190
<v Speaker 0>let's just search this whole repo.

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:19.030
<v Speaker 0>Let's

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:19.830
<v Speaker 0>try

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:21.350
<v Speaker 0>and force a cool on.

00:36:23.435 --> 00:36:26.555
<v Speaker 0>Oh, thanks, github. It was useless.

00:36:33.195 --> 00:36:34.635
<v Speaker 0>So what does that mean?

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:42.060
<v Speaker 0>Could it be

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:46.620
<v Speaker 0>I mean, do we need

00:36:49.195 --> 00:36:51.035
<v Speaker 0>that? No. Maybe.

00:37:01.195 --> 00:37:03.035
<v Speaker 0>Let's check out the docs.

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:10.980
<v Speaker 0>Fucking example.

00:37:18.635 --> 00:37:19.835
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So

00:37:20.075 --> 00:37:20.875
<v Speaker 0>should we

00:37:22.155 --> 00:37:23.035
<v Speaker 0>try

00:37:23.035 --> 00:37:24.555
<v Speaker 0>pull scripts first?

00:37:26.795 --> 00:37:28.075
<v Speaker 0>Let's try some

00:37:28.555 --> 00:37:30.520
<v Speaker 0>let's see if we get any logs. Where

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.080
<v Speaker 0>is

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.440
<v Speaker 0>and blocks.

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.520
<v Speaker 0>Nothing

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:35.400
<v Speaker 0>whatsoever.

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:38.920
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:39.720
<v Speaker 0>That's

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:41.800
<v Speaker 0>not very useful.

00:37:43.665 --> 00:37:44.785
<v Speaker 0>How about

00:37:46.145 --> 00:37:47.665
<v Speaker 0>let's go to

00:37:51.265 --> 00:37:53.665
<v Speaker 0>right now, I'm thinking this is potentially an

00:37:53.665 --> 00:37:56.065
<v Speaker 0>issue with the influx

00:37:56.465 --> 00:37:57.425
<v Speaker 0>DB build.

00:37:58.619 --> 00:38:01.180
<v Speaker 0>Maybe the flux library being a bit older.

00:38:04.299 --> 00:38:06.140
<v Speaker 0>So let's try and get it working with

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:08.300
<v Speaker 0>just straight up flux first.

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:11.420
<v Speaker 0>So I need to compile this.

00:38:12.075 --> 00:38:13.355
<v Speaker 0>Go modules

00:38:13.994 --> 00:38:14.715
<v Speaker 0>on

00:38:14.875 --> 00:38:16.395
<v Speaker 0>go build

00:38:17.115 --> 00:38:18.075
<v Speaker 0>c m d

00:38:18.315 --> 00:38:19.195
<v Speaker 0>flux.

00:38:20.555 --> 00:38:21.115
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully,

00:38:21.595 --> 00:38:22.715
<v Speaker 0>it won't take too long.

00:38:23.755 --> 00:38:25.675
<v Speaker 0>We'll copy that flux script,

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:31.110
<v Speaker 0>and I will make it my mission

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:33.510
<v Speaker 0>to get rid of every

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:34.710
<v Speaker 0>example

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:38.630
<v Speaker 0>that has

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.430
<v Speaker 0>that.

00:38:40.555 --> 00:38:43.115
<v Speaker 0>That's my my my new life's purpose.

00:38:43.195 --> 00:38:45.195
<v Speaker 0>Let's take a read of that example everywhere.

00:38:49.035 --> 00:38:49.835
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

00:38:49.915 --> 00:38:51.595
<v Speaker 0>come on flux, compile.

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:54.910
<v Speaker 0>So the really cool thing about running or

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:56.830
<v Speaker 0>at least running flux as a standalone binary

00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:58.110
<v Speaker 0>if there's a ripple,

00:38:58.190 --> 00:39:00.830
<v Speaker 0>I'm hoping we're gonna get slightly better

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:04.910
<v Speaker 0>error logs on what is actually going wrong.

00:39:06.905 --> 00:39:08.185
<v Speaker 0>Although that's the

00:39:08.825 --> 00:39:10.665
<v Speaker 0>best guess right now.

00:39:13.625 --> 00:39:16.105
<v Speaker 0>Well, I've been streaming forty minutes, and I've

00:39:16.105 --> 00:39:16.585
<v Speaker 0>gotten nowhere.

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:23.510
<v Speaker 0>So what can I do just now? Alright.

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:25.110
<v Speaker 0>So we have no logging here.

00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:28.070
<v Speaker 0>I mean, is there any other file

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:30.390
<v Speaker 0>formatting path that I'm missing?

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:33.430
<v Speaker 0>Where did I okay. Let's try where did

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:35.745
<v Speaker 0>I run influx d from?

00:39:39.825 --> 00:39:41.985
<v Speaker 0>What directory? Is that just my home?

00:39:44.145 --> 00:39:45.984
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I can kill it. Yeah. Okay.

00:39:45.984 --> 00:39:48.385
<v Speaker 0>So let's copy the file there too.

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:56.230
<v Speaker 0>All that finished, which is good, so we'll

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:57.270
<v Speaker 0>come back to that.

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:01.830
<v Speaker 0>Don't care about telegraph at this moment in

00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:05.190
<v Speaker 0>time, so let's copy our main

00:40:04.255 --> 00:40:06.575
<v Speaker 0>to home main.db.

00:40:07.615 --> 00:40:08.255
<v Speaker 0>And,

00:40:09.215 --> 00:40:11.455
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I'm the same user. It it

00:40:11.455 --> 00:40:12.495
<v Speaker 0>just shouldn't matter.

00:40:13.455 --> 00:40:15.855
<v Speaker 0>And let's try opening it now.

00:40:16.815 --> 00:40:17.215
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:23.490
<v Speaker 0>And because

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:24.850
<v Speaker 0>I'm just

00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:28.770
<v Speaker 0>very curious.

00:40:33.484 --> 00:40:34.525
<v Speaker 0>Main DB.

00:40:36.204 --> 00:40:37.724
<v Speaker 0>Main DB.

00:40:40.365 --> 00:40:41.964
<v Speaker 0>Maybe it just doesn't work.

00:40:42.765 --> 00:40:44.525
<v Speaker 0>Maybe that's what we're getting to here.

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:46.630
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's run.

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:54.070
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I just changed them to the right

00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:55.910
<v Speaker 0>here instead of running it. There we go.

00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:56.870
<v Speaker 0>Flux. Good.

00:40:59.625 --> 00:41:00.425
<v Speaker 0>Ruffle.

00:41:05.225 --> 00:41:06.585
<v Speaker 0>And your own time.

00:41:06.665 --> 00:41:08.905
<v Speaker 0>There we go. So let's import

00:41:08.905 --> 00:41:09.945
<v Speaker 0>SQL.

00:41:11.705 --> 00:41:13.705
<v Speaker 0>And I'm about to

00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:14.990
<v Speaker 0>let's just copy this.

00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:24.430
<v Speaker 0>Interesting.

00:41:27.185 --> 00:41:29.025
<v Speaker 0>That is interesting.

00:41:29.025 --> 00:41:31.105
<v Speaker 0>Let's try and get this on one line.

00:41:36.625 --> 00:41:38.305
<v Speaker 0>So it said no

00:41:39.025 --> 00:41:39.665
<v Speaker 0>table,

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:44.350
<v Speaker 0>which is, I think, progress. Unless InfluxDB is

00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:45.870
<v Speaker 0>just swallowing that, and that's the same error

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:47.310
<v Speaker 0>we've had the entire time.

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:51.790
<v Speaker 0>Now let's try

00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:53.150
<v Speaker 0>doing the temp one.

00:41:54.944 --> 00:41:56.865
<v Speaker 0>And then let's try incorrect

00:41:56.865 --> 00:41:58.545
<v Speaker 0>path and see if it's at the same.

00:42:02.305 --> 00:42:03.744
<v Speaker 0>That's annoying.

00:42:04.545 --> 00:42:05.984
<v Speaker 0>No such table

00:42:06.305 --> 00:42:06.785
<v Speaker 0>hosts.

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:11.720
<v Speaker 0>Let's try two slashes.

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:13.160
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:14.440
<v Speaker 0>that's definitely

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.360
<v Speaker 0>different. Let's try three.

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.960
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So two seems to be the magic

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:21.000
<v Speaker 0>incantation here.

00:42:24.704 --> 00:42:26.865
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no. That failed to exist anyway.

00:42:29.905 --> 00:42:31.984
<v Speaker 0>Why does that give us an SQL logic

00:42:31.984 --> 00:42:32.385
<v Speaker 0>error?

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:37.580
<v Speaker 0>It's

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.780
<v Speaker 0>still called main dot DB, isn't it? Yeah.

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:45.660
<v Speaker 0>Oh, wait. Temp. Temp.

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:46.300
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:42:52.245 --> 00:42:54.325
<v Speaker 0>SQL logic error.

00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:08.310
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:12.150
<v Speaker 0>We do have a table called hosts.

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:14.630
<v Speaker 0>Open database.

00:43:15.795 --> 00:43:16.835
<v Speaker 0>TMP

00:43:16.835 --> 00:43:17.635
<v Speaker 0>main

00:43:18.994 --> 00:43:19.875
<v Speaker 0>DB.

00:43:21.315 --> 00:43:22.195
<v Speaker 0>Tables,

00:43:22.434 --> 00:43:23.395
<v Speaker 0>hosts.

00:43:25.234 --> 00:43:26.275
<v Speaker 0>Select

00:43:26.355 --> 00:43:28.275
<v Speaker 0>star from hosts.

00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:30.310
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:37.110
<v Speaker 0>So maybe this has just never been tested.

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:40.150
<v Speaker 0>So there's a good idea.

00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:42.470
<v Speaker 0>Let's look at the test suite.

00:43:44.965 --> 00:43:45.605
<v Speaker 0>So

00:43:46.724 --> 00:43:48.965
<v Speaker 0>where would this be? Standard loop

00:43:50.645 --> 00:43:51.605
<v Speaker 0>SQL.

00:43:51.845 --> 00:43:52.565
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:43:55.845 --> 00:43:56.885
<v Speaker 0>SQLite test.

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:00.490
<v Speaker 0>We're gonna get there.

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:04.650
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's see. So write values to the

00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:05.450
<v Speaker 0>DB.

00:44:10.809 --> 00:44:12.650
<v Speaker 0>So I wonder if we could try that.

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:14.970
<v Speaker 0>Maybe we could try, like, a create tables

00:44:14.445 --> 00:44:15.325
<v Speaker 0>command

00:44:18.045 --> 00:44:19.965
<v Speaker 0>rather than pulling anything

00:44:21.405 --> 00:44:22.285
<v Speaker 0>out.

00:44:24.605 --> 00:44:25.485
<v Speaker 0>Curious.

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.760
<v Speaker 0>Let's see if we can find fail colon.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:30.560
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:35.680
<v Speaker 0>Oh, wait. That's just a I'm just using

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:37.119
<v Speaker 0>the memory one, aren't they?

00:44:37.839 --> 00:44:40.160
<v Speaker 0>Dot open. Memory. Memory. Memory.

00:44:40.799 --> 00:44:40.960
<v Speaker 0>Memory.

00:44:44.745 --> 00:44:46.185
<v Speaker 0>It looks to me like we need a

00:44:46.185 --> 00:44:47.865
<v Speaker 0>test that actually opens a fail

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:10.480
<v Speaker 0>I wonder why the two slashes gives me

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:11.440
<v Speaker 0>that logic thing.

00:45:15.925 --> 00:45:17.605
<v Speaker 0>Oh, wait. Hold on a minute.

00:45:18.885 --> 00:45:20.565
<v Speaker 0>Mode equals memory.

00:45:23.365 --> 00:45:24.245
<v Speaker 0>What does that do?

00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:30.490
<v Speaker 0>Try slash.

00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:36.970
<v Speaker 0>Quite happy with that.

00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:39.530
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:45:40.224 --> 00:45:42.785
<v Speaker 0>There's mode memory. I noticed that in

00:45:43.825 --> 00:45:44.865
<v Speaker 0>the test,

00:45:46.545 --> 00:45:48.944
<v Speaker 0>which stops it opening the file. So let's

00:45:48.944 --> 00:45:50.465
<v Speaker 0>jump back here,

00:45:51.825 --> 00:45:53.665
<v Speaker 0>and we're just gonna go back to main

00:45:53.665 --> 00:45:54.545
<v Speaker 0>DB

00:45:54.545 --> 00:45:55.585
<v Speaker 0>cache shared.

00:45:56.810 --> 00:45:58.010
<v Speaker 0>Take that off.

00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:01.450
<v Speaker 0>Oh, come on. Okay. Let's try it from

00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:02.170
<v Speaker 0>flux.

00:46:06.010 --> 00:46:07.690
<v Speaker 0>Oh, wait. We did. Okay. It worked.

00:46:08.645 --> 00:46:09.445
<v Speaker 0>Fail,

00:46:09.445 --> 00:46:10.005
<v Speaker 0>colon,

00:46:10.805 --> 00:46:11.925
<v Speaker 0>main DB.

00:46:15.925 --> 00:46:18.005
<v Speaker 0>So it doesn't work in influx DB,

00:46:18.885 --> 00:46:22.280
<v Speaker 0>but it does work here on the command

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:24.040
<v Speaker 0>line with the Flux repo.

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:27.960
<v Speaker 0>And I

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:29.960
<v Speaker 0>don't believe

00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:32.280
<v Speaker 0>there is

00:46:32.775 --> 00:46:35.015
<v Speaker 0>anything different in those queries.

00:46:41.895 --> 00:46:44.775
<v Speaker 0>Now the problem just could be that it's

00:46:45.335 --> 00:46:47.575
<v Speaker 0>not time series data,

00:46:47.734 --> 00:46:49.870
<v Speaker 0>so let's try saying

00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:55.790
<v Speaker 0>nice names equals,

00:46:56.110 --> 00:46:58.670
<v Speaker 0>and then let's bring back in this query

00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:01.550
<v Speaker 0>because the UI

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:03.150
<v Speaker 0>can get a little bit funny.

00:47:08.375 --> 00:47:11.495
<v Speaker 0>I'm bringing a computer. So so now I

00:47:11.495 --> 00:47:13.015
<v Speaker 0>think this is working,

00:47:13.415 --> 00:47:16.215
<v Speaker 0>but the UI needs to see things in

00:47:17.735 --> 00:47:20.570
<v Speaker 0>a very particular format. So let's try

00:47:20.890 --> 00:47:22.090
<v Speaker 0>doing a map.

00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:26.970
<v Speaker 0>Pass in the row.

00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:29.530
<v Speaker 0>We wanna execute some code.

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:32.890
<v Speaker 0>What we're gonna do here is return

00:47:33.755 --> 00:47:34.795
<v Speaker 0>r with,

00:47:36.075 --> 00:47:38.635
<v Speaker 0>and we're gonna add nice name.

00:47:40.475 --> 00:47:41.995
<v Speaker 0>And right now, let's just put my username

00:47:41.995 --> 00:47:43.755
<v Speaker 0>and check if the syntax works.

00:47:43.915 --> 00:47:45.195
<v Speaker 0>No. What have I got wrong?

00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:48.109
<v Speaker 0>Because I'm using multiline.

00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:50.270
<v Speaker 0>Uh-huh.

00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:53.230
<v Speaker 0>And that gives us a nice name of

00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:54.190
<v Speaker 0>Rawkode.

00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:57.309
<v Speaker 0>So let's now see if we can

00:47:59.285 --> 00:48:02.165
<v Speaker 0>pull something out of this nice names

00:48:04.325 --> 00:48:05.685
<v Speaker 0>variable. Now the

00:48:06.085 --> 00:48:09.204
<v Speaker 0>UI doesn't provide great debugging tools. Let me

00:48:09.204 --> 00:48:10.164
<v Speaker 0>turn off that refresh.

00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:14.819
<v Speaker 0>For our introspection, what this value even looks

00:48:14.819 --> 00:48:15.380
<v Speaker 0>like.

00:48:17.619 --> 00:48:18.900
<v Speaker 0>So for now,

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:22.660
<v Speaker 0>let's pull in JSON and see if I

00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:24.980
<v Speaker 0>can get a JSON representation

00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:25.540
<v Speaker 0>of it.

00:48:30.644 --> 00:48:31.925
<v Speaker 0>Nice names.

00:48:35.204 --> 00:48:36.325
<v Speaker 0>Unknown type.

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:42.990
<v Speaker 0>It's an array according to this.

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:44.830
<v Speaker 0>Thank you, LSP.

00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:46.670
<v Speaker 0>I

00:48:46.830 --> 00:48:48.590
<v Speaker 0>should be able to

00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:51.630
<v Speaker 0>encode

00:48:53.685 --> 00:48:56.005
<v Speaker 0>an array, but it might just be

00:48:56.805 --> 00:48:59.205
<v Speaker 0>we expect a string there. Perfect.

00:49:00.645 --> 00:49:01.285
<v Speaker 0>So

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:10.740
<v Speaker 0>So that's not executed

00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:14.740
<v Speaker 0>a query.

00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:18.980
<v Speaker 0>In fact, I'm just getting back

00:49:21.505 --> 00:49:23.025
<v Speaker 0>Data source name.

00:49:27.825 --> 00:49:29.905
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's not really what I want.

00:49:30.625 --> 00:49:32.145
<v Speaker 0>What I want is that.

00:49:34.065 --> 00:49:35.105
<v Speaker 0>How do I get that?

00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:44.990
<v Speaker 0>Do we have access to anything?

00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:47.790
<v Speaker 0>Result.

00:49:51.725 --> 00:49:52.365
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:49:53.405 --> 00:49:56.205
<v Speaker 0>So it comes back here. Yeah. Result. Result.

00:49:59.325 --> 00:49:59.965
<v Speaker 0>Result.

00:50:03.245 --> 00:50:03.725
<v Speaker 0>Nope.

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:11.740
<v Speaker 0>What a brick. What a brick.

00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:21.315
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's try

00:50:21.875 --> 00:50:23.155
<v Speaker 0>temp.

00:50:25.715 --> 00:50:27.635
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. We're just gonna send back. And then

00:50:27.635 --> 00:50:29.315
<v Speaker 0>just because I wanna see if it actually

00:50:29.475 --> 00:50:30.995
<v Speaker 0>fail if it ever does.

00:50:31.715 --> 00:50:32.115
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:37.740
<v Speaker 0>So there must I guess I mean, I'll

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:39.819
<v Speaker 0>need to check with the flux team, what

00:50:39.819 --> 00:50:41.500
<v Speaker 0>I can kind of tell right now,

00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:45.900
<v Speaker 0>maybe there's a version mismatch.

00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:47.020
<v Speaker 0>Definitely working here.

00:50:50.825 --> 00:50:52.505
<v Speaker 0>I get back what I want. I get

00:50:52.505 --> 00:50:54.505
<v Speaker 0>my ID. I get the nice name.

00:50:56.105 --> 00:50:58.505
<v Speaker 0>I'm just not getting

00:51:00.665 --> 00:51:01.625
<v Speaker 0>anything here.

00:51:05.050 --> 00:51:06.570
<v Speaker 0>Select star from point. Yeah. I mean, it's

00:51:06.570 --> 00:51:08.090
<v Speaker 0>the same query I pasted in.

00:51:13.609 --> 00:51:14.810
<v Speaker 0>I

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:18.250
<v Speaker 0>think I'm at a loose end,

00:51:21.194 --> 00:51:21.835
<v Speaker 0>but

00:51:22.315 --> 00:51:24.075
<v Speaker 0>we we fixed a few things.

00:51:25.755 --> 00:51:27.515
<v Speaker 0>We did get it opened. We did get

00:51:27.515 --> 00:51:29.195
<v Speaker 0>the results using flux,

00:51:29.515 --> 00:51:30.315
<v Speaker 0>which is good,

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:33.119
<v Speaker 0>But we can't

00:51:33.119 --> 00:51:35.200
<v Speaker 0>bring that over to influx DB.

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:38.640
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:41.520
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna finish up shortly. If anyone has

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:44.000
<v Speaker 0>any questions on what you've seen or parts

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000
<v Speaker 0>seen or wanna see something else, I'll give

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.484
<v Speaker 0>you a few minutes while I mumble to

00:51:47.484 --> 00:51:49.405
<v Speaker 0>myself about what else I could try.

00:51:50.925 --> 00:51:53.085
<v Speaker 0>And I think I'll shut this down, grab

00:51:53.085 --> 00:51:55.325
<v Speaker 0>some lunch, and then pick up another community

00:51:55.325 --> 00:51:57.484
<v Speaker 0>issue after lunch and see if I can

00:51:57.484 --> 00:51:58.365
<v Speaker 0>get a bit more success.

00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:07.260
<v Speaker 0>Do we have any examples?

00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:08.940
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I could always spin up a

00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:09.900
<v Speaker 0>Postgres, I guess.

00:52:12.275 --> 00:52:14.675
<v Speaker 0>But the question was about SQLite.

00:52:15.315 --> 00:52:17.155
<v Speaker 0>And this example is just wrong.

00:52:18.275 --> 00:52:20.915
<v Speaker 0>I think when fail is here, mode memory

00:52:20.915 --> 00:52:22.115
<v Speaker 0>needs to just disappear.

00:52:25.350 --> 00:52:27.590
<v Speaker 0>That's definitely what broke it from here.

00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:31.510
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:34.150
<v Speaker 0>Because it's it's saying it's not memory SQLite

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:35.750
<v Speaker 0>store from what I can tell.

00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:38.230
<v Speaker 0>So that's good. We can update that. We

00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.870
<v Speaker 0>can fix that.

00:52:40.745 --> 00:52:43.225
<v Speaker 0>And it's a path which we can document.

00:52:48.105 --> 00:52:49.465
<v Speaker 0>That's creating

00:52:49.545 --> 00:52:50.985
<v Speaker 0>I mean, can I create?

00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:54.160
<v Speaker 0>Let's try that. So

00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:57.360
<v Speaker 0>I create

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:00.880
<v Speaker 0>table

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:03.200
<v Speaker 0>new table.

00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:04.720
<v Speaker 0>I mean, can I just do that?

00:53:09.585 --> 00:53:10.944
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna show

00:53:10.944 --> 00:53:13.505
<v Speaker 0>my lack of knowledge here. SQLite

00:53:13.505 --> 00:53:14.464
<v Speaker 0>create.

00:53:15.184 --> 00:53:17.424
<v Speaker 0>Maybe create database is a bit easier. I

00:53:17.424 --> 00:53:19.025
<v Speaker 0>don't know if that is that is a

00:53:19.025 --> 00:53:19.424
<v Speaker 0>database.

00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:22.270
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's see.

00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:25.710
<v Speaker 0>Just

00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:28.670
<v Speaker 0>give me an example. Perfect.

00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:29.950
<v Speaker 0>You are the one.

00:53:37.585 --> 00:53:38.545
<v Speaker 0>Read only.

00:53:44.065 --> 00:53:44.785
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:53:45.105 --> 00:53:46.305
<v Speaker 0>How do we open?

00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:51.420
<v Speaker 0>Open.

00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:52.860
<v Speaker 0>Retry.

00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:56.620
<v Speaker 0>What's the magic incantation for that?

00:54:05.575 --> 00:54:07.095
<v Speaker 0>Mode equals

00:54:09.015 --> 00:54:10.535
<v Speaker 0>can I just do RW?

00:54:17.655 --> 00:54:17.975
<v Speaker 0>Nope.

00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:20.760
<v Speaker 0>That would have been too nice.

00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:26.680
<v Speaker 0>Maybe we should look at

00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:28.920
<v Speaker 0>the library we're actually using,

00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:33.880
<v Speaker 0>which was on one of these tabs.

00:54:35.375 --> 00:54:36.015
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:54:38.335 --> 00:54:40.175
<v Speaker 0>I always wish that Chrome had a command

00:54:40.175 --> 00:54:42.655
<v Speaker 0>palette like Versus Code where I could just,

00:54:42.655 --> 00:54:43.055
<v Speaker 0>like,

00:54:43.535 --> 00:54:45.455
<v Speaker 0>type in roughly what I want.

00:54:47.055 --> 00:54:48.095
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Alright.

00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:50.430
<v Speaker 0>Good. Mode.

00:54:54.110 --> 00:54:54.990
<v Speaker 0>RW.

00:55:00.590 --> 00:55:02.990
<v Speaker 0>Now I was sure

00:55:04.214 --> 00:55:07.015
<v Speaker 0>there was SQL two support. Yeah.

00:55:08.375 --> 00:55:10.135
<v Speaker 0>Which means I must be able to open

00:55:10.135 --> 00:55:10.775
<v Speaker 0>it.

00:55:12.295 --> 00:55:13.335
<v Speaker 0>I just read right.

00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:17.440
<v Speaker 0>There's a fucking memory again.

00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:21.840
<v Speaker 0>Sorry. My language is dreadful.

00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:23.120
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:26.640
<v Speaker 0>So there's no mention of even

00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:29.280
<v Speaker 0>attempting to open this in readwrite mode.

00:55:33.205 --> 00:55:35.285
<v Speaker 0>So access mode of the database.

00:55:36.805 --> 00:55:39.925
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's take a look at SQLite open.

00:55:43.365 --> 00:55:45.045
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. We've already been on that page.

00:55:47.130 --> 00:55:48.410
<v Speaker 0>Mode equals

00:55:48.730 --> 00:55:49.609
<v Speaker 0>RO.

00:55:49.609 --> 00:55:50.570
<v Speaker 0>Read only.

00:55:56.730 --> 00:55:57.609
<v Speaker 0>Definitely

00:55:57.609 --> 00:55:58.890
<v Speaker 0>not having a lucky day.

00:56:01.085 --> 00:56:02.685
<v Speaker 0>Mode equals rewrite.

00:56:03.405 --> 00:56:06.045
<v Speaker 0>So maybe my cache

00:56:06.045 --> 00:56:06.845
<v Speaker 0>then

00:56:06.845 --> 00:56:08.605
<v Speaker 0>is disabling this.

00:56:09.645 --> 00:56:10.285
<v Speaker 0>So

00:56:12.685 --> 00:56:14.125
<v Speaker 0>can I just remove that?

00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:22.910
<v Speaker 0>I feel like I'm clutching it's dry, but

00:56:25.309 --> 00:56:26.990
<v Speaker 0>it's definitely not really gone, though.

00:56:35.085 --> 00:56:35.805
<v Speaker 0>Wait.

00:56:37.165 --> 00:56:37.885
<v Speaker 0>What could it be?

00:56:45.619 --> 00:56:48.500
<v Speaker 0>I ran the flux process as myself,

00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:52.020
<v Speaker 0>so it shouldn't be permissions.

00:56:54.234 --> 00:56:56.715
<v Speaker 0>Let's try the temp one.

00:56:57.195 --> 00:56:57.915
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

00:56:59.835 --> 00:57:01.355
<v Speaker 0>okay. It was permissions.

00:57:03.275 --> 00:57:05.275
<v Speaker 0>So let's try opening

00:57:05.515 --> 00:57:08.395
<v Speaker 0>that

00:57:06.810 --> 00:57:08.010
<v Speaker 0>and this.

00:57:11.450 --> 00:57:12.970
<v Speaker 0>We have our new table.

00:57:13.290 --> 00:57:16.330
<v Speaker 0>K. Let's try that from here, which was

00:57:16.330 --> 00:57:17.450
<v Speaker 0>our plan

00:57:18.330 --> 00:57:19.770
<v Speaker 0>to see if,

00:57:20.785 --> 00:57:22.545
<v Speaker 0>well, I can't remember.

00:57:22.945 --> 00:57:24.625
<v Speaker 0>Definitely had a plan, though.

00:57:25.905 --> 00:57:28.225
<v Speaker 0>I wanted to see if it was just

00:57:28.385 --> 00:57:30.065
<v Speaker 0>inversion mismatch.

00:57:31.345 --> 00:57:32.865
<v Speaker 0>So we're gonna try this.

00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:37.860
<v Speaker 0>Let's try t two.

00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:39.780
<v Speaker 0>Oh, we still need this to actually do

00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:42.020
<v Speaker 0>something so the UI doesn't give us an

00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:42.660
<v Speaker 0>error.

00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:43.700
<v Speaker 0>Two.

00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:49.665
<v Speaker 0>Oh, too much.

00:57:54.785 --> 00:57:56.305
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's fine. Whatever.

00:57:57.345 --> 00:57:59.345
<v Speaker 0>Did that create t two?

00:58:00.545 --> 00:58:02.150
<v Speaker 0>That is a question.

00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:10.070
<v Speaker 0>Temp.

00:58:13.110 --> 00:58:13.910
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:15.030
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:15.750
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So,

00:58:18.505 --> 00:58:19.865
<v Speaker 0>yeah, definitely

00:58:20.425 --> 00:58:22.425
<v Speaker 0>the SQL stuff

00:58:25.305 --> 00:58:26.345
<v Speaker 0>just doesn't

00:58:26.505 --> 00:58:27.225
<v Speaker 0>oh.

00:58:27.865 --> 00:58:29.945
<v Speaker 0>Let's take off this map just just in

00:58:29.945 --> 00:58:30.825
<v Speaker 0>case it's the error.

00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:32.890
<v Speaker 0>Let's see the query work.

00:58:41.210 --> 00:58:42.250
<v Speaker 0>Say what?

00:58:43.210 --> 00:58:45.050
<v Speaker 0>Let's try assigning this to nothing.

00:58:46.865 --> 00:58:47.585
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:58:50.545 --> 00:58:53.425
<v Speaker 0>Just double check how do I reload?

00:58:57.345 --> 00:58:58.225
<v Speaker 0>Can I

00:59:00.065 --> 00:59:01.105
<v Speaker 0>open it again?

00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:05.080
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It doesn't

00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:08.760
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I'm just gonna have to be

00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:10.040
<v Speaker 0>super sure.

00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:12.760
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't seem like I can do much

00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:13.400
<v Speaker 0>from

00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:14.440
<v Speaker 0>MySQL,

00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:15.400
<v Speaker 0>the NTP

00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:16.840
<v Speaker 0>version. Yeah.

00:59:17.515 --> 00:59:19.275
<v Speaker 0>So we're not getting that table.

00:59:20.555 --> 00:59:21.995
<v Speaker 0>Interestingly enough,

00:59:26.555 --> 00:59:28.555
<v Speaker 0>it is trying to have some sort of

00:59:28.555 --> 00:59:29.355
<v Speaker 0>result

00:59:30.339 --> 00:59:30.980
<v Speaker 0>here

00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:37.940
<v Speaker 0>just because I hate things

00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:39.700
<v Speaker 0>being unanswered.

00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:42.820
<v Speaker 0>R

00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:45.380
<v Speaker 0>with

00:59:46.095 --> 00:59:47.375
<v Speaker 0>SQLite,

00:59:47.775 --> 00:59:49.775
<v Speaker 0>which is gonna be string

00:59:49.775 --> 00:59:51.215
<v Speaker 0>v JSON

00:59:51.215 --> 00:59:52.255
<v Speaker 0>encode

00:59:52.655 --> 00:59:53.455
<v Speaker 0>the

00:59:53.535 --> 00:59:54.175
<v Speaker 0>result.

00:59:56.910 --> 00:59:58.270
<v Speaker 0>What if I go wrong?

00:59:59.630 --> 01:00:00.430
<v Speaker 0>Map.

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:01.470
<v Speaker 0>RMov.

01:00:04.030 --> 01:00:07.470
<v Speaker 0>I just got a wrong number. One, two,

01:00:07.550 --> 01:00:08.510
<v Speaker 0>three, four.

01:00:15.275 --> 01:00:17.435
<v Speaker 0>Oh, wait. I don't need to surround

01:00:17.595 --> 01:00:19.035
<v Speaker 0>that. Right? No.

01:00:21.115 --> 01:00:23.275
<v Speaker 0>And the string function is called string. Right?

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:29.480
<v Speaker 0>Let's just use multilane.

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:30.760
<v Speaker 0>Return.

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:33.400
<v Speaker 0>Wrap that in object syntax.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.120
<v Speaker 0>Close JSON.

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:38.280
<v Speaker 0>Close string. Close that.

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:39.560
<v Speaker 0>Close this this.

01:00:40.644 --> 01:00:41.365
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

01:00:44.085 --> 01:00:46.005
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. We're not getting a result back. Keep

01:00:46.005 --> 01:00:46.645
<v Speaker 0>in mind,

01:00:47.125 --> 01:00:48.644
<v Speaker 0>I was complaining. I don't know. I think

01:00:48.644 --> 01:00:49.765
<v Speaker 0>I'll need to speak to some people on

01:00:49.765 --> 01:00:51.605
<v Speaker 0>the team about what's actually going on here.

01:00:52.884 --> 01:00:55.045
<v Speaker 0>So in response to this person's question,

01:00:56.609 --> 01:00:57.650
<v Speaker 0>I

01:00:57.730 --> 01:00:58.690
<v Speaker 0>have no idea.

01:01:00.849 --> 01:01:02.690
<v Speaker 0>I don't have enough history to go back.

01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:04.130
<v Speaker 0>I'll go back to it in a minute.

01:01:05.010 --> 01:01:06.690
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we could get it working from

01:01:06.690 --> 01:01:08.049
<v Speaker 0>Flux CLI,

01:01:09.605 --> 01:01:12.005
<v Speaker 0>but we cannot get it working from InfluxDB.

01:01:12.005 --> 01:01:12.965
<v Speaker 0>I'll need to

01:01:13.285 --> 01:01:15.125
<v Speaker 0>get that docs fixed on,

01:01:15.285 --> 01:01:16.805
<v Speaker 0>speak to our Flux team,

01:01:17.444 --> 01:01:19.525
<v Speaker 0>and see if this is just that InfluxDB

01:01:19.525 --> 01:01:21.525
<v Speaker 0>hasn't got the latest and greatest version or

01:01:21.525 --> 01:01:23.845
<v Speaker 0>if there is something more sinister.

01:01:23.845 --> 01:01:27.000
<v Speaker 0>Maybe there's some security implications about

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:30.040
<v Speaker 0>loading from the desk, maybe,

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.880
<v Speaker 0>when fluxes

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:34.680
<v Speaker 0>and the sandbox environment that influx DB provides.

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:35.640
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure.

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:39.045
<v Speaker 0>Anyway, that's been an hour and five minutes.

01:01:39.045 --> 01:01:40.405
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna grab some lunch, and I'll be

01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:42.405
<v Speaker 0>back in a bit. But if you persevered

01:01:42.405 --> 01:01:44.165
<v Speaker 0>with me, thank you for joining me. Let

01:01:44.165 --> 01:01:46.085
<v Speaker 0>me know what you thought on Twitter.

01:01:46.405 --> 01:01:48.405
<v Speaker 0>And anything you wanna see with influxDB,

01:01:48.405 --> 01:01:50.565
<v Speaker 0>flux, or any surrounding monitoring

01:01:50.565 --> 01:01:52.565
<v Speaker 0>or observability technology, just let me know.

01:01:53.211 --> 01:01:54.091
<v Speaker 0>Thanks for your time.
