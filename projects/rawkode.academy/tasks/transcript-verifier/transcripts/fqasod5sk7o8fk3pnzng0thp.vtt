<v Speaker 0>Welcome to Cloud Native Compass,

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.880
<v Speaker 0>a podcast to help you navigate the vast

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.120
<v Speaker 0>landscape of the cloud native ecosystem.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.920
<v Speaker 1>We're your hosts. I'm David Flanagan, a technology

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.400
<v Speaker 1>magpie that can't stop playing with new shiny

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.494
<v Speaker 1>things. I'm Laura Santa Maria, a forever learner

00:00:15.494 --> 00:00:18.455
<v Speaker 0>who is constantly breaking production. David is supposed

00:00:18.455 --> 00:00:20.295
<v Speaker 0>to be working on something open source at

00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:20.855
<v Speaker 0>this point,

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:23.494
<v Speaker 0>at least according to our current guest, Kat

00:00:23.494 --> 00:00:25.654
<v Speaker 0>Cosgrove, one of the sub project leads for

00:00:25.654 --> 00:00:28.790
<v Speaker 0>SIG release in the Kubernetes project. Kubernetes is

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.510
<v Speaker 1>the second biggest open source project in the

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.990
<v Speaker 1>world,

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.310
<v Speaker 1>which means the only people being paid to

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.710
<v Speaker 1>contribute to Kubernetes are the lawyers. In this

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.430
<v Speaker 0>episode,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.510
<v Speaker 0>we didn't even bring up Rust,

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.590
<v Speaker 0>but we did get to talk with Kat

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.885
<v Speaker 0>about the release process and what being a

00:00:43.885 --> 00:00:45.005
<v Speaker 0>maintainer is like,

00:00:45.405 --> 00:00:48.685
<v Speaker 0>including burnout and handling drive by PRs. Enjoy

00:00:48.685 --> 00:00:50.685
<v Speaker 1>this episode. And for a bit of fun,

00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:54.045
<v Speaker 1>one project has caused numerous delays to the

00:00:54.045 --> 00:00:56.765
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes release. Can you guess what it is?

00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:57.005
<v Speaker 1>Enjoy.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.769
<v Speaker 0>David and I are excited to have Kat

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:00.329
<v Speaker 0>on.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.489
<v Speaker 0>Kat is here. Yay.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.610
<v Speaker 0>Hello. Hi, Kat. Yay. You sound so excited.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.009
<v Speaker 2>I'm not well known for my enthusiasm. No.

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.090
<v Speaker 0>No. I know. It's okay. Yeah. You're well

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.170
<v Speaker 1>with the Scottish audience and the Scottish culture

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.415
<v Speaker 1>because you're dry as fuck, and I love

00:01:14.415 --> 00:01:17.055
<v Speaker 1>it. Thank you. Thank you. Well, so for

00:01:17.055 --> 00:01:18.815
<v Speaker 0>for those of you who don't know us,

00:01:18.815 --> 00:01:20.495
<v Speaker 0>the three of us used to work together,

00:01:20.495 --> 00:01:22.175
<v Speaker 0>and so this is gonna be a highly

00:01:22.175 --> 00:01:24.735
<v Speaker 0>entertaining podcast, I think, more than anything else.

00:01:24.895 --> 00:01:27.375
<v Speaker 0>But we are trying to talk about the

00:01:27.375 --> 00:01:29.055
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes release cycle

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.920
<v Speaker 0>on this, and who knows if we're gonna

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.600
<v Speaker 0>stick to it? But we're gonna find out.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.160
<v Speaker 2>So We'll try. Yeah. Why not? David, do

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.000
<v Speaker 0>you have, like, a first question? Otherwise,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.880
<v Speaker 0>we're just gonna dive in. I don't know.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. We'll kick it off with a

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.885
<v Speaker 1>nice low hanging fruit, easy to answer. Lubricate

00:01:44.885 --> 00:01:46.165
<v Speaker 1>the the conversation.

00:01:46.245 --> 00:01:48.405
<v Speaker 1>I've never used that before ever.

00:01:48.645 --> 00:01:50.565
<v Speaker 1>And then I said it out loud. Lubricate.

00:01:50.565 --> 00:01:52.085
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think we regret that

00:01:52.085 --> 00:01:52.565
<v Speaker 2>one.

00:01:52.885 --> 00:01:54.965
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. File that away, so don't do it

00:01:54.965 --> 00:01:56.005
<v Speaker 2>again. Jesus.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.400
<v Speaker 1>I was actually wanting to make, like, a

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.240
<v Speaker 1>whiskey and bourbon

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.560
<v Speaker 1>intro, and I could quite connect the dots

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.720
<v Speaker 1>in my head about looking at the conversation.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.560
<v Speaker 0>So our guests who are joining us in

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.800
<v Speaker 0>the middle of this conversation, we already have

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.440
<v Speaker 0>been talking for about forty minutes, including about

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.385
<v Speaker 0>bourbon. So there was an attempt, David. That

00:02:14.385 --> 00:02:15.105
<v Speaker 0>was a

00:02:15.425 --> 00:02:17.105
<v Speaker 0>entertaining attempt at

00:02:17.425 --> 00:02:19.265
<v Speaker 0>drawing us back to bourbon.

00:02:19.425 --> 00:02:21.345
<v Speaker 0>But maybe we should talk about tech first.

00:02:21.345 --> 00:02:22.865
<v Speaker 0>Then we can talk about bourbon

00:02:23.025 --> 00:02:25.970
<v Speaker 0>again. Alright. I don't love computers. Yeah. What

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.730
<v Speaker 0>is the who who taught sand to think?

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.090
<v Speaker 0>Who thought that was a good idea?

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.650
<v Speaker 2>I thought teaching sand to think was fine.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.970
<v Speaker 2>Letting the talking sand

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.290
<v Speaker 2>communicate with other talking sand,

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.730
<v Speaker 2>that's where we fucked up.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.810
<v Speaker 2>That's where we veered off course, I think.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.195
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Sounds makes sense. Okay. I'm trying to

00:02:43.195 --> 00:02:44.715
<v Speaker 0>lubricate the conversation.

00:02:45.595 --> 00:02:48.235
<v Speaker 1>Lubricating up. Right? Let's go.

00:02:48.315 --> 00:02:50.075
<v Speaker 1>No. I'm not gonna make that joke. So

00:02:50.075 --> 00:02:51.275
<v Speaker 1>let's cat

00:02:51.435 --> 00:02:52.075
<v Speaker 1>you

00:02:52.235 --> 00:02:53.035
<v Speaker 1>led

00:02:53.115 --> 00:02:55.675
<v Speaker 1>the release, our previous release. I think we're

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:57.860
<v Speaker 1>now back to releases there. It was called,

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know how to pronounce it,

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.900
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes. Is that right? I

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.020
<v Speaker 2>was the release lead for Oh, Kubernetes.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.700
<v Speaker 1>But you're also continuing your work, right? I

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.020
<v Speaker 2>am. I own the release team sub project

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 2>now. Now I am the release lead's boss

00:03:12.875 --> 00:03:14.235
<v Speaker 2>and mom

00:03:14.555 --> 00:03:16.315
<v Speaker 2>and personal assistant

00:03:16.635 --> 00:03:18.235
<v Speaker 2>and housekeeper.

00:03:18.235 --> 00:03:20.395
<v Speaker 0>There you go. There you go. Yeah.

00:03:21.194 --> 00:03:22.875
<v Speaker 0>You went to All right. So let's cover

00:03:22.875 --> 00:03:25.035
<v Speaker 1>this through both angles. Let's understand

00:03:25.114 --> 00:03:28.950
<v Speaker 1>what's involved in leading a release, naming all

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.710
<v Speaker 1>the fun bits as well as the hardships.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.550
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe we can talk broader about

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.110
<v Speaker 1>just how much effort goes into each release,

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.430
<v Speaker 1>the people involved, and how people can inevitably

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.910
<v Speaker 1>contribute and help out. Because, obviously, this is

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.990
<v Speaker 1>a fast moving project. Kubernetes has not stopped

00:03:42.275 --> 00:03:44.115
<v Speaker 1>in many years. And I'd love to get

00:03:44.115 --> 00:03:45.315
<v Speaker 1>into that in more detail.

00:03:45.635 --> 00:03:48.435
<v Speaker 2>Sure. So we do three releases a year.

00:03:48.435 --> 00:03:50.435
<v Speaker 2>Each cycle is about

00:03:50.995 --> 00:03:54.355
<v Speaker 2>four months long. There's a week ish and

00:03:54.355 --> 00:03:55.955
<v Speaker 2>a half of gap between each release where

00:03:55.955 --> 00:03:58.550
<v Speaker 2>we're not doing anything, which is nice. But

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.630
<v Speaker 2>yeah, we don't really slow down at any

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.270
<v Speaker 2>point during the year, which is unfortunate for

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.590
<v Speaker 2>us, but fortunate for people who rely on

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.110
<v Speaker 2>Kubernetes. If you want

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.950
<v Speaker 2>new updates frequently.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.310
<v Speaker 2>And the release team is

00:04:10.795 --> 00:04:12.394
<v Speaker 2>not as large as it used to be,

00:04:12.394 --> 00:04:13.355
<v Speaker 2>but it is still

00:04:13.595 --> 00:04:15.915
<v Speaker 2>quite large. The team itself is made up

00:04:15.915 --> 00:04:17.995
<v Speaker 2>of the sub project owners, which is myself

00:04:17.995 --> 00:04:19.035
<v Speaker 2>and Grace,

00:04:19.354 --> 00:04:22.395
<v Speaker 2>then a release lead and an emeritus adviser.

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:24.710
<v Speaker 2>The emeritus adviser's job is just kind of

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.990
<v Speaker 2>emotional support for the lead because it is

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.030
<v Speaker 2>like it's stressful. It's highly public. You are

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.310
<v Speaker 2>the face of the release. You have to

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.590
<v Speaker 2>talk to the press. You have to deal

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.190
<v Speaker 2>with the CNCF sometimes.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.830
<v Speaker 2>You get random DMs from people you don't

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.430
<v Speaker 2>know and have never spoken to, but they

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.845
<v Speaker 2>have a lot of power and that can

00:04:40.845 --> 00:04:41.805
<v Speaker 2>be overwhelming

00:04:42.045 --> 00:04:44.765
<v Speaker 2>for some people. And beneath the release lead,

00:04:44.765 --> 00:04:47.405
<v Speaker 2>they have their own shadows. They have between

00:04:47.405 --> 00:04:49.405
<v Speaker 2>four and six release lead shadows who are

00:04:49.405 --> 00:04:52.365
<v Speaker 2>people who have experience leading a sub team

00:04:52.365 --> 00:04:54.525
<v Speaker 2>within the release team and may lead a

00:04:54.525 --> 00:04:55.725
<v Speaker 2>release in the future.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.080
<v Speaker 2>There are also several sub teams. There is

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.400
<v Speaker 2>a docs sub team responsible for making sure

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.520
<v Speaker 2>that any KEP with

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.640
<v Speaker 2>user facing changes has documentation.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.040
<v Speaker 2>That is a hard requirement. We don't allow

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.560
<v Speaker 2>KEPs with user facing changes into the release

00:05:11.884 --> 00:05:13.405
<v Speaker 2>unless they have documentation.

00:05:13.645 --> 00:05:16.925
<v Speaker 2>There's a communications team that's responsible for managing

00:05:16.925 --> 00:05:18.445
<v Speaker 2>things like feature blogs,

00:05:18.604 --> 00:05:21.645
<v Speaker 2>making sure the release webinar happens, managing the

00:05:21.645 --> 00:05:22.845
<v Speaker 2>press embargo,

00:05:23.245 --> 00:05:25.805
<v Speaker 2>handling the release lead schedule for

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.300
<v Speaker 2>interviews with the press, that kind of stuff.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.220
<v Speaker 2>Then an enhancements team that catalogs and makes

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.540
<v Speaker 2>sure that each CAP has

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.780
<v Speaker 2>all of its requirements met by certain deadlines,

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.335
<v Speaker 2>like code freeze and test freeze. And release

00:05:39.335 --> 00:05:42.295
<v Speaker 2>signal, which is bug hunting, basically, making sure

00:05:42.295 --> 00:05:45.175
<v Speaker 2>that our CI looks good before any cut.

00:05:45.175 --> 00:05:47.095
<v Speaker 2>And if it is bad for whatever reason,

00:05:47.095 --> 00:05:48.935
<v Speaker 2>if there's a test failing, they chase down

00:05:48.935 --> 00:05:50.215
<v Speaker 2>the SIG that owns it and make sure

00:05:50.215 --> 00:05:52.670
<v Speaker 2>that bug gets fixed. Each of those teams

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.990
<v Speaker 2>has between four and six shadows and a

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.670
<v Speaker 2>lead as well. So ultimately,

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.790
<v Speaker 2>the release lead is managing something like 25

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:00.990
<v Speaker 2>to 30 people

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.285
<v Speaker 2>for four months. It is a lot of

00:06:04.285 --> 00:06:06.285
<v Speaker 2>work. It can be very overwhelming. Any role

00:06:06.285 --> 00:06:09.005
<v Speaker 2>on the release team is mostly just

00:06:09.324 --> 00:06:10.525
<v Speaker 2>project management,

00:06:11.085 --> 00:06:13.324
<v Speaker 2>but some of them do require like some

00:06:13.324 --> 00:06:15.805
<v Speaker 2>degree of technical expertise. You have to know

00:06:15.805 --> 00:06:16.685
<v Speaker 2>how to use Git

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:19.889
<v Speaker 2>on basically any team, but you don't have

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:23.090
<v Speaker 2>to be an expert in Kubernetes or an

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.889
<v Speaker 2>expert in open source. It's a pretty common

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:28.289
<v Speaker 2>entry point for new people contributing to Kubernetes

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:29.009
<v Speaker 2>for the first time.

00:06:29.705 --> 00:06:31.305
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it is a good way

00:06:31.305 --> 00:06:33.065
<v Speaker 2>to contribute to Kubernetes for the first time

00:06:33.065 --> 00:06:34.745
<v Speaker 2>if that's really overwhelming.

00:06:34.905 --> 00:06:36.585
<v Speaker 2>But people do it all the time and

00:06:36.585 --> 00:06:37.465
<v Speaker 2>survive.

00:06:37.625 --> 00:06:39.545
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think it's the easiest or

00:06:39.545 --> 00:06:41.705
<v Speaker 2>best way to get started in the project.

00:06:41.705 --> 00:06:43.145
<v Speaker 2>But it is it's a it's an overwhelming

00:06:43.145 --> 00:06:44.825
<v Speaker 2>place to be. It's a burnout factory too.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.750
<v Speaker 0>So you obviously then get a lot of

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.590
<v Speaker 0>floaters coming in and out, a lot of

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:50.630
<v Speaker 0>new contributors,

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.950
<v Speaker 0>people you have to kind of guide ish.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.230
<v Speaker 0>Do you think a lot of it has

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.030
<v Speaker 0>more to do with just how structured

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.910
<v Speaker 0>and how short of a time commitment it

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:02.175
<v Speaker 0>is that you get so many new people

00:07:02.175 --> 00:07:02.975
<v Speaker 0>coming through?

00:07:03.375 --> 00:07:05.455
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the short time commitment is

00:07:05.455 --> 00:07:06.655
<v Speaker 2>a consideration

00:07:06.655 --> 00:07:08.175
<v Speaker 2>because for a lot of these people, by

00:07:08.175 --> 00:07:10.175
<v Speaker 2>the time they're halfway through the release cycle,

00:07:10.335 --> 00:07:11.935
<v Speaker 2>they think four months is a long time

00:07:11.935 --> 00:07:14.960
<v Speaker 2>and they disappear. Yeah. What drives people to

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.199
<v Speaker 2>go through the release team as an entry

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:17.760
<v Speaker 2>point

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.639
<v Speaker 2>is it's very structured. That's for sure a

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:21.440
<v Speaker 2>contributing

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:23.120
<v Speaker 2>factor. It's

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.680
<v Speaker 2>very clear how to get involved and

00:07:26.254 --> 00:07:28.414
<v Speaker 2>what getting involved gets you, which is org

00:07:28.414 --> 00:07:30.495
<v Speaker 2>membership. Anybody on the release team has to

00:07:30.495 --> 00:07:32.574
<v Speaker 2>be a Kubernetes org member. So if you

00:07:32.574 --> 00:07:34.414
<v Speaker 2>are not an org member and you are

00:07:34.414 --> 00:07:36.735
<v Speaker 2>selected for the release team, we just give

00:07:36.735 --> 00:07:39.455
<v Speaker 2>you org membership with no previous contributions.

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:42.319
<v Speaker 2>I think the bigger contributing factor to people

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:44.400
<v Speaker 2>choosing the release team is how public and

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.840
<v Speaker 2>how flashy it is, and they think it

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.680
<v Speaker 2>looks good on a resume. And I think

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.919
<v Speaker 2>that's something that the project doesn't think about

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:52.319
<v Speaker 2>enough. We are the second largest open source

00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:53.919
<v Speaker 2>project in the world. We are the largest

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:56.315
<v Speaker 2>Golang based open source project in the world.

00:07:56.635 --> 00:07:58.395
<v Speaker 2>And we need to accept that, that we

00:07:58.395 --> 00:07:59.515
<v Speaker 2>are no longer

00:07:59.915 --> 00:08:02.315
<v Speaker 2>a little tiny baby. We are in fact

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:04.475
<v Speaker 2>like an absolutely enormous

00:08:04.795 --> 00:08:07.515
<v Speaker 2>force within open source and people want that

00:08:07.515 --> 00:08:08.315
<v Speaker 2>on their resume.

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:10.610
<v Speaker 2>So they go through the release team because

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.370
<v Speaker 2>it is an easy way to get a

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.850
<v Speaker 2>very public aspect of the Kubernetes project

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.730
<v Speaker 2>on your LinkedIn profile. Don't love that because

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:19.010
<v Speaker 2>people do misuse it.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.570
<v Speaker 1>Of course. Of course. Yeah.

00:08:22.705 --> 00:08:25.425
<v Speaker 1>I get that, David. And I was a

00:08:25.425 --> 00:08:28.465
<v Speaker 1>shadow for the one twelve, 13, and 14

00:08:28.625 --> 00:08:30.545
<v Speaker 1>release. You wanna come Well, actually, the reason

00:08:30.545 --> 00:08:32.705
<v Speaker 1>I stopped contributing is because I kept signing

00:08:32.705 --> 00:08:34.465
<v Speaker 1>up for other different groups. I only ever

00:08:34.465 --> 00:08:36.799
<v Speaker 1>did release columns, but I couldn't get accepted

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:38.400
<v Speaker 1>into any other group because I think there

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.080
<v Speaker 1>was a phase where there were so many

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:40.880
<v Speaker 1>people applying.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.640
<v Speaker 1>It was really Oh, we get hundreds.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.560
<v Speaker 2>We get hundreds of applicants. So I just

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.560
<v Speaker 1>stopped applying, but I would definitely love to

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.680
<v Speaker 1>come back. I didn't do it to get

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.280
<v Speaker 1>it on my resume. I was the official

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.625
<v Speaker 1>host of the Cooper official. Right? And we

00:08:51.625 --> 00:08:53.144
<v Speaker 1>were all volunteers, but I was the host

00:08:53.144 --> 00:08:55.065
<v Speaker 1>of the Kubernetes office hours and joining the

00:08:55.065 --> 00:08:57.545
<v Speaker 2>release team is actually a good way to

00:08:57.785 --> 00:08:59.545
<v Speaker 1>keep up to date with what was happening.

00:08:59.545 --> 00:09:00.505
<v Speaker 1>But I think one of the things that

00:09:00.505 --> 00:09:02.185
<v Speaker 1>shocked me the most is, like, the release

00:09:02.185 --> 00:09:03.625
<v Speaker 1>team is super structured,

00:09:03.945 --> 00:09:05.385
<v Speaker 1>but the people working on

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:08.490
<v Speaker 1>issues and contributing code, was a bit like

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:10.089
<v Speaker 1>the Wild West. Like, to the point where

00:09:10.089 --> 00:09:11.610
<v Speaker 1>the feature enhancements team,

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:13.050
<v Speaker 1>we just say, oh, what are going to

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:14.250
<v Speaker 1>do in the best release? And they're like,

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.089
<v Speaker 1>oh, we don't know yet. Let's maybe pull

00:09:16.089 --> 00:09:17.610
<v Speaker 1>in these ones. And it's very ad hoc

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.050
<v Speaker 1>and it's very we'll just see what we

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:20.785
<v Speaker 1>can get done. It felt like I don't

00:09:20.785 --> 00:09:22.225
<v Speaker 1>want to say wrangling cats, but it does

00:09:22.225 --> 00:09:24.385
<v Speaker 1>feel like wrangling cats. It is. It's

00:09:24.385 --> 00:09:26.305
<v Speaker 2>definitely more structured now than it was when

00:09:26.305 --> 00:09:27.665
<v Speaker 2>you were on the team. We also have

00:09:27.665 --> 00:09:29.745
<v Speaker 2>far fewer sub teams now. Now we only

00:09:29.745 --> 00:09:32.225
<v Speaker 2>have four. We used to have bug signal

00:09:32.225 --> 00:09:35.720
<v Speaker 2>or bug triage and CI signal, and there

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.240
<v Speaker 2>was a testing

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.040
<v Speaker 2>sub team as well. So we've deleted some

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.879
<v Speaker 2>sub teams and things are definitely much more

00:09:41.879 --> 00:09:44.360
<v Speaker 2>structured, but the herding cats aspect,

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.480
<v Speaker 2>absolutely still a problem. It's still an enormous

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.000
<v Speaker 2>problem. Some SIGs are

00:09:49.705 --> 00:09:51.305
<v Speaker 2>harder to herd than others,

00:09:51.865 --> 00:09:54.425
<v Speaker 2>but it is very much still an issue.

00:09:54.425 --> 00:09:56.425
<v Speaker 2>And that's just the nature of open source.

00:09:56.425 --> 00:09:57.865
<v Speaker 2>Right? Many of those contributors are just doing

00:09:57.865 --> 00:09:58.665
<v Speaker 2>it for free.

00:09:58.985 --> 00:10:01.065
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That's the thing. Like everyone working on

00:10:01.065 --> 00:10:03.720
<v Speaker 1>the Kubernetes program, normally people paid for Kubernetes.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.480
<v Speaker 1>It's the CNCF staff. So let's not touch

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.600
<v Speaker 1>that with a particle.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.360
<v Speaker 1>However Yeah. Working

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.240
<v Speaker 1>working on Kubernetes are volunteers. They have day

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.760
<v Speaker 1>jobs. Some of them are fortunate enough to

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.600
<v Speaker 1>be paid to be working on Kubernetes, which

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.960
<v Speaker 1>is great for the people that work at

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Google, Red Hat, a couple other big ones.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.855
<v Speaker 1>Right? But most people are just yeah, I'll

00:10:19.855 --> 00:10:21.535
<v Speaker 1>try and get this done. I'll do it

00:10:21.535 --> 00:10:22.975
<v Speaker 1>at the weekend. I'll do it when I

00:10:22.975 --> 00:10:25.935
<v Speaker 1>get home. You're asking for questions on documentation

00:10:25.935 --> 00:10:27.935
<v Speaker 1>updates and as a feature gonna make it,

00:10:27.935 --> 00:10:30.175
<v Speaker 1>and they're replying as they can. And I

00:10:30.175 --> 00:10:31.615
<v Speaker 1>get that. That's just the nature of open

00:10:31.615 --> 00:10:32.975
<v Speaker 1>source, as you said. Like,

00:10:33.535 --> 00:10:35.440
<v Speaker 1>don't. It's the nature of any I don't

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.760
<v Speaker 1>know. Volunteering organization, to be honest with you.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.480
<v Speaker 0>Like, if you're running a conference, like, no

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.000
<v Speaker 0>no one's really paid to do that if

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.920
<v Speaker 0>you're doing it as a community conference, and

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.760
<v Speaker 0>it's when somebody gets time.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.240
<v Speaker 0>And so you have to flex around that

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.464
<v Speaker 0>quite a bit. So I don't think it's

00:10:50.464 --> 00:10:52.464
<v Speaker 0>I don't think it's unique to open source.

00:10:52.464 --> 00:10:54.545
<v Speaker 0>The only thing unique about open source, I'd

00:10:54.545 --> 00:10:55.585
<v Speaker 0>say, is how,

00:10:56.464 --> 00:10:58.145
<v Speaker 0>specialized it can get

00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:01.025
<v Speaker 0>when you start really getting down to it.

00:11:01.345 --> 00:11:03.584
<v Speaker 0>So Mhmm. I don't know. It is kind

00:11:03.584 --> 00:11:07.100
<v Speaker 0>of an interesting conundrum there. Yeah. Right. Okay.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.860
<v Speaker 1>So when again, I'll come back to one

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.380
<v Speaker 1>more question related to my time on it

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:11.660
<v Speaker 1>because that's where most of my experience is,

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.420
<v Speaker 1>and we can talk about modern more of

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:15.820
<v Speaker 1>the modern day stuff. But CI Signal was

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.260
<v Speaker 1>the team that I had the most

00:11:17.714 --> 00:11:19.075
<v Speaker 1>sympathy empathy.

00:11:19.075 --> 00:11:20.755
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure which for.

00:11:20.915 --> 00:11:22.595
<v Speaker 1>They felt like they were I felt like

00:11:22.595 --> 00:11:25.315
<v Speaker 1>they were constantly firefighting with everybody pushing up

00:11:25.315 --> 00:11:27.795
<v Speaker 1>new bugs, new features, all these things, and

00:11:27.795 --> 00:11:29.954
<v Speaker 1>CI just falling over. And you actually take

00:11:29.954 --> 00:11:32.195
<v Speaker 1>a step back to understand just what is

00:11:32.195 --> 00:11:34.389
<v Speaker 1>happening, how many commits per day there are,

00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:36.389
<v Speaker 1>how many CI runs, how many GitHub actions

00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:39.029
<v Speaker 1>that is. It's such a huge,

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:41.910
<v Speaker 1>daunting task to keep all of that green

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.990
<v Speaker 1>and relevant. Is that still the case?

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:46.709
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. It's gotten better. As we've gotten better

00:11:46.709 --> 00:11:47.670
<v Speaker 2>at writing tests,

00:11:48.295 --> 00:11:51.015
<v Speaker 2>not everything is blocking now,

00:11:51.095 --> 00:11:52.455
<v Speaker 2>which is an improvement.

00:11:52.775 --> 00:11:54.455
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things that made

00:11:54.855 --> 00:11:57.895
<v Speaker 2>bug triage and CI signal easier, easy enough

00:11:57.895 --> 00:11:59.655
<v Speaker 2>that we could eliminate them as separate teams

00:11:59.655 --> 00:12:02.455
<v Speaker 2>and merge them, was actually just a change

00:12:02.455 --> 00:12:04.510
<v Speaker 2>in the way we manage those teams. We

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.830
<v Speaker 2>used to handle all of that

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:09.630
<v Speaker 2>through a Google spreadsheet,

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:12.029
<v Speaker 2>which was a big, shitty,

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:13.950
<v Speaker 2>miserable nightmare.

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:16.350
<v Speaker 2>The whole release was managed in a single

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:20.065
<v Speaker 2>Google Sheet. Anything from enhancements tracking to CI

00:12:20.065 --> 00:12:21.825
<v Speaker 2>signal to bug triage was all just like

00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:24.385
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of messy automation dumping into a

00:12:24.385 --> 00:12:25.185
<v Speaker 2>Google Sheet.

00:12:25.585 --> 00:12:28.785
<v Speaker 2>And six or seven releases ago, maybe six

00:12:28.785 --> 00:12:29.745
<v Speaker 2>releases ago,

00:12:30.065 --> 00:12:31.025
<v Speaker 2>we canned that

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.620
<v Speaker 2>and switched over to using

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:39.100
<v Speaker 2>GitHub projects board and some significantly smarter automation

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.100
<v Speaker 2>for our test grid, which is what the

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.100
<v Speaker 2>CI signal team was looking at.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.820
<v Speaker 2>And now Bug Triage has

00:12:46.205 --> 00:12:49.645
<v Speaker 2>almost nothing to do, so little to do.

00:12:49.965 --> 00:12:51.965
<v Speaker 2>There's still something. There's still enough that we

00:12:51.965 --> 00:12:54.205
<v Speaker 2>couldn't just can the whole roll, but we

00:12:54.205 --> 00:12:55.565
<v Speaker 2>just rolled it into

00:12:55.645 --> 00:12:58.125
<v Speaker 2>CI signal and now it's much easier for

00:12:58.125 --> 00:12:59.885
<v Speaker 2>everybody to deal with. So it's less frantic,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.100
<v Speaker 2>but every time there's a bug or a

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.540
<v Speaker 2>master blocking test fails, yeah, it's still frantic.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.460
<v Speaker 2>But how frantic that is depends on the

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:10.740
<v Speaker 2>SIG that owns that test that failed. Some

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.980
<v Speaker 2>SIGs are larger and more well staffed and

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:14.500
<v Speaker 2>more responsive than others.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:15.620
<v Speaker 2>And again,

00:13:16.155 --> 00:13:17.915
<v Speaker 2>it's open source, so

00:13:18.395 --> 00:13:20.955
<v Speaker 2>everybody has a day job. Everybody has kids

00:13:20.955 --> 00:13:23.595
<v Speaker 2>and family and pets to take care of.

00:13:23.595 --> 00:13:25.355
<v Speaker 2>And an important thing that I think

00:13:25.755 --> 00:13:27.595
<v Speaker 2>not just the public, but a lot of

00:13:27.595 --> 00:13:30.235
<v Speaker 2>people even within the project don't realize is

00:13:30.235 --> 00:13:31.595
<v Speaker 2>that by charter

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.740
<v Speaker 2>SIG release will choose to delay a release

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:36.980
<v Speaker 2>before we choose to make the release team

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.339
<v Speaker 2>work over weekends.

00:13:38.899 --> 00:13:39.620
<v Speaker 2>We will yeah,

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.459
<v Speaker 2>we it is. We will not run our

00:13:43.459 --> 00:13:44.740
<v Speaker 2>team ragged

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:45.540
<v Speaker 2>just to

00:13:45.915 --> 00:13:48.475
<v Speaker 2>squash a bug and make a release cut.

00:13:48.475 --> 00:13:50.475
<v Speaker 2>We will just delay it. We've done it

00:13:50.475 --> 00:13:52.395
<v Speaker 2>in the past. We'll do it again.

00:13:52.714 --> 00:13:54.555
<v Speaker 2>I personally have been very quick to say

00:13:54.555 --> 00:13:55.675
<v Speaker 2>no, delay

00:13:56.235 --> 00:13:57.195
<v Speaker 2>an RC,

00:13:57.355 --> 00:13:58.955
<v Speaker 2>a release candidate cut, because why?

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.660
<v Speaker 2>The release date is aspirational, and we're not

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.460
<v Speaker 2>gonna make our team miserable to

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.980
<v Speaker 2>hit it because nobody's paying us. Yeah. I

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.380
<v Speaker 0>have to remember like, I guess I'm

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.020
<v Speaker 0>kind of showing that maybe I don't remember

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:16.175
<v Speaker 0>everything about open source. What open source project

00:14:16.175 --> 00:14:18.335
<v Speaker 0>does have set releases like this?

00:14:18.655 --> 00:14:20.975
<v Speaker 0>Really, like, this like, something this big.

00:14:21.375 --> 00:14:23.615
<v Speaker 0>Even, like, the Linux kernel doesn't

00:14:23.935 --> 00:14:26.815
<v Speaker 0>say, like, we're guaranteeing a release on this

00:14:26.815 --> 00:14:26.975
<v Speaker 0>day.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.660
<v Speaker 0>No one really does that. Not an open

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.260
<v Speaker 0>source. Not that I can think

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:32.220
<v Speaker 2>of.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.180
<v Speaker 2>They don't guarantee it. Some

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:36.540
<v Speaker 2>projects

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:40.300
<v Speaker 2>will give you their target release dates for

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.660
<v Speaker 2>every release for the year.

00:14:42.355 --> 00:14:44.675
<v Speaker 2>Whereas we only give you a target date

00:14:44.755 --> 00:14:47.235
<v Speaker 2>at the beginning of the release cycle. We're

00:14:47.235 --> 00:14:50.115
<v Speaker 2>discussing the timeline for the next Kubernetes release

00:14:50.115 --> 00:14:52.355
<v Speaker 2>right now. So within the next week or

00:14:52.355 --> 00:14:52.915
<v Speaker 2>two,

00:14:53.155 --> 00:14:55.475
<v Speaker 2>you'll know when the next Kubernetes releases target

00:14:55.475 --> 00:14:57.570
<v Speaker 2>date is. Some projects will give you their

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:59.170
<v Speaker 2>target dates for a whole year, but I

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:00.930
<v Speaker 2>don't think anybody guarantees

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:02.210
<v Speaker 2>that.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:04.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't think even not

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:06.770
<v Speaker 2>it's not even that common with closed source,

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:09.410
<v Speaker 2>like paid nobody would guarantee a release date.

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:11.545
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous. That's a liability. Yeah. The only

00:15:11.545 --> 00:15:13.465
<v Speaker 0>thing I can think of that is even

00:15:13.625 --> 00:15:14.265
<v Speaker 0>remotely

00:15:14.425 --> 00:15:16.105
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if guaranteed is the right

00:15:16.105 --> 00:15:18.745
<v Speaker 0>word is the Ubuntu releases because they always

00:15:18.745 --> 00:15:20.425
<v Speaker 0>do it in April and October.

00:15:20.825 --> 00:15:21.705
<v Speaker 0>But even then,

00:15:22.185 --> 00:15:25.010
<v Speaker 0>it's a whole month to hit, not a

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:28.210
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Not a single day. Day. Yeah. Right?

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:29.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. And we can't we would never be

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:31.410
<v Speaker 2>able to do that anyway because honestly, the

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:33.730
<v Speaker 2>most common cause of a Kubernetes release being

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:34.370
<v Speaker 2>delayed

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:35.650
<v Speaker 2>is Golang.

00:15:36.425 --> 00:15:38.024
<v Speaker 2>Really? Yep,

00:15:38.024 --> 00:15:40.265
<v Speaker 2>the Go project does not tell us when

00:15:40.265 --> 00:15:42.825
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be an update coming. We

00:15:42.825 --> 00:15:44.585
<v Speaker 2>don't get any kind of advanced warning.

00:15:44.825 --> 00:15:46.584
<v Speaker 2>The only time we get advanced warning is

00:15:46.584 --> 00:15:50.105
<v Speaker 2>if it is due to a

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:51.930
<v Speaker 2>CBE that affects us. Will know in advance,

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:54.330
<v Speaker 2>but we can't tell you that because we

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.330
<v Speaker 2>all sign NDAs for

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.290
<v Speaker 2>that. So, we can't actually say anything. But

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:00.970
<v Speaker 2>yeah, if Go updates

00:16:01.385 --> 00:16:03.385
<v Speaker 2>and they update too close to the release

00:16:03.385 --> 00:16:05.865
<v Speaker 2>date so that we can't have we really

00:16:05.865 --> 00:16:08.025
<v Speaker 2>want at least three days for a new

00:16:08.025 --> 00:16:09.865
<v Speaker 2>Go version to soak before we call it

00:16:09.865 --> 00:16:11.305
<v Speaker 2>good and release.

00:16:11.385 --> 00:16:12.825
<v Speaker 2>If they cut it too close,

00:16:13.225 --> 00:16:15.200
<v Speaker 2>we have no choice but to delay. I've

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.840
<v Speaker 2>seen that delay three or four Kubernetes releases

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.640
<v Speaker 2>in my Pretty

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.640
<v Speaker 2>common cause.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.560
<v Speaker 2>And we have no control over that. We

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.920
<v Speaker 2>have no way to predict it because we

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.840
<v Speaker 2>don't get any kind of advanced warning from

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.695
<v Speaker 2>the Go team, Which is fine. They don't

00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:28.895
<v Speaker 2>have to give it to us. Can like,

00:16:28.895 --> 00:16:30.255
<v Speaker 2>we can work around it. It's no skin

00:16:30.255 --> 00:16:32.335
<v Speaker 2>off my back to delay a release for

00:16:32.335 --> 00:16:34.975
<v Speaker 2>a week. Yeah. Nobody's waiting for it that

00:16:34.975 --> 00:16:37.215
<v Speaker 0>hard or they shouldn't be. If they are,

00:16:37.215 --> 00:16:38.975
<v Speaker 0>maybe you should go touch some grass.

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:42.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Touch grass. The media, because they get

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:44.050
<v Speaker 2>it means that we push their embargo date

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:46.050
<v Speaker 2>back and that's like a little bit irritating.

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:47.650
<v Speaker 2>But yeah, it's not the end of the

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:48.210
<v Speaker 2>world.

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.370
<v Speaker 2>Like, you're not going to die because you

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:52.930
<v Speaker 2>had to wait another release. Why is there

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:55.834
<v Speaker 1>a press embargo date when everything is so

00:16:55.834 --> 00:16:57.515
<v Speaker 1>open and transparent?

00:16:57.595 --> 00:16:57.915
<v Speaker 1>What is

00:16:58.635 --> 00:16:59.515
<v Speaker 2>No idea.

00:16:59.755 --> 00:17:02.315
<v Speaker 2>Wish I knew one. I think it's dumb.

00:17:02.475 --> 00:17:05.035
<v Speaker 2>So, because So we try to keep it

00:17:05.035 --> 00:17:07.530
<v Speaker 2>secret, right, with the release blog. The release

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:10.490
<v Speaker 2>blog will be staged in a PR two

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:13.530
<v Speaker 2>weeks before an actual release date. And then

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:15.850
<v Speaker 2>the little blurb that the release lead writes

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:17.290
<v Speaker 2>and the logo

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:19.770
<v Speaker 2>will get added to that PR like the

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:21.930
<v Speaker 2>day before release, two days before release.

00:17:22.484 --> 00:17:23.444
<v Speaker 2>So it's not

00:17:24.005 --> 00:17:26.724
<v Speaker 2>public, if you know how to look at

00:17:26.724 --> 00:17:28.885
<v Speaker 2>GitHub, like you can see it, you can

00:17:28.885 --> 00:17:32.405
<v Speaker 2>see it. I don't really get it. Embargoing

00:17:32.405 --> 00:17:36.725
<v Speaker 2>interviews with the release lead, fine. I don't

00:17:36.725 --> 00:17:39.160
<v Speaker 2>really care. But embargoing

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:39.800
<v Speaker 2>just

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.520
<v Speaker 2>writings about the release,

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.240
<v Speaker 2>which is all based on information that is

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.480
<v Speaker 2>very publicly visible on

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.120
<v Speaker 2>GitHub, seems a little bit ridiculous to me.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.965
<v Speaker 2>I don't know. It smells like a formality

00:17:52.965 --> 00:17:54.645
<v Speaker 2>that's there to make the whole thing seem

00:17:54.645 --> 00:17:55.205
<v Speaker 2>more

00:17:55.605 --> 00:17:57.685
<v Speaker 2>important than it actually is. Yeah. I think

00:17:57.685 --> 00:17:59.925
<v Speaker 1>it's some weird decision from someone who's worked

00:17:59.925 --> 00:18:02.885
<v Speaker 1>in So press market and and it's yeah.

00:18:02.885 --> 00:18:04.565
<v Speaker 1>It's because I wouldn't name the company, but

00:18:04.565 --> 00:18:05.925
<v Speaker 1>there's a well known observability

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:08.490
<v Speaker 1>company that always published or watched new Kubernetes

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:10.489
<v Speaker 1>the day before the embargo

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.970
<v Speaker 1>was supposed to lift. And obviously, the information

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:14.490
<v Speaker 1>is public. Like, it's not like they can

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:16.570
<v Speaker 1>they can't force them to stop it. Yeah.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:17.450
<v Speaker 2>What are you gonna do?

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:19.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. There's nothing you can do. Like, you

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:21.529
<v Speaker 2>are welcome to do that. I don't love

00:18:21.529 --> 00:18:23.995
<v Speaker 2>it. It's a little bit irritating. It's okay.

00:18:24.315 --> 00:18:25.995
<v Speaker 2>It irritates me in one situation and one

00:18:25.995 --> 00:18:26.955
<v Speaker 2>situation only.

00:18:27.275 --> 00:18:30.795
<v Speaker 2>When people go and rip quotes out of

00:18:30.795 --> 00:18:34.075
<v Speaker 2>the unpublished release blog and publish it,

00:18:34.635 --> 00:18:35.035
<v Speaker 2>that

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.680
<v Speaker 2>hurts my feelings a little because it's stealing

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.760
<v Speaker 2>the thunder from the release lead

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:40.799
<v Speaker 0>who- Yeah.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.320
<v Speaker 2>Worked their butt off for- Who

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.480
<v Speaker 2>worked their butt off for four months, for

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.880
<v Speaker 2>probably more like two or three years

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.120
<v Speaker 2>you've

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:49.600
<v Speaker 2>got to

00:18:50.465 --> 00:18:53.665
<v Speaker 2>lead multiple sub teams to end up as

00:18:53.665 --> 00:18:55.105
<v Speaker 2>a release lead. It's a lot of work

00:18:55.105 --> 00:18:55.505
<v Speaker 2>and

00:18:55.985 --> 00:18:58.465
<v Speaker 2>it's unpaid work. The only reward that the

00:18:58.465 --> 00:19:01.905
<v Speaker 2>release lead gets is publishing that release blog

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.480
<v Speaker 2>with their cute little couple paragraphs about the

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:07.440
<v Speaker 2>release theme and naming it something fun. So

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.480
<v Speaker 2>when people

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.200
<v Speaker 2>rip that out of the unpublished blog.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.240
<v Speaker 2>That's rude.

00:19:14.945 --> 00:19:18.384
<v Speaker 2>But just talking about what enhancements made it

00:19:18.625 --> 00:19:20.545
<v Speaker 2>go ahead, because what enhancements made it has

00:19:20.545 --> 00:19:21.664
<v Speaker 2>been public for

00:19:21.905 --> 00:19:22.705
<v Speaker 2>shit,

00:19:23.025 --> 00:19:24.865
<v Speaker 2>four, six weeks at that point

00:19:25.345 --> 00:19:28.145
<v Speaker 2>because of code freeze. So be my guest.

00:19:28.145 --> 00:19:29.185
<v Speaker 2>I don't care. It's not,

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:32.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean, fight with the CNCF on it.

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:34.470
<v Speaker 2>But for me, that's not against the rules

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:34.790
<v Speaker 0>in It's

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.630
<v Speaker 0>to find if you know. I guess there

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:39.910
<v Speaker 0>is a little bit of that if you

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:43.190
<v Speaker 0>know where to look. And I mean, everyone

00:19:43.605 --> 00:19:46.965
<v Speaker 0>always talks about how complex and convoluted the

00:19:46.965 --> 00:19:47.765
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes

00:19:47.765 --> 00:19:50.965
<v Speaker 0>GitHub can be for somebody who isn't familiar

00:19:51.285 --> 00:19:53.044
<v Speaker 0>with how everything is structured. So I guess

00:19:53.044 --> 00:19:55.125
<v Speaker 0>there's a little bit of that, maybe. But

00:19:55.125 --> 00:19:57.605
<v Speaker 2>for listeners who want to get a sneak

00:19:57.605 --> 00:19:58.325
<v Speaker 2>peek of

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.580
<v Speaker 2>what's going to be in the release before

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:03.380
<v Speaker 2>the actual release date, the trick is you

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:04.900
<v Speaker 2>go look in the Kubernetes

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:07.940
<v Speaker 2>website repo. Yep. And the release blog will

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.340
<v Speaker 2>be there in PRs a couple weeks before

00:20:10.675 --> 00:20:13.075
<v Speaker 2>the release, as well as any unpublished feature

00:20:13.075 --> 00:20:14.355
<v Speaker 2>blogs. And

00:20:14.435 --> 00:20:16.275
<v Speaker 0>if you want to know which enhancements made

00:20:16.275 --> 00:20:18.995
<v Speaker 2>it, you go to the Kubernetes enhancements repo

00:20:18.995 --> 00:20:21.475
<v Speaker 2>and go look there. I mean, or

00:20:22.195 --> 00:20:24.850
<v Speaker 2>you could join a and be there's that

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:26.690
<v Speaker 2>too. I mean, like, could just be part

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:27.490
<v Speaker 0>of it. Yeah.

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:29.090
<v Speaker 2>You could go snooping or you could come

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:30.929
<v Speaker 2>do some free work for me. Free work

00:20:30.929 --> 00:20:33.330
<v Speaker 0>sounds good. Free work sounds good. David. I've

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.090
<v Speaker 1>I've just read the PRs. There's a lot

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:36.625
<v Speaker 1>less effort. And then I can pump them

00:20:36.625 --> 00:20:37.985
<v Speaker 1>through AI and have to write my own

00:20:37.985 --> 00:20:40.225
<v Speaker 1>blogs and then the job done. Right? Oh,

00:20:40.225 --> 00:20:42.145
<v Speaker 2>yeah. Easy. But I'm worth saying, David, you

00:20:42.145 --> 00:20:44.465
<v Speaker 0>could go do some free work. Hint. Hint.

00:20:44.465 --> 00:20:45.985
<v Speaker 0>Hint. Hint. Oh, yeah. Come do some free

00:20:45.985 --> 00:20:47.825
<v Speaker 2>work for me. We did have a drive

00:20:47.825 --> 00:20:49.585
<v Speaker 2>by AI PR issue

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:51.789
<v Speaker 2>a little while Oh, did. I you does

00:20:51.789 --> 00:20:53.789
<v Speaker 1>not surprise me. I mean, open source project

00:20:53.789 --> 00:20:55.870
<v Speaker 0>has been Especially during Hacktoberfest.

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:58.429
<v Speaker 1>Right? I'm assuming it was right. Oh, geez.

00:20:58.429 --> 00:21:00.510
<v Speaker 2>I know. We do not participate in Hacktoberfest

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:02.669
<v Speaker 2>for the same reasons that lots of people

00:21:02.669 --> 00:21:05.645
<v Speaker 2>don't participate in Hacktoberfest anymore. And it was

00:21:05.645 --> 00:21:07.644
<v Speaker 2>not a Hacktoberfest thing. It was some

00:21:08.365 --> 00:21:09.164
<v Speaker 2>paid

00:21:09.325 --> 00:21:11.884
<v Speaker 2>product that uses AI to

00:21:12.044 --> 00:21:12.844
<v Speaker 2>improve

00:21:13.164 --> 00:21:15.325
<v Speaker 2>the docs for open source projects

00:21:15.565 --> 00:21:18.649
<v Speaker 2>for style guide compliance and all that. But

00:21:18.809 --> 00:21:20.970
<v Speaker 2>it is a paid product and they do

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:23.129
<v Speaker 2>these free drive by PRs

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:25.450
<v Speaker 2>and say, Oh, this one's on the house

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.769
<v Speaker 2>if we can just say you use us.

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:30.809
<v Speaker 2>And so we have two problems with that.

00:21:30.809 --> 00:21:31.049
<v Speaker 2>One,

00:21:31.875 --> 00:21:34.914
<v Speaker 2>absolutely fucking. Not without talking to us first.

00:21:34.995 --> 00:21:36.115
<v Speaker 2>No. Two,

00:21:36.435 --> 00:21:39.475
<v Speaker 2>the PR was bad. That's entirely automated. It

00:21:39.475 --> 00:21:41.875
<v Speaker 2>doesn't actually think or learn or understand the

00:21:41.875 --> 00:21:45.235
<v Speaker 2>structure of the Kubernetes docs website. So it

00:21:45.235 --> 00:21:47.075
<v Speaker 2>was making changes to a bunch of generated

00:21:47.075 --> 00:21:47.715
<v Speaker 2>files

00:21:48.179 --> 00:21:52.339
<v Speaker 2>and some things that like admittedly our bad

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.219
<v Speaker 2>are

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.580
<v Speaker 2>how we like to write things, but not

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:58.740
<v Speaker 2>at the time weren't included in our style

00:21:58.740 --> 00:21:59.379
<v Speaker 2>guide.

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:00.980
<v Speaker 2>So if

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:02.899
<v Speaker 2>you own an AI based

00:22:03.535 --> 00:22:04.255
<v Speaker 2>project

00:22:04.655 --> 00:22:07.215
<v Speaker 2>about docs for open source projects,

00:22:07.375 --> 00:22:09.215
<v Speaker 2>please do not drive by PRs. Just talk

00:22:09.215 --> 00:22:11.054
<v Speaker 2>to us for God's sake.

00:22:11.615 --> 00:22:13.295
<v Speaker 2>We're so easy to get a hold of.

00:22:13.295 --> 00:22:15.455
<v Speaker 2>Just talk to The question when they do

00:22:15.455 --> 00:22:17.390
<v Speaker 1>this is not is your product useful and

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:18.750
<v Speaker 1>could we get value from it? And that

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:20.190
<v Speaker 1>could be a yes, but is that the

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:22.110
<v Speaker 1>right way to do it? No. It could

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:22.990
<v Speaker 2>easily be yes.

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:25.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. That's the problem. Yeah. Like, I would

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:28.990
<v Speaker 2>love to see, like, some toil reduced

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:31.955
<v Speaker 2>in open source projects. Right? Like, style guide

00:22:31.955 --> 00:22:34.035
<v Speaker 2>compliance is an obnoxious thing

00:22:34.275 --> 00:22:37.155
<v Speaker 2>to review for. It's very ticky tack, and

00:22:37.155 --> 00:22:38.275
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to train

00:22:38.675 --> 00:22:41.715
<v Speaker 2>new people to do that because it's this

00:22:41.715 --> 00:22:44.835
<v Speaker 2>laundry list of like really specific tiny things

00:22:44.835 --> 00:22:45.955
<v Speaker 2>that they have to comply with.

00:22:46.679 --> 00:22:48.200
<v Speaker 2>And they're going to screw up a lot

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.360
<v Speaker 2>at first until they have the style guide

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.159
<v Speaker 2>memorized.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.919
<v Speaker 2>And it would be great to reduce that

00:22:52.919 --> 00:22:53.479
<v Speaker 2>work.

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:57.159
<v Speaker 2>But you can't just rock up with an

00:22:57.159 --> 00:22:59.480
<v Speaker 2>unasked for PR and say, hey, can we

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.759
<v Speaker 2>use you for marketing?

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.120
<v Speaker 0>So

00:23:02.175 --> 00:23:04.415
<v Speaker 0>I will say I know someone,

00:23:04.655 --> 00:23:06.335
<v Speaker 0>and I am not naming names.

00:23:06.735 --> 00:23:08.415
<v Speaker 0>I know somebody who,

00:23:08.895 --> 00:23:10.015
<v Speaker 0>for a little while,

00:23:10.815 --> 00:23:13.695
<v Speaker 0>was doing AutoPep eight on Python stuff. This

00:23:13.695 --> 00:23:15.440
<v Speaker 0>was a long time ago. They were doing

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.920
<v Speaker 0>AutoPep eight on Python code in random open

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.040
<v Speaker 0>source projects and just submitting PRs. They would

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.040
<v Speaker 0>just run AutoPep eight, you know, pull it

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.000
<v Speaker 0>down, run AutoPep eight, submit the PR. Next

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:26.720
<v Speaker 0>project.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:27.680
<v Speaker 0>And it was

00:23:28.414 --> 00:23:30.414
<v Speaker 0>I think at the time, I don't remember

00:23:30.414 --> 00:23:32.575
<v Speaker 0>how many they did, but it definitely was

00:23:32.575 --> 00:23:34.815
<v Speaker 0>a, like, what are you doing? Why are

00:23:34.815 --> 00:23:36.254
<v Speaker 0>you creating more work

00:23:36.575 --> 00:23:37.934
<v Speaker 0>for a maintainer?

00:23:38.255 --> 00:23:40.975
<v Speaker 0>You're not even asking. You're not, like, looking

00:23:40.975 --> 00:23:42.890
<v Speaker 0>at what they have. This was long before

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:45.210
<v Speaker 0>black and any of those those projects that

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:46.970
<v Speaker 0>would lint for you and do the auto

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:49.049
<v Speaker 0>pip. It was just auto pip eight. I

00:23:49.049 --> 00:23:51.049
<v Speaker 0>don't know. I I keep thinking about just

00:23:51.049 --> 00:23:53.929
<v Speaker 0>how many how many decisions an open source

00:23:53.929 --> 00:23:56.365
<v Speaker 0>maintainer has to make in the day. How

00:23:56.365 --> 00:23:58.205
<v Speaker 0>many, like, reviews they have to do and

00:23:58.205 --> 00:23:59.645
<v Speaker 0>all that, but just the pure idea of

00:23:59.645 --> 00:24:01.965
<v Speaker 0>how many decisions. All of that is overwhelming.

00:24:01.965 --> 00:24:03.645
<v Speaker 0>So if you're gonna come in with a

00:24:03.645 --> 00:24:05.884
<v Speaker 0>random auto generated PR and

00:24:06.205 --> 00:24:07.965
<v Speaker 0>ask them to make another decision

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:10.290
<v Speaker 0>rather than talking to them first. It is

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:12.290
<v Speaker 0>it is the epitome of Which is the

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:14.850
<v Speaker 1>biggest problem with open source. Whether

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:17.649
<v Speaker 1>it's automated or not is that people feel,

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:19.650
<v Speaker 1>I use your project as open source. I

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:21.490
<v Speaker 1>can come along with a 500,000,000

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:24.075
<v Speaker 1>line PR with this feature that no one

00:24:24.075 --> 00:24:25.755
<v Speaker 1>has ever even talked about.

00:24:26.075 --> 00:24:27.995
<v Speaker 1>And you're just expecting, oh, you're gonna accept

00:24:27.995 --> 00:24:29.355
<v Speaker 1>this because I've done all this work. And

00:24:29.355 --> 00:24:31.515
<v Speaker 1>there's no like, there's maintenance that comes on

00:24:31.515 --> 00:24:32.875
<v Speaker 1>the back of that. People have to then

00:24:32.955 --> 00:24:34.955
<v Speaker 1>Also Ugh. It's so frustrating.

00:24:35.115 --> 00:24:37.755
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Also, what development team ever would let

00:24:37.755 --> 00:24:38.555
<v Speaker 0>you do that

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:40.450
<v Speaker 0>in general? No, There

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:43.809
<v Speaker 0>are others that do this, but the good

00:24:43.809 --> 00:24:45.889
<v Speaker 0>ones- If at a tiny startup and you're

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:48.049
<v Speaker 2>a piece of shit 10x engineer,

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:49.330
<v Speaker 2>the lone wolf

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:51.890
<v Speaker 2>that all of your coworkers fucking hate you,

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:53.170
<v Speaker 2>but you've been there since the dawn of

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:53.330
<v Speaker 2>time.

00:24:54.585 --> 00:24:56.905
<v Speaker 2>You're You know that ex KCD comic with

00:24:56.905 --> 00:24:58.425
<v Speaker 2>the one tiny

00:24:56.825 --> 00:24:59.145
<v Speaker 2>You're

00:24:59.145 --> 00:25:01.705
<v Speaker 2>that guy at this 15 person You're

00:25:02.425 --> 00:25:04.825
<v Speaker 2>brilliant. So, even though you're awful and toxic

00:25:04.825 --> 00:25:05.705
<v Speaker 2>and shitty,

00:25:05.945 --> 00:25:07.145
<v Speaker 2>they feel like they can't get rid of

00:25:07.145 --> 00:25:10.060
<v Speaker 2>you. They'll they'll tolerate that guy opening a

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:11.259
<v Speaker 2>15,000 line

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.220
<v Speaker 2>drive by PR. Yeah. That refactors the whole

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:16.220
<v Speaker 2>goddamn thing without talking to anybody.

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:18.300
<v Speaker 0>I don't know. I just I always look

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:19.580
<v Speaker 0>at some of these and I go like,

00:25:20.265 --> 00:25:21.065
<v Speaker 0>where

00:25:21.065 --> 00:25:23.145
<v Speaker 0>did you learn to do development

00:25:23.225 --> 00:25:24.184
<v Speaker 0>in a team?

00:25:24.665 --> 00:25:26.105
<v Speaker 1>Like I think and a team is the

00:25:26.105 --> 00:25:28.185
<v Speaker 1>important thing here. Right? And I just because

00:25:28.185 --> 00:25:30.105
<v Speaker 1>I look at my Rawkode Academy

00:25:30.505 --> 00:25:32.105
<v Speaker 1>Mono Repo, and I am a dick.

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:35.010
<v Speaker 0>David, I mean like that's- Over the Christmas

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:37.490
<v Speaker 1>break, I rewrote every microservice with a slightly

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:39.570
<v Speaker 1>different tool, but that's because I was having

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:42.050
<v Speaker 1>fun at my project. There's no contributions, external

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:43.010
<v Speaker 1>contributions. Yeah.

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:46.065
<v Speaker 2>Your own stuff, it's fine. Yeah. Like, your

00:25:46.065 --> 00:25:47.424
<v Speaker 2>own stuff. I'm just making sure I didn't

00:25:47.424 --> 00:25:49.265
<v Speaker 1>qualify for the fish part of the stuff.

00:25:49.265 --> 00:25:51.904
<v Speaker 1>We can continue that. Like, I I literally

00:25:52.065 --> 00:25:53.664
<v Speaker 0>on some of my commit messages, it's just

00:25:53.664 --> 00:25:55.904
<v Speaker 0>more more. Because I don't know what else.

00:25:55.904 --> 00:25:57.745
<v Speaker 0>Right? Like, I'm just I'm just screwing it

00:25:57.745 --> 00:25:59.745
<v Speaker 0>right now then. You you put words. I

00:25:59.745 --> 00:26:00.784
<v Speaker 2>just type, like,

00:26:01.345 --> 00:26:01.745
<v Speaker 2>There

00:26:15.424 --> 00:26:17.424
<v Speaker 0>you know, because that's installed globally, so it

00:26:17.424 --> 00:26:19.825
<v Speaker 0>asks me everywhere, even including in my, like,

00:26:19.825 --> 00:26:20.864
<v Speaker 0>personal repos.

00:26:21.184 --> 00:26:23.105
<v Speaker 2>You're much kinder to your future self than

00:26:23.105 --> 00:26:23.184
<v Speaker 2>I Not

00:26:24.225 --> 00:26:25.825
<v Speaker 0>as much as you would think. You should

00:26:25.825 --> 00:26:27.825
<v Speaker 0>see some of the comments I'm looking here

00:26:27.825 --> 00:26:30.304
<v Speaker 1>is do as we see. Sometimes we think.

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:32.470
<v Speaker 0>Right. Okay. There we go. Yeah. There's the

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:35.269
<v Speaker 0>lesson. That's perfect. There we go. Alright. So

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:37.350
<v Speaker 1>let's get us back on the track for

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:38.870
<v Speaker 1>just a moment. We were we had a

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:40.309
<v Speaker 0>track. We pretend sometimes.

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:43.110
<v Speaker 1>But Kat has said we'd love more people

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:44.950
<v Speaker 1>to come and help out with sick release.

00:26:44.925 --> 00:26:46.685
<v Speaker 1>So let's assume that we want people to

00:26:46.685 --> 00:26:48.605
<v Speaker 1>listen to this, enjoy it, find it funny,

00:26:48.605 --> 00:26:51.165
<v Speaker 1>and then but hopefully, help the project.

00:26:51.485 --> 00:26:54.205
<v Speaker 1>You're both active members of six to the

00:26:54.205 --> 00:26:55.165
<v Speaker 1>best of my knowledge.

00:26:55.805 --> 00:26:57.565
<v Speaker 1>I was previously one, but what I'm gonna

00:26:57.565 --> 00:26:59.540
<v Speaker 1>do is say right now. Why do you

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:02.179
<v Speaker 1>both do it? What is the reward, the

00:27:02.179 --> 00:27:03.299
<v Speaker 1>gooey feeling?

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.820
<v Speaker 1>What if you could say to someone, do

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:06.820
<v Speaker 1>this because. Right? It's not gonna be fame.

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:09.139
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely not money. It's not glory.

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:11.139
<v Speaker 1>Why do you do this? Alright.

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:12.660
<v Speaker 0>Kat, you or me first.

00:27:13.355 --> 00:27:14.875
<v Speaker 2>No, go ahead. Do you want me to

00:27:14.875 --> 00:27:17.275
<v Speaker 0>go first? Okay. Yes. I will admit that

00:27:17.275 --> 00:27:19.355
<v Speaker 0>right now, just due to chaos in my

00:27:19.355 --> 00:27:20.875
<v Speaker 0>life, I haven't been very active.

00:27:21.195 --> 00:27:24.235
<v Speaker 0>I do it because I like helping people.

00:27:24.955 --> 00:27:27.275
<v Speaker 0>That's just it's a thing. I like teaching

00:27:27.275 --> 00:27:28.555
<v Speaker 0>people. I like helping people.

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:31.410
<v Speaker 0>I don't like sitting on my hands and

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:33.730
<v Speaker 0>watching someone else do something for me.

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:35.810
<v Speaker 0>I want to do it myself, and I

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:38.450
<v Speaker 0>want to help somebody get somewhere. So I

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:40.850
<v Speaker 0>do it for the I helped somebody else

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:43.414
<v Speaker 0>out today. I answered somebody's question.

00:27:43.815 --> 00:27:45.495
<v Speaker 0>I built something that someone else is gonna

00:27:45.495 --> 00:27:46.375
<v Speaker 0>get to use.

00:27:46.855 --> 00:27:48.054
<v Speaker 0>I do it for that.

00:27:48.615 --> 00:27:49.174
<v Speaker 0>And

00:27:49.975 --> 00:27:52.695
<v Speaker 0>granted, I I probably have a little bit

00:27:52.695 --> 00:27:54.455
<v Speaker 0>of a I guess, a hate for myself

00:27:54.455 --> 00:27:56.695
<v Speaker 0>considering how many projects I do this with,

00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:59.289
<v Speaker 0>for everybody who knows. A vacation.

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:00.090
<v Speaker 2>What?

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:03.690
<v Speaker 2>Please take a vacation. Eventually. I I help

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:04.249
<v Speaker 0>run

00:28:04.809 --> 00:28:06.730
<v Speaker 0>don't remember how many conferences I help run

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:07.289
<v Speaker 0>now.

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:09.770
<v Speaker 0>And meetups and and lots of other things

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:12.330
<v Speaker 0>along with open source. And and now I'm

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:14.805
<v Speaker 0>also starting a a job with a more

00:28:14.805 --> 00:28:16.965
<v Speaker 0>open source. So it's kind of like, it's

00:28:16.965 --> 00:28:18.405
<v Speaker 0>just who I am. Long story short, that's

00:28:18.405 --> 00:28:19.524
<v Speaker 0>why I do busy.

00:28:19.685 --> 00:28:21.284
<v Speaker 0>What? Oh, I'm podcasting. Sorry.

00:28:21.605 --> 00:28:23.605
<v Speaker 0>It's up to I I don't know anymore.

00:28:23.605 --> 00:28:25.685
<v Speaker 0>Like, it's just where can I be of

00:28:25.685 --> 00:28:27.445
<v Speaker 0>his help? Where can I be of service?

00:28:27.445 --> 00:28:29.309
<v Speaker 0>And that that's where I end up.

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:32.190
<v Speaker 0>And, unfortunately, I last time you were bored.

00:28:32.429 --> 00:28:34.350
<v Speaker 0>Me? Bored? Yeah.

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:36.190
<v Speaker 0>I don't know what that word means.

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:38.429
<v Speaker 2>I think you need to experience boredom.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.110
<v Speaker 0>Well, but then I have a book. I

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:42.510
<v Speaker 0>have a crocheting project. Like, I will unplug.

00:28:43.054 --> 00:28:44.014
<v Speaker 0>That's different.

00:28:44.335 --> 00:28:45.455
<v Speaker 0>I still am helping.

00:28:45.775 --> 00:28:49.054
<v Speaker 0>Does that count? Okay. Okay. Anyway, Kat, you

00:28:49.054 --> 00:28:50.335
<v Speaker 0>probably have a I don't know if you

00:28:50.335 --> 00:28:52.655
<v Speaker 0>have a less altruistic version of this because

00:28:52.655 --> 00:28:54.655
<v Speaker 0>I think some people are thinking I'm insane.

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:57.870
<v Speaker 0>But you know. You know what? I got

00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:59.389
<v Speaker 2>involved by accident

00:28:59.549 --> 00:29:00.909
<v Speaker 2>a long time ago,

00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:03.790
<v Speaker 2>before I was actually involved in the Kubernetes

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:04.429
<v Speaker 2>project.

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:05.470
<v Speaker 2>We

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:07.470
<v Speaker 2>announced a deprecation

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:08.190
<v Speaker 2>for

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:11.385
<v Speaker 2>an aspect of the project that had been

00:29:11.385 --> 00:29:13.225
<v Speaker 2>there since the dawn of time. We announced

00:29:13.225 --> 00:29:16.105
<v Speaker 2>the deprecation of the Docker shim, which was

00:29:16.345 --> 00:29:18.665
<v Speaker 2>a little software shim that allowed you to

00:29:18.665 --> 00:29:21.385
<v Speaker 2>use the entire Docker stack

00:29:21.545 --> 00:29:22.905
<v Speaker 2>as your container runtime.

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.480
<v Speaker 2>If you're relatively new to Kubernetes and that

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.720
<v Speaker 2>sounds ridiculous to you, good. It should sound

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.799
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous. That should never have been a thing.

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.280
<v Speaker 2>But we announced the deprecation for this and

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.920
<v Speaker 2>it was really poorly received. People were freaking

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.760
<v Speaker 2>out. Twitter was big at the time

00:29:37.174 --> 00:29:38.775
<v Speaker 2>and people were freaking out online and it

00:29:38.775 --> 00:29:40.455
<v Speaker 2>was six in the morning. And I was

00:29:40.455 --> 00:29:40.934
<v Speaker 2>like,

00:29:41.255 --> 00:29:44.294
<v Speaker 2>people are wrong online. Oh no. Because people

00:29:44.294 --> 00:29:46.135
<v Speaker 2>were not freaking out about the right thing.

00:29:46.135 --> 00:29:47.495
<v Speaker 2>They were misunderstanding

00:29:47.495 --> 00:29:51.010
<v Speaker 2>what the Docker shim is. They were misunderstanding

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:54.290
<v Speaker 2>what Docker is in relation to a container

00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:56.850
<v Speaker 2>runtime. And they were misunderstanding how this would

00:29:56.850 --> 00:30:00.370
<v Speaker 2>actually impact both cluster administrators and like regular

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:03.090
<v Speaker 2>developers that may work inside of containers, but

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:04.210
<v Speaker 2>don't actually touch Kubernetes.

00:30:04.675 --> 00:30:07.075
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people thought we were deprecating

00:30:07.075 --> 00:30:09.315
<v Speaker 2>Docker as if an open source project has

00:30:09.315 --> 00:30:11.794
<v Speaker 2>the power to shut down a private business.

00:30:12.195 --> 00:30:13.395
<v Speaker 2>Initially,

00:30:13.395 --> 00:30:15.715
<v Speaker 2>I got involved because people were wrong on

00:30:15.715 --> 00:30:17.955
<v Speaker 2>the internet, and I didn't like seeing people

00:30:17.955 --> 00:30:21.290
<v Speaker 2>being wrong. TV comic right there. It is.

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:22.890
<v Speaker 2>So, like, people were wrong online, and I

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:24.250
<v Speaker 2>was like, I'm not standing for this at

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:25.690
<v Speaker 2>six in the morning before I've had any

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:27.850
<v Speaker 2>coffee. So I thumbed out a tweet, like

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:30.889
<v Speaker 2>10 tweets long, and it went wildly viral,

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:32.090
<v Speaker 2>for tech Twitter at least.

00:30:32.985 --> 00:30:35.625
<v Speaker 2>And I got dragged into

00:30:35.705 --> 00:30:38.585
<v Speaker 2>SIG Contributor Experience, a SIG that I no

00:30:38.585 --> 00:30:39.465
<v Speaker 2>longer touch,

00:30:39.945 --> 00:30:42.585
<v Speaker 2>really, to write some blog articles explaining

00:30:42.985 --> 00:30:45.625
<v Speaker 2>what was actually going on, the actual implications

00:30:45.625 --> 00:30:48.570
<v Speaker 2>of removing the Dockershim and why people were

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:50.649
<v Speaker 2>misunderstanding and freaking out online.

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:51.850
<v Speaker 2>From there,

00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:54.730
<v Speaker 2>SIG Release liked the way I handled that

00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:57.530
<v Speaker 2>from a communications perspective and asked me to

00:30:57.530 --> 00:31:00.090
<v Speaker 2>come shadow on the comms subteam

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:00.730
<v Speaker 2>for

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:03.050
<v Speaker 2>version 1.22.

00:31:03.585 --> 00:31:05.985
<v Speaker 2>And then I just never left because it

00:31:05.985 --> 00:31:08.945
<v Speaker 2>turns out that being on the release team

00:31:08.945 --> 00:31:10.864
<v Speaker 2>is a constant barrage

00:31:11.265 --> 00:31:14.544
<v Speaker 2>of somebody is wrong on the internet or

00:31:14.865 --> 00:31:17.825
<v Speaker 2>I see this glaring problem that everybody else

00:31:17.825 --> 00:31:19.790
<v Speaker 2>is just stepping around. I know how to

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:22.270
<v Speaker 2>fix that. I will go fix that. So

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:24.270
<v Speaker 2>there's just it is an onslaught. It is

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:25.070
<v Speaker 2>nonstop,

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:28.910
<v Speaker 2>both trying to solve technical issues and interpersonal

00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:31.230
<v Speaker 2>issues. And it just does not get boring

00:31:31.755 --> 00:31:34.554
<v Speaker 2>at all, ever. So I just never left.

00:31:34.555 --> 00:31:36.475
<v Speaker 2>I just kept doing that until they gave

00:31:36.475 --> 00:31:39.034
<v Speaker 2>me a fancy maintainer title.

00:31:39.515 --> 00:31:40.955
<v Speaker 2>And then I went and did the same

00:31:40.955 --> 00:31:42.075
<v Speaker 2>thing in Sigdocs,

00:31:42.075 --> 00:31:43.435
<v Speaker 2>which is why I'm a tech lead over

00:31:43.435 --> 00:31:45.755
<v Speaker 2>there. And now we're working on unfucking the

00:31:45.755 --> 00:31:48.610
<v Speaker 2>way we generate our reference API docs

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:50.770
<v Speaker 2>for the same reason. It is a problem

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:53.490
<v Speaker 2>and nobody else has bothered to fix it

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:54.850
<v Speaker 2>for years. So

00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:56.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fix it.

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:58.690
<v Speaker 1>You say that Yeah. I like solving problems.

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:00.930
<v Speaker 0>Would you say that this itches the like

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:02.450
<v Speaker 0>an ADHD itch?

00:32:03.385 --> 00:32:05.385
<v Speaker 0>Because there's always something going on and you,

00:32:05.385 --> 00:32:07.145
<v Speaker 2>like There's always something on. Switch a ton.

00:32:07.145 --> 00:32:09.625
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. There's there's absolutely always something going on.

00:32:09.625 --> 00:32:10.745
<v Speaker 2>But I'm ignoring

00:32:11.065 --> 00:32:13.305
<v Speaker 2>nine Slack messages right now, all from the

00:32:13.305 --> 00:32:14.825
<v Speaker 2>Kubernetes Slack. Ping.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.519
<v Speaker 2>Don't don't get distracted.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Don't get distracted.

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.280
<v Speaker 2>Who are asking me for something, all of

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.280
<v Speaker 2>them will get it. But, yeah, it's just

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:23.880
<v Speaker 2>if you like chaos

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:27.240
<v Speaker 2>and you thrive in chaotic environments,

00:32:27.784 --> 00:32:30.265
<v Speaker 2>Sig Release may be for you. There we

00:32:30.265 --> 00:32:32.505
<v Speaker 0>go. There's there's the ad. There's the the

00:32:32.505 --> 00:32:34.345
<v Speaker 0>plug at here at the end. We've never

00:32:34.345 --> 00:32:36.505
<v Speaker 1>published a show as a prelude to an

00:32:36.505 --> 00:32:38.184
<v Speaker 1>episode, but that right there is going out.

00:32:38.184 --> 00:32:40.105
<v Speaker 0>That's it. That's it right there. Go for

00:32:40.105 --> 00:32:42.159
<v Speaker 2>it. Yeah. It's it's not always chaotic. We're

00:32:42.159 --> 00:32:44.000
<v Speaker 2>trying to make it less chaotic. We're actively

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.559
<v Speaker 2>making changes to to be less chaotic,

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.719
<v Speaker 2>but it is very

00:32:49.279 --> 00:32:50.880
<v Speaker 2>you're you're all over the place at all

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.774
<v Speaker 2>times by its nature. Another important thing for

00:32:53.774 --> 00:32:55.615
<v Speaker 2>newcomers in SIG release is if you are

00:32:55.615 --> 00:32:57.375
<v Speaker 2>on the release team, you need to be

00:32:57.375 --> 00:32:58.494
<v Speaker 2>real comfortable

00:32:58.815 --> 00:33:01.534
<v Speaker 2>not being afraid of people that you might

00:33:01.534 --> 00:33:03.614
<v Speaker 2>consider to be Kubernetes celebrities.

00:33:04.095 --> 00:33:06.815
<v Speaker 0>There you go. So just because somebody was

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:10.700
<v Speaker 2>one of the original three committers to Kubernetes

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:12.460
<v Speaker 2>and they've been at Google for twenty five

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:12.940
<v Speaker 2>years,

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:14.940
<v Speaker 2>you still got to tell that guy no.

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:17.659
<v Speaker 2>Y'all just him no. Tell they're wrong. Right?

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:19.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Tell him he's wrong. Tell him And

00:33:19.924 --> 00:33:21.445
<v Speaker 2>if he pushes back, then you can come

00:33:21.445 --> 00:33:22.804
<v Speaker 2>crying to your release leader. You can come

00:33:22.804 --> 00:33:24.325
<v Speaker 2>crying to me and we'll take care of

00:33:24.325 --> 00:33:25.605
<v Speaker 2>it. But you do got to not be

00:33:25.605 --> 00:33:28.804
<v Speaker 2>afraid of people like that. Awesome. Great answers.

00:33:28.804 --> 00:33:30.484
<v Speaker 1>Thank you both. And two

00:33:31.205 --> 00:33:33.125
<v Speaker 1>very different answers. Both great answers.

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:35.110
<v Speaker 1>Laura wants to make the world a better

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:37.990
<v Speaker 1>place. Of them psychologically healthy. Lots of people.

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:39.990
<v Speaker 1>And Kat's doing it more with a sword

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:41.750
<v Speaker 1>and go Well,

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:43.830
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I think that actually sums the

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:44.950
<v Speaker 0>both of us up fairly well.

00:33:45.605 --> 00:33:47.925
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Actually. It does. It does. It does.

00:33:47.925 --> 00:33:49.605
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. That's why we work well together. Yeah.

00:33:49.605 --> 00:33:52.085
<v Speaker 2>Exactly. No. You're both doing great work. That's

00:33:51.685 --> 00:33:52.085
<v Speaker 1>And

00:33:52.805 --> 00:33:55.125
<v Speaker 1>I love that it started just from people

00:33:55.125 --> 00:33:57.445
<v Speaker 1>don't understand the talker sham deprecation.

00:33:57.445 --> 00:33:59.765
<v Speaker 1>So Yeah. Just mad as hell

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.040
<v Speaker 2>tweeting at six in the morning. With no

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.880
<v Speaker 0>coffee. That's the line that I'm not sure

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.559
<v Speaker 0>I believe, Kat, is the is the you

00:34:06.559 --> 00:34:09.199
<v Speaker 0>were tweeting. Yeah. With no All of my

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:11.199
<v Speaker 2>worst tweets have happened first thing in the

00:34:11.199 --> 00:34:11.680
<v Speaker 2>morning.

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.760
<v Speaker 0>Okay. That's while I'm waiting for my coffee

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.520
<v Speaker 2>to brew. Yeah. All of the worst ones.

00:34:15.695 --> 00:34:17.614
<v Speaker 0>Okay. That's fair. Alright. I could believe that

00:34:17.614 --> 00:34:18.094
<v Speaker 0>one.

00:34:18.415 --> 00:34:20.335
<v Speaker 0>I think it's more the 10 tweet thread

00:34:20.494 --> 00:34:21.775
<v Speaker 0>is the one I'm not so sure about.

00:34:21.775 --> 00:34:23.614
<v Speaker 0>But okay. Oh, yeah. No. I was banging

00:34:23.614 --> 00:34:24.655
<v Speaker 2>that out while I was waiting for my

00:34:24.655 --> 00:34:26.895
<v Speaker 0>French press. There you go. There you go.

00:34:26.895 --> 00:34:27.695
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Yeah.

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:30.820
<v Speaker 1>Alright. I have one more question. Okay.

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.300
<v Speaker 1>And then we'll see what happens after that.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:34.340
<v Speaker 1>But Kubernetes,

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:37.060
<v Speaker 1>what was the the last release? January,

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:38.100
<v Speaker 1>'1 '30 '3?

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:40.100
<v Speaker 2>'30 '3. Obviously,

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:43.060
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes has been a thing though for the

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.685
<v Speaker 1>best part of anything. Can't ten years? Yeah,

00:34:45.685 --> 00:34:47.764
<v Speaker 1>ten years. Almost eleven. Is there ever going

00:34:47.764 --> 00:34:49.284
<v Speaker 1>be a two point zero or is backwards

00:34:49.205 --> 00:34:50.244
<v Speaker 1>It's

00:34:50.244 --> 00:34:52.405
<v Speaker 1>something the release team tries to enforce

00:34:52.645 --> 00:34:54.005
<v Speaker 1>or encourage.

00:34:54.165 --> 00:34:56.085
<v Speaker 0>It's like, I wish you didn't ask that

00:34:56.085 --> 00:34:58.645
<v Speaker 0>question. I could see it. So here's the

00:34:58.645 --> 00:34:58.885
<v Speaker 2>thing.

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:01.330
<v Speaker 2>That's not my call.

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:04.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. It's, it is not my call

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:07.170
<v Speaker 2>and it never will be. Like, I don't

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:08.050
<v Speaker 2>get to say

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:09.250
<v Speaker 2>when

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:12.770
<v Speaker 2>we finally bump the major version. I mean,

00:35:13.175 --> 00:35:14.375
<v Speaker 1>there is a list. Don't know if there

00:35:14.375 --> 00:35:16.775
<v Speaker 2>ever will be. Sorry. We don't enforce

00:35:16.775 --> 00:35:18.855
<v Speaker 2>things like backwards compatibility.

00:35:18.855 --> 00:35:19.575
<v Speaker 2>Like we,

00:35:19.815 --> 00:35:21.815
<v Speaker 2>we don't enforce anything

00:35:21.815 --> 00:35:24.615
<v Speaker 2>really with respect to the technical implementation

00:35:24.695 --> 00:35:26.215
<v Speaker 2>of an enhancement.

00:35:26.535 --> 00:35:29.369
<v Speaker 2>It is absolutely not within our purview. Who

00:35:29.369 --> 00:35:31.930
<v Speaker 2>does have control over that technically

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:34.170
<v Speaker 2>is SIG architecture?

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:36.089
<v Speaker 2>The enhancements

00:35:36.089 --> 00:35:36.970
<v Speaker 2>subproject

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:39.609
<v Speaker 2>would have a say there, I think.

00:35:40.089 --> 00:35:42.010
<v Speaker 2>But I don't know. I think it's more

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:43.955
<v Speaker 2>fun to just stay as a one point

00:35:43.955 --> 00:35:46.275
<v Speaker 2>zero forever. There's just a list of things

00:35:46.275 --> 00:35:47.955
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see

00:35:48.195 --> 00:35:49.075
<v Speaker 1>that were

00:35:49.475 --> 00:35:51.075
<v Speaker 1>They worked okay at the time and we

00:35:51.075 --> 00:35:52.915
<v Speaker 1>need to change this, we can't because we're

00:35:52.915 --> 00:35:54.675
<v Speaker 1>so far. My favorite example.

00:35:55.155 --> 00:35:57.235
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what the default DNS policy is

00:35:57.235 --> 00:35:59.630
<v Speaker 1>in the Kubernetes cluster? Right? I do not.

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:00.590
<v Speaker 1>It's cluster first. However,

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:03.710
<v Speaker 1>there is a DNS policy called

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:04.510
<v Speaker 1>default.

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:06.830
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like, can we please help fix

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:08.510
<v Speaker 1>this? And the default one made sense at

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:10.110
<v Speaker 1>the time. It means use the default DNS

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:12.110
<v Speaker 1>resolution of the host. Like, fine. Sure. It

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:14.315
<v Speaker 1>should be host first or whatever. But this

00:36:14.315 --> 00:36:16.394
<v Speaker 1>thing things like test. You should just draw

00:36:16.394 --> 00:36:18.234
<v Speaker 1>a line and say, we have a golden

00:36:18.234 --> 00:36:20.394
<v Speaker 1>opportunity. We found your bar. I've actually joined

00:36:20.394 --> 00:36:22.954
<v Speaker 1>a release team. Here's the thing. Going over.

00:36:23.434 --> 00:36:24.474
<v Speaker 2>Maybe got your bar. Baby,

00:36:25.035 --> 00:36:27.355
<v Speaker 2>it's an open source project. PR is welcome.

00:36:27.355 --> 00:36:28.875
<v Speaker 2>Open that PR.

00:36:29.194 --> 00:36:31.490
<v Speaker 2>Like, you want to see the change? Open

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:33.410
<v Speaker 2>the PR. Right. But that's someone would say,

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:35.250
<v Speaker 1>let's just deprecate the default policy, create a

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:36.450
<v Speaker 1>new one with a name, and then make

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:37.330
<v Speaker 1>it 135.

00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:39.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's a that's an okay solution too.

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:41.730
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. And then you're do it. Open a

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:43.795
<v Speaker 2>cap, file an issue, and then fight with

00:36:43.795 --> 00:36:45.635
<v Speaker 1>friends and get them caught But I'm gonna

00:36:45.635 --> 00:36:48.435
<v Speaker 1>have that ready for KubeCon and drum up

00:36:48.595 --> 00:36:51.155
<v Speaker 1>a rally and protest to get this thing

00:36:51.155 --> 00:36:53.795
<v Speaker 1>changed. But yeah. Okay. And and Do you

00:36:53.795 --> 00:36:55.395
<v Speaker 1>have any other questions, Laura, that you would

00:36:55.395 --> 00:36:57.395
<v Speaker 1>like to throw towards Kat? No.

00:36:57.930 --> 00:36:59.849
<v Speaker 0>I'm just enjoying having the two of you

00:36:59.849 --> 00:37:01.530
<v Speaker 0>on the same call with me right now.

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:03.369
<v Speaker 0>That's all. Yeah. Alright. I'm gonna be selfish

00:37:03.369 --> 00:37:05.770
<v Speaker 1>and ask a cool an not tech related

00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:07.849
<v Speaker 1>at all just because I would love to

00:37:07.849 --> 00:37:08.730
<v Speaker 1>know your answers.

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:10.809
<v Speaker 1>Okay? And because I I need a new

00:37:10.809 --> 00:37:12.329
<v Speaker 1>book. I need a new movie, and I

00:37:12.329 --> 00:37:14.244
<v Speaker 1>need a new album to listen to. So

00:37:14.244 --> 00:37:15.605
<v Speaker 1>catch recommendations.

00:37:15.845 --> 00:37:17.445
<v Speaker 1>That's super hits. I don't know what we'll

00:37:17.445 --> 00:37:19.205
<v Speaker 1>call it, but get me a a book,

00:37:19.205 --> 00:37:22.405
<v Speaker 1>a movie, and an album, please. Book.

00:37:23.045 --> 00:37:26.165
<v Speaker 2>I would say have you read Jeff Vandermeer's

00:37:26.165 --> 00:37:26.805
<v Speaker 2>Southern Reach?

00:37:27.309 --> 00:37:28.830
<v Speaker 2>Do you like hard sci Excellent.

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:32.990
<v Speaker 2>You should read, Jeff Vandermeer's Southern Reach. It

00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:35.230
<v Speaker 2>was originally a trilogy. However, he just released

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:36.589
<v Speaker 2>a fourth book a little while ago. I

00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:38.030
<v Speaker 2>just finished it. It's exceptional.

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:41.645
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Go read Jeff Vandermeer's Southern Reach. Movie.

00:37:41.645 --> 00:37:43.325
<v Speaker 2>I have seen Nosferatu

00:37:43.325 --> 00:37:46.445
<v Speaker 2>twice. I'm gonna say go see Nosferatu.

00:37:46.445 --> 00:37:49.085
<v Speaker 2>If you don't wanna go see Nosferatu

00:37:49.085 --> 00:37:50.765
<v Speaker 2>because you don't like horror movies and you

00:37:50.765 --> 00:37:53.005
<v Speaker 2>can't take your children to see a scary

00:37:53.005 --> 00:37:54.605
<v Speaker 2>black and white arthouse

00:37:54.765 --> 00:37:55.405
<v Speaker 2>horror flick,

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.100
<v Speaker 2>I think that

00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:00.380
<v Speaker 2>Kiss Bang is criminally underrated.

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:02.220
<v Speaker 2>It's

00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:04.460
<v Speaker 2>not a horror movie. It's a thriller

00:38:04.619 --> 00:38:06.060
<v Speaker 2>kind of drama

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.940
<v Speaker 2>starring Robert Downey Jr. Before he played Iron

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:10.860
<v Speaker 2>Man. It's very good. It's funny. You should

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:12.995
<v Speaker 2>go watch that album. I don't know. Do

00:38:12.995 --> 00:38:13.955
<v Speaker 2>you like industrial?

00:38:14.355 --> 00:38:16.675
<v Speaker 2>Okay. Are you familiar with the band Health?

00:38:16.995 --> 00:38:19.235
<v Speaker 2>You are now. Go listen to Health.

00:38:19.395 --> 00:38:21.075
<v Speaker 2>Any of their records, but their most recent

00:38:21.075 --> 00:38:23.235
<v Speaker 2>one is great. They're very And are they

00:38:23.235 --> 00:38:25.075
<v Speaker 1>like industrial EDME?

00:38:25.075 --> 00:38:27.235
<v Speaker 1>Are they industrial metal? What genre of industrial

00:38:27.235 --> 00:38:27.570
<v Speaker 1>do they fit in? Metal. Industrial do they

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:28.530
<v Speaker 1>fit in? Metal.

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:31.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay. More like industrial metal.

00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:34.290
<v Speaker 2>They do a lot of collabs with like,

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:36.450
<v Speaker 2>they've done collabs with Bad Omens and Poppy

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:36.770
<v Speaker 2>as So

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:39.010
<v Speaker 2>if you like either of them, you will

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:40.930
<v Speaker 2>also like Health, but Health is significantly more

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:43.785
<v Speaker 2>industrial and Bad Omens is significantly more metal.

00:38:43.785 --> 00:38:44.905
<v Speaker 0>I don't know. I've seen him like four

00:38:44.905 --> 00:38:46.665
<v Speaker 2>times. Cool. That'll keep me busy for the

00:38:46.665 --> 00:38:48.665
<v Speaker 1>next few weeks with my travel. So again,

00:38:48.665 --> 00:38:50.425
<v Speaker 1>selfish question, but I'm glad I asked now.
