00:02:42.594 --> 00:02:46.349
<v Speaker 0>Hello, and welcome back to Rawkode Academy. I'm

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.989
<v Speaker 0>your host, David Flanagan. And today, we have

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.349
<v Speaker 0>a another great episode coming of Rawkode Live.

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.109
<v Speaker 0>Rawkode Live is the show where we take

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:56.030
<v Speaker 0>a look at open source software within the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.545
<v Speaker 0>cloud native and Kubernetes space, And hopefully show

00:02:58.545 --> 00:03:00.945
<v Speaker 0>you enough cool stuff to help simplify your

00:03:00.945 --> 00:03:03.265
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes journey. Because let's face it, this stuff

00:03:03.265 --> 00:03:04.305
<v Speaker 0>is mighty hard.

00:03:05.105 --> 00:03:07.905
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Remember, we love comments. So if you're

00:03:07.905 --> 00:03:09.505
<v Speaker 0>watching this now, feel free to say hello

00:03:09.505 --> 00:03:11.745
<v Speaker 0>in the comments section. As we move through

00:03:11.745 --> 00:03:13.890
<v Speaker 0>today's episode and we're playing with the technology,

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.450
<v Speaker 0>take a moment to ask your questions. Don't

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 0>leave them lingering in your mind because you'll

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.130
<v Speaker 0>forget. We recommend you take them in as

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.010
<v Speaker 0>soon as possible.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.570
<v Speaker 0>Today, we are taking a look at DevSpace

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.570
<v Speaker 0>from Loft. It is a tool to help

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.555
<v Speaker 0>you ship, build, develop Kubernetes applications faster and

00:03:29.555 --> 00:03:32.595
<v Speaker 0>easier. And today's guest today is Leon from

00:03:32.595 --> 00:03:34.915
<v Speaker 0>the Loft team. Hey there. How's it going?

00:03:34.915 --> 00:03:35.475
<v Speaker 1>Pretty

00:03:36.435 --> 00:03:40.195
<v Speaker 1>good. Thanks. It's a beautiful day, surprisingly so.

00:03:40.834 --> 00:03:42.194
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I'm looking forward to the session.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.080
<v Speaker 0>Well, yeah. I mean, you're in Amsterdam. Right?

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.440
<v Speaker 0>And I'm in Glasgow. I think we have

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.640
<v Speaker 0>quite similar weather patterns, which is usually

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Probably. Yeah. Cloudy and rainy and windy. I

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.400
<v Speaker 0>don't know. But today's today has been quite

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.000
<v Speaker 0>nice here too, actually. That's good.

00:03:58.895 --> 00:04:01.295
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So for anyone that

00:04:02.095 --> 00:04:04.175
<v Speaker 0>doesn't know you, hasn't spoken to you before,

00:04:04.175 --> 00:04:05.775
<v Speaker 0>can you please say hello and give us

00:04:05.775 --> 00:04:07.455
<v Speaker 0>a little brief introduction, please?

00:04:08.175 --> 00:04:10.255
<v Speaker 1>I would love to. So my name is

00:04:10.255 --> 00:04:10.975
<v Speaker 1>Leon.

00:04:11.055 --> 00:04:12.175
<v Speaker 1>I'm based in Amsterdam,

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.420
<v Speaker 1>and I'm a DevRel for Loft.

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:16.300
<v Speaker 1>And

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.019
<v Speaker 1>if you know me from any kind of,

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.940
<v Speaker 1>like, social events or something, you probably best

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.100
<v Speaker 1>know me as the chief karaoke officer.

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:25.259
<v Speaker 1>So if we ever are at the same

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:25.980
<v Speaker 1>conference,

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.725
<v Speaker 1>I promise we we will go to karaoke.

00:04:29.525 --> 00:04:30.965
<v Speaker 0>Well, we are going to be at the

00:04:30.965 --> 00:04:33.045
<v Speaker 0>same conference. Right? We are. I booked at

00:04:33.045 --> 00:04:35.205
<v Speaker 1>the Cube Cuddle already. I'm really looking forward

00:04:35.205 --> 00:04:37.685
<v Speaker 1>to it. Yeah. Yeah. We are just, what,

00:04:37.685 --> 00:04:39.365
<v Speaker 0>two and a little bit weeks away, two

00:04:39.365 --> 00:04:40.165
<v Speaker 0>weeks in a few days.

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:41.680
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.039
<v Speaker 0>It's stressful.

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:44.400
<v Speaker 0>But, yeah, I can't wait. So

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:45.919
<v Speaker 0>karaoke

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:46.960
<v Speaker 0>is gonna be awesome.

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:50.560
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Today, we're taking a look at DevSpace.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.240
<v Speaker 0>This is a relatively

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.014
<v Speaker 0>new project to me. I wasn't that familiar

00:04:55.014 --> 00:04:56.215
<v Speaker 0>about it or I hadn't been aware of

00:04:56.215 --> 00:04:57.735
<v Speaker 0>it until a couple of weeks ago. I

00:04:57.735 --> 00:04:59.575
<v Speaker 0>think you you tweeted something and you share

00:04:59.575 --> 00:05:01.255
<v Speaker 0>something, and I thought, hey. Is this this

00:05:01.255 --> 00:05:02.855
<v Speaker 0>looks cool. Like, we need to do something

00:05:02.855 --> 00:05:05.014
<v Speaker 0>on this. So can you just tell us,

00:05:05.014 --> 00:05:07.415
<v Speaker 0>like, what what what's the TLDR for DevSpace?

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Sure. So to me, it's easier to

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.380
<v Speaker 1>say what it does rather than what it

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.940
<v Speaker 1>is.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.660
<v Speaker 1>So, basically, what we're trying to do with

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.180
<v Speaker 1>DevSpace is make the development cycles

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.220
<v Speaker 1>faster.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.740
<v Speaker 1>So if you're developing

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.100
<v Speaker 1>for Kubernetes,

00:05:24.505 --> 00:05:26.105
<v Speaker 1>then, you know, there's all kinds of stuff

00:05:26.105 --> 00:05:27.945
<v Speaker 1>that you need to be aware of, putting

00:05:27.945 --> 00:05:29.465
<v Speaker 1>stuff in a container and everything.

00:05:29.785 --> 00:05:32.265
<v Speaker 1>And most developers, they just wanna focus on

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:33.065
<v Speaker 1>developing.

00:05:33.385 --> 00:05:36.265
<v Speaker 1>So we're trying to just abstract everything away

00:05:36.265 --> 00:05:39.630
<v Speaker 1>from you, make it easy and fast. And

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't wanna go too deep into details

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.310
<v Speaker 1>because I hope we can, you know, like,

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.510
<v Speaker 1>learn by doing.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.110
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I always find this this is one

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.190
<v Speaker 0>of these really common questions that I get

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.310
<v Speaker 0>all the time, you know, when you go

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.305
<v Speaker 0>to conferences and people are doing you know,

00:05:53.305 --> 00:05:54.745
<v Speaker 0>we're all in the same journey, but all

00:05:54.745 --> 00:05:56.425
<v Speaker 0>at different stages of that journey. And it's

00:05:56.425 --> 00:05:58.905
<v Speaker 0>like, yeah, I'm used to developing locally

00:05:58.905 --> 00:06:00.425
<v Speaker 0>and I just installed all the tools and

00:06:00.425 --> 00:06:03.224
<v Speaker 0>it's fine. And then people move towards containers.

00:06:03.224 --> 00:06:04.425
<v Speaker 0>And it's like, okay. Well, I spent up

00:06:04.425 --> 00:06:06.344
<v Speaker 0>some Docker containers and I work against it.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.670
<v Speaker 0>But we're now at this stage, I feel

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.470
<v Speaker 0>where it's not just I've adopted Kubernetes.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.350
<v Speaker 0>It's I've refactored my monolithic application to half

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.310
<v Speaker 0>a dozen or two dozen or 20 services.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.390
<v Speaker 0>I have a Kubernetes cluster. I have service

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.505
<v Speaker 0>meshes. I have all these things. How do

00:06:21.505 --> 00:06:23.105
<v Speaker 0>I develop locally? And you're like,

00:06:24.785 --> 00:06:27.345
<v Speaker 0>good question. You don't. This is this not

00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:29.265
<v Speaker 0>a solved thing yet, but there are tools

00:06:29.265 --> 00:06:30.945
<v Speaker 0>to make it a little bit easier. And

00:06:30.945 --> 00:06:32.705
<v Speaker 0>I this is where DevSpace comes in. Right?

00:06:32.705 --> 00:06:35.020
<v Speaker 0>This is the the market. This is the

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.380
<v Speaker 0>problem that it really wants to help us

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.020
<v Speaker 0>with. So

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Exactly.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.780
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We have And, again, I just have

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.539
<v Speaker 1>to say it's not gonna solve, like, every

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:44.220
<v Speaker 1>problem that you have. Like, I I don't

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.060
<v Speaker 1>even know, like, service meshes. And if you

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.660
<v Speaker 1>have, like, something that's super distributed,

00:06:48.615 --> 00:06:51.095
<v Speaker 1>you might get it to work. I probably

00:06:51.095 --> 00:06:52.535
<v Speaker 1>could point you to the people who can

00:06:52.535 --> 00:06:54.215
<v Speaker 1>help you with that. But,

00:06:54.535 --> 00:06:56.215
<v Speaker 1>yeah, there's, like for now,

00:06:56.535 --> 00:06:58.935
<v Speaker 1>this is, like, tackling the most common issues

00:06:58.935 --> 00:07:01.015
<v Speaker 1>that people have, not every single one.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Awesome. Oh, hey, Marino. Yeah. There there's quite

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.390
<v Speaker 0>a lot of comments going on in the

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.030
<v Speaker 0>chat. People are are very excited, so awesome.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.070
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Well, we're gonna take a look at

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.350
<v Speaker 0>DevSpace. So let's make sure that screen share

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:16.470
<v Speaker 0>is all up in business.

00:07:18.235 --> 00:07:20.155
<v Speaker 0>I guess we could share everybody and see

00:07:20.155 --> 00:07:22.074
<v Speaker 0>we were having some I was having some

00:07:22.074 --> 00:07:24.074
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes trouble prior to this going live, and

00:07:24.074 --> 00:07:25.835
<v Speaker 0>I couldn't get a cluster to work. Go

00:07:25.835 --> 00:07:26.475
<v Speaker 0>figure.

00:07:26.794 --> 00:07:27.835
<v Speaker 0>Pretty standard.

00:07:28.074 --> 00:07:28.635
<v Speaker 0>Well,

00:07:29.035 --> 00:07:31.530
<v Speaker 1>gonna say right now that it's it's you

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:34.410
<v Speaker 1>can use DevSpace locally or on a remote

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:37.130
<v Speaker 1>cluster. It works the same way. So luckily

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:37.930
<v Speaker 1>that we

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.330
<v Speaker 1>had some backups.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.290
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Well, we can definitely try both. Right?

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:45.275
<v Speaker 0>I I've got a mini cube cluster, which

00:07:45.275 --> 00:07:47.354
<v Speaker 0>is the one I'm currently looking at right

00:07:47.354 --> 00:07:49.435
<v Speaker 0>now. But I do have a SQL cloud

00:07:49.435 --> 00:07:51.354
<v Speaker 0>or a SQL cluster that we can switch

00:07:51.354 --> 00:07:52.634
<v Speaker 0>to it and maybe try and see what

00:07:52.634 --> 00:07:54.235
<v Speaker 0>that remote experience looks like.

00:07:54.634 --> 00:07:57.514
<v Speaker 0>We also have the DevSpace website here. So

00:07:57.514 --> 00:07:58.955
<v Speaker 0>it's got some nice little

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.250
<v Speaker 0>kind of walk throughs here on the homepage,

00:08:02.729 --> 00:08:05.050
<v Speaker 0>and we're just gonna kinda get started on

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.410
<v Speaker 0>this. I think we'll just send a learn

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:08.330
<v Speaker 0>this by doing, which is my favorite way.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.810
<v Speaker 0>I hope that's okay for you. Yeah. Same.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:11.530
<v Speaker 1>Of course. Yeah.

00:08:12.544 --> 00:08:14.305
<v Speaker 0>Right. That's the first thing you need is

00:08:14.305 --> 00:08:15.425
<v Speaker 1>the CLI

00:08:16.065 --> 00:08:18.865
<v Speaker 1>that will make things easier. Well, well, actually,

00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:20.225
<v Speaker 1>you needed to run it.

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:21.265
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:08:21.985 --> 00:08:23.905
<v Speaker 0>We've got a nice graphic. This is a

00:08:24.145 --> 00:08:25.505
<v Speaker 0>go over this in a moment. But let's

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:26.865
<v Speaker 0>see if we can get the CLI first.

00:08:26.865 --> 00:08:27.930
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Yeah.

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.970
<v Speaker 0>Then Would you should you do you want

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:34.809
<v Speaker 1>me to tell you where to find things,

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:37.130
<v Speaker 1>or do you wanna, like, explore for yourself

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.105
<v Speaker 1>a little bit? I kinda prefer exploring, and

00:08:40.105 --> 00:08:41.304
<v Speaker 0>I I know you're gonna be sitting there

00:08:41.304 --> 00:08:42.824
<v Speaker 0>cringing as I'm like, oh, I don't know

00:08:42.824 --> 00:08:44.105
<v Speaker 0>what I'm saying. But

00:08:44.425 --> 00:08:47.545
<v Speaker 0>yeah. No. Consider This is excellent because it

00:08:48.024 --> 00:08:49.785
<v Speaker 1>this is how we, like, improve our docs,

00:08:49.785 --> 00:08:51.704
<v Speaker 1>I think. Exactly. It's a litmus test for

00:08:51.704 --> 00:08:52.505
<v Speaker 0>documentation.

00:08:52.505 --> 00:08:54.360
<v Speaker 0>It's like, you know, how long is it

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.720
<v Speaker 0>gonna take me to find the thing that

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.360
<v Speaker 0>I need?

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.160
<v Speaker 0>But at least I think I just bridged

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.639
<v Speaker 0>all these things. I'm not feeling Yeah. Too

00:09:01.639 --> 00:09:03.000
<v Speaker 0>worried about that.

00:09:03.959 --> 00:09:05.720
<v Speaker 1>Should be fine. It's not that huge.

00:09:07.455 --> 00:09:09.055
<v Speaker 1>But I did see what happened when you

00:09:09.055 --> 00:09:11.535
<v Speaker 1>tried to start that mini cube. It

00:09:11.535 --> 00:09:13.375
<v Speaker 1>had me a bit worried. Well, you know,

00:09:13.375 --> 00:09:15.935
<v Speaker 0>I've I've been at this office space for

00:09:15.935 --> 00:09:18.655
<v Speaker 0>a little under a year now. And the

00:09:18.815 --> 00:09:20.735
<v Speaker 0>people that provide Internet to the office space,

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.760
<v Speaker 0>they they charge extortionate amounts. Like like it

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.360
<v Speaker 0>was the nineties and Internet with those new

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.040
<v Speaker 0>things. So I told them to go away

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.560
<v Speaker 0>and I run off of a five g

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.240
<v Speaker 0>router and I have done all year and

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.400
<v Speaker 0>it's just been perfect. But I know at

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.520
<v Speaker 0>some point, I'm gonna

00:09:34.265 --> 00:09:36.425
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna feel the pain of using a

00:09:36.425 --> 00:09:37.385
<v Speaker 0>five g viewer.

00:09:38.105 --> 00:09:40.345
<v Speaker 0>Okay. We have DevSpace.

00:09:40.585 --> 00:09:42.425
<v Speaker 0>So let's maybe go back to that image

00:09:42.425 --> 00:09:45.065
<v Speaker 0>and kinda try and understand what it's doing.

00:09:45.065 --> 00:09:47.865
<v Speaker 0>So this is the Yeah. How does it

00:09:47.865 --> 00:09:50.839
<v Speaker 0>work? And I see things like Docker, Canico.

00:09:50.839 --> 00:09:53.399
<v Speaker 0>I see Registry. I see YAML. So

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.720
<v Speaker 0>what what is the the starting point for,

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.760
<v Speaker 0>know, taking a project and using DevSpace against

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:01.000
<v Speaker 0>it?

00:10:02.245 --> 00:10:04.885
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So luckily, those are numbers, so that

00:10:04.885 --> 00:10:06.725
<v Speaker 1>helps a little bit for figuring out what

00:10:06.725 --> 00:10:07.685
<v Speaker 1>happens first.

00:10:08.645 --> 00:10:11.045
<v Speaker 1>You usually, you start with a project that

00:10:11.045 --> 00:10:13.125
<v Speaker 1>is already containerized. So you have a Docker

00:10:13.125 --> 00:10:13.765
<v Speaker 1>file,

00:10:14.639 --> 00:10:15.199
<v Speaker 1>and

00:10:15.759 --> 00:10:18.720
<v Speaker 1>you probably also already need, like, at least

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.360
<v Speaker 1>a

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.279
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes manifest,

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.079
<v Speaker 1>or you can use customize or helm charts.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.639
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of the prerequisites

00:10:26.639 --> 00:10:28.480
<v Speaker 1>to really get starting with DevSpace.

00:10:29.835 --> 00:10:30.955
<v Speaker 1>Okay. And then

00:10:31.915 --> 00:10:34.075
<v Speaker 1>yeah. So I'm just gonna kind of rephrase

00:10:34.075 --> 00:10:35.355
<v Speaker 1>this this image.

00:10:35.515 --> 00:10:36.155
<v Speaker 1>So

00:10:37.195 --> 00:10:39.995
<v Speaker 1>when you initialize a project to use with

00:10:39.995 --> 00:10:40.795
<v Speaker 1>DevSpace,

00:10:41.195 --> 00:10:43.675
<v Speaker 1>it will create a DevSpace YAML for you.

00:10:43.675 --> 00:10:45.330
<v Speaker 1>So, I mean, like,

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:48.050
<v Speaker 1>YAML. Right? We're doing Kubernetes. So, obviously, we're

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:49.090
<v Speaker 1>gonna have a YAML.

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.690
<v Speaker 1>DevSpace, so the CLI when I say DevSpace,

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:54.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably gonna refer to the the tool,

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:57.065
<v Speaker 1>the CLI now from now on. So DevSpace

00:10:57.065 --> 00:10:59.865
<v Speaker 1>will look for the DevSpace YAML, read the

00:10:59.865 --> 00:11:00.585
<v Speaker 1>config,

00:11:00.745 --> 00:11:02.745
<v Speaker 1>and then build a

00:11:02.905 --> 00:11:03.465
<v Speaker 1>image

00:11:04.105 --> 00:11:06.505
<v Speaker 1>using whatever build tool you say it should.

00:11:07.145 --> 00:11:08.105
<v Speaker 1>It will then

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.160
<v Speaker 1>push the image to the registry. Maybe you

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.240
<v Speaker 1>can also say that you wanna skip pushing

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.240
<v Speaker 1>to registries, and it will just build that

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.760
<v Speaker 1>in memory, I believe. Then

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.560
<v Speaker 1>it will check your kube conf

00:11:22.275 --> 00:11:25.955
<v Speaker 1>KubeConfig, KubeContext to understand, like, which Kubernetes cluster

00:11:25.955 --> 00:11:27.715
<v Speaker 1>should use. This is where you can, like,

00:11:27.715 --> 00:11:29.955
<v Speaker 1>use a local one or a remote one.

00:11:30.755 --> 00:11:32.995
<v Speaker 1>And then it will deploy your project to

00:11:32.995 --> 00:11:35.715
<v Speaker 1>that cluster with Helm charts or, as I

00:11:35.715 --> 00:11:37.315
<v Speaker 1>said, customize or

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:38.860
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes manifest.

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.500
<v Speaker 1>And this is kind of the the, like,

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.740
<v Speaker 1>the the basic workflow,

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.460
<v Speaker 1>but then DevSpace also has this has this

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.220
<v Speaker 1>dev mode that does a bunch of cool

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.380
<v Speaker 1>stuff. That is where we try to

00:11:51.254 --> 00:11:53.894
<v Speaker 1>improve kind of, like, the the development cycle.

00:11:54.295 --> 00:11:57.095
<v Speaker 1>So there's stuff like hot reloading where if

00:11:57.095 --> 00:11:59.815
<v Speaker 1>you make changes in your source code,

00:12:00.214 --> 00:12:01.334
<v Speaker 1>we're not gonna

00:12:01.574 --> 00:12:04.375
<v Speaker 1>rebuild the image, and we're not gonna redeploy

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:06.269
<v Speaker 1>the container. Instead, what we're we're gonna do

00:12:06.269 --> 00:12:08.829
<v Speaker 1>is we're gonna mount the changes directly into

00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:11.070
<v Speaker 1>the running container so you will instantly see

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:12.110
<v Speaker 1>the changes.

00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:14.670
<v Speaker 1>It can start a

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.589
<v Speaker 1>SSH server in your pod, so in your

00:12:18.589 --> 00:12:19.310
<v Speaker 1>application

00:12:19.395 --> 00:12:21.955
<v Speaker 1>that you can, like, SSH into the container

00:12:21.955 --> 00:12:23.875
<v Speaker 1>and do whatever stuff you need to do.

00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:26.515
<v Speaker 1>It can start a terminal for you automatically

00:12:26.995 --> 00:12:27.715
<v Speaker 1>through,

00:12:27.955 --> 00:12:29.715
<v Speaker 1>like, a configuration DevSpace.

00:12:30.115 --> 00:12:30.675
<v Speaker 1>And

00:12:30.915 --> 00:12:32.915
<v Speaker 1>yeah. So this is all, like, stuff that

00:12:32.915 --> 00:12:35.710
<v Speaker 1>we could, hopefully, we'll be able to explore.

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:38.750
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. I mean, the only challenge there is

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:41.150
<v Speaker 0>is me. So, hopefully, I don't break things

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:42.430
<v Speaker 0>too much. Alright.

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:44.510
<v Speaker 0>So I'm gonna try and summarize that just

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:45.550
<v Speaker 0>to make sure that I have a a

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.470
<v Speaker 0>really good mental model and understanding Yeah. Of

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:50.154
<v Speaker 0>what DevSpace is doing. But it sounds like

00:12:50.154 --> 00:12:52.395
<v Speaker 0>I just take my existing project that I'm

00:12:52.395 --> 00:12:53.835
<v Speaker 0>working on, whether that be a monolith or

00:12:53.835 --> 00:12:57.595
<v Speaker 0>a microservice, like, whatever. I added DevSpace.YAML.

00:12:57.595 --> 00:12:59.035
<v Speaker 0>We don't know what that looks like yet,

00:12:59.035 --> 00:13:00.315
<v Speaker 0>but I'm sure we'll be right in one

00:13:00.315 --> 00:13:01.035
<v Speaker 0>of them in just a moment.

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:04.510
<v Speaker 0>From that configuration, the DevSpace CLI is capable

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.710
<v Speaker 0>of building the image using whatever tools I

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:08.830
<v Speaker 0>already use,

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:11.470
<v Speaker 0>optionally pushing it to a registry,

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:14.430
<v Speaker 0>and then using my current cube context to

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.350
<v Speaker 0>deploy that to a Kubernetes cluster.

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:18.665
<v Speaker 0>And you mentioned that it has a dev

00:13:18.665 --> 00:13:19.865
<v Speaker 0>mode. We see that on the right hand

00:13:19.865 --> 00:13:21.705
<v Speaker 0>side here. And this has given us that

00:13:21.705 --> 00:13:24.185
<v Speaker 0>convenience features that we're starting to see more

00:13:24.185 --> 00:13:26.265
<v Speaker 0>and more of, which really helps us get

00:13:26.265 --> 00:13:29.225
<v Speaker 0>that sharp feedback loop for developing our applications.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.120
<v Speaker 0>Hot reloading, so important. Like, who really wants

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.960
<v Speaker 0>to sit and wait for Docker image build

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.200
<v Speaker 0>to work every single time they change a

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.600
<v Speaker 0>bit of their code? Yeah. Exactly.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.760
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. And the local Well, guess people who

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.920
<v Speaker 1>are people who are bored in an office

00:13:42.575 --> 00:13:44.495
<v Speaker 1>love when there's docker build, and you can,

00:13:44.495 --> 00:13:45.855
<v Speaker 1>like, go and have a coffee and chat

00:13:45.855 --> 00:13:47.214
<v Speaker 1>with someone for half an hour and then

00:13:47.214 --> 00:13:49.295
<v Speaker 1>come back. Or jump on a wheelchair and

00:13:49.295 --> 00:13:50.975
<v Speaker 0>have a sword fight. I don't know. Whatever

00:13:50.975 --> 00:13:52.175
<v Speaker 0>whatever your preference.

00:13:52.815 --> 00:13:54.095
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

00:13:54.495 --> 00:13:56.495
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Okay. So hot reloading,

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.389
<v Speaker 0>local host access put forward, and all the

00:13:59.389 --> 00:14:00.990
<v Speaker 0>logging that I need. And then

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:03.550
<v Speaker 0>I haven't seen this last feature working well

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:05.149
<v Speaker 0>on any other tool yet, so I'm very

00:14:05.149 --> 00:14:05.709
<v Speaker 0>excited.

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:07.709
<v Speaker 0>No. I don't even know if we have

00:14:07.709 --> 00:14:09.550
<v Speaker 0>a right application to try and debug something.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:10.910
<v Speaker 0>But debugging, I've always I wanna

00:14:11.765 --> 00:14:13.845
<v Speaker 1>I have not even tried that debugging feature,

00:14:13.845 --> 00:14:15.125
<v Speaker 1>but I guess we'll find out.

00:14:15.605 --> 00:14:18.245
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. Awesome. Okay. I'm gonna click on

00:14:18.245 --> 00:14:20.405
<v Speaker 0>initialize the project because I'm assuming this is

00:14:20.405 --> 00:14:21.285
<v Speaker 0>gonna guide

00:14:21.525 --> 00:14:24.485
<v Speaker 0>us through getting set up. Yeah. It's a

00:14:24.485 --> 00:14:25.445
<v Speaker 1>good way to get started.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:28.370
<v Speaker 0>I like that I can just use one

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:29.570
<v Speaker 0>of these quick starts.

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:31.810
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna try and make my life a

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:32.690
<v Speaker 0>little bit easier.

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:35.090
<v Speaker 0>Just do Node. Js,

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:37.570
<v Speaker 0>and then maybe we'll do we'll see how

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:38.850
<v Speaker 0>things are going, and we we can always

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:40.370
<v Speaker 0>try Go. But I think maybe Node. Js

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:41.915
<v Speaker 0>is a good Sure. Point. When you think

00:14:41.915 --> 00:14:44.154
<v Speaker 0>about I was gonna dis I was gonna

00:14:44.154 --> 00:14:46.394
<v Speaker 1>discourage you from using Ruby and ASP dot

00:14:46.394 --> 00:14:47.675
<v Speaker 1>NET. That was the only thing that I

00:14:47.675 --> 00:14:49.915
<v Speaker 1>was like, maybe don't do that because I

00:14:49.915 --> 00:14:51.755
<v Speaker 1>I think there's some like, I couldn't get

00:14:51.755 --> 00:14:53.915
<v Speaker 1>them to run on my machine probably because

00:14:53.915 --> 00:14:54.795
<v Speaker 1>I have an m one.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.840
<v Speaker 1>So I think we haven't updated those yet.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.880
<v Speaker 0>Cool. Yeah. I'm not very comfortable with those

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.920
<v Speaker 0>languages, so I'm quite happy to avoid them.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.040
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's see what we have here in

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.480
<v Speaker 0>this example application.

00:15:10.095 --> 00:15:12.495
<v Speaker 0>Do I trust? Sure. Go for it.

00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:14.335
<v Speaker 0>So this

00:15:14.895 --> 00:15:16.895
<v Speaker 0>alright. So this is just an express application

00:15:16.895 --> 00:15:19.455
<v Speaker 0>that's gonna throw some HTML right down to

00:15:19.455 --> 00:15:22.495
<v Speaker 0>the browser. Yep. That's fine. Exactly. We have

00:15:22.495 --> 00:15:25.139
<v Speaker 0>a docker upload in my font. Tiny because

00:15:25.139 --> 00:15:26.820
<v Speaker 0>I was doing some other stuff today.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.459
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Okay. That's good. Now we have a

00:15:31.459 --> 00:15:32.339
<v Speaker 0>docker file

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.700
<v Speaker 0>just using node Alpine, doing a quick copy,

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.019
<v Speaker 0>NPM install. It's pretty much what we'd expect.

00:15:39.235 --> 00:15:40.595
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty fair.

00:15:40.834 --> 00:15:41.395
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:15:41.795 --> 00:15:44.915
<v Speaker 0>Yep. I don't see a DevSpace surprises there.

00:15:44.755 --> 00:15:46.755
<v Speaker 0>So I must remember we're gonna is that

00:15:46.755 --> 00:15:48.035
<v Speaker 0>a command for that?

00:15:48.834 --> 00:15:51.475
<v Speaker 1>Yes. Yeah. So the the quick start is,

00:15:51.475 --> 00:15:53.590
<v Speaker 1>like, just the project. So we're gonna walk

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:56.070
<v Speaker 1>you through, like, the that that is, like,

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:58.790
<v Speaker 1>probably what you already have, and then the

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:00.390
<v Speaker 1>rest of it is, like, okay. Now you're

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:03.270
<v Speaker 1>introducing DevSpace. Yeah. That's good. Like, don't make

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:05.910
<v Speaker 0>any assumptions, which I like. So Exactly.

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:07.910
<v Speaker 0>It's detected JavaScript.

00:16:09.404 --> 00:16:11.005
<v Speaker 0>Oh, how do I want to deploy?

00:16:12.685 --> 00:16:15.245
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So the for the for the for

00:16:15.245 --> 00:16:17.085
<v Speaker 1>the quick start products, we do have Helm

00:16:17.085 --> 00:16:20.285
<v Speaker 1>charts that we have in a remote repository.

00:16:20.365 --> 00:16:21.325
<v Speaker 1>If you feel super

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:23.819
<v Speaker 1>adventurous, we could try one of the others,

00:16:23.819 --> 00:16:25.740
<v Speaker 1>but then you would have to, like, actually

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.260
<v Speaker 1>write them yourself, I believe.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:28.779
<v Speaker 1>So the easiest

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.420
<v Speaker 1>is to use the Helm chart. I think

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.420
<v Speaker 1>it's also in the docs. I'm not quite

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.180
<v Speaker 1>sure, but I think I recently changed them

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.019
<v Speaker 1>to just, like, walk you through the actual

00:16:37.259 --> 00:16:39.365
<v Speaker 1>like, what you what should you choose at

00:16:39.365 --> 00:16:40.644
<v Speaker 1>every step of the way.

00:16:41.445 --> 00:16:42.084
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:16:42.565 --> 00:16:44.165
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. You have. Okay.

00:16:45.285 --> 00:16:47.524
<v Speaker 0>Well, let's start with helm. Because I If

00:16:47.524 --> 00:16:49.045
<v Speaker 0>we do the goal one, we will we

00:16:49.045 --> 00:16:49.925
<v Speaker 0>feel adventurous.

00:16:51.149 --> 00:16:52.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Let's let's let's see what the hell

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:55.550
<v Speaker 1>yeah. What this does for us with the

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:57.790
<v Speaker 1>easy the easy start. Yeah. So we also

00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:59.870
<v Speaker 1>detect that it's a quick start project, which

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:01.790
<v Speaker 1>makes the setup a bit more streamlined.

00:17:02.845 --> 00:17:04.044
<v Speaker 1>And then, yeah,

00:17:04.525 --> 00:17:06.285
<v Speaker 1>we want to develop because we wanna see

00:17:06.285 --> 00:17:07.804
<v Speaker 1>all the cool dev mode stuff.

00:17:08.525 --> 00:17:11.244
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. We have a Dockerfile there already.

00:17:11.885 --> 00:17:14.605
<v Speaker 1>And since you're local, I would probably suggest

00:17:14.605 --> 00:17:15.085
<v Speaker 1>skipping.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.400
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I don't have to want to deal

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.159
<v Speaker 0>with credentials that are remote.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.480
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Okay. So we'll just avoid that for

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:21.960
<v Speaker 0>now.

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:25.000
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm. Alright. So this is telling us So

00:17:25.799 --> 00:17:27.240
<v Speaker 0>We can use

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.200
<v Speaker 0>the namespace if we want to I'm just

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.285
<v Speaker 0>gonna use default, which is my context. I

00:17:32.285 --> 00:17:33.325
<v Speaker 0>I don't think we need to worry about

00:17:33.325 --> 00:17:34.205
<v Speaker 0>that. But I

00:17:34.605 --> 00:17:36.684
<v Speaker 0>believe now we can do DevSpace dev

00:17:37.885 --> 00:17:38.684
<v Speaker 0>and

00:17:38.845 --> 00:17:41.645
<v Speaker 0>oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm okay with that. Yeah.

00:17:41.645 --> 00:17:43.920
<v Speaker 1>So there's a warning that it's like, are

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:44.640
<v Speaker 1>you sure?

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.880
<v Speaker 1>Because you might be on a shared cluster.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.960
<v Speaker 1>You might, like, be on the kind of

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.960
<v Speaker 1>dev cluster when you're sharing that with other

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:51.840
<v Speaker 1>people. So

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.400
<v Speaker 1>just just wanna make sure you're not breaking

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.920
<v Speaker 1>anything. Is DevSpace specifically targeted at

00:17:58.445 --> 00:18:01.165
<v Speaker 0>dev clusters and not production clusters? Or is

00:18:01.165 --> 00:18:03.405
<v Speaker 0>that something that you think it's gonna open

00:18:03.405 --> 00:18:05.405
<v Speaker 0>up to maybe production clusters? Or

00:18:06.285 --> 00:18:08.205
<v Speaker 1>You can use it for production clusters as

00:18:08.205 --> 00:18:10.205
<v Speaker 1>well as well. There's there's

00:18:10.205 --> 00:18:12.929
<v Speaker 1>another command that's DevSpace deploy, which would then

00:18:12.929 --> 00:18:15.010
<v Speaker 1>not start the dev mode, but just deploy

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:15.730
<v Speaker 1>your

00:18:16.049 --> 00:18:17.009
<v Speaker 1>application,

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:20.450
<v Speaker 1>like, kind of like you would in on

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:22.130
<v Speaker 1>prod. We can check that out. And you

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:24.370
<v Speaker 1>can use it in prod. You can use

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.770
<v Speaker 1>DevSpace to do some CICD stuff for you.

00:18:27.335 --> 00:18:29.735
<v Speaker 1>Ideally, you would use DevSpace for everything, so

00:18:29.735 --> 00:18:31.975
<v Speaker 1>it really behaves the same way everywhere, and

00:18:31.975 --> 00:18:33.174
<v Speaker 1>it actually manages

00:18:33.255 --> 00:18:35.815
<v Speaker 1>your environment no matter where whether it's, like,

00:18:35.815 --> 00:18:37.335
<v Speaker 1>dev or staging or prod.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:40.070
<v Speaker 1>But

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:41.830
<v Speaker 1>yeah. I mean, like, most of our users

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.510
<v Speaker 1>use it for development because the dev mode

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:44.870
<v Speaker 1>is really the thing that

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:47.990
<v Speaker 1>stands out, I guess. I see that Oleg

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:49.670
<v Speaker 1>said hi, which is great because Oleg is

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:51.750
<v Speaker 1>one of the engineers at Loft. So if

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.030
<v Speaker 1>we have a question, maybe he can help

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:53.350
<v Speaker 1>us out.

00:18:54.255 --> 00:18:56.255
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Always good to have support in the

00:18:56.255 --> 00:18:56.815
<v Speaker 0>chat.

00:18:57.535 --> 00:18:59.375
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So I suspected I was in a

00:18:59.375 --> 00:19:01.615
<v Speaker 0>container here because my prompt changed. I typed

00:19:01.615 --> 00:19:03.375
<v Speaker 0>who am I? It says root. So, yeah,

00:19:03.375 --> 00:19:05.855
<v Speaker 0>DevSpace dev has Yeah. Spun up a container

00:19:05.855 --> 00:19:08.015
<v Speaker 0>and then put me in an interactive shell.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:11.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh-huh. Exactly. You are in the container right

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:11.889
<v Speaker 1>now.

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:15.170
<v Speaker 1>I opened the terminal for you. You can

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:16.370
<v Speaker 1>see probably

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:19.090
<v Speaker 1>yeah. So

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.650
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of things that

00:19:23.765 --> 00:19:24.565
<v Speaker 1>that

00:19:24.725 --> 00:19:26.645
<v Speaker 1>DevSpace does in the background, which we can

00:19:26.645 --> 00:19:29.044
<v Speaker 1>look at later in the YAML. But for

00:19:29.044 --> 00:19:30.164
<v Speaker 1>now, all you need to know is that

00:19:30.164 --> 00:19:32.164
<v Speaker 1>we are in the container now. We have

00:19:32.164 --> 00:19:34.405
<v Speaker 1>not started the web server yet.

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.740
<v Speaker 1>That's why it says, like, this is how

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.620
<v Speaker 1>you can work with it if you're yeah.

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.379
<v Speaker 1>If you want, you can, yeah,

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:44.100
<v Speaker 1>check out the container some more, or you

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.500
<v Speaker 1>can run NPM star to see the

00:19:46.915 --> 00:19:47.875
<v Speaker 1>application.

00:19:48.195 --> 00:19:50.115
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I just I just wanted to poke

00:19:50.115 --> 00:19:52.355
<v Speaker 0>around. I'm loving No. The sleep command. Fair

00:19:52.355 --> 00:19:54.435
<v Speaker 0>enough. Of course. This this pipeline. Like, why

00:19:54.435 --> 00:19:55.635
<v Speaker 0>not? Just Yeah.

00:19:56.115 --> 00:19:58.195
<v Speaker 0>I could see the sync thing. I assume

00:19:58.195 --> 00:19:59.875
<v Speaker 0>this is some sort of fail system. We

00:19:59.875 --> 00:20:01.795
<v Speaker 0>have an SSH server and a tunnel and

00:20:01.795 --> 00:20:02.515
<v Speaker 0>then screen.

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:03.610
<v Speaker 0>So

00:20:03.929 --> 00:20:05.769
<v Speaker 0>yeah. Okay. Cool. But

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:08.009
<v Speaker 1>Everything you need to

00:20:08.809 --> 00:20:10.330
<v Speaker 1>pry open the container.

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.690
<v Speaker 1>So, yeah, it also automatically opens this, like,

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:16.585
<v Speaker 1>beautiful web page and then tells you what

00:20:16.585 --> 00:20:19.465
<v Speaker 1>you could do now to try out the

00:20:19.465 --> 00:20:20.345
<v Speaker 1>functionalities

00:20:20.345 --> 00:20:21.384
<v Speaker 1>of DevSpace.

00:20:22.265 --> 00:20:24.425
<v Speaker 0>Hold on a minute. How does it open

00:20:24.425 --> 00:20:24.985
<v Speaker 0>a web page?

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.720
<v Speaker 1>We can look inside the DevSpace YAML to

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.000
<v Speaker 1>do it. If you're asking me how does

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
<v Speaker 1>it happen inside

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:35.399
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.320
<v Speaker 1>Like, under the hood, I don't know that.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.320
<v Speaker 1>But if you open the DevSpace YAML, there's

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.000
<v Speaker 1>a there's a command for that.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:41.880
<v Speaker 1>But,

00:20:42.675 --> 00:20:44.434
<v Speaker 1>yeah, you would have to probably

00:20:44.435 --> 00:20:46.115
<v Speaker 1>leave the container to

00:20:46.595 --> 00:20:48.035
<v Speaker 1>check it out. But

00:20:48.515 --> 00:20:49.955
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It does it only does it once.

00:20:49.955 --> 00:20:50.995
<v Speaker 0>Just don't know how

00:20:51.555 --> 00:20:54.035
<v Speaker 0>did that I mean, DevSpace must have detected

00:20:54.035 --> 00:20:56.915
<v Speaker 0>that a new port was opened or something.

00:20:56.915 --> 00:20:57.475
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure.

00:20:58.710 --> 00:20:59.669
<v Speaker 1>Actually, it

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.670
<v Speaker 1>pulls

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:03.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a hundred a % sure, but

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:05.990
<v Speaker 1>it does, like, a regular check on

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:08.309
<v Speaker 1>you you provide a

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:12.034
<v Speaker 1>URL, and it just does a regular pull

00:21:12.034 --> 00:21:13.635
<v Speaker 1>on it. And as soon as it gets

00:21:13.635 --> 00:21:15.875
<v Speaker 1>like a non 500,

00:21:15.875 --> 00:21:17.315
<v Speaker 1>I wanna say, response,

00:21:18.674 --> 00:21:21.315
<v Speaker 1>it will then open a browser and display

00:21:21.315 --> 00:21:23.554
<v Speaker 1>that page. There

00:21:23.554 --> 00:21:24.674
<v Speaker 0>you go. Okay.

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:29.980
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we now have a DevSpace.YAML.

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:32.540
<v Speaker 0>We can see we've got a version and

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:33.259
<v Speaker 0>a name.

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:35.419
<v Speaker 0>We got something called a pipeline.

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:37.420
<v Speaker 0>We got something called an image Yeah. Something

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:38.380
<v Speaker 0>called a deployment.

00:21:39.184 --> 00:21:40.785
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. There's a lot of stuff happening in

00:21:40.785 --> 00:21:43.745
<v Speaker 1>there. Let's look let's look at the images

00:21:43.745 --> 00:21:45.424
<v Speaker 1>first maybe because this is kind of the

00:21:45.424 --> 00:21:46.465
<v Speaker 1>order of things.

00:21:48.145 --> 00:21:49.744
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So we

00:21:50.304 --> 00:21:52.225
<v Speaker 1>basically say we have a bunch of images,

00:21:52.225 --> 00:21:53.985
<v Speaker 1>and this image is named app.

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:57.169
<v Speaker 1>And then we tell it, like, okay. This

00:21:57.169 --> 00:21:58.929
<v Speaker 1>is how you have to name the image.

00:21:58.929 --> 00:21:59.330
<v Speaker 1>It can

00:22:00.049 --> 00:22:01.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean, if you wanna push it to

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:02.770
<v Speaker 1>a registry, then this is where you would

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:03.489
<v Speaker 1>put the

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:06.929
<v Speaker 1>the full URL with the username and the

00:22:06.929 --> 00:22:08.875
<v Speaker 1>name of the image,

00:22:08.875 --> 00:22:10.634
<v Speaker 1>and then where to find the Docker file?

00:22:11.275 --> 00:22:13.355
<v Speaker 1>And I

00:22:13.355 --> 00:22:16.475
<v Speaker 1>think if you want to use a different

00:22:19.195 --> 00:22:20.235
<v Speaker 1>building

00:22:20.475 --> 00:22:21.035
<v Speaker 1>engine,

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:25.020
<v Speaker 1>then you can provide that as a

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:26.620
<v Speaker 1>property.

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:29.740
<v Speaker 1>I would have to check the

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:32.220
<v Speaker 1>docs myself,

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:34.345
<v Speaker 1>which I am doing right now. Well, we

00:22:34.345 --> 00:22:36.264
<v Speaker 1>have Yeah. Can look at the or

00:22:36.585 --> 00:22:39.304
<v Speaker 1>something else. Uh-huh. Good. Even better.

00:22:40.505 --> 00:22:42.424
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I did not even know that.

00:22:44.024 --> 00:22:46.345
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Well, down here, I don't know. I

00:22:46.345 --> 00:22:48.040
<v Speaker 0>know it's really difficult to do that. But

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.480
<v Speaker 0>it actually detects the Yeah. No. I see.

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.960
<v Speaker 0>As a DevSpace YAML, which was my first

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.040
<v Speaker 0>indication that I could probably all complete this.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.120
<v Speaker 0>And, yeah, looks like we

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.400
<v Speaker 0>we can.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.775
<v Speaker 0>Nice. I like it when projects publish the

00:23:00.775 --> 00:23:02.615
<v Speaker 0>JSON schema, and it just works with Versus

00:23:02.615 --> 00:23:04.295
<v Speaker 0>Code because I spend most of my day

00:23:04.295 --> 00:23:05.895
<v Speaker 0>in Versus Code. So I want I want

00:23:05.895 --> 00:23:07.255
<v Speaker 0>that to be a good experience.

00:23:07.975 --> 00:23:08.855
<v Speaker 1>Makes sense.

00:23:09.255 --> 00:23:09.895
<v Speaker 1>So,

00:23:10.615 --> 00:23:12.215
<v Speaker 1>yeah, we can check deployments next. I'm gonna

00:23:12.215 --> 00:23:14.135
<v Speaker 1>explain pipelines later, but that's it's not super

00:23:14.135 --> 00:23:14.855
<v Speaker 1>important right now.

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:19.809
<v Speaker 1>So here, we have the list of deployments

00:23:19.809 --> 00:23:20.529
<v Speaker 1>that

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:23.090
<v Speaker 1>we can use. And, again, we have, like,

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:24.529
<v Speaker 1>a thing named app,

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:26.850
<v Speaker 1>and we we're just saying right now that

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:28.529
<v Speaker 1>we're using a Helm chart. And here, we

00:23:28.529 --> 00:23:30.610
<v Speaker 1>were loading this from our

00:23:31.605 --> 00:23:34.245
<v Speaker 1>from our own repo, the Charts DevSpace SH

00:23:34.245 --> 00:23:36.805
<v Speaker 1>repo, and it's called component chart. And, like,

00:23:36.805 --> 00:23:38.725
<v Speaker 1>all the other quick starts use the same

00:23:38.725 --> 00:23:39.365
<v Speaker 1>chart.

00:23:40.645 --> 00:23:42.405
<v Speaker 1>I can probably look into it to see

00:23:42.405 --> 00:23:43.845
<v Speaker 1>what exactly gets deployed.

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:47.409
<v Speaker 1>And then we put in some values,

00:23:47.809 --> 00:23:48.529
<v Speaker 1>namely

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:51.250
<v Speaker 1>what the name of the image is and

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:53.970
<v Speaker 1>which port we need to open to access

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:55.249
<v Speaker 1>the website.

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:59.010
<v Speaker 1>And you can use DevSpace deploy,

00:23:59.265 --> 00:24:01.425
<v Speaker 1>So the DevSpace deploy command if you only

00:24:01.425 --> 00:24:03.665
<v Speaker 1>want to deploy this without without opening the

00:24:03.665 --> 00:24:06.305
<v Speaker 1>dev mode. So you could conceivably

00:24:06.305 --> 00:24:09.024
<v Speaker 1>just run DevSpace deploy on a prod

00:24:09.825 --> 00:24:11.905
<v Speaker 1>environment and then just deploy it like it

00:24:11.905 --> 00:24:12.385
<v Speaker 1>is.

00:24:13.185 --> 00:24:13.665
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:16.330
<v Speaker 0>And then I must have been this dev

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:18.090
<v Speaker 0>key is how we hook up the

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:20.409
<v Speaker 0>the reloading and Dev mode. Yeah.

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:23.370
<v Speaker 1>This is the the interesting part. So we

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:25.130
<v Speaker 1>can, like yeah. Let's run from it from

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:25.850
<v Speaker 1>the top, I guess.

00:24:27.034 --> 00:24:27.674
<v Speaker 1>So

00:24:27.995 --> 00:24:30.395
<v Speaker 1>the basically, in dev mode, we're doing a

00:24:30.395 --> 00:24:32.075
<v Speaker 1>bunch of stuff to the container.

00:24:32.475 --> 00:24:34.474
<v Speaker 1>We're modifying it in a lot of ways.

00:24:34.475 --> 00:24:35.674
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing we need to do

00:24:35.674 --> 00:24:37.434
<v Speaker 1>is we have to, like, select the right

00:24:37.434 --> 00:24:39.890
<v Speaker 1>container or the right pod, let's say, right

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:41.650
<v Speaker 1>container. There's a couple of ways you can

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:43.330
<v Speaker 1>do that. You can use an image selector.

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:45.330
<v Speaker 1>So, basically, you would select all the or

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:46.609
<v Speaker 1>the first image

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:49.250
<v Speaker 1>or the first container that has this that's

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:51.250
<v Speaker 1>using this image. I think you can also

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:53.250
<v Speaker 1>use a label selector

00:24:53.545 --> 00:24:55.865
<v Speaker 1>and probably some other ways to do that

00:24:55.865 --> 00:24:56.505
<v Speaker 1>as well.

00:24:57.385 --> 00:24:59.305
<v Speaker 1>Again, we can refer to docs later if

00:24:59.305 --> 00:25:00.345
<v Speaker 1>wanna get

00:25:00.825 --> 00:25:01.544
<v Speaker 1>excited.

00:25:03.145 --> 00:25:05.945
<v Speaker 1>This dev image in line 50, that's a

00:25:05.945 --> 00:25:06.745
<v Speaker 1>pretty cool feature.

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:10.740
<v Speaker 1>So I said that you could deploy your

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:11.619
<v Speaker 1>container

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:12.580
<v Speaker 1>to production.

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:15.619
<v Speaker 1>But then if you're developing,

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.420
<v Speaker 1>you might wanna have a slightly different container,

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:20.419
<v Speaker 1>maybe one that has, like, some kind of

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.820
<v Speaker 1>DevTools installed that you wouldn't want to have

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:25.205
<v Speaker 1>on prod. So here, we will we would

00:25:25.205 --> 00:25:28.565
<v Speaker 1>be replacing the container image with this image

00:25:29.445 --> 00:25:31.284
<v Speaker 1>that we provide a dev image,

00:25:31.684 --> 00:25:34.725
<v Speaker 1>and that's just optimized for development purposes. So

00:25:34.725 --> 00:25:36.725
<v Speaker 1>then we are not using the original image

00:25:36.725 --> 00:25:39.070
<v Speaker 1>anymore. We're using this one. And this image

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:40.909
<v Speaker 1>also doesn't have the source code. We have

00:25:40.909 --> 00:25:44.590
<v Speaker 1>to, like, sync it to this dev container,

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:46.669
<v Speaker 1>which we're doing in the next couple lines.

00:25:47.149 --> 00:25:48.830
<v Speaker 1>This is where the hot reloading happens as

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:52.095
<v Speaker 1>well. We're basically saying, like, okay. I copy

00:25:52.095 --> 00:25:54.495
<v Speaker 1>everything from this path, put it into the

00:25:54.495 --> 00:25:55.615
<v Speaker 1>container.

00:25:56.335 --> 00:26:00.015
<v Speaker 1>You can also exclude things, like, for example.

00:26:00.895 --> 00:26:02.575
<v Speaker 1>This if you're using Dev Image, this is

00:26:02.575 --> 00:26:04.335
<v Speaker 1>super important. Otherwise, you just end up with

00:26:04.335 --> 00:26:05.615
<v Speaker 1>a container with nothing in it.

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:08.379
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:12.619
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Here, we are opening a terminal,

00:26:13.259 --> 00:26:15.580
<v Speaker 1>and there's a bunch of magic happening in

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.019
<v Speaker 1>DevSpace start.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:18.860
<v Speaker 1>We can take a look at that. I

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.185
<v Speaker 1>have not yet, so I would probably be

00:26:21.185 --> 00:26:22.465
<v Speaker 1>learning something if we take a look at

00:26:22.465 --> 00:26:24.625
<v Speaker 1>that. But I actually opened it Yeah. The

00:26:24.625 --> 00:26:26.465
<v Speaker 0>all complete here because I was really hoping

00:26:26.465 --> 00:26:28.945
<v Speaker 0>to see sort of make target option

00:26:29.105 --> 00:26:30.625
<v Speaker 0>where I could just maybe because I don't

00:26:30.625 --> 00:26:31.745
<v Speaker 0>know. I don't I'm not a big fan

00:26:31.745 --> 00:26:33.345
<v Speaker 0>of arbitrary

00:26:33.345 --> 00:26:34.865
<v Speaker 0>scripts lying around and

00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:37.109
<v Speaker 0>maybe supporting some links. Yeah.

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:39.029
<v Speaker 0>I don't yeah. Meet target would be cool

00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:39.589
<v Speaker 0>there.

00:26:40.309 --> 00:26:42.309
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Oleg, I hope you're listening. Right?

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:44.709
<v Speaker 1>This is the feature request now.

00:26:46.389 --> 00:26:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And then we can inject the SSH

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:50.870
<v Speaker 1>server into the container so you can

00:26:51.405 --> 00:26:53.165
<v Speaker 1>either with your IDE or just with your

00:26:53.165 --> 00:26:56.365
<v Speaker 1>shell Right. Connect to the container.

00:26:58.285 --> 00:27:00.685
<v Speaker 1>We also for the quick start, we are

00:27:00.685 --> 00:27:02.765
<v Speaker 1>creating some proxy commands. So, basically, if you

00:27:02.765 --> 00:27:05.920
<v Speaker 1>run DevSpace or kubectl inside the container, it

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.000
<v Speaker 1>will then be proxied to your host machine.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.160
<v Speaker 1>Gotta be super careful with that because everyone

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.000
<v Speaker 1>who has access to the dev container could

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.640
<v Speaker 1>then execute these commands on your

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.480
<v Speaker 1>host machine on your local

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.120
<v Speaker 1>laptop or something. Yeah.

00:27:20.405 --> 00:27:22.725
<v Speaker 1>And then we can also do some port

00:27:22.725 --> 00:27:23.845
<v Speaker 1>forwarding there.

00:27:24.165 --> 00:27:26.325
<v Speaker 1>Not quite sure what the nine two two

00:27:26.325 --> 00:27:27.764
<v Speaker 1>nine port is for.

00:27:28.325 --> 00:27:30.965
<v Speaker 1>The 3,000 is obviously for the web app.

00:27:31.285 --> 00:27:33.205
<v Speaker 0>Maybe the Node. Js will find.

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:36.790
<v Speaker 1>That could be. I'm not sure. I I

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:38.550
<v Speaker 0>guess Guess we could experiment with

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:40.149
<v Speaker 1>yeah. Yeah.

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:43.030
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, finally, that line 72, that's that's

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:44.549
<v Speaker 1>the thing that opens the

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:45.669
<v Speaker 1>browser.

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:47.830
<v Speaker 1>And as I said, so it, yeah, it

00:27:49.414 --> 00:27:51.494
<v Speaker 1>checks the status,

00:27:51.975 --> 00:27:53.575
<v Speaker 1>and then other than five zero two or

00:27:53.575 --> 00:27:55.735
<v Speaker 1>five zero three. Okay. So as soon as

00:27:55.815 --> 00:27:57.494
<v Speaker 1>usually, it's, like, as soon as the

00:27:58.375 --> 00:28:01.815
<v Speaker 1>application starts, it will then open the browser

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:04.570
<v Speaker 1>as you've seen. So when we started the

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:07.290
<v Speaker 1>when we run run DevSpace start, nothing happened.

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:10.250
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as you then ran NPM

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:11.049
<v Speaker 1>start,

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:13.050
<v Speaker 1>that's when the web server actually got started,

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:14.010
<v Speaker 1>and that's when the

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:15.850
<v Speaker 1>the browser opened.

00:28:16.384 --> 00:28:18.384
<v Speaker 1>So this is the this is the cool

00:28:18.384 --> 00:28:20.705
<v Speaker 1>magic part, and the stuff that you see

00:28:20.705 --> 00:28:22.624
<v Speaker 1>here is pretty much like

00:28:23.105 --> 00:28:25.904
<v Speaker 1>the most used features in DevSpace,

00:28:25.904 --> 00:28:27.424
<v Speaker 1>which is why they're all here.

00:28:28.144 --> 00:28:29.440
<v Speaker 1>And we can talk about the others too

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.200
<v Speaker 1>if you want, or we can what we

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.279
<v Speaker 1>haven't tried yet is to actually change some

00:28:33.279 --> 00:28:35.279
<v Speaker 1>source code and see it just, like,

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.960
<v Speaker 1>change in the browser without having to re

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.519
<v Speaker 1>rebuild in everything. Yeah. That's a good idea.

00:28:41.519 --> 00:28:42.480
<v Speaker 0>I mean, we should try and see what

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.225
<v Speaker 0>this kind of feedback look is like for

00:28:44.225 --> 00:28:45.024
<v Speaker 0>developers.

00:28:45.184 --> 00:28:46.784
<v Speaker 0>I'll just add that. I mean, I think

00:28:46.784 --> 00:28:48.544
<v Speaker 0>I was overcomplicating this. We could just do

00:28:48.544 --> 00:28:50.625
<v Speaker 0>command make thing. Right? Like, I don't we

00:28:50.625 --> 00:28:52.705
<v Speaker 0>don't need a special pragma for a big

00:28:52.705 --> 00:28:55.184
<v Speaker 0>target. So I'll take back my feature request.

00:28:55.184 --> 00:28:57.220
<v Speaker 0>You're okay. I like We

00:28:58.179 --> 00:28:59.619
<v Speaker 0>do have a start script.

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:02.980
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I think that's just for for sure

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:04.419
<v Speaker 0>to print DevSpace,

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:06.660
<v Speaker 0>I guess you could run migration

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:07.940
<v Speaker 0>scripts and other things there.

00:29:08.845 --> 00:29:10.925
<v Speaker 0>And I'm gonna pull up the browser

00:29:11.325 --> 00:29:13.405
<v Speaker 0>with that local host on it.

00:29:13.805 --> 00:29:15.565
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm. Let's change

00:29:17.165 --> 00:29:19.405
<v Speaker 0>let's change some text or something. So

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:22.970
<v Speaker 0>index dot g s.

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:26.889
<v Speaker 0>Oh, it tells you to edit the text.

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:28.809
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. It tells you exactly what to

00:29:28.809 --> 00:29:30.890
<v Speaker 1>do. But you don't have to follow it.

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:32.409
<v Speaker 1>Like, you can change other stuff if you

00:29:32.409 --> 00:29:32.809
<v Speaker 1>want to.

00:29:33.544 --> 00:29:36.105
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I am a terrible HTML and

00:29:36.105 --> 00:29:38.345
<v Speaker 0>CSS person. But, I mean, I could probably

00:29:38.345 --> 00:29:39.784
<v Speaker 0>manage to do, like,

00:29:40.745 --> 00:29:41.465
<v Speaker 0>style.

00:29:42.585 --> 00:29:43.304
<v Speaker 1>Oh.

00:29:43.705 --> 00:29:45.385
<v Speaker 1>I would have just removed the line, but

00:29:45.385 --> 00:29:45.705
<v Speaker 1>okay.

00:29:48.669 --> 00:29:50.190
<v Speaker 0>Well, we could try and make a red

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:51.229
<v Speaker 0>background. Right?

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:53.309
<v Speaker 0>Because this I think we're gonna find out.

00:29:53.309 --> 00:29:54.350
<v Speaker 0>I don't even know how to do background

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.990
<v Speaker 0>colors. But

00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:59.070
<v Speaker 1>Okay. You just need to save the file.

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:01.230
<v Speaker 1>You you can now check the logs if

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:02.029
<v Speaker 1>you would like.

00:30:02.625 --> 00:30:04.465
<v Speaker 1>In any case, you have to reload the

00:30:04.465 --> 00:30:06.304
<v Speaker 1>browser to see the changes.

00:30:06.545 --> 00:30:09.745
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you have to reload. Ah. Yeah. Well

00:30:09.745 --> 00:30:10.465
<v Speaker 1>done.

00:30:12.545 --> 00:30:15.025
<v Speaker 0>Yep. That was a nightmare in the past

00:30:15.025 --> 00:30:17.100
<v Speaker 0>life, as you could tell. I know.

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:18.380
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.300
<v Speaker 1>I was gonna say this is not very

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:23.100
<v Speaker 1>eye friendly, but Yeah. Okay. Well done.

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:26.779
<v Speaker 0>We'll just go with the all black approach.

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:28.780
<v Speaker 0>Ta da. Uh-huh.

00:30:29.404 --> 00:30:31.085
<v Speaker 1>And you see this is pretty fast, so

00:30:31.085 --> 00:30:32.604
<v Speaker 1>this this is excellent.

00:30:33.404 --> 00:30:33.965
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:30:34.284 --> 00:30:35.645
<v Speaker 0>K. Cool. So I I can see how

00:30:35.645 --> 00:30:37.804
<v Speaker 0>that works. Russell's

00:30:37.885 --> 00:30:39.965
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Has that the or Uman Russell. The

00:30:39.965 --> 00:30:40.924
<v Speaker 0>red one's not bad.

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:46.059
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So one of the things also is

00:30:46.059 --> 00:30:48.379
<v Speaker 1>that we need to use NodeMon

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:50.379
<v Speaker 1>instead of running Node because,

00:30:52.059 --> 00:30:52.940
<v Speaker 1>otherwise,

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:55.100
<v Speaker 1>we would have to restart the Node process

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.335
<v Speaker 1>all the time if we make a change.

00:30:56.335 --> 00:30:58.095
<v Speaker 1>So NodeMen will detect that there was a

00:30:58.095 --> 00:31:01.054
<v Speaker 1>change, and it will kind of, like, inside

00:31:01.054 --> 00:31:03.455
<v Speaker 1>its own process, restart the node process.

00:31:05.615 --> 00:31:06.414
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:31:06.895 --> 00:31:08.894
<v Speaker 0>Well, that was pretty easy.

00:31:09.855 --> 00:31:12.610
<v Speaker 1>Right? Right? Okay. I think we're done now.

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:15.809
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty good. Alright. Bye. See you soon.

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:21.570
<v Speaker 1>Like, I can we can talk a bit

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:23.330
<v Speaker 1>more about the other things in the DevSpace

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:24.770
<v Speaker 1>YAML that we haven't

00:31:26.424 --> 00:31:29.384
<v Speaker 1>looked at yet? Or if you have any

00:31:29.384 --> 00:31:31.544
<v Speaker 1>specific questions, we can cover them as well.

00:31:31.544 --> 00:31:33.544
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Okay. There's a few assumptions that wanna

00:31:33.544 --> 00:31:35.224
<v Speaker 0>get out of my head. So

00:31:35.625 --> 00:31:37.465
<v Speaker 0>firstly, this terminal we're in we're in a

00:31:37.465 --> 00:31:40.340
<v Speaker 0>thing. We saw this is running screen.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.100
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming I could just drop this, and

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.420
<v Speaker 0>I actually expect this web application still. Oh,

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:46.740
<v Speaker 0>no. It doesn't. Okay. That that ended. I

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:48.820
<v Speaker 0>thought that was gonna run-in the background. You

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:52.660
<v Speaker 1>stopped the process, though. Like, you stopped the

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.180
<v Speaker 1>web server, so that's why it's not here

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:56.105
<v Speaker 1>anymore. Oh, but I thought because I was

00:31:56.105 --> 00:31:57.464
<v Speaker 0>on a screen session.

00:32:00.345 --> 00:32:02.505
<v Speaker 1>I think the screen is for the I

00:32:02.505 --> 00:32:04.024
<v Speaker 1>I actually don't know. You know what? I

00:32:04.024 --> 00:32:04.345
<v Speaker 1>don't know.

00:32:08.059 --> 00:32:10.700
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Okay. Alright. We'll just we'll just not

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:11.580
<v Speaker 0>do that anymore.

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:13.820
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So when I leave the when I

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:15.740
<v Speaker 0>leave the container, it shuts all down. I

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:17.340
<v Speaker 0>can go have my coffee, come back after

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:19.259
<v Speaker 0>lunch, and start again. That's fine.

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:22.140
<v Speaker 0>And then we need to run the NPM

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:22.620
<v Speaker 0>star.

00:32:23.515 --> 00:32:25.835
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. We should be back in business. Okay.

00:32:25.835 --> 00:32:27.195
<v Speaker 0>Cool. Yeah.

00:32:28.875 --> 00:32:31.195
<v Speaker 1>And we could, for example, if you if

00:32:31.195 --> 00:32:32.235
<v Speaker 1>you didn't

00:32:32.235 --> 00:32:33.515
<v Speaker 1>ex replace

00:32:33.515 --> 00:32:34.955
<v Speaker 1>the dev

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:37.710
<v Speaker 1>image well, if you didn't replace the image

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:39.790
<v Speaker 1>and just use the the image that we

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:41.870
<v Speaker 1>have, then you wouldn't need to start to

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:43.710
<v Speaker 1>run NPM start even because then we would

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:46.429
<v Speaker 1>use the actual production image that we built,

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:48.750
<v Speaker 1>and that automatically starts NPM start.

00:32:49.325 --> 00:32:51.085
<v Speaker 1>But you can still, like, do the hot

00:32:51.085 --> 00:32:53.404
<v Speaker 1>reloading. That would still work. It's just that

00:32:53.405 --> 00:32:55.164
<v Speaker 1>because we're using a dev image,

00:32:55.405 --> 00:32:56.284
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,

00:32:56.925 --> 00:32:58.765
<v Speaker 1>yeah, it doesn't use the Docker image that

00:32:58.765 --> 00:32:59.644
<v Speaker 1>we looked at.

00:33:00.205 --> 00:33:02.445
<v Speaker 0>But you said if I run DevSpace deploy

00:33:02.445 --> 00:33:02.765
<v Speaker 0>then,

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.720
<v Speaker 0>that just deploy with Not quite. Not not

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.040
<v Speaker 1>quite because we still need to go to

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:11.040
<v Speaker 1>dev mode. So okay. If you open the

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.240
<v Speaker 1>DevSpace YAML

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:33:15.375 --> 00:33:17.375
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And then we could

00:33:18.335 --> 00:33:20.335
<v Speaker 1>remove the line 50 where we just commented

00:33:20.335 --> 00:33:20.975
<v Speaker 1>out.

00:33:21.455 --> 00:33:23.535
<v Speaker 1>So now we're not replacing the dev image

00:33:23.535 --> 00:33:25.775
<v Speaker 1>anymore. We're just using the production image. You

00:33:25.775 --> 00:33:27.295
<v Speaker 1>can run DevSpace dev,

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:33.640
<v Speaker 1>and then it would

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.800
<v Speaker 1>just open the browser. And we do we

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.800
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have to run NPM start because the

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:40.840
<v Speaker 1>entry point

00:33:42.515 --> 00:33:45.794
<v Speaker 1>okay. Interesting. The entry point would be NPM

00:33:45.794 --> 00:33:46.514
<v Speaker 1>start.

00:33:47.635 --> 00:33:48.835
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.

00:33:49.075 --> 00:33:49.955
<v Speaker 1>What happened?

00:33:50.835 --> 00:33:51.874
<v Speaker 0>Well, I

00:33:52.115 --> 00:33:54.355
<v Speaker 0>may have broken it by running a deploy

00:33:54.355 --> 00:33:55.075
<v Speaker 0>and killing it,

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:57.990
<v Speaker 0>and it made no oh, no. It's trying

00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:59.349
<v Speaker 0>to reach speed to red. Oh.

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:02.229
<v Speaker 1>Oh, okay. That interesting.

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:07.510
<v Speaker 1>I did not have that issue when I

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:09.830
<v Speaker 1>tried it, but, yeah, if you just use

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:10.389
<v Speaker 1>the

00:34:11.135 --> 00:34:12.895
<v Speaker 1>I guess you have to if you're doing

00:34:12.895 --> 00:34:15.135
<v Speaker 1>that, you have to probably change the image

00:34:15.135 --> 00:34:16.175
<v Speaker 1>name everywhere

00:34:16.734 --> 00:34:18.655
<v Speaker 1>because I think it's it's trying to build

00:34:18.655 --> 00:34:20.734
<v Speaker 1>the image in the images part. So if

00:34:20.734 --> 00:34:22.574
<v Speaker 1>you scroll up, there was this property called

00:34:22.574 --> 00:34:22.974
<v Speaker 1>image

00:34:24.599 --> 00:34:25.320
<v Speaker 1>and

00:34:25.799 --> 00:34:28.199
<v Speaker 1>or images. Yeah. And that that's where we

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:29.239
<v Speaker 1>built the image.

00:34:30.279 --> 00:34:30.920
<v Speaker 1>So

00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:34.040
<v Speaker 1>I guess we could just, yeah, remove the

00:34:34.359 --> 00:34:37.159
<v Speaker 1>host name and just call it DevSpace.

00:34:38.495 --> 00:34:40.895
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And then then change our dev image

00:34:40.975 --> 00:34:42.815
<v Speaker 1>It's or image selector.

00:34:43.775 --> 00:34:45.215
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I don't know if we have to

00:34:45.215 --> 00:34:47.295
<v Speaker 1>change it in the deployments part as well,

00:34:47.295 --> 00:34:48.655
<v Speaker 1>but I guess we'll find out.

00:34:50.335 --> 00:34:52.574
<v Speaker 1>Oh, no. And that's trying to interesting.

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Well, it's try it's still authenticating you with

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:58.400
<v Speaker 1>Docker Hub.

00:34:58.640 --> 00:34:59.760
<v Speaker 1>Got okay.

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.320
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no. It's trying to it's

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.200
<v Speaker 0>trying to pull that.

00:35:08.945 --> 00:35:11.985
<v Speaker 1>Don't quite understand why it's trying to push

00:35:12.545 --> 00:35:14.945
<v Speaker 1>your image, though, because we did say that

00:35:14.945 --> 00:35:15.985
<v Speaker 1>we wanna skip.

00:35:16.865 --> 00:35:19.105
<v Speaker 1>What we can do is we can add

00:35:19.105 --> 00:35:21.185
<v Speaker 1>a property called skip push

00:35:22.145 --> 00:35:23.105
<v Speaker 1>to the app,

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:24.950
<v Speaker 1>and that should

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:27.830
<v Speaker 1>definitely push skip the push.

00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Like, when we when we say that in

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:32.310
<v Speaker 1>the initialization

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:33.350
<v Speaker 1>period

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:35.750
<v Speaker 1>you know what? I actually, I don't I'm

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:36.710
<v Speaker 1>not quite sure about that.

00:35:37.775 --> 00:35:39.855
<v Speaker 1>I thought it would be saved

00:35:40.335 --> 00:35:41.215
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.

00:35:41.215 --> 00:35:43.135
<v Speaker 1>It probably is saved somewhere because we did

00:35:43.135 --> 00:35:45.055
<v Speaker 1>skip the push initially.

00:35:45.055 --> 00:35:46.895
<v Speaker 0>We did skip that way when we ran

00:35:46.895 --> 00:35:47.695
<v Speaker 0>the init.

00:35:48.095 --> 00:35:49.855
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And then it'll complete here, and there

00:35:49.855 --> 00:35:51.855
<v Speaker 0>is a skip push flag that wasn't set.

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:54.170
<v Speaker 0>So I've kinda maybe that will help. I

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:56.650
<v Speaker 0>don't know. I'm I'm Let's try. Let's try.

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:58.250
<v Speaker 1>No. Same.

00:35:58.250 --> 00:35:59.290
<v Speaker 1>Uh-huh. Okay.

00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Well alright. Yeah. It seems happier now. Okay.

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:03.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:36:04.635 --> 00:36:06.315
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if that works because we didn't

00:36:06.315 --> 00:36:08.635
<v Speaker 1>change the image name in deployment.

00:36:08.635 --> 00:36:09.195
<v Speaker 1>So

00:36:11.755 --> 00:36:13.915
<v Speaker 1>we will see. I'm learning as well.

00:36:14.555 --> 00:36:15.195
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:36:15.595 --> 00:36:17.675
<v Speaker 1>Probably need to change that in deployment as

00:36:17.675 --> 00:36:19.755
<v Speaker 1>well because that's it's still trying to deploy.

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.520
<v Speaker 1>So there's in line 48. Yeah. Exactly.

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Makes sense because we're telling the helm chart

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.440
<v Speaker 1>that we are like, it should use this

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:30.760
<v Speaker 1>image.

00:36:32.964 --> 00:36:35.445
<v Speaker 1>We're putting the values in there. So,

00:36:36.484 --> 00:36:37.125
<v Speaker 1>yeah,

00:36:37.285 --> 00:36:39.125
<v Speaker 1>deployment should show. I mean, this is just

00:36:39.125 --> 00:36:39.925
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes.

00:36:39.925 --> 00:36:41.205
<v Speaker 0>I could actually run

00:36:42.165 --> 00:36:44.085
<v Speaker 0>yeah. We can see that. Yeah.

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:46.660
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no error. Pulled image.

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Which image is it trying to load? I

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:55.460
<v Speaker 0>don't know. Maybe we should figure that out.

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:57.460
<v Speaker 0>It's because I'm using many cube.

00:37:00.315 --> 00:37:02.475
<v Speaker 0>I will need to source.

00:37:03.435 --> 00:37:04.635
<v Speaker 0>I don't ever had to do this. It's

00:37:04.635 --> 00:37:05.595
<v Speaker 0>been so long.

00:37:07.515 --> 00:37:10.395
<v Speaker 0>The docker end because I'm actually built we'll

00:37:10.395 --> 00:37:13.115
<v Speaker 0>be building this into

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:19.420
<v Speaker 0>computers are hard. Yeah. This this is very

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:21.980
<v Speaker 1>interesting because I I don't

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:24.780
<v Speaker 1>understand why we're running into this now when

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:25.980
<v Speaker 1>it worked before.

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:29.820
<v Speaker 1>I guess the the fact that we are

00:37:31.975 --> 00:37:35.175
<v Speaker 1>because I would have expected that we deploy

00:37:35.575 --> 00:37:38.215
<v Speaker 1>the regular like, the image that we built,

00:37:38.215 --> 00:37:39.495
<v Speaker 1>and then we

00:37:39.735 --> 00:37:42.135
<v Speaker 1>exchange the image with the dev image.

00:37:42.535 --> 00:37:43.975
<v Speaker 1>So we should have run into this problem

00:37:43.975 --> 00:37:44.375
<v Speaker 1>before,

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:47.339
<v Speaker 1>but I might be wrong. I'm obviously wrong

00:37:47.339 --> 00:37:49.339
<v Speaker 1>because it didn't happen as I would have

00:37:49.339 --> 00:37:50.220
<v Speaker 1>thought it would.

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:53.339
<v Speaker 1>Well, like, if you're still listening, you can

00:37:53.339 --> 00:37:53.980
<v Speaker 1>explain it. Right?

00:37:58.175 --> 00:37:59.775
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's it's not working.

00:38:00.975 --> 00:38:02.335
<v Speaker 0>What have I done wrong?

00:38:03.535 --> 00:38:04.495
<v Speaker 0>Control,

00:38:04.895 --> 00:38:05.295
<v Speaker 0>describe.

00:38:10.029 --> 00:38:11.309
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yes. So I was trying to pull

00:38:11.309 --> 00:38:12.430
<v Speaker 0>this image.

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:16.910
<v Speaker 1>Which it should.

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Can you check your images?

00:38:19.869 --> 00:38:20.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:38:22.724 --> 00:38:24.565
<v Speaker 1>I think this is the right one. It

00:38:24.565 --> 00:38:27.204
<v Speaker 1>should be I mean, we're building it correctly,

00:38:27.204 --> 00:38:28.085
<v Speaker 1>apparently.

00:38:30.085 --> 00:38:30.964
<v Speaker 1>Empty. Yeah.

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.200
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'm not sure.

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.120
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.520
<v Speaker 0>Is there a DevSpace delete

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.320
<v Speaker 0>everything?

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.280
<v Speaker 0>Can I will we

00:38:47.925 --> 00:38:50.245
<v Speaker 1>Yes? There's a DevSpace purge,

00:38:50.485 --> 00:38:51.445
<v Speaker 1>and that will

00:38:52.725 --> 00:38:55.045
<v Speaker 1>I don't I probably won't delete images from

00:38:55.045 --> 00:38:58.085
<v Speaker 1>your Docker registry, though, but we can Well,

00:38:58.085 --> 00:39:00.325
<v Speaker 0>it's just because we set the Docker the

00:39:00.325 --> 00:39:02.405
<v Speaker 0>Minikube Docker environment halfway through.

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:05.060
<v Speaker 0>So now that we have that Yeah.

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:08.500
<v Speaker 0>Although, it depends with DevSpace.

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:11.460
<v Speaker 0>Let's try. Okay. But we do build.

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:15.700
<v Speaker 0>It's all cached, which means I think this

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:16.900
<v Speaker 0>image is in the right place.

00:39:18.095 --> 00:39:19.135
<v Speaker 1>It should be.

00:39:19.615 --> 00:39:21.455
<v Speaker 0>Let's try DevSpace.

00:39:22.895 --> 00:39:24.655
<v Speaker 0>Dev Let's try DevSpace.

00:39:24.815 --> 00:39:25.775
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Okay.

00:39:27.615 --> 00:39:29.615
<v Speaker 1>I mean, as we could try DevSpace deploy

00:39:29.615 --> 00:39:31.454
<v Speaker 1>because the way that I understand it oh,

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:32.440
<v Speaker 1>okay.

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:33.320
<v Speaker 1>So

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.720
<v Speaker 1>you broke it. It wasn't me.

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:37.640
<v Speaker 0>Good.

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:39.800
<v Speaker 0>I think it was just because,

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.480
<v Speaker 0>yeah, the Minikube environment wasn't my local Docker

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:46.360
<v Speaker 0>environment, and I think DevSpace was working against

00:39:45.885 --> 00:39:48.445
<v Speaker 0>my Docker desktop and not my Medikube.

00:39:48.445 --> 00:39:51.085
<v Speaker 0>And yeah. It was a weird Ah, okay.

00:39:51.165 --> 00:39:52.605
<v Speaker 1>No. Yeah. That makes sense.

00:39:53.725 --> 00:39:55.885
<v Speaker 0>But that's what's saying we have something running.

00:39:55.885 --> 00:39:56.045
<v Speaker 0>So

00:39:57.005 --> 00:39:58.845
<v Speaker 1>We have, but it doesn't do what I

00:39:58.845 --> 00:40:00.365
<v Speaker 1>was hoping it would do, which is just

00:40:00.365 --> 00:40:02.810
<v Speaker 1>start your browser immediately.

00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh, DevSpace start not found.

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:08.410
<v Speaker 1>What

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:09.210
<v Speaker 1>did you do?

00:40:13.155 --> 00:40:15.155
<v Speaker 0>Is is it because we're not using the

00:40:15.155 --> 00:40:17.395
<v Speaker 0>dev image anymore? So, like, this stuff isn't

00:40:17.555 --> 00:40:17.955
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:40:19.795 --> 00:40:22.115
<v Speaker 1>No. I well, because we're syncing it, so

00:40:22.115 --> 00:40:23.155
<v Speaker 1>we should be, like,

00:40:23.555 --> 00:40:25.235
<v Speaker 1>syncing everything over.

00:40:25.875 --> 00:40:27.475
<v Speaker 1>Like, literally, I tested this yesterday.

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:31.010
<v Speaker 1>Wait a sec. Oh, yeah. Look. Waiting for

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:33.730
<v Speaker 0>initial sync to complete, sync work, and then

00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:37.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So that includes the DevSpace start. Did

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:39.170
<v Speaker 1>you rename it or something?

00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:41.410
<v Speaker 0>I don't think so.

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:43.250
<v Speaker 1>No. It's there.

00:40:44.975 --> 00:40:45.695
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:40:46.255 --> 00:40:48.815
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Bunch of stuff in this file.

00:40:49.535 --> 00:40:51.215
<v Speaker 1>We did, but not

00:40:54.495 --> 00:40:55.215
<v Speaker 1>yeah.

00:40:55.615 --> 00:40:56.735
<v Speaker 1>Because okay.

00:40:57.135 --> 00:40:59.135
<v Speaker 1>So we're we're saying open a terminal and

00:40:59.135 --> 00:41:01.140
<v Speaker 1>use the following command to start it.

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:05.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't think our I'm not quite sure

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:08.579
<v Speaker 1>whether our DevSpace containers have the DevSpace start

00:41:08.579 --> 00:41:10.660
<v Speaker 1>as agent. Shouldn't

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:11.540
<v Speaker 1>in theory.

00:41:13.625 --> 00:41:15.865
<v Speaker 0>Well, I'll take it. That's probably something I've

00:41:15.865 --> 00:41:16.345
<v Speaker 0>done.

00:41:17.865 --> 00:41:20.105
<v Speaker 1>Thank you. It's not it's clearly not that

00:41:20.105 --> 00:41:23.065
<v Speaker 1>our quick start don't work properly. Alright. Let's

00:41:24.025 --> 00:41:26.265
<v Speaker 1>okay. Just to make sure that we we're

00:41:26.265 --> 00:41:26.825
<v Speaker 1>back, can you

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:30.240
<v Speaker 1>reintroduce the dev image languages? I just wanna

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.200
<v Speaker 1>make sure that

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.160
<v Speaker 1>we didn't change it to the degree that

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.520
<v Speaker 1>nothing works anymore.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise, we have to reset everything, I think.

00:41:44.655 --> 00:41:46.494
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It seems okay. But Okay. That that

00:41:46.494 --> 00:41:47.855
<v Speaker 1>looks like yeah.

00:41:49.295 --> 00:41:50.895
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So if you run-in

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:57.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm wondering if maybe you we what we

00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:59.070
<v Speaker 1>should what we would need to do is

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:00.670
<v Speaker 1>really not open the terminal.

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:02.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like the,

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:04.190
<v Speaker 1>yeah, the terminal is kind of tied to

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:05.630
<v Speaker 1>the dev image, but then

00:42:07.395 --> 00:42:09.875
<v Speaker 1>we could take a look at the documentation.

00:42:12.195 --> 00:42:13.475
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Well,

00:42:15.715 --> 00:42:18.435
<v Speaker 0>I think we can

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:19.410
<v Speaker 0>go back to the docs and and work

00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:21.650
<v Speaker 0>through that. But I just while we're here,

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:22.210
<v Speaker 0>right,

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:24.930
<v Speaker 0>and then DevSpace thing,

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:27.010
<v Speaker 0>something caught my eye, which was these commands

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:28.930
<v Speaker 0>here. Like, I mentioned migration to earlier, not

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:31.250
<v Speaker 0>knowing. This was set set in the DevSpace.YAML.

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:33.385
<v Speaker 0>So it looks like there's already the ability

00:42:33.385 --> 00:42:34.105
<v Speaker 0>to run

00:42:35.145 --> 00:42:36.744
<v Speaker 0>arbitrary command. So

00:42:37.224 --> 00:42:39.464
<v Speaker 0>Yes. Is that just DevSpace

00:42:39.464 --> 00:42:40.345
<v Speaker 0>run?

00:42:40.345 --> 00:42:43.704
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Run. Yeah. Exactly. So you could run

00:42:43.704 --> 00:42:44.904
<v Speaker 1>any kinds of

00:42:45.549 --> 00:42:47.549
<v Speaker 1>commands, anything that you need to do to,

00:42:47.549 --> 00:42:49.630
<v Speaker 1>you know, set up your development environment in

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:51.549
<v Speaker 1>the way that you need it and then

00:42:51.549 --> 00:42:53.150
<v Speaker 1>do a DevSpace run.

00:42:53.869 --> 00:42:54.430
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.

00:42:55.069 --> 00:42:56.990
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, it could be anything

00:42:58.115 --> 00:43:00.035
<v Speaker 1>that you would so this is why we

00:43:00.035 --> 00:43:01.715
<v Speaker 1>kind of replace Makefiles

00:43:01.795 --> 00:43:02.515
<v Speaker 1>or,

00:43:02.595 --> 00:43:04.915
<v Speaker 1>you know, like, sup supply Makefiles if you

00:43:04.915 --> 00:43:06.434
<v Speaker 1>want to. If you love your Makefiles, like,

00:43:06.434 --> 00:43:08.035
<v Speaker 1>you can still, like, do both.

00:43:09.875 --> 00:43:11.315
<v Speaker 1>If you go to back to the DevSpace

00:43:11.315 --> 00:43:13.250
<v Speaker 1>YAML, I think this is not a a

00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:17.010
<v Speaker 1>good place to talk about the pipelines.

00:43:17.089 --> 00:43:18.610
<v Speaker 1>So we scroll all the way up.

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:20.609
<v Speaker 1>So we have these pipelines,

00:43:20.609 --> 00:43:21.570
<v Speaker 1>and this is,

00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:25.170
<v Speaker 1>like, something that we changed in in the

00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:27.650
<v Speaker 1>latest release. So we released DevSpace six, like,

00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:28.450
<v Speaker 1>a couple of weeks ago.

00:43:29.065 --> 00:43:31.465
<v Speaker 1>So we now have these pipelines that you

00:43:31.465 --> 00:43:32.585
<v Speaker 1>can completely

00:43:33.625 --> 00:43:35.625
<v Speaker 1>modify the way that you want to. There

00:43:35.625 --> 00:43:37.865
<v Speaker 1>is a default behavior for the pipelines.

00:43:38.665 --> 00:43:40.185
<v Speaker 1>I think it's

00:43:40.585 --> 00:43:41.705
<v Speaker 1>it's it's

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:44.010
<v Speaker 1>in-depth explained in the docs, but then you

00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:46.490
<v Speaker 1>can, like, run the default behavior by just,

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:48.330
<v Speaker 1>like, run default pipeline or something.

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:49.770
<v Speaker 1>But, basically,

00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:52.250
<v Speaker 1>here, when you run DevSpace dev,

00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:54.970
<v Speaker 1>which is a short form for DevSpace run

00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:55.850
<v Speaker 1>pipeline dev,

00:43:56.484 --> 00:43:58.325
<v Speaker 1>this is what will happen. So you will

00:43:58.325 --> 00:44:00.165
<v Speaker 1>run all the dependencies of which we have

00:44:00.165 --> 00:44:01.205
<v Speaker 1>none currently.

00:44:01.925 --> 00:44:02.805
<v Speaker 1>You will

00:44:03.525 --> 00:44:05.204
<v Speaker 1>create the deployments.

00:44:05.204 --> 00:44:07.525
<v Speaker 1>So then that would be the the deployments

00:44:07.525 --> 00:44:09.630
<v Speaker 1>part that starts in '9 '20 '8, and

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:11.950
<v Speaker 1>then you start the dev mode for one

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:12.750
<v Speaker 1>or more

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:18.029
<v Speaker 1>units. So we we named everything app here.

00:44:18.029 --> 00:44:20.430
<v Speaker 1>You could give them different names. You could,

00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:22.430
<v Speaker 1>like, say, like, all of them, or you

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:24.835
<v Speaker 1>could just, like, have a couple. So we

00:44:24.835 --> 00:44:27.475
<v Speaker 1>could, like, have start dev app DB or

00:44:27.475 --> 00:44:28.595
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want.

00:44:29.075 --> 00:44:29.635
<v Speaker 1>And,

00:44:30.115 --> 00:44:32.115
<v Speaker 1>yeah, so similarly, in deployments, we run all

00:44:32.115 --> 00:44:34.115
<v Speaker 1>the dependencies. We build other images,

00:44:34.755 --> 00:44:36.515
<v Speaker 1>and we create the deployments.

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh, see. So in DevSpace dev, we don't

00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:40.790
<v Speaker 1>build the images.

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:43.830
<v Speaker 1>So if I had read this earlier. This

00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:45.590
<v Speaker 1>is why we didn't run into this issue

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:47.750
<v Speaker 1>earlier because we don't build the images because

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:50.225
<v Speaker 1>we're just, like, using the dev image. Got

00:44:50.225 --> 00:44:51.345
<v Speaker 0>it. Okay.

00:44:52.465 --> 00:44:54.625
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, you could change whatever you need

00:44:54.625 --> 00:44:56.785
<v Speaker 1>here. You could add add commands. Right? Like,

00:44:56.785 --> 00:44:59.265
<v Speaker 1>here, we could you could, like, add the

00:44:59.665 --> 00:45:02.865
<v Speaker 1>migrate DB command into the dev pipeline or

00:45:02.865 --> 00:45:03.905
<v Speaker 1>the pipeline.

00:45:04.225 --> 00:45:05.105
<v Speaker 1>And then this way,

00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:08.540
<v Speaker 1>if you are someone who's, like, completely new,

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:10.780
<v Speaker 1>just being onboarded to the team, all you

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:12.220
<v Speaker 1>need to know know is that you have

00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:13.820
<v Speaker 1>to run DevSpace dev, and you don't need

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:15.020
<v Speaker 1>to know, like, oh, you have to run

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:16.460
<v Speaker 1>this script and then that, but only in

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:18.860
<v Speaker 1>these circumstances and all of that. That's kind

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:20.220
<v Speaker 1>of the thing that we're trying to do

00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:20.620
<v Speaker 1>here

00:45:21.425 --> 00:45:23.425
<v Speaker 1>to just give you, like, one command, and

00:45:23.425 --> 00:45:25.025
<v Speaker 1>then your development environment

00:45:25.345 --> 00:45:26.305
<v Speaker 1>is just

00:45:26.545 --> 00:45:28.065
<v Speaker 1>all shiny and perfect,

00:45:29.825 --> 00:45:32.305
<v Speaker 1>which we've seen that that works perfectly.

00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:36.750
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Alright. No. I understand pipelines. I hadn't

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:38.910
<v Speaker 0>really worked that out from the start when

00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:40.590
<v Speaker 0>we're looking at this. The dev and deploy

00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:42.990
<v Speaker 0>were just pipelines. I mean, I'm assuming

00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:44.910
<v Speaker 0>and I, you know, I like to make

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:46.830
<v Speaker 0>assumptions. But if I copied Yeah.

00:45:50.045 --> 00:45:53.085
<v Speaker 0>Let's say performance test or some or performance.

00:45:53.244 --> 00:45:56.765
<v Speaker 1>Mhmm. I could just run that, like, with

00:45:57.085 --> 00:45:57.964
<v Speaker 0>DevSpace.

00:45:57.964 --> 00:45:59.484
<v Speaker 0>What was it? Pipeline

00:45:59.644 --> 00:46:00.444
<v Speaker 0>run

00:46:00.444 --> 00:46:01.244
<v Speaker 0>performance.

00:46:01.244 --> 00:46:02.365
<v Speaker 0>And this is actually Run

00:46:02.765 --> 00:46:03.565
<v Speaker 1>dash pipeline.

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:05.510
<v Speaker 1>It's DevSpace.

00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:09.990
<v Speaker 1>Run dash.

00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:13.510
<v Speaker 1>That's one one command one dash pipeline. Yep.

00:46:17.525 --> 00:46:19.605
<v Speaker 0>Oh, nice. Okay. Cool.

00:46:19.765 --> 00:46:20.725
<v Speaker 0>I like that.

00:46:21.605 --> 00:46:23.445
<v Speaker 0>So I can start to build off and

00:46:23.445 --> 00:46:25.365
<v Speaker 0>build off all the pipelines from my application.

00:46:25.365 --> 00:46:27.365
<v Speaker 0>Because it might be that, you know, developers

00:46:27.365 --> 00:46:29.125
<v Speaker 0>just want a short feedback loop when they're

00:46:29.125 --> 00:46:32.470
<v Speaker 0>making changes to HTML, CSS, maybe some code.

00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:34.230
<v Speaker 0>But, you know, QA engineers may want to

00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:37.430
<v Speaker 0>actually run automated browser test against the and,

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:40.230
<v Speaker 0>like, you know, maybe there's other people, machine

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:42.470
<v Speaker 0>learning people that wanna start important data. I

00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:43.830
<v Speaker 0>don't know. Like, the I'm sure there's lots

00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:45.750
<v Speaker 0>of pipelines in a modern application these days.

00:46:46.935 --> 00:46:48.935
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Exactly. And as it gives you the

00:46:48.935 --> 00:46:50.295
<v Speaker 1>freedom to just, like,

00:46:52.455 --> 00:46:55.095
<v Speaker 1>use the bits that you want to use,

00:46:55.095 --> 00:46:57.175
<v Speaker 1>and there's also the cool feature, which is

00:46:57.175 --> 00:46:59.975
<v Speaker 1>you can import other DevSpace YAMLs into your

00:46:59.975 --> 00:47:02.535
<v Speaker 1>DevSpace YAML. It's not showcased in this one,

00:47:02.535 --> 00:47:02.695
<v Speaker 1>but,

00:47:03.549 --> 00:47:06.030
<v Speaker 1>conceivably, you could have, like, a shared DevSpace

00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:08.670
<v Speaker 1>library with these custom commands and pipelines.

00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:12.430
<v Speaker 1>And then, you know, I wanna import that

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:13.869
<v Speaker 1>so I can just, like,

00:47:14.349 --> 00:47:16.910
<v Speaker 1>use it without having to necessarily know

00:47:17.069 --> 00:47:17.630
<v Speaker 1>exactly.

00:47:20.035 --> 00:47:23.395
<v Speaker 1>So I could, like, define these custom functions,

00:47:23.395 --> 00:47:26.195
<v Speaker 1>custom pipelines, custom commands, and you can import

00:47:26.195 --> 00:47:26.755
<v Speaker 1>them

00:47:27.315 --> 00:47:27.875
<v Speaker 1>and

00:47:28.355 --> 00:47:28.915
<v Speaker 1>use them,

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:32.410
<v Speaker 1>but you can also override them. So if

00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:34.890
<v Speaker 1>you have, like, some kind of testing setup

00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:38.250
<v Speaker 1>and there's some functions I wanna use, but

00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:40.010
<v Speaker 1>others I wanna just, like, do differently on

00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:41.610
<v Speaker 1>my machine or in my project, then I

00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:43.370
<v Speaker 1>can just override individual

00:47:44.090 --> 00:47:47.135
<v Speaker 1>functions or pipelines or commands. That's super cool

00:47:47.135 --> 00:47:49.375
<v Speaker 1>because you can, like, build this library of,

00:47:49.375 --> 00:47:50.495
<v Speaker 1>like, shared stuff.

00:47:50.815 --> 00:47:52.335
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It makes a lot of sense. Like,

00:47:52.335 --> 00:47:54.815
<v Speaker 0>you know, most dev shops that I speak

00:47:54.815 --> 00:47:55.615
<v Speaker 0>to, you know,

00:47:56.335 --> 00:47:56.815
<v Speaker 0>we

00:47:57.135 --> 00:47:59.810
<v Speaker 0>we think we're in this world of polyglotism

00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:01.410
<v Speaker 0>where we are writing a Rust and Go

00:48:01.410 --> 00:48:03.730
<v Speaker 0>and Pony and C and all our app.

00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:05.410
<v Speaker 0>Like, we've got 50 different languages and 50

00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:07.810
<v Speaker 0>different services. But, really, most shops Yeah. Have

00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:09.810
<v Speaker 0>one or two languages that they really invest

00:48:09.810 --> 00:48:11.570
<v Speaker 0>in and builds up the knowledge within their

00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:13.625
<v Speaker 0>organization and within their team. And I can

00:48:13.625 --> 00:48:15.545
<v Speaker 0>see where you would want to have a

00:48:15.545 --> 00:48:17.625
<v Speaker 0>consolidation of all your DevSpace

00:48:17.704 --> 00:48:20.745
<v Speaker 0>pipelines and configuration and a central location so

00:48:20.984 --> 00:48:22.665
<v Speaker 0>that when you update that once,

00:48:22.984 --> 00:48:25.065
<v Speaker 0>every team can take advantage of that right

00:48:25.065 --> 00:48:27.330
<v Speaker 0>away with the import statement. I think that's

00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:28.930
<v Speaker 0>a really clever move. Like, that's that's a

00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:29.650
<v Speaker 0>nice feature.

00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:32.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's also new in DevSpace six. And,

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:34.050
<v Speaker 1>really, the the goal is really that you

00:48:34.050 --> 00:48:36.610
<v Speaker 1>just you can just focus on your development.

00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:37.810
<v Speaker 1>Like, you should not be

00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:40.915
<v Speaker 1>bogged down in, oh. Like, all this knowledge

00:48:40.915 --> 00:48:42.355
<v Speaker 1>that you have to have, especially when you

00:48:42.355 --> 00:48:43.954
<v Speaker 1>start in a new place or you switch

00:48:43.954 --> 00:48:44.994
<v Speaker 1>teams or whatever,

00:48:45.234 --> 00:48:47.315
<v Speaker 1>you have to know all these, like, secret

00:48:47.315 --> 00:48:50.115
<v Speaker 1>knowledge things about, like, this this is here,

00:48:50.115 --> 00:48:51.555
<v Speaker 1>but you have to, like, press this button

00:48:51.555 --> 00:48:53.234
<v Speaker 1>first, and then you can, like, do that.

00:48:53.234 --> 00:48:53.715
<v Speaker 1>So,

00:48:54.515 --> 00:48:56.770
<v Speaker 1>yep, all this is trying to kinda cut

00:48:56.770 --> 00:48:58.690
<v Speaker 1>down on that. Do you see a future

00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:01.329
<v Speaker 0>where, you know, there's a DevSpace hub and

00:49:01.329 --> 00:49:02.770
<v Speaker 0>you have these preconfigured

00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:05.089
<v Speaker 0>DevSpaces for Go? Because I'm assuming they don't

00:49:05.089 --> 00:49:07.650
<v Speaker 0>differ lightly. And for Rust and for PHP

00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:08.930
<v Speaker 0>and for JavaScript

00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:11.415
<v Speaker 0>and Java, or do you think this is

00:49:11.415 --> 00:49:13.655
<v Speaker 0>very much Yeah. Mean organizations to

00:49:15.015 --> 00:49:15.895
<v Speaker 1>I

00:49:15.975 --> 00:49:16.535
<v Speaker 1>would

00:49:16.855 --> 00:49:18.455
<v Speaker 1>like to see that. I mean, DevSpace is

00:49:18.455 --> 00:49:21.015
<v Speaker 1>an open source project, so any way that

00:49:21.015 --> 00:49:23.575
<v Speaker 1>the community can contribute and help each other

00:49:23.575 --> 00:49:25.450
<v Speaker 1>out and make things better, share their best

00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:27.690
<v Speaker 1>practices. I think that's a good thing. I

00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:29.450
<v Speaker 1>know there was once an attempt to do,

00:49:29.450 --> 00:49:31.530
<v Speaker 1>like, something like DevSpace Cloud. I think that

00:49:31.530 --> 00:49:32.970
<v Speaker 1>was a that was the

00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:35.050
<v Speaker 1>attempt to do a share like,

00:49:35.850 --> 00:49:37.290
<v Speaker 1>a service offering, though.

00:49:39.385 --> 00:49:41.545
<v Speaker 1>Right now, most of our

00:49:42.345 --> 00:49:44.825
<v Speaker 1>customers, as I understand it, for them, it's

00:49:44.825 --> 00:49:47.224
<v Speaker 1>more like building up the internal platform,

00:49:47.224 --> 00:49:49.545
<v Speaker 1>if you will. So their focus is not

00:49:49.545 --> 00:49:52.720
<v Speaker 1>necessarily on, like, open sourcing, whatever stuff they

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:54.560
<v Speaker 1>got going. And I guess, like,

00:49:55.599 --> 00:49:58.079
<v Speaker 1>in probably the overwhelming amount of cases, it

00:49:58.079 --> 00:50:01.279
<v Speaker 1>really is, like, very organizational specific stuff that

00:50:01.279 --> 00:50:02.640
<v Speaker 1>that you're, like,

00:50:03.119 --> 00:50:03.759
<v Speaker 1>to put in there.

00:50:04.464 --> 00:50:06.305
<v Speaker 1>I could see it. I don't think that's

00:50:06.305 --> 00:50:08.705
<v Speaker 1>where our current focus is right now,

00:50:09.184 --> 00:50:11.665
<v Speaker 1>but it would be cool. Okay. I mean,

00:50:11.665 --> 00:50:13.585
<v Speaker 1>nothing's stopping you from just creating a a

00:50:13.585 --> 00:50:14.385
<v Speaker 1>repository

00:50:14.385 --> 00:50:16.305
<v Speaker 1>and making it public because as you can

00:50:16.305 --> 00:50:19.200
<v Speaker 1>see, you can import a public Git, like,

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:20.320
<v Speaker 1>any repository,

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.400
<v Speaker 1>really. So you could just do it, put

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:24.480
<v Speaker 1>it, you know, on GitHub, and then everyone

00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:26.800
<v Speaker 1>could pull it from from there. Yeah. That

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:27.520
<v Speaker 0>makes sense.

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:30.080
<v Speaker 0>Alright. There's two things on my head that

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:32.080
<v Speaker 0>I've been kinda holding on to while we

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:34.305
<v Speaker 0>kind of explore a little bit. So I

00:50:34.305 --> 00:50:35.585
<v Speaker 0>I wonder if you could touch on both

00:50:35.585 --> 00:50:37.185
<v Speaker 0>of those. One of them was well, one

00:50:37.185 --> 00:50:38.224
<v Speaker 0>of them is right in front of me.

00:50:38.224 --> 00:50:40.145
<v Speaker 0>Like, so I see some sort of IDE

00:50:40.145 --> 00:50:41.665
<v Speaker 0>integration. So I'll come back to that in

00:50:41.665 --> 00:50:44.065
<v Speaker 0>a second. Yes. The other thing I saw

00:50:44.065 --> 00:50:46.145
<v Speaker 0>was when we ran DevSpace,

00:50:46.145 --> 00:50:47.345
<v Speaker 0>there was a UI

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:48.880
<v Speaker 0>command.

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.640
<v Speaker 0>Is this gonna give me a Yeah. Like,

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:51.840
<v Speaker 0>a shiny interface? Or

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:55.760
<v Speaker 1>It's an interface. I'm not sure how shiny

00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:58.160
<v Speaker 1>it is. I mean, that that's, like, subjective,

00:50:58.160 --> 00:50:58.960
<v Speaker 1>I would say.

00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:01.920
<v Speaker 1>It oh, it's there. Yeah.

00:51:02.925 --> 00:51:04.685
<v Speaker 0>I could change my Again, is the idea

00:51:04.685 --> 00:51:06.525
<v Speaker 1>that maybe people just don't feel super comfortable

00:51:06.525 --> 00:51:08.445
<v Speaker 1>working on the CLI, so you could, like

00:51:09.085 --> 00:51:10.845
<v Speaker 1>so this is for, like, checking the logs

00:51:10.845 --> 00:51:13.725
<v Speaker 1>of your containers and, like, not managing your

00:51:13.725 --> 00:51:15.645
<v Speaker 1>containers, but being able to debug them and,

00:51:15.645 --> 00:51:16.765
<v Speaker 1>like, try things out in them.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Like, my honest personal opinion is that it

00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.720
<v Speaker 1>could do more. Right now, it's just kind

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:23.440
<v Speaker 1>of like

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:26.480
<v Speaker 1>yeah. Just like a yeah. A little bit

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:28.560
<v Speaker 1>shinier version of what you could also get

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:29.360
<v Speaker 1>from the CLI.

00:51:30.635 --> 00:51:31.995
<v Speaker 1>I think it could it

00:51:32.395 --> 00:51:34.315
<v Speaker 1>could be much better. Right? I think there's,

00:51:34.315 --> 00:51:34.875
<v Speaker 1>like like

00:51:35.355 --> 00:51:36.795
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned before, and I would like

00:51:36.795 --> 00:51:38.315
<v Speaker 1>to look at that maybe at some

00:51:38.715 --> 00:51:40.555
<v Speaker 1>point later as well as, like, you can

00:51:40.555 --> 00:51:42.315
<v Speaker 1>have the you can define dependencies.

00:51:42.849 --> 00:51:44.690
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a

00:51:45.010 --> 00:51:47.569
<v Speaker 1>an application that depends on, like, a microservice

00:51:47.569 --> 00:51:49.730
<v Speaker 1>that depends on other microservices, you can define

00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:51.890
<v Speaker 1>that. And I would really like to see,

00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:54.210
<v Speaker 1>like, a dependency tree, a visual one.

00:51:54.450 --> 00:51:55.730
<v Speaker 1>Right? I think that would be a super

00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:57.490
<v Speaker 1>cool feature. Again, Oleg, if you're listening, please

00:51:57.490 --> 00:51:58.609
<v Speaker 1>put that in the feature

00:51:59.145 --> 00:51:59.945
<v Speaker 1>backlog.

00:52:00.265 --> 00:52:01.785
<v Speaker 1>Because I think that is something that I've

00:52:01.785 --> 00:52:04.185
<v Speaker 1>heard from a lot of people while when

00:52:04.185 --> 00:52:05.865
<v Speaker 1>I was, like, you know, I was a

00:52:05.865 --> 00:52:08.105
<v Speaker 1>consultant for a long time where people were

00:52:08.105 --> 00:52:10.425
<v Speaker 1>just like, I don't I just wanna know

00:52:10.425 --> 00:52:12.905
<v Speaker 1>what my applications depend on and which,

00:52:13.650 --> 00:52:16.290
<v Speaker 1>like, what what the actual, like, tree is.

00:52:17.329 --> 00:52:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I think that would be cool. But

00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:20.609
<v Speaker 1>right now, it's just, like, looking at logs,

00:52:20.609 --> 00:52:21.970
<v Speaker 1>looking at stacks.

00:52:23.569 --> 00:52:25.010
<v Speaker 0>K. Cool. Yeah. I guess you can run

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:27.335
<v Speaker 1>commands from there as well. Alright.

00:52:27.335 --> 00:52:29.655
<v Speaker 0>Well And the other thing I've seen then

00:52:29.655 --> 00:52:33.335
<v Speaker 0>was the Versus Code integration. I'm curious what

00:52:33.335 --> 00:52:34.695
<v Speaker 0>what this adds.

00:52:35.655 --> 00:52:38.694
<v Speaker 1>You this is super cool. So I highly

00:52:38.694 --> 00:52:41.335
<v Speaker 1>recommend to check out the example project.

00:52:42.250 --> 00:52:44.250
<v Speaker 1>And what it will do is it will

00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:45.930
<v Speaker 1>open that SSH server,

00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:49.290
<v Speaker 1>and then it will open your Versus Code

00:52:49.290 --> 00:52:50.490
<v Speaker 1>if you have remote

00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:51.850
<v Speaker 1>like,

00:52:52.650 --> 00:52:54.810
<v Speaker 1>this this remote SSH extension.

00:52:54.810 --> 00:52:56.855
<v Speaker 1>If you have that installed, it will then

00:52:56.855 --> 00:53:00.135
<v Speaker 1>open Versus Code, which is directly connected to

00:53:00.135 --> 00:53:01.095
<v Speaker 1>the container,

00:53:01.255 --> 00:53:03.175
<v Speaker 1>and that is really awesome.

00:53:05.015 --> 00:53:05.735
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:53:06.934 --> 00:53:08.454
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I'm just gonna go with default

00:53:08.454 --> 00:53:09.015
<v Speaker 0>namespace.

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:11.700
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Yes. I'm sure.

00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:20.020
<v Speaker 0>Oh, let's see.

00:53:25.155 --> 00:53:26.675
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That's just a bit of a walk

00:53:26.675 --> 00:53:29.714
<v Speaker 1>through for you to see what's happening. Ah,

00:53:29.714 --> 00:53:30.355
<v Speaker 0>okay.

00:53:30.915 --> 00:53:32.595
<v Speaker 0>So we're just waiting for the containers to

00:53:32.595 --> 00:53:34.755
<v Speaker 0>come up right now. We're just just waiting

00:53:34.755 --> 00:53:35.555
<v Speaker 1>for the yeah.

00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:39.580
<v Speaker 0>So that's just gonna spin up a Versus

00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:40.620
<v Speaker 0>code for me.

00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:43.500
<v Speaker 0>Or just a Versus code with remote.

00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:45.740
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Okay. Yeah. As long as you oh,

00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:47.020
<v Speaker 1>as long as you have the Versus code

00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:49.420
<v Speaker 1>CLI because it's starting it from the shell.

00:53:50.305 --> 00:53:51.825
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not sure if you have that,

00:53:51.825 --> 00:53:55.105
<v Speaker 1>though. Yeah. But it's it's failing. It says

00:53:55.505 --> 00:53:57.825
<v Speaker 0>I can't drag it on. Okay. Now yeah.

00:54:01.105 --> 00:54:02.865
<v Speaker 1>Can't read it. What does it say?

00:54:08.050 --> 00:54:09.410
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no. It's not over here.

00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:15.970
<v Speaker 1>I I couldn't read the error message. What

00:54:15.970 --> 00:54:16.450
<v Speaker 1>did it say?

00:54:19.175 --> 00:54:21.175
<v Speaker 0>It said it couldn't connect to the remote,

00:54:21.175 --> 00:54:22.375
<v Speaker 0>but I don't know why.

00:54:22.615 --> 00:54:23.335
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:54:25.575 --> 00:54:27.734
<v Speaker 1>Are you willing to share what's in your

00:54:27.734 --> 00:54:30.295
<v Speaker 1>EDC host? Because I think I had a

00:54:30.695 --> 00:54:31.975
<v Speaker 1>problem earlier.

00:54:32.695 --> 00:54:33.015
<v Speaker 1>And,

00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:36.790
<v Speaker 1>like, an older version of DevSpace,

00:54:36.790 --> 00:54:39.110
<v Speaker 1>the we did some stuff there, and then

00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:41.670
<v Speaker 1>you had to remove that so it works

00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:42.310
<v Speaker 1>now.

00:54:42.550 --> 00:54:44.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm just looking for the

00:54:46.310 --> 00:54:48.230
<v Speaker 1>for the Slack exchange where I got had

00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:49.190
<v Speaker 1>that explained

00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.589
<v Speaker 1>to me.

00:54:51.755 --> 00:54:52.475
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:54:57.195 --> 00:54:59.435
<v Speaker 1>So because in your e oh, no. In

00:54:59.435 --> 00:55:01.435
<v Speaker 1>the SSH config, it wasn't in the e

00:55:01.435 --> 00:55:03.595
<v Speaker 1>t c host. Sorry. There should be, like,

00:55:03.595 --> 00:55:05.195
<v Speaker 1>an entry for this

00:55:06.099 --> 00:55:07.380
<v Speaker 1>quick start stuff.

00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:08.100
<v Speaker 0>Ah.

00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:13.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:16.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So there's

00:55:18.285 --> 00:55:19.965
<v Speaker 1>my app DevSpace.

00:55:20.045 --> 00:55:20.525
<v Speaker 1>And,

00:55:21.085 --> 00:55:22.125
<v Speaker 1>actually, that

00:55:22.605 --> 00:55:23.325
<v Speaker 1>looks

00:55:23.484 --> 00:55:25.724
<v Speaker 1>right because what we should

00:55:25.724 --> 00:55:27.565
<v Speaker 1>want to see is

00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:36.260
<v Speaker 1>So the quick start,

00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:37.220
<v Speaker 1>that's

00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:39.940
<v Speaker 1>right. I don't know if, like, my app

00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:41.220
<v Speaker 1>is that the

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:43.780
<v Speaker 1>okay.

00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:45.220
<v Speaker 1>Do you still get that error, by the

00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:46.740
<v Speaker 1>way? I'm I'm assuming you have that on

00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:47.140
<v Speaker 1>another.

00:55:48.965 --> 00:55:51.205
<v Speaker 0>I I removed the old one. Let's try

00:55:51.205 --> 00:55:51.765
<v Speaker 0>again.

00:55:52.005 --> 00:55:52.725
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:56:00.165 --> 00:56:02.245
<v Speaker 1>And this is some great user research right

00:56:02.245 --> 00:56:02.405
<v Speaker 1>now.

00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:06.520
<v Speaker 0>Could not establish connection to my app dot

00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:07.560
<v Speaker 0>DevSpace.

00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:10.119
<v Speaker 1>Can you try to just SSH to my

00:56:10.119 --> 00:56:11.320
<v Speaker 1>app dot DevSpace

00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:12.440
<v Speaker 1>without the,

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.400
<v Speaker 1>you know, Versus code? Yeah. That doesn't work

00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:16.120
<v Speaker 0>either.

00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:20.585
<v Speaker 1>Oh. Bad configuration option DevSpace.

00:56:21.705 --> 00:56:22.505
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.

00:56:24.825 --> 00:56:26.265
<v Speaker 0>I guess, like, comment.

00:56:27.225 --> 00:56:28.345
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no. It's not running.

00:56:32.349 --> 00:56:33.790
<v Speaker 1>Wait. But this is not even the right

00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:34.510
<v Speaker 1>port.

00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:39.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh, we have ten

00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:40.910
<v Speaker 1>six three seven.

00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:43.310
<v Speaker 1>I think the other one is probably oh,

00:56:43.310 --> 00:56:44.990
<v Speaker 1>can we just remove the other one here,

00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:46.350
<v Speaker 1>the the one above?

00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:47.310
<v Speaker 0>The one above.

00:56:48.995 --> 00:56:49.635
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

00:56:55.155 --> 00:56:56.995
<v Speaker 0>I think that's like a magic comment, isn't

00:56:56.995 --> 00:56:58.515
<v Speaker 0>it? I'm gonna leave that.

00:56:58.755 --> 00:57:00.675
<v Speaker 0>I think it's being used to parse and

00:57:00.675 --> 00:57:02.435
<v Speaker 0>add stuff to that fail. So I've probably

00:57:02.435 --> 00:57:04.530
<v Speaker 0>been breaking this demo because of that.

00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:08.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Let let's just again say that this

00:57:08.610 --> 00:57:11.250
<v Speaker 1>is something you broke and clearly not

00:57:11.890 --> 00:57:14.370
<v Speaker 1>some weird behavior that we haven't anticipated.

00:57:18.675 --> 00:57:20.115
<v Speaker 0>No. It failed. No

00:57:21.075 --> 00:57:22.915
<v Speaker 0>matching keys. I'm just going to

00:57:23.635 --> 00:57:26.275
<v Speaker 1>okay. Then instead, let's look at the DevSpace

00:57:26.275 --> 00:57:28.675
<v Speaker 1>YAML to see what it should do. I

00:57:28.675 --> 00:57:29.715
<v Speaker 0>know why that's not working.

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:33.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh, you know? My SSH sock is hooked

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:35.680
<v Speaker 0>up to one password, and you're probably adding

00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:37.840
<v Speaker 0>them to a different agent.

00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:39.920
<v Speaker 0>DevSpace will be adding it to the default

00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:41.440
<v Speaker 0>SSH agent, so I don't think it's gonna

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:45.065
<v Speaker 0>work. Yeah. Probably. Okay. Well, then let's still

00:57:45.065 --> 00:57:46.985
<v Speaker 1>look at the DevSpace YAML. And

00:57:47.865 --> 00:57:49.785
<v Speaker 1>if you at home try it out yourself,

00:57:49.785 --> 00:57:51.785
<v Speaker 1>and you don't have this weird setup with

00:57:51.785 --> 00:57:53.385
<v Speaker 1>the SSH cable work.

00:57:54.025 --> 00:57:55.545
<v Speaker 1>Because, again, I tried it out yesterday, so

00:57:55.545 --> 00:57:56.345
<v Speaker 1>it should still be working.

00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh, this is the wrong DevSpace. We need

00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:01.060
<v Speaker 1>to go to the

00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:02.500
<v Speaker 1>v

00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:06.260
<v Speaker 1>Versus Code example DevSpace exactly.

00:58:12.035 --> 00:58:13.795
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Right. So,

00:58:16.914 --> 00:58:18.595
<v Speaker 1>yeah, if you scroll down a little bit

00:58:18.674 --> 00:58:20.115
<v Speaker 1>this is very similar to what we just

00:58:20.115 --> 00:58:20.434
<v Speaker 1>saw.

00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:25.820
<v Speaker 1>So in the

00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:29.260
<v Speaker 1>sync

00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:30.540
<v Speaker 1>part

00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:36.060
<v Speaker 0>Yep. Yeah. We're just, like, doing some Git

00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:37.340
<v Speaker 1>magic

00:58:36.865 --> 00:58:39.425
<v Speaker 1>stuff there. I think it's in the pipeline

00:58:39.585 --> 00:58:41.825
<v Speaker 1>in the dev pipeline, probably, what's happening, the

00:58:41.825 --> 00:58:44.945
<v Speaker 1>the interesting part, I'm guessing. So scroll down

00:58:45.105 --> 00:58:47.265
<v Speaker 1>a little bit. Oh, yeah. There it is.

00:58:47.505 --> 00:58:50.225
<v Speaker 1>So we run the default pipeline of dev,

00:58:50.225 --> 00:58:52.225
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty much what we saw, so

00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:54.760
<v Speaker 1>deploying stuff.

00:58:55.079 --> 00:58:57.720
<v Speaker 1>And then we this is just one command.

00:58:57.720 --> 00:58:59.720
<v Speaker 1>Right? We because the SSH

00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:04.359
<v Speaker 1>server has been created in the SSH part,

00:59:04.359 --> 00:59:06.440
<v Speaker 1>what we can do here is we just

00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:07.240
<v Speaker 1>start

00:59:07.475 --> 00:59:10.115
<v Speaker 1>Versus Code with the code code command

00:59:10.115 --> 00:59:12.275
<v Speaker 1>and then basically say, like, the the folder

00:59:12.275 --> 00:59:13.475
<v Speaker 1>that you should open

00:59:13.875 --> 00:59:14.515
<v Speaker 1>is

00:59:15.315 --> 00:59:16.115
<v Speaker 1>this,

00:59:16.275 --> 00:59:17.395
<v Speaker 1>like, remote

00:59:18.515 --> 00:59:19.395
<v Speaker 1>container

00:59:19.795 --> 00:59:22.355
<v Speaker 1>that you can connect to through SSH

00:59:22.650 --> 00:59:23.450
<v Speaker 1>remote.

00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:25.609
<v Speaker 1>Not quite sure how the Versus Code remote

00:59:25.690 --> 00:59:27.530
<v Speaker 1>thing works, but it seems like this is

00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:29.369
<v Speaker 1>just a a URL that you can just

00:59:29.369 --> 00:59:30.650
<v Speaker 1>feed into the code

00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:31.690
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:59:32.170 --> 00:59:32.890
<v Speaker 1>Command.

00:59:33.609 --> 00:59:35.609
<v Speaker 1>So this would be super cool if it

00:59:35.609 --> 00:59:35.849
<v Speaker 1>were.

00:59:38.184 --> 00:59:40.585
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's my fault, I think, just because

00:59:40.585 --> 00:59:42.105
<v Speaker 0>of my weird setup.

00:59:43.305 --> 00:59:44.345
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. But, like, this

00:59:44.984 --> 00:59:46.664
<v Speaker 1>again, if you if you just wanna try

00:59:46.664 --> 00:59:47.785
<v Speaker 1>it out at home,

00:59:48.585 --> 00:59:50.984
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure if there is a CLI for,

00:59:50.984 --> 00:59:53.310
<v Speaker 1>like, intelligent or something that would allow you

00:59:53.310 --> 00:59:55.630
<v Speaker 1>to similarly just, like, open a remote

00:59:57.070 --> 00:59:58.990
<v Speaker 1>folder, you could probably do that as well

00:59:58.990 --> 00:59:59.630
<v Speaker 1>here.

01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:02.190
<v Speaker 1>And, yes, really convenient.

01:00:03.070 --> 01:00:04.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm I'm guessing there's probably other stuff that

01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:06.190
<v Speaker 1>we can also do with Versus Code, but

01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:07.150
<v Speaker 1>I haven't checked that yet.

01:00:07.895 --> 01:00:09.815
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, we have a few comments.

01:00:10.214 --> 01:00:13.415
<v Speaker 0>So, apparently, I'm the ultimate product tester

01:00:13.415 --> 01:00:14.215
<v Speaker 0>because

01:00:14.615 --> 01:00:16.855
<v Speaker 0>on every hands on session, I managed to

01:00:16.855 --> 01:00:17.655
<v Speaker 0>break something.

01:00:18.135 --> 01:00:20.135
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Thank you. Well, you're not breaking something.

01:00:20.135 --> 01:00:21.655
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing. You just have a very

01:00:21.655 --> 01:00:24.150
<v Speaker 1>particular setup, which is good to know. I

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:25.829
<v Speaker 1>mean, we're probably not gonna fix it because

01:00:25.829 --> 01:00:27.430
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work for you because you're, like,

01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:29.190
<v Speaker 1>one of the 00.1%

01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:30.630
<v Speaker 1>of people who do it the way that

01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:32.150
<v Speaker 1>you do, possibly.

01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:34.310
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:00:34.310 --> 01:00:36.470
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I spent too much time playing with

01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:38.545
<v Speaker 0>myself. But if I just left it alone,

01:00:38.545 --> 01:00:40.065
<v Speaker 0>maybe more stuff would work. I think I

01:00:40.065 --> 01:00:42.545
<v Speaker 0>definitely am the the lowest common denominator here.

01:00:42.545 --> 01:00:45.425
<v Speaker 0>But You you pretty much know what you're

01:00:45.425 --> 01:00:48.065
<v Speaker 1>doing, which is, like, not necessarily I mean,

01:00:48.065 --> 01:00:49.505
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna say that our users don't

01:00:49.505 --> 01:00:50.545
<v Speaker 1>know what they're doing, but

01:00:51.810 --> 01:00:54.210
<v Speaker 1>that's obviously, we're targeting people who

01:00:54.610 --> 01:00:56.530
<v Speaker 1>might not know exactly

01:00:56.530 --> 01:00:58.290
<v Speaker 1>all the ins and outs

01:00:58.450 --> 01:01:01.170
<v Speaker 1>about, like, you know, SSH connections or networking

01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:02.690
<v Speaker 1>or, like, how to set up stuff in

01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:03.490
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes.

01:01:03.810 --> 01:01:04.050
<v Speaker 1>So,

01:01:04.885 --> 01:01:06.725
<v Speaker 1>yeah, we're focusing on on the group of

01:01:06.725 --> 01:01:08.725
<v Speaker 1>people who just, like, do the standard stuff

01:01:08.725 --> 01:01:10.085
<v Speaker 1>more than, like,

01:01:10.485 --> 01:01:12.725
<v Speaker 1>very specific edge cases, which is, like, probably

01:01:12.725 --> 01:01:14.165
<v Speaker 1>what most companies are doing.

01:01:14.485 --> 01:01:15.125
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

01:01:15.285 --> 01:01:17.525
<v Speaker 0>We also have a question from Russell who

01:01:17.525 --> 01:01:18.565
<v Speaker 0>is saying

01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:20.860
<v Speaker 0>it's went off the screen, but I'll read

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:23.020
<v Speaker 0>this one out. Is there any support for

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:24.300
<v Speaker 0>multiple copies?

01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:26.540
<v Speaker 0>So this is where Russell is assuming there's

01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:28.860
<v Speaker 0>a shared development cluster that is being used

01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:30.380
<v Speaker 0>by multiple people, and they may want to

01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:32.060
<v Speaker 0>work on the same service at the same

01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:33.980
<v Speaker 0>time. So I guess the DevSpace.YAML

01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:36.355
<v Speaker 0>would be the same. How would that work?

01:01:37.395 --> 01:01:39.555
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So this is where you could use

01:01:39.555 --> 01:01:40.435
<v Speaker 1>dependencies,

01:01:40.435 --> 01:01:42.755
<v Speaker 1>for example. So let's say we're we're the

01:01:42.755 --> 01:01:44.195
<v Speaker 1>two of us are working on

01:01:44.675 --> 01:01:45.475
<v Speaker 1>different

01:01:45.475 --> 01:01:47.795
<v Speaker 1>services that depend on each other. We can

01:01:48.035 --> 01:01:50.275
<v Speaker 1>I can define your service as a dependency,

01:01:50.275 --> 01:01:52.079
<v Speaker 1>and you can define my service as a

01:01:52.079 --> 01:01:52.800
<v Speaker 1>dependency?

01:01:53.119 --> 01:01:54.800
<v Speaker 1>And then on the cluster,

01:01:55.359 --> 01:01:57.680
<v Speaker 1>there is it's either a config map or

01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.279
<v Speaker 1>a secret. I'm not quite sure about that,

01:01:59.279 --> 01:02:00.880
<v Speaker 1>but it's saved on the cluster.

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:04.225
<v Speaker 1>And DevSpace will see, oh, there is a

01:02:04.464 --> 01:02:06.865
<v Speaker 1>instance of this dependency running, so I don't

01:02:06.865 --> 01:02:08.385
<v Speaker 1>need to deploy it. I'm just gonna use

01:02:08.385 --> 01:02:10.785
<v Speaker 1>this instance here as a dependency for my

01:02:10.785 --> 01:02:11.745
<v Speaker 1>microservice.

01:02:11.825 --> 01:02:13.825
<v Speaker 1>And if you change something, it will be

01:02:13.825 --> 01:02:16.145
<v Speaker 1>reflected in my microservice because I'm using your

01:02:16.145 --> 01:02:16.865
<v Speaker 1>dependency.

01:02:16.945 --> 01:02:18.180
<v Speaker 1>So as long as we're on the same

01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:20.180
<v Speaker 1>cluster, this will work out of the box,

01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:21.380
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty awesome.

01:02:21.859 --> 01:02:23.300
<v Speaker 0>But I guess if someone if two people

01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:25.300
<v Speaker 0>wanted to work on the same service, they

01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:27.060
<v Speaker 0>would have to use different namespaces to make

01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:28.340
<v Speaker 0>sure that would work and doesn't

01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:31.325
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. But that is not and I don't

01:02:31.325 --> 01:02:33.244
<v Speaker 1>think it should work, honestly. I I think

01:02:33.244 --> 01:02:34.925
<v Speaker 1>if two people work on the same class

01:02:34.925 --> 01:02:36.285
<v Speaker 1>and the same product at the same time,

01:02:36.285 --> 01:02:38.605
<v Speaker 1>it's it's just generally not a good idea.

01:02:38.765 --> 01:02:41.405
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Use namespaces. Keep them separate, I guess.

01:02:41.405 --> 01:02:43.244
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. Or vClusters,

01:02:43.244 --> 01:02:44.765
<v Speaker 1>which is another product that we develop.

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:48.440
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Yeah. We've done a session on vCluster,

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:49.880
<v Speaker 0>but it has been a long time. So

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:51.320
<v Speaker 0>I'll need to reach out to you to

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:53.240
<v Speaker 0>you and Yeah. And Retch and get something

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:54.440
<v Speaker 0>else on the couch for that because it'd

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.040
<v Speaker 0>be good to see what's going on vCluster.

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.320
<v Speaker 0>But that that's not what we're doing today.

01:02:58.235 --> 01:03:00.075
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So I really like this. You know,

01:03:00.075 --> 01:03:02.635
<v Speaker 0>DevSpace gives me something I could put into

01:03:02.635 --> 01:03:04.635
<v Speaker 0>GET, which is, the step one for all

01:03:04.635 --> 01:03:06.235
<v Speaker 0>tools. If if I'm gonna use it, I

01:03:06.235 --> 01:03:07.275
<v Speaker 0>have to be able to store the config

01:03:07.275 --> 01:03:09.515
<v Speaker 0>in GET. We have a YAML definition for

01:03:09.515 --> 01:03:11.710
<v Speaker 0>describing how to build

01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:12.270
<v Speaker 0>and

01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:13.950
<v Speaker 0>ship

01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:15.310
<v Speaker 0>our application,

01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:17.470
<v Speaker 0>and it sets up all of that plumbing

01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:20.190
<v Speaker 0>that just gives us this interactive environment report

01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:22.110
<v Speaker 0>forward and and potential

01:03:22.110 --> 01:03:22.750
<v Speaker 0>debugger,

01:03:23.085 --> 01:03:25.565
<v Speaker 0>which I'm not fancying my chances of my

01:03:25.645 --> 01:03:27.725
<v Speaker 0>my machine getting to work. So

01:03:29.484 --> 01:03:31.244
<v Speaker 1>As I said, I also haven't used the

01:03:31.244 --> 01:03:33.965
<v Speaker 1>debugger feature, so I couldn't even help you

01:03:33.965 --> 01:03:34.845
<v Speaker 1>troubleshoot it probably.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.080
<v Speaker 0>Well, no. But, you know, we're I think

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:39.440
<v Speaker 0>what we've done is we're able to show

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:40.960
<v Speaker 0>people that this tool is best, how to

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:41.760
<v Speaker 0>get started,

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:44.080
<v Speaker 0>and, you know, how it could be adapted

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:46.320
<v Speaker 0>to different languages and such. Now I I

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:48.480
<v Speaker 0>like that the documentation kind of has I

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:51.125
<v Speaker 0>mean, these are all pretty popular languages, Node,

01:03:51.125 --> 01:03:53.685
<v Speaker 0>Python, Java, Ruby, Go language, PNSB. So, you

01:03:53.685 --> 01:03:55.445
<v Speaker 0>know, people should go check it out and

01:03:55.605 --> 01:03:56.885
<v Speaker 0>let us know how you get on. Feel

01:03:56.885 --> 01:03:58.725
<v Speaker 0>free to leave comments or reach out to

01:03:58.725 --> 01:04:01.845
<v Speaker 0>either of us directly on Twitter. And it's

01:04:01.845 --> 01:04:04.085
<v Speaker 0>always fun to share. Yeah. Is there anything

01:04:04.085 --> 01:04:05.445
<v Speaker 1>else that we could do with comfort?

01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:10.140
<v Speaker 1>I think the I mean, there's, like, this

01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:11.260
<v Speaker 1>function sections,

01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:12.780
<v Speaker 1>which is, like, a way that you can

01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:15.660
<v Speaker 1>define, like, your own custom functions,

01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:17.900
<v Speaker 1>but I think this is like, I don't

01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:19.580
<v Speaker 1>know how interesting this is. This is just

01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:21.100
<v Speaker 1>another thing that you can define.

01:04:22.835 --> 01:04:23.875
<v Speaker 1>I do wanna

01:04:24.115 --> 01:04:26.515
<v Speaker 1>just give people the chance. If you if

01:04:26.515 --> 01:04:28.915
<v Speaker 1>you have more in-depth questions, especially, like, more

01:04:28.915 --> 01:04:31.635
<v Speaker 1>technical questions, we have a public Slack, which

01:04:31.635 --> 01:04:32.755
<v Speaker 1>is you can see that on the top

01:04:32.755 --> 01:04:33.235
<v Speaker 1>right,

01:04:33.555 --> 01:04:35.474
<v Speaker 1>and you can join that Slack and ask

01:04:35.474 --> 01:04:36.320
<v Speaker 1>you questions.

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:37.840
<v Speaker 1>And, you know, like, if you have any

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:40.240
<v Speaker 1>feature requests, maybe just drop them in there.

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:42.240
<v Speaker 1>We have some lovely engineers there who will

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:43.040
<v Speaker 1>help you out.

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Apart from that, I think we covered

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:48.160
<v Speaker 1>most of it.

01:04:48.785 --> 01:04:50.945
<v Speaker 1>Most of the, like, standard stuff. If you

01:04:50.945 --> 01:04:52.865
<v Speaker 1>wanna do something more specific, the docs will

01:04:52.865 --> 01:04:53.905
<v Speaker 1>hopefully help you.

01:04:54.465 --> 01:04:55.745
<v Speaker 1>If you want to contribute,

01:04:55.905 --> 01:04:57.665
<v Speaker 1>as I said, it's open source, so feel

01:04:57.665 --> 01:04:59.345
<v Speaker 1>free to check out the GitHub

01:04:59.505 --> 01:05:00.225
<v Speaker 1>repository.

01:05:00.305 --> 01:05:02.290
<v Speaker 1>And, you know, even if you're just changing

01:05:02.290 --> 01:05:04.369
<v Speaker 1>a typo in the docs, that's also helpful.

01:05:04.369 --> 01:05:06.210
<v Speaker 1>So feel free to just, like,

01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:08.130
<v Speaker 1>you know, send in some pull requests or

01:05:08.130 --> 01:05:08.610
<v Speaker 1>something.

01:05:09.410 --> 01:05:11.970
<v Speaker 1>Thanks, Russ. Have a great weekend too.

01:05:12.690 --> 01:05:14.930
<v Speaker 0>Well, I mean, we've taken a good look

01:05:14.930 --> 01:05:16.690
<v Speaker 0>at what DevSpace offers.

01:05:17.065 --> 01:05:18.905
<v Speaker 0>I hope that people's interest has peaked and

01:05:18.905 --> 01:05:20.505
<v Speaker 0>they go kick the tires on it. But

01:05:20.505 --> 01:05:22.025
<v Speaker 0>maybe you could share

01:05:22.345 --> 01:05:23.545
<v Speaker 0>you know, I I didn't realize it was

01:05:23.545 --> 01:05:25.465
<v Speaker 0>on DevSpace six, but I'm assuming the market

01:05:25.465 --> 01:05:27.705
<v Speaker 0>is ongoing and continue to improve. Like, what's

01:05:27.705 --> 01:05:29.145
<v Speaker 0>on the road map for DevSpace? What are

01:05:29.145 --> 01:05:29.865
<v Speaker 0>you working on next?

01:05:31.269 --> 01:05:33.589
<v Speaker 1>Then you're literally asking the wrong person for

01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:35.030
<v Speaker 1>that. I

01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:38.150
<v Speaker 1>do not do not know. Stuff and things.

01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:39.190
<v Speaker 0>That's all I have to say. Yeah. Lots

01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:41.269
<v Speaker 0>of cool stuff. Lots of good things. Just

01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:43.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. We're we're gonna make it even

01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:45.349
<v Speaker 1>better. We're gonna make it work on Rawkode's

01:05:46.655 --> 01:05:47.455
<v Speaker 1>computer.

01:05:48.495 --> 01:05:49.535
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Awesome.

01:05:50.095 --> 01:05:52.335
<v Speaker 0>Well, I think that's us then. I'm looking

01:05:52.335 --> 01:05:54.335
<v Speaker 0>forward to catching up with you in Edinburgh,

01:05:54.335 --> 01:05:56.495
<v Speaker 0>a cute puddle. And so I will see

01:05:56.495 --> 01:05:58.815
<v Speaker 0>you then. Super excited. Lots of karaoke.

01:05:59.190 --> 01:06:01.109
<v Speaker 0>I hope everyone has a great weekend. I

01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:03.109
<v Speaker 0>hope you have a great weekend. Any last

01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:04.870
<v Speaker 0>words before I say goodbye?

01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:08.710
<v Speaker 1>Just, you know, be kind to each other,

01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:11.030
<v Speaker 1>and thanks for having me. Awesome. Thank you.

01:06:11.030 --> 01:06:12.869
