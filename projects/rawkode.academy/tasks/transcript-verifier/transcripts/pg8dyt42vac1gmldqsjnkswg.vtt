00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.000
<v Speaker 0>Hello.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.799
<v Speaker 0>And welcome back to the Rawkode Academy. Today,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.040
<v Speaker 0>we are following on with our Fermion Spin

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.000
<v Speaker 0>course.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.960
<v Speaker 0>And in particular, we're following on from the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.280
<v Speaker 0>last video where I showed you how

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:18.055
<v Speaker 0>to deploy the Fermion platform

00:01:18.215 --> 00:01:20.055
<v Speaker 0>so that you can actually run your own

00:01:20.055 --> 00:01:21.575
<v Speaker 0>spin applications

00:01:21.895 --> 00:01:24.454
<v Speaker 0>on your own cloud provider or hardware provider

00:01:24.454 --> 00:01:25.415
<v Speaker 0>of choice.

00:01:26.134 --> 00:01:28.054
<v Speaker 0>Today will be a a quick episode where

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:29.735
<v Speaker 0>we take a look at an evolution of

00:01:29.735 --> 00:01:30.615
<v Speaker 0>that architecture.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.560
<v Speaker 0>So in the first one, we jumped through

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.880
<v Speaker 0>the Fermion installer repository

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:38.840
<v Speaker 0>where we used the Civo cloud provider,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.479
<v Speaker 0>so I contributed by SIAM, to spin up

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.479
<v Speaker 0>some Civo virtual machines

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.560
<v Speaker 0>and deploy everything with cloud in it.

00:01:46.615 --> 00:01:49.095
<v Speaker 0>Well, I've actually contributed or at least it's

00:01:49.095 --> 00:01:51.575
<v Speaker 0>in a PR just now to the installer

00:01:51.575 --> 00:01:52.535
<v Speaker 0>repository

00:01:53.255 --> 00:01:55.495
<v Speaker 0>with some code that allows you to do

00:01:55.495 --> 00:01:56.855
<v Speaker 0>this with Equinix metal.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.890
<v Speaker 0>Now why would I do this with Equinix

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:00.530
<v Speaker 0>metal?

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.890
<v Speaker 0>Well,

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.970
<v Speaker 0>one bare metal is more fun.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.330
<v Speaker 0>I always like working with loads of loads

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 0>of cores and loads of RAM and super

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.890
<v Speaker 0>chunky gigabit network cards. But

00:02:13.395 --> 00:02:15.555
<v Speaker 0>they also expose BGP to you,

00:02:15.875 --> 00:02:18.195
<v Speaker 0>which means we can do some really sophisticated

00:02:18.195 --> 00:02:18.915
<v Speaker 0>routing

00:02:19.315 --> 00:02:21.555
<v Speaker 0>at the network level when we have more

00:02:21.555 --> 00:02:23.235
<v Speaker 0>than one family on platform.

00:02:23.955 --> 00:02:25.875
<v Speaker 0>Now you've probably seen me chat about BGP

00:02:25.875 --> 00:02:27.635
<v Speaker 0>before. I'm a huge fan. I think it

00:02:27.635 --> 00:02:30.730
<v Speaker 0>opens up infinite scale. Well, you know, that's

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.650
<v Speaker 0>a scary word to use, but it opens

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.930
<v Speaker 0>up certainly different

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.290
<v Speaker 0>scaling avenues

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.890
<v Speaker 0>where you can provide low latency applications to

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:39.770
<v Speaker 0>your customers.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.209
<v Speaker 0>So we're gonna take a look at that

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.930
<v Speaker 0>today in the context of Fairmain's platform

00:02:44.945 --> 00:02:46.465
<v Speaker 0>and web assembly.

00:02:46.945 --> 00:02:47.505
<v Speaker 0>So

00:02:48.625 --> 00:02:50.465
<v Speaker 0>let's share my screen.

00:02:52.145 --> 00:02:52.945
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully,

00:02:53.585 --> 00:02:54.225
<v Speaker 0>here we go.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.420
<v Speaker 0>And this read me,

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.380
<v Speaker 0>and

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 0>you can find this and currently a pull

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:04.740
<v Speaker 0>request

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.020
<v Speaker 0>at github.com/firmion/installer.

00:03:09.475 --> 00:03:11.715
<v Speaker 0>This is the Equinix metal directory, which has

00:03:11.715 --> 00:03:12.915
<v Speaker 0>a read me. It tells you everything that

00:03:12.915 --> 00:03:13.795
<v Speaker 0>you need to know.

00:03:14.435 --> 00:03:16.675
<v Speaker 0>Essentially, you need an Equinix metal account, and

00:03:16.675 --> 00:03:18.915
<v Speaker 0>you need a user level API key.

00:03:19.155 --> 00:03:21.155
<v Speaker 0>We need a user level API key because

00:03:21.155 --> 00:03:23.875
<v Speaker 0>project level API keys cannot change the BGP

00:03:23.875 --> 00:03:24.435
<v Speaker 0>configuration.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.810
<v Speaker 0>So you all have to use a user

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.170
<v Speaker 0>level key.

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.450
<v Speaker 0>And you must have BGP enabled for your

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.330
<v Speaker 0>project. So what does that look like? Well,

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.890
<v Speaker 0>if you come to project settings,

00:03:38.155 --> 00:03:38.955
<v Speaker 0>nope.

00:03:39.035 --> 00:03:40.955
<v Speaker 0>If you go to networking BGP

00:03:41.595 --> 00:03:42.875
<v Speaker 0>and I'll zoom in.

00:03:43.834 --> 00:03:45.995
<v Speaker 0>You can see here this is already enabled

00:03:45.995 --> 00:03:48.235
<v Speaker 0>like so. If you don't see this, what

00:03:48.235 --> 00:03:49.755
<v Speaker 0>you're actually going to see is a big

00:03:49.755 --> 00:03:51.834
<v Speaker 0>blue button that says, hey, do you want

00:03:51.834 --> 00:03:54.260
<v Speaker 0>to enable BGP on this project? So as

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.780
<v Speaker 0>long as you see something that looks like

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 0>this, you are good to go.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.420
<v Speaker 0>Now you need to export your API key

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.340
<v Speaker 0>as metal off token

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:05.780
<v Speaker 0>as we can see here.

00:04:07.585 --> 00:04:09.585
<v Speaker 0>This uses a bunch of defaults as part

00:04:09.585 --> 00:04:11.985
<v Speaker 0>of the automation. One is gonna create your

00:04:11.985 --> 00:04:14.145
<v Speaker 0>instances and call them fermion at least as

00:04:14.145 --> 00:04:15.825
<v Speaker 0>a prefix dependent on the metro that we

00:04:15.825 --> 00:04:17.425
<v Speaker 0>deploy to and it's going to use a

00:04:17.425 --> 00:04:19.425
<v Speaker 0>c d small x 86 instance.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.780
<v Speaker 0>This is gonna cost you about $1 per

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.099
<v Speaker 0>hour. So remember to shut it down if

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:27.099
<v Speaker 0>you're only playing around and not deploying this

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:27.980
<v Speaker 0>to production.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.060
<v Speaker 0>We also allocate one global IP address which

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.500
<v Speaker 0>allows us to use BGP.

00:04:35.225 --> 00:04:36.985
<v Speaker 0>Next, all we need to do is CDN

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:38.425
<v Speaker 0>to the Terraform directory,

00:04:38.425 --> 00:04:40.505
<v Speaker 0>run Terraform and Terraform

00:04:40.505 --> 00:04:41.305
<v Speaker 0>apply.

00:04:41.945 --> 00:04:44.825
<v Speaker 0>Now, let's see if it's that easy.

00:04:45.705 --> 00:04:47.785
<v Speaker 0>As you can see, I'm in the Equinix

00:04:47.785 --> 00:04:49.705
<v Speaker 0>manual slash Terraform directory

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.290
<v Speaker 0>and I'm going to run terraform edit.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.610
<v Speaker 0>This has been done plenty of times while

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.370
<v Speaker 0>I was testing those pull request.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.850
<v Speaker 0>So this should be nice and fast. If

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.530
<v Speaker 0>I just finished, I'm a meeting a little

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:01.890
<v Speaker 0>bit longer for you as it pulls down

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:02.530
<v Speaker 0>the providers.

00:05:03.475 --> 00:05:05.315
<v Speaker 0>And I see Russell has joined us in

00:05:05.315 --> 00:05:07.715
<v Speaker 0>the chat. Hey, Russell. I was a player.

00:05:09.635 --> 00:05:12.675
<v Speaker 0>So now we can run Terraform

00:05:12.915 --> 00:05:15.395
<v Speaker 0>apply. And well, spins up. We'll quickly take

00:05:15.395 --> 00:05:16.915
<v Speaker 0>a look at the code and what's actually

00:05:16.915 --> 00:05:19.220
<v Speaker 0>happening. I thought to be honest, it's really,

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.740
<v Speaker 0>really easy. Well,

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.060
<v Speaker 0>easy is a bold word, but it really

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.540
<v Speaker 0>is.

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:26.740
<v Speaker 0>From here we need an EquinixMatter project ID

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.460
<v Speaker 0>to get this. Just go to the console

00:05:30.285 --> 00:05:32.125
<v Speaker 0>and this massive UUID

00:05:32.125 --> 00:05:34.764
<v Speaker 0>that you have after projects is your project

00:05:34.764 --> 00:05:35.405
<v Speaker 0>ID.

00:05:35.884 --> 00:05:37.725
<v Speaker 0>You can also get this from project settings

00:05:37.725 --> 00:05:39.325
<v Speaker 0>where you can copy it

00:05:40.125 --> 00:05:40.604
<v Speaker 0>like so.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.420
<v Speaker 0>We paste this in

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.380
<v Speaker 0>and before I had this, let me change

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.660
<v Speaker 0>one more thing.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.500
<v Speaker 0>So

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.380
<v Speaker 0>and variables,

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.460
<v Speaker 0>we have the metros that we're going to

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.820
<v Speaker 0>deploy to and I'm gonna make this a

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.420
<v Speaker 0>bit bigger. This is smaller because I was

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.475
<v Speaker 0>on my laptop earlier. Here we go.

00:06:01.315 --> 00:06:03.715
<v Speaker 0>This is our metros and you can see

00:06:03.715 --> 00:06:05.235
<v Speaker 0>here I'm going to deploy it to D

00:06:05.235 --> 00:06:07.235
<v Speaker 0>E which is Dallas and AM which is

00:06:07.235 --> 00:06:10.035
<v Speaker 0>Amsterdam. And I'm actually gonna turn off

00:06:11.235 --> 00:06:12.355
<v Speaker 0>Amsterdam

00:06:12.435 --> 00:06:13.235
<v Speaker 0>for now

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.090
<v Speaker 0>Because I wanna see this perform

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.410
<v Speaker 0>not slowly, but I wanna see the latency

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.770
<v Speaker 0>kind of well from The UK to Dallas,

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:22.810
<v Speaker 0>which is a bit more than from The

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.970
<v Speaker 0>UK to Amsterdam. And then we'll deploy that

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.095
<v Speaker 0>second Metro. The BGP advertisement will then start

00:06:28.095 --> 00:06:30.175
<v Speaker 0>written or traffic and we'll get faster fairway

00:06:30.175 --> 00:06:30.975
<v Speaker 0>on platform,

00:06:31.215 --> 00:06:32.975
<v Speaker 0>which is the goal for today's session.

00:06:33.695 --> 00:06:35.615
<v Speaker 0>So we can hit return on this ID.

00:06:35.935 --> 00:06:38.015
<v Speaker 0>TerraForm is gonna go bloop bloop bloop.

00:06:38.575 --> 00:06:40.575
<v Speaker 0>Oh, it's in changes rather than no. It's

00:06:40.575 --> 00:06:42.510
<v Speaker 0>okay. It's ads. I

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:44.510
<v Speaker 0>know it's

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:47.389
<v Speaker 0>let's run that again, but now that I've

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:49.229
<v Speaker 0>saved the change. Hopefully, we don't get

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:51.310
<v Speaker 0>alright.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.550
<v Speaker 0>This is in a currently broken state. So

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.745
<v Speaker 0>that's gonna be absolutely perfect, doesn't it? Let's

00:06:55.745 --> 00:06:57.824
<v Speaker 0>run a terraform refresh.

00:07:00.784 --> 00:07:01.505
<v Speaker 0>Really,

00:07:01.585 --> 00:07:03.425
<v Speaker 0>did not clean this up at some point.

00:07:03.585 --> 00:07:05.025
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna try again.

00:07:07.104 --> 00:07:08.784
<v Speaker 0>I'm just gonna let it go. This may

00:07:08.784 --> 00:07:10.145
<v Speaker 0>fail. We're gonna find out.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.080
<v Speaker 0>So what happened is I think before I

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.840
<v Speaker 0>had COVID last week, so I was off

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.160
<v Speaker 0>all week, which is why the stream moved

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.440
<v Speaker 0>to today instead of last week. But I

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.760
<v Speaker 0>think during my testing, I've left up, realized

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.375
<v Speaker 0>that while I was sick, went to the

00:07:24.375 --> 00:07:27.175
<v Speaker 0>Equities Federal Council, shut down all the instances,

00:07:27.574 --> 00:07:28.935
<v Speaker 0>and now we're in this position that we

00:07:28.935 --> 00:07:29.655
<v Speaker 0>see today.

00:07:30.055 --> 00:07:31.175
<v Speaker 0>But I don't think that's a big deal

00:07:31.175 --> 00:07:33.175
<v Speaker 0>because we can see that we are getting

00:07:33.175 --> 00:07:35.815
<v Speaker 0>the Dallas instance spun up and hopefully TerraForm

00:07:35.815 --> 00:07:37.495
<v Speaker 0>will just clean up the state fail for

00:07:37.495 --> 00:07:38.854
<v Speaker 0>their missing resources.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.720
<v Speaker 0>Well, that spins up. It does take around

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.080
<v Speaker 0>one to two minutes.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.800
<v Speaker 0>We can see what this code does.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.520
<v Speaker 0>Now

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.000
<v Speaker 0>this is really standard terraform

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.035
<v Speaker 0>that grabs the reserved IP address from the

00:07:54.035 --> 00:07:55.315
<v Speaker 0>Equinix middle API.

00:07:56.115 --> 00:07:58.354
<v Speaker 0>We're just doing a little bit of juggling

00:07:58.354 --> 00:07:59.794
<v Speaker 0>with the values so that we can get

00:07:59.794 --> 00:08:01.395
<v Speaker 0>a global IP and a global IP with

00:08:01.395 --> 00:08:02.195
<v Speaker 0>the cider.

00:08:02.435 --> 00:08:04.835
<v Speaker 0>This is needed for some configuration aspects, not

00:08:04.835 --> 00:08:05.555
<v Speaker 0>important right now.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.940
<v Speaker 0>We have the IP attachment which we do

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.860
<v Speaker 0>for each device and each metro

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.820
<v Speaker 0>and then we build our cloud and a

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:13.700
<v Speaker 0>configuration.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.700
<v Speaker 0>So let's see. This bit

00:08:18.914 --> 00:08:19.715
<v Speaker 0>here

00:08:19.875 --> 00:08:22.514
<v Speaker 0>is already provided for you by Fermion. This

00:08:22.514 --> 00:08:23.235
<v Speaker 0>is what

00:08:24.034 --> 00:08:24.755
<v Speaker 0>all

00:08:24.914 --> 00:08:26.995
<v Speaker 0>of the cloud providers use.

00:08:27.314 --> 00:08:29.235
<v Speaker 0>However, you'll see that I've kind of thrown

00:08:29.235 --> 00:08:30.914
<v Speaker 0>in this bootstrap component

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.350
<v Speaker 0>which just sets up all the stuff that

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:34.149
<v Speaker 0>we need

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:37.429
<v Speaker 0>for this platform to run with BGP

00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:38.390
<v Speaker 0>integrated.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.950
<v Speaker 0>And that just means installing and configuring Bert

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:44.070
<v Speaker 0>on the on the Linux hosts so that

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.750
<v Speaker 0>we can get that BGP advertisement.

00:08:47.205 --> 00:08:49.605
<v Speaker 0>Nothing else in here is particularly

00:08:49.685 --> 00:08:52.085
<v Speaker 0>different from any other provider. This is just

00:08:52.085 --> 00:08:54.485
<v Speaker 0>standard fair mail platform Terraform.

00:08:55.125 --> 00:08:56.964
<v Speaker 0>The bet that we've added to make this

00:08:56.964 --> 00:08:59.045
<v Speaker 0>different is to set up BGP script.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.100
<v Speaker 0>Now we just make sure we have JQ

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.260
<v Speaker 0>installed because we are doing a little bit

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.340
<v Speaker 0>of JSON juggling and the fact that we

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.660
<v Speaker 0>pulled down the Equinix MERL metadata

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.100
<v Speaker 0>which is a JSON blob that our Terraform

00:09:12.275 --> 00:09:14.035
<v Speaker 0>throws into it for us.

00:09:15.155 --> 00:09:18.515
<v Speaker 0>We sleep because sometimes this metadata isn't there

00:09:18.515 --> 00:09:20.515
<v Speaker 0>until the BGP is turned on for the

00:09:20.515 --> 00:09:23.075
<v Speaker 0>device, which is why we then repeat

00:09:23.235 --> 00:09:25.075
<v Speaker 0>until we have access to a key called

00:09:25.075 --> 00:09:25.955
<v Speaker 0>BGP neighbors.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.199
<v Speaker 0>Once we have the BGP neighbor information, it

00:09:29.199 --> 00:09:30.959
<v Speaker 0>means that we can configure BART and even

00:09:30.959 --> 00:09:32.639
<v Speaker 0>add the BGP

00:09:32.639 --> 00:09:33.519
<v Speaker 0>address

00:09:33.759 --> 00:09:36.320
<v Speaker 0>to the loopback device on the host.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.639
<v Speaker 0>Now if you're not familiar with Linux and

00:09:38.639 --> 00:09:42.024
<v Speaker 0>Linux networking stuff, don't worry about it. We're

00:09:42.024 --> 00:09:44.425
<v Speaker 0>just really making sure that this IP address

00:09:44.824 --> 00:09:47.305
<v Speaker 0>will always route to one of our Linux

00:09:47.305 --> 00:09:50.105
<v Speaker 0>machines and that that machine can actually respond

00:09:50.105 --> 00:09:51.225
<v Speaker 0>for the IP address.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.800
<v Speaker 0>We configure some default routing for the BGP

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.520
<v Speaker 0>peers

00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:00.120
<v Speaker 0>and then we install BERD. Now again,

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.945
<v Speaker 0>I'm not really doing anything manually here. The

00:10:03.945 --> 00:10:06.985
<v Speaker 0>team Equinix metal formerly packet host, which is

00:10:06.985 --> 00:10:08.905
<v Speaker 0>why this is packet

00:10:08.905 --> 00:10:10.185
<v Speaker 0>host repository

00:10:11.145 --> 00:10:12.505
<v Speaker 0>wrote a

00:10:12.665 --> 00:10:13.945
<v Speaker 0>Python script

00:10:14.025 --> 00:10:16.345
<v Speaker 0>published as network helpers and as long as

00:10:16.345 --> 00:10:17.945
<v Speaker 0>you can just kind of pep the install

00:10:17.945 --> 00:10:19.145
<v Speaker 0>and then run configure,

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.840
<v Speaker 0>it will actually speak to the Equinix metal

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.840
<v Speaker 0>API, get all the peer information,

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.120
<v Speaker 0>configure the

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.320
<v Speaker 0>well, just configure the entire bird

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.000
<v Speaker 0>instance so that you don't need to do

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.200
<v Speaker 0>anything. And in fact, the only thing we

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.720
<v Speaker 0>do do is just restart it,

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.000
<v Speaker 0>which is nice.

00:10:34.715 --> 00:10:37.435
<v Speaker 0>From there, I did have to modify the

00:10:37.435 --> 00:10:40.315
<v Speaker 0>standard fermion platform nomad jobs.

00:10:40.555 --> 00:10:42.475
<v Speaker 0>So you'll see here, I am waiting for

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:43.675
<v Speaker 0>the file provisioner,

00:10:43.675 --> 00:10:45.195
<v Speaker 0>which throws all of the

00:10:45.435 --> 00:10:46.235
<v Speaker 0>nomad stuff,

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:47.870
<v Speaker 0>haplo,

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:49.790
<v Speaker 0>family on platform,

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:50.910
<v Speaker 0>bundle,

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.510
<v Speaker 0>blah onto the root directory. And once we

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:56.910
<v Speaker 0>have that, we're actually patching it. So

00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:59.870
<v Speaker 0>family on platform isn't really designed

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:00.510
<v Speaker 0>to

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:02.190
<v Speaker 0>lessen

00:11:02.595 --> 00:11:04.755
<v Speaker 0>on like multiple

00:11:04.675 --> 00:11:06.995
<v Speaker 0>not multiple IP addresses, but you know,

00:11:08.115 --> 00:11:10.755
<v Speaker 0>each Linux machine has its IPv4

00:11:10.755 --> 00:11:12.675
<v Speaker 0>address and then the global IP address is

00:11:12.675 --> 00:11:15.235
<v Speaker 0>different from it. And we actually want some

00:11:15.235 --> 00:11:18.274
<v Speaker 0>stuff to listen on the machines IPv4

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.250
<v Speaker 0>and not the global IPv4.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.730
<v Speaker 0>So we have to modify the traffic instance,

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:24.410
<v Speaker 0>which is a proxy set in front of

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:26.330
<v Speaker 0>all of the fair mail platform components

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:29.370
<v Speaker 0>and just say, hey, actually, we have the

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.930
<v Speaker 0>domain that we're configuring on a host level,

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:34.485
<v Speaker 0>but also we need to add on

00:11:36.964 --> 00:11:39.445
<v Speaker 0>our BGP IP address to.

00:11:40.085 --> 00:11:41.845
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, that kind of makes sense.

00:11:44.005 --> 00:11:44.885
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So

00:11:45.605 --> 00:11:48.085
<v Speaker 0>instead of just saying, hey, listen on this,

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:49.750
<v Speaker 0>we need to add in the HIPAA host

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.590
<v Speaker 0>and we do the same for bundle actually,

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.910
<v Speaker 0>which is done here. Let me see here.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:55.830
<v Speaker 0>And this is just so that we can

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.630
<v Speaker 0>when you're creating the

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.110
<v Speaker 0>spin applications deployed to the platform,

00:12:01.685 --> 00:12:03.445
<v Speaker 0>you could use the BGP

00:12:03.445 --> 00:12:05.204
<v Speaker 0>address and host name, and it doesn't matter

00:12:05.204 --> 00:12:06.964
<v Speaker 0>which one you hit. But if you want

00:12:06.964 --> 00:12:08.644
<v Speaker 0>to get to the hyper UI,

00:12:09.125 --> 00:12:11.365
<v Speaker 0>then you you really wanna have control over

00:12:11.365 --> 00:12:13.605
<v Speaker 0>that. So we're specifically saying I wanna be

00:12:13.605 --> 00:12:15.764
<v Speaker 0>able to request this on the local IPP

00:12:15.764 --> 00:12:16.324
<v Speaker 0>for address.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.240
<v Speaker 0>And we do the same for bundle and

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.400
<v Speaker 0>that's it. That's the only two modifications that

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.720
<v Speaker 0>had to be made to the entire stack,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.840
<v Speaker 0>which is just as time for this to

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.320
<v Speaker 0>pop over here and hopefully be healthy.

00:12:30.035 --> 00:12:32.035
<v Speaker 0>Well, let's go back to our read me.

00:12:36.755 --> 00:12:39.154
<v Speaker 0>We're not fussed about the TLS configuration or

00:12:39.154 --> 00:12:40.514
<v Speaker 0>anything like that right now.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.160
<v Speaker 0>What I actually want

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.240
<v Speaker 0>is

00:12:54.759 --> 00:12:56.120
<v Speaker 0>did they not put this in the read

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:56.279
<v Speaker 0>me?

00:12:59.915 --> 00:13:01.915
<v Speaker 0>No big deal. What we actually want is

00:13:01.915 --> 00:13:03.995
<v Speaker 0>the Hepco password.

00:13:04.155 --> 00:13:06.155
<v Speaker 0>So we can run Terraform

00:13:07.355 --> 00:13:08.235
<v Speaker 0>output,

00:13:08.235 --> 00:13:09.595
<v Speaker 0>which will spit out

00:13:09.915 --> 00:13:10.715
<v Speaker 0>all that stuff.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.700
<v Speaker 0>But what we want to do is request

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.940
<v Speaker 0>a specific value,

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.460
<v Speaker 0>which is our heppo

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:22.060
<v Speaker 0>admin

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:23.820
<v Speaker 0>password

00:13:24.975 --> 00:13:25.615
<v Speaker 0>dot

00:13:27.135 --> 00:13:28.095
<v Speaker 0>value.

00:13:28.095 --> 00:13:30.175
<v Speaker 0>No. We can do that with JQ. That

00:13:30.175 --> 00:13:31.855
<v Speaker 0>pulls out a JSON blob.

00:13:32.975 --> 00:13:34.495
<v Speaker 0>This is then JQ

00:13:34.735 --> 00:13:37.695
<v Speaker 0>value and we wanna raw or put quotes

00:13:37.695 --> 00:13:38.175
<v Speaker 0>though.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.460
<v Speaker 0>Let's try again.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:45.580
<v Speaker 0>What does that give me? Oh, it just

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.260
<v Speaker 0>gives me a password. Never mind.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.180
<v Speaker 0>Let's copy this. And

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.340
<v Speaker 0>then we can come up here and

00:13:53.605 --> 00:13:55.605
<v Speaker 0>copy the hippo address.

00:14:08.325 --> 00:14:09.279
<v Speaker 0>So Please work.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.560
<v Speaker 0>Maybe it's not ready yet.

00:14:27.714 --> 00:14:30.115
<v Speaker 0>Alright. When in doubt, we do debugging. So

00:14:30.115 --> 00:14:31.955
<v Speaker 0>the other thing that we have access to

00:14:32.035 --> 00:14:33.875
<v Speaker 0>is the SSH private key.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:36.570
<v Speaker 0>So let's do Terraform,

00:14:38.089 --> 00:14:40.410
<v Speaker 0>I put private key

00:14:41.209 --> 00:14:43.130
<v Speaker 0>and write this to prev

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:44.410
<v Speaker 0>and then we open prev.

00:14:48.265 --> 00:14:50.345
<v Speaker 0>Make sure we only have the private key.

00:14:50.985 --> 00:14:52.265
<v Speaker 0>Change the permissions

00:14:52.505 --> 00:14:53.865
<v Speaker 0>on it to be four hundred.

00:14:55.225 --> 00:14:56.905
<v Speaker 0>And then we want to get to the

00:14:56.905 --> 00:14:58.665
<v Speaker 0>IP address of the machine. And then the

00:14:58.665 --> 00:15:01.305
<v Speaker 0>fastest way to get that is probably

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:04.170
<v Speaker 0>go to here and see manage servers. This

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:05.690
<v Speaker 0>is the IP address for the machine and

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:07.210
<v Speaker 0>not the BGP address.

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:10.570
<v Speaker 0>And we can connect to the instance assuming

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:12.010
<v Speaker 0>well,

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:13.450
<v Speaker 0>all good.

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:15.610
<v Speaker 0>And then tail

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:16.810
<v Speaker 0>bar log

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:17.610
<v Speaker 0>clouds

00:15:18.355 --> 00:15:19.475
<v Speaker 0>and output.

00:15:24.435 --> 00:15:26.195
<v Speaker 0>So you can see it's looping

00:15:26.514 --> 00:15:28.834
<v Speaker 0>because it's not got the BGP information.

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:40.070
<v Speaker 0>And I don't know why.

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:45.750
<v Speaker 0>Let's take a look at our host.

00:15:46.395 --> 00:15:47.915
<v Speaker 0>Go to BGP.

00:15:50.635 --> 00:15:52.075
<v Speaker 0>Actually looks good.

00:15:56.955 --> 00:15:58.635
<v Speaker 0>Let's run this manually and see what the

00:15:58.635 --> 00:15:59.195
<v Speaker 0>problem is.

00:16:20.365 --> 00:16:21.084
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:16:21.245 --> 00:16:21.964
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

00:16:38.785 --> 00:16:39.345
<v Speaker 0>Interesting.

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.920
<v Speaker 0>This resource here is our BGP session

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.360
<v Speaker 0>for the machine.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.560
<v Speaker 0>And I'm going to assume that maybe it

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.240
<v Speaker 0>wasn't added, although it does appear to be

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:02.480
<v Speaker 0>added.

00:17:13.815 --> 00:17:15.335
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I think that's it because I have

00:17:15.335 --> 00:17:16.934
<v Speaker 0>everything in such a weird state.

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:24.319
<v Speaker 0>Damn myself.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.280
<v Speaker 0>When in doubt,

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.920
<v Speaker 0>we're on a terraform destroyer.

00:17:38.585 --> 00:17:40.345
<v Speaker 0>And a tear form

00:17:41.145 --> 00:17:41.784
<v Speaker 0>apply.

00:17:43.065 --> 00:17:44.505
<v Speaker 0>That does mean that we will have to

00:17:44.505 --> 00:17:46.345
<v Speaker 0>wait approximately a minute and half to two

00:17:46.345 --> 00:17:47.945
<v Speaker 0>minutes for this machine to come up.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:51.360
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no.

00:18:10.934 --> 00:18:12.695
<v Speaker 0>What have I broken now?

00:18:14.054 --> 00:18:16.375
<v Speaker 0>I really hate having the debug stuff live.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.680
<v Speaker 0>I think my project's not found.

00:18:39.955 --> 00:18:41.554
<v Speaker 0>Oh, wait. What's this?

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:49.730
<v Speaker 0>Schedule maintenance. Yeah. That's not gonna bother me.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:50.289
<v Speaker 0>Right?

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:56.289
<v Speaker 0>Well, my project ID ends on 132.

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:58.050
<v Speaker 0>Oh, this is not the project it's using.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.340
<v Speaker 0>What was I pasting?

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:19.100
<v Speaker 0>I have no idea.

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.380
<v Speaker 0>It's always me though, isn't it? Alright, so

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.740
<v Speaker 0>that's just gonna take a minute or two

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:23.980
<v Speaker 0>now.

00:19:26.075 --> 00:19:27.355
<v Speaker 0>And what I'll do is as soon as

00:19:27.355 --> 00:19:28.714
<v Speaker 0>this is spun up,

00:19:30.154 --> 00:19:31.674
<v Speaker 0>as we'll just go straight into that HEPL

00:19:31.674 --> 00:19:32.394
<v Speaker 0>UI,

00:19:33.115 --> 00:19:35.674
<v Speaker 0>deploy our spin application, and then we'll quickly

00:19:35.674 --> 00:19:37.674
<v Speaker 0>add that second one to the Amsterdam region

00:19:37.674 --> 00:19:40.609
<v Speaker 0>where we'll see the latency drop by

00:19:41.169 --> 00:19:43.250
<v Speaker 0>hopefully around three hundred milliseconds.

00:19:59.495 --> 00:20:00.534
<v Speaker 0>Good evening.

00:20:02.375 --> 00:20:03.495
<v Speaker 0>Welcome to the stream.

00:20:07.539 --> 00:20:09.139
<v Speaker 0>So we can see the failed provisioner is

00:20:09.139 --> 00:20:11.459
<v Speaker 0>now running. This is the one that puts

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:12.580
<v Speaker 0>Fermion

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.740
<v Speaker 0>installer no more jobs on to the machine.

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:16.019
<v Speaker 0>All that fun stuff.

00:20:17.539 --> 00:20:19.539
<v Speaker 0>Let's grab

00:20:22.315 --> 00:20:24.075
<v Speaker 0>IP address here

00:20:26.635 --> 00:20:27.674
<v Speaker 0>BSSH.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.399
<v Speaker 0>And we'll tail

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.679
<v Speaker 0>a cloud and an output

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.040
<v Speaker 0>where we can see currently it's on the

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.640
<v Speaker 0>g q install step,

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.640
<v Speaker 0>which is good.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.960
<v Speaker 0>It's now trying to get the metadata. It's

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.960
<v Speaker 0>already got it and now it's proceeding to

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.080
<v Speaker 0>provision correctly.

00:20:52.424 --> 00:20:53.544
<v Speaker 0>No rustle.

00:20:59.225 --> 00:20:59.945
<v Speaker 0>No

00:21:00.265 --> 00:21:02.024
<v Speaker 0>worry rules. Hopefully, no more breaks.

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:05.070
<v Speaker 0>So recovering from the COVID.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:07.390
<v Speaker 0>Be nice. Be gentle.

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:12.830
<v Speaker 0>Happy testing negative for four days. That's Friday.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:13.710
<v Speaker 0>Three days.

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:16.110
<v Speaker 0>I'm still tired.

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.990
<v Speaker 0>I'm very tired.

00:21:19.835 --> 00:21:22.235
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We're almost there. Now it's all a

00:21:22.235 --> 00:21:22.954
<v Speaker 0>nomad

00:21:23.754 --> 00:21:24.714
<v Speaker 0>console

00:21:24.715 --> 00:21:25.674
<v Speaker 0>vault.

00:21:25.754 --> 00:21:27.754
<v Speaker 0>These are all the components used to give

00:21:27.754 --> 00:21:29.434
<v Speaker 0>us a fair mail platform.

00:21:30.075 --> 00:21:30.875
<v Speaker 0>Bundle,

00:21:30.875 --> 00:21:33.115
<v Speaker 0>which is where it distributes and shares or

00:21:33.115 --> 00:21:33.995
<v Speaker 0>spin applications.

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:37.730
<v Speaker 0>Hepoo which is the kind of orchestrator component.

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:44.290
<v Speaker 0>Nomad which runs all of our jobs.

00:21:47.595 --> 00:21:49.755
<v Speaker 0>Sweet. This is looking pretty good. So I'm

00:21:49.755 --> 00:21:52.155
<v Speaker 0>gonna pop back off and we're gonna do

00:21:52.155 --> 00:21:53.995
<v Speaker 0>a terraform output.

00:21:54.635 --> 00:21:56.875
<v Speaker 0>We want the hippo admin password.

00:21:57.915 --> 00:22:00.395
<v Speaker 0>We also want

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.519
<v Speaker 0>the URL,

00:22:02.679 --> 00:22:03.480
<v Speaker 0>which is here.

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:30.110
<v Speaker 0>So

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:32.110
<v Speaker 0>I wish the Terraformer could go to the

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:33.549
<v Speaker 0>BGP one, but I want you to bypass

00:22:33.549 --> 00:22:35.150
<v Speaker 0>it and just go directly to this machine

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:37.230
<v Speaker 0>because Bert may still be advertiser may not

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:39.390
<v Speaker 0>have actually advertised the address yet. But you

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:41.389
<v Speaker 0>can see that we did get the thing.

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:43.710
<v Speaker 0>So now we can grab the password

00:22:44.765 --> 00:22:46.764
<v Speaker 0>and we can do admin

00:22:47.644 --> 00:22:48.445
<v Speaker 0>password.

00:22:48.924 --> 00:22:51.885
<v Speaker 0>Perfect. Now we have a platform where we

00:22:51.885 --> 00:22:53.404
<v Speaker 0>could deploy an application,

00:22:53.885 --> 00:22:55.164
<v Speaker 0>but we're not gonna do it this way.

00:22:55.164 --> 00:22:56.365
<v Speaker 0>We'll do it from the CLI.

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:00.580
<v Speaker 0>So we need a new tab

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:05.220
<v Speaker 0>I'll approve this.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.660
<v Speaker 0>And we need

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:11.940
<v Speaker 0>a spin application.

00:23:25.174 --> 00:23:26.774
<v Speaker 0>Where did I put my spin application?

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:39.269
<v Speaker 0>This is what happens when you disappear.

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:40.070
<v Speaker 0>Listen demo.

00:23:41.395 --> 00:23:42.434
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:23:43.315 --> 00:23:44.675
<v Speaker 0>So now we can do a spin log

00:23:44.675 --> 00:23:46.595
<v Speaker 0>in and we provide a URL,

00:23:47.555 --> 00:23:49.235
<v Speaker 0>which is HTTPS,

00:23:49.715 --> 00:23:50.914
<v Speaker 0>hippo.

00:23:51.875 --> 00:23:52.755
<v Speaker 0>Password.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:59.210
<v Speaker 0>Let's copy this.

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:04.090
<v Speaker 0>Like so.

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:07.210
<v Speaker 0>Then to log and suspend application,

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:11.450
<v Speaker 0>Russell's like, woah, ASP dot NET Core.

00:24:12.245 --> 00:24:14.005
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Hippo is a

00:24:15.125 --> 00:24:18.005
<v Speaker 0>days lab project, which I believe is mostly

00:24:18.085 --> 00:24:18.885
<v Speaker 0>dot net.

00:24:20.085 --> 00:24:21.285
<v Speaker 0>So we're not gonna send them a gap

00:24:21.285 --> 00:24:22.965
<v Speaker 0>because we haven't configured it as to do

00:24:22.965 --> 00:24:25.080
<v Speaker 0>any gap application

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.920
<v Speaker 0>client nonsense. We're going to use a new

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:30.039
<v Speaker 0>password for we see the heppool username admin.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.120
<v Speaker 0>The password is that one that I've now

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.920
<v Speaker 0>lost all access to. So let's scroll back

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:35.160
<v Speaker 0>up.

00:24:37.765 --> 00:24:38.885
<v Speaker 0>Like, so

00:24:40.245 --> 00:24:41.924
<v Speaker 0>the bundle URL

00:24:42.085 --> 00:24:43.765
<v Speaker 0>is the same IP address that we use

00:24:43.765 --> 00:24:46.005
<v Speaker 0>for the hyper URL, but with bundle start.

00:24:46.005 --> 00:24:52.840
<v Speaker 0>So that's 1477535151

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.760
<v Speaker 0>and it does need v one on the

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:55.320
<v Speaker 0>end.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.320
<v Speaker 0>And there's no authentication

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.440
<v Speaker 0>and now we're logged in to our bare

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.719
<v Speaker 0>main platform.

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.279
<v Speaker 0>In fact, you can just spend deploy.

00:25:18.365 --> 00:25:18.684
<v Speaker 0>Why?

00:25:24.059 --> 00:25:25.419
<v Speaker 0>Not trusted.

00:25:28.059 --> 00:25:29.100
<v Speaker 0>Can I skip that?

00:25:45.535 --> 00:25:47.295
<v Speaker 0>Oh, wait. Why is that HTTP?

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:52.590
<v Speaker 0>Try again.

00:26:03.975 --> 00:26:05.735
<v Speaker 0>I wonder if it's supposed to be HTTP

00:26:05.735 --> 00:26:08.295
<v Speaker 0>and I've got myself into some weird mesh

00:26:08.295 --> 00:26:09.255
<v Speaker 0>mesh mode.

00:26:13.095 --> 00:26:14.455
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So it's bit not.

00:26:15.415 --> 00:26:17.335
<v Speaker 0>I'm just going to buy by it, bypass

00:26:17.335 --> 00:26:17.575
<v Speaker 0>it.

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.080
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. Because why would it be HTTPS

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.920
<v Speaker 0>because I'm using a slip. We're not using

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.120
<v Speaker 0>a real domain name.

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.120
<v Speaker 0>Alright. It should

00:26:27.679 --> 00:26:28.559
<v Speaker 0>endo

00:26:28.559 --> 00:26:30.000
<v Speaker 0>one four seven

00:26:31.035 --> 00:26:33.355
<v Speaker 0>five. Should really just be copying this from

00:26:33.355 --> 00:26:35.595
<v Speaker 0>now on, but hopefully it's the last time.

00:26:37.195 --> 00:26:38.155
<v Speaker 0>Spin,

00:26:38.155 --> 00:26:38.555
<v Speaker 0>play.

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:47.860
<v Speaker 0>What did I get wrong?

00:27:02.835 --> 00:27:04.994
<v Speaker 0>Let's see what happens if we curl this.

00:27:11.235 --> 00:27:12.034
<v Speaker 0>404.

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.919
<v Speaker 0>That happens if our patch doesn't work.

00:27:32.725 --> 00:27:33.445
<v Speaker 0>I

00:27:33.765 --> 00:27:34.565
<v Speaker 0>am

00:27:38.245 --> 00:27:40.085
<v Speaker 0>never going to do a demo after being

00:27:40.085 --> 00:27:40.405
<v Speaker 0>elegant.

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:43.950
<v Speaker 0>Let's jump onto this machine.

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:45.950
<v Speaker 0>We can run nomad status.

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:48.110
<v Speaker 0>Bundle is running.

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:50.190
<v Speaker 0>We'll check our logs to see if there

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:50.990
<v Speaker 0>were any errors.

00:28:00.415 --> 00:28:01.855
<v Speaker 0>Oh, it looks perfect.

00:28:02.415 --> 00:28:03.695
<v Speaker 0>We can even

00:28:05.535 --> 00:28:08.095
<v Speaker 0>use this

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:11.009
<v Speaker 0>to see console.

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:12.690
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Bundle's running.

00:28:26.975 --> 00:28:29.455
<v Speaker 0>But it's not got both the hosts.

00:28:29.455 --> 00:28:31.054
<v Speaker 0>So

00:28:32.015 --> 00:28:33.135
<v Speaker 0>our patch job.

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:42.450
<v Speaker 0>So if you've ever seen dot reg dot

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:44.690
<v Speaker 0>reject fails before, this is what happens when

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:46.049
<v Speaker 0>a patch doesn't work.

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:50.130
<v Speaker 0>So we're gonna do it normally. We're gonna

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:50.850
<v Speaker 0>do it manually.

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:52.850
<v Speaker 0>Manually, normally. Yeah.

00:28:57.445 --> 00:28:59.125
<v Speaker 0>And why it didn't work? I have no

00:28:59.125 --> 00:29:01.285
<v Speaker 0>idea. I'm gonna fix that later.

00:29:03.845 --> 00:29:06.165
<v Speaker 0>Let's just copy it from here.

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:16.860
<v Speaker 0>Get rid of you.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.179
<v Speaker 0>And we don't need to double

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:23.740
<v Speaker 0>dollar sign. That's just to get past the

00:29:22.755 --> 00:29:24.674
<v Speaker 0>terraform interpolation.

00:29:27.555 --> 00:29:29.075
<v Speaker 0>But that looks good now.

00:29:29.395 --> 00:29:31.315
<v Speaker 0>And the last thing we need to do

00:29:31.315 --> 00:29:33.155
<v Speaker 0>comes from

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:43.100
<v Speaker 0>comes from the Fermion installer where we have

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.940
<v Speaker 0>to actually tell it to run the job.

00:29:45.419 --> 00:29:46.860
<v Speaker 0>And in order for this, this is all

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:48.620
<v Speaker 0>getting very complicated now and you shouldn't have

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.380
<v Speaker 0>to worry about this. But I feel like

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.260
<v Speaker 0>I'm committed now.

00:29:52.915 --> 00:29:54.355
<v Speaker 0>If we go to var

00:29:56.275 --> 00:29:58.674
<v Speaker 0>var log cloud and output,

00:30:00.595 --> 00:30:01.794
<v Speaker 0>scroll to the bottom.

00:30:02.275 --> 00:30:03.794
<v Speaker 0>We need to copy this,

00:30:04.675 --> 00:30:06.115
<v Speaker 0>export them to the environment,

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:08.820
<v Speaker 0>goes to the Fermion installer,

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:17.539
<v Speaker 0>grab the share Terraform

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:19.540
<v Speaker 0>VM assets,

00:30:20.425 --> 00:30:22.665
<v Speaker 0>run servers and then here there's a nomad

00:30:22.665 --> 00:30:23.385
<v Speaker 0>command

00:30:24.265 --> 00:30:25.865
<v Speaker 0>to run bundle.

00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:27.625
<v Speaker 0>Like so.

00:30:29.865 --> 00:30:31.225
<v Speaker 0>So we need to run this to tell

00:30:31.225 --> 00:30:32.665
<v Speaker 0>to recreate the bundle job.

00:30:34.009 --> 00:30:36.090
<v Speaker 0>And I'm in the job directory. So let's

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:37.209
<v Speaker 0>just pop up.

00:30:40.809 --> 00:30:42.729
<v Speaker 0>Oh, it's looking for that list encrypt.

00:30:42.889 --> 00:30:44.409
<v Speaker 0>We can just set that to false.

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:04.210
<v Speaker 0>Now restarting our bundle job,

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:05.330
<v Speaker 0>which is done.

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:07.249
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:31:08.049 --> 00:31:09.729
<v Speaker 0>Thank you for bearing with me.

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:12.529
<v Speaker 0>My curl command is on this tab.

00:31:14.175 --> 00:31:15.055
<v Speaker 0>And now

00:31:15.375 --> 00:31:16.895
<v Speaker 0>we get a four zero four.

00:31:26.095 --> 00:31:27.295
<v Speaker 0>So that was gonna be it.

00:31:47.795 --> 00:31:48.675
<v Speaker 0>Let's find.

00:31:50.915 --> 00:31:54.035
<v Speaker 0>Let's Let's see what we see

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:58.299
<v Speaker 0>and our services because we wanna see

00:31:58.940 --> 00:31:59.580
<v Speaker 0>yeah.

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:03.900
<v Speaker 0>So anything on bendle.

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:06.620
<v Speaker 0>Should resolve to the bendle server.

00:32:10.815 --> 00:32:12.495
<v Speaker 0>Maybe that 404 and the v one is

00:32:12.495 --> 00:32:14.815
<v Speaker 0>fine. Maybe this Maybe that's a prefix.

00:32:15.055 --> 00:32:16.414
<v Speaker 0>Not entirely sure.

00:32:18.415 --> 00:32:19.455
<v Speaker 0>Let's just be bold.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:34.399
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Russell only one of the patches failed.

00:32:34.399 --> 00:32:37.120
<v Speaker 0>So Russell was asking there's two changes.

00:32:38.455 --> 00:32:40.135
<v Speaker 0>Your setup script, you only made one in

00:32:40.135 --> 00:32:41.175
<v Speaker 0>the thing

00:32:41.415 --> 00:32:42.615
<v Speaker 0>on the terminal.

00:32:43.415 --> 00:32:45.095
<v Speaker 0>And because it was only a thought a

00:32:45.095 --> 00:32:47.255
<v Speaker 0>wrench and dot rejection for the bundle patch.

00:32:47.335 --> 00:32:49.655
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure why this failed

00:32:49.735 --> 00:32:50.935
<v Speaker 0>to patch.

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:56.690
<v Speaker 0>Normally happens if you get spaces and tabs

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:59.570
<v Speaker 0>wrong, but all these dots here to suggest

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:01.409
<v Speaker 0>I'm using spaces which is fine.

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:03.970
<v Speaker 0>I will fix that.

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:06.929
<v Speaker 0>Something silly but I only had to apply

00:33:06.929 --> 00:33:08.530
<v Speaker 0>the one. But as you can see now,

00:33:09.295 --> 00:33:10.495
<v Speaker 0>it did deploy.

00:33:12.495 --> 00:33:14.015
<v Speaker 0>We can call our application and we get

00:33:14.015 --> 00:33:15.855
<v Speaker 0>hello fermion. This is good.

00:33:16.895 --> 00:33:18.095
<v Speaker 0>We could

00:33:19.535 --> 00:33:21.135
<v Speaker 0>benchmark this if we want.

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:25.740
<v Speaker 0>I don't have drill installed.

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:29.660
<v Speaker 0>Doesn't matter.

00:33:36.115 --> 00:33:36.835
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:33:38.915 --> 00:33:40.434
<v Speaker 0>Throwing me for six.

00:33:40.515 --> 00:33:42.115
<v Speaker 0>If you refresh console,

00:33:43.075 --> 00:33:46.034
<v Speaker 0>let's use our application here, the random UUID.

00:33:46.435 --> 00:33:49.155
<v Speaker 0>If we pop this out, go to here,

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:52.890
<v Speaker 0>change the path so it's not apt new.

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:56.409
<v Speaker 0>We now have our demo application.

00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:58.490
<v Speaker 0>So we're now deploying to the fermion platform.

00:34:02.905 --> 00:34:04.904
<v Speaker 0>We could run an MTR.

00:34:05.545 --> 00:34:07.784
<v Speaker 0>Why have I not got any cool commands?

00:34:14.025 --> 00:34:15.705
<v Speaker 0>This is just also cool commands.

00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:20.630
<v Speaker 0>MTRs

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:23.589
<v Speaker 0>like a tracer drill is a HTTP benchmarking

00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:24.310
<v Speaker 0>tool.

00:34:27.989 --> 00:34:29.750
<v Speaker 0>We'll give them just a wee second.

00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:32.469
<v Speaker 0>So we can run drill

00:34:31.734 --> 00:34:33.175
<v Speaker 0>our IP address.

00:34:39.175 --> 00:34:41.335
<v Speaker 0>Maybe I was wrong. If you're on drill

00:34:41.335 --> 00:34:42.054
<v Speaker 0>again.

00:34:42.775 --> 00:34:44.135
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you need to fail, don't you?

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:52.600
<v Speaker 0>I've forgotten how to drill rust

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:54.199
<v Speaker 0>drill. It should be.

00:35:05.865 --> 00:35:07.545
<v Speaker 0>That's a bit more complicated than I was

00:35:07.545 --> 00:35:08.105
<v Speaker 0>hoping for.

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.460
<v Speaker 0>It should be a request latency.

00:35:15.619 --> 00:35:16.100
<v Speaker 0>Test

00:35:19.059 --> 00:35:19.700
<v Speaker 0>my

00:35:24.099 --> 00:35:25.300
<v Speaker 0>I don't test my latency.

00:35:33.355 --> 00:35:35.275
<v Speaker 0>I have forgotten how to computer.

00:35:36.795 --> 00:35:37.995
<v Speaker 0>This should be

00:35:38.795 --> 00:35:39.995
<v Speaker 0>latency test.

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:45.020
<v Speaker 0>Solar runs. I don't know if I trust

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:45.500
<v Speaker 0>you.

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:53.100
<v Speaker 0>I want to test my ping.

00:35:58.125 --> 00:35:59.645
<v Speaker 0>Oh, whatever.

00:35:59.645 --> 00:36:00.525
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

00:36:04.685 --> 00:36:06.285
<v Speaker 0>Russell, how would you test the speed of

00:36:06.285 --> 00:36:08.205
<v Speaker 0>an h two p request? Come on. Tell

00:36:08.205 --> 00:36:08.365
<v Speaker 0>me.

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:12.250
<v Speaker 0>HTTP

00:36:12.569 --> 00:36:13.290
<v Speaker 0>test

00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:14.970
<v Speaker 0>speed response.

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:16.650
<v Speaker 0>I mean, how hard can this be?

00:36:29.235 --> 00:36:32.355
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Test. Cool. Tested from Europe.

00:36:33.075 --> 00:36:34.275
<v Speaker 0>London's close enough.

00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:48.970
<v Speaker 0>Well, that does its thing. What is m

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:49.850
<v Speaker 0>t r,

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:51.690
<v Speaker 0>the BGP address?

00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:55.770
<v Speaker 0>So the BGP address is from our terraform

00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:56.330
<v Speaker 0>output.

00:37:02.465 --> 00:37:03.665
<v Speaker 0>This one here.

00:37:07.984 --> 00:37:09.425
<v Speaker 0>If I go ahead to MGR.

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:14.030
<v Speaker 0>No. MGR host name.

00:37:27.714 --> 00:37:29.875
<v Speaker 0>Oh, why am I gonna protocol on there?

00:37:34.355 --> 00:37:36.115
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I hit me again.

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.280
<v Speaker 0>MTR requires to do.

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:46.800
<v Speaker 0>Finally,

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.599
<v Speaker 0>I swear I'm good at this stuff. Let's

00:37:49.599 --> 00:37:50.559
<v Speaker 0>let them try running.

00:37:51.585 --> 00:37:54.065
<v Speaker 0>Because you hear the latency for our from

00:37:54.065 --> 00:37:55.745
<v Speaker 0>London to our application,

00:37:55.825 --> 00:37:58.065
<v Speaker 0>three hundred milliseconds. I'm gonna let the MTR

00:37:58.065 --> 00:38:00.785
<v Speaker 0>finish before I lose my mind.

00:38:01.025 --> 00:38:02.945
<v Speaker 0>We're going to add that second region

00:38:03.744 --> 00:38:04.705
<v Speaker 0>very, very quickly.

00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:08.850
<v Speaker 0>And I'll need the project ID.

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:17.010
<v Speaker 0>And yes.

00:38:20.615 --> 00:38:21.255
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:38:22.695 --> 00:38:24.935
<v Speaker 0>So we've seen the latency from London to

00:38:24.935 --> 00:38:28.215
<v Speaker 0>Dallas at three hundred milliseconds. Our MTR is

00:38:28.215 --> 00:38:29.335
<v Speaker 0>working on it.

00:38:31.095 --> 00:38:33.335
<v Speaker 0>We never actually tested the BGP route, did

00:38:33.335 --> 00:38:33.575
<v Speaker 0>we?

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:39.390
<v Speaker 0>Maybe this is going to go into the

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:40.270
<v Speaker 0>great unknown.

00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:45.470
<v Speaker 0>That if we copy

00:38:48.404 --> 00:38:49.204
<v Speaker 0>this.

00:38:51.525 --> 00:38:52.325
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:38:52.964 --> 00:38:53.685
<v Speaker 0>This

00:38:57.924 --> 00:38:58.645
<v Speaker 0>demo.

00:38:58.805 --> 00:38:59.924
<v Speaker 0>There's our application.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.520
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's the BGP one. Nice.

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:04.920
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:07.960
<v Speaker 0>So I don't know why the MTR is

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:09.320
<v Speaker 0>taking so long actually.

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.480
<v Speaker 0>Normally that'd be showing us the route.

00:39:19.125 --> 00:39:21.525
<v Speaker 0>Let register the IP address this time.

00:39:25.924 --> 00:39:27.684
<v Speaker 0>The reason it failed was I didn't do

00:39:27.684 --> 00:39:29.204
<v Speaker 0>it the first time. That's the other thing.

00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:33.250
<v Speaker 0>Now our second instance is now up, which

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:34.050
<v Speaker 0>is good.

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:37.650
<v Speaker 0>What we can do, which is the regional

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:40.050
<v Speaker 0>IP output here to go on to Amsterdam.

00:39:43.505 --> 00:39:46.225
<v Speaker 0>We can follow the progress of that deploy.

00:39:47.985 --> 00:39:49.425
<v Speaker 0>It's working on it.

00:39:49.665 --> 00:39:51.505
<v Speaker 0>MTR is working on it.

00:39:52.385 --> 00:39:53.905
<v Speaker 0>The Carl's fine.

00:39:54.865 --> 00:39:56.305
<v Speaker 0>Things are happening

00:39:56.385 --> 00:39:59.360
<v Speaker 0>not necessarily all going well. Let's see.

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:02.240
<v Speaker 0>So once the Nomad jobs for the Amsterdam

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.160
<v Speaker 0>One deployed, when I do a curl on

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.800
<v Speaker 0>an MTR, it should rip to the Amsterdam

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:08.800
<v Speaker 0>instance instead of the Dallas instance. We should

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.880
<v Speaker 0>see a latency, hopefully no more than about

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:12.000
<v Speaker 0>fifty milliseconds.

00:40:13.685 --> 00:40:15.045
<v Speaker 0>And this was supposed to be a twenty

00:40:15.045 --> 00:40:17.605
<v Speaker 0>minute stream and we're forty minutes in, but

00:40:17.605 --> 00:40:19.445
<v Speaker 0>you know sometimes shit happens.

00:40:20.885 --> 00:40:22.805
<v Speaker 0>As Russell knows all too well.

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:31.980
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Bundles on its way.

00:40:35.019 --> 00:40:35.900
<v Speaker 0>No HEPL.

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:37.420
<v Speaker 0>What's going over that MTR?

00:40:41.815 --> 00:40:43.655
<v Speaker 0>It's usually super quick.

00:40:51.255 --> 00:40:52.135
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:40:52.295 --> 00:40:53.255
<v Speaker 0>Almost there.

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:55.540
<v Speaker 0>Now I do need to log in and

00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:57.620
<v Speaker 0>deploy the application to this instance.

00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:00.740
<v Speaker 0>Now the BGP advertisement will be working.

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:02.980
<v Speaker 0>And so we probably see a photo for

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:04.900
<v Speaker 0>now if we were to curl.

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:05.859
<v Speaker 0>Nope.

00:41:07.745 --> 00:41:09.185
<v Speaker 0>So you can see here,

00:41:09.345 --> 00:41:11.345
<v Speaker 0>we got hold fermion and there we got

00:41:11.345 --> 00:41:13.105
<v Speaker 0>a four zero four. So you still have

00:41:13.105 --> 00:41:14.545
<v Speaker 0>to deploy your application

00:41:14.945 --> 00:41:16.225
<v Speaker 0>and that means you have to log in

00:41:16.225 --> 00:41:17.265
<v Speaker 0>to your application.

00:41:19.345 --> 00:41:20.785
<v Speaker 0>And for each instance,

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:23.840
<v Speaker 0>we can drop it first from terraform

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.200
<v Speaker 0>terraform.

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:27.440
<v Speaker 0>Output.

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.440
<v Speaker 0>We want that regional IP again

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.760
<v Speaker 0>where we can log in

00:41:35.905 --> 00:41:39.025
<v Speaker 0>.sslip.i0

00:41:39.744 --> 00:41:40.465
<v Speaker 0>to

00:41:40.625 --> 00:41:42.224
<v Speaker 0>admin. We need the password.

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:53.180
<v Speaker 0>No. Don't get the course this time.

00:41:55.099 --> 00:41:56.860
<v Speaker 0>We need the bundle URL.

00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:59.980
<v Speaker 0>14540.

00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:01.820
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:06.495
<v Speaker 0>754012SSlipIOB1.

00:42:13.935 --> 00:42:15.615
<v Speaker 0>I wonder where that's been login goes. Can

00:42:15.615 --> 00:42:16.255
<v Speaker 0>I change that?

00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:22.390
<v Speaker 0>No idea.

00:42:33.325 --> 00:42:35.725
<v Speaker 0>Like not to mess it up this time.

00:42:43.805 --> 00:42:44.605
<v Speaker 0>Bundle.

00:42:59.619 --> 00:43:01.859
<v Speaker 0>Empty hours gone. Don't know what's happening. Let's

00:43:01.859 --> 00:43:02.500
<v Speaker 0>get rid of it.

00:43:06.165 --> 00:43:08.645
<v Speaker 0>When that's deploy finishes, we'll do the Carl.

00:43:08.645 --> 00:43:10.325
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully it's not $4.00 4.

00:43:13.125 --> 00:43:15.365
<v Speaker 0>Although the bundle configuration is not gonna work

00:43:15.365 --> 00:43:16.645
<v Speaker 0>on this machine either, is it?

00:43:18.849 --> 00:43:21.090
<v Speaker 0>And I just use the BGP address.

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:32.050
<v Speaker 0>We'll get there.

00:43:35.275 --> 00:43:36.715
<v Speaker 0>Any minute now.

00:43:36.875 --> 00:43:37.515
<v Speaker 0>Two

00:43:37.755 --> 00:43:38.555
<v Speaker 0>admin

00:43:39.435 --> 00:43:40.315
<v Speaker 0>password.

00:43:43.275 --> 00:43:44.395
<v Speaker 0>Bindle,

00:43:44.955 --> 00:43:45.755
<v Speaker 0>not BGP.

00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:48.830
<v Speaker 0>We want this.

00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:53.870
<v Speaker 0>Course that doesn't work.

00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:59.470
<v Speaker 0>And I'm gonna type this and I'm gonna

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:01.070
<v Speaker 0>have to go into that patch again, aren't

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:02.750
<v Speaker 0>I? And it's gonna feel

00:44:03.895 --> 00:44:04.454
<v Speaker 0>five.

00:44:15.609 --> 00:44:17.130
<v Speaker 0>Resource not found.

00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:27.530
<v Speaker 0>Easy job.

00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:29.609
<v Speaker 0>We have a rejected fail.

00:44:30.734 --> 00:44:32.015
<v Speaker 0>End of up normad.

00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:47.150
<v Speaker 0>Copy.

00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:51.630
<v Speaker 0>Improve the extra

00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:53.790
<v Speaker 0>quote dollar thing.

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:54.830
<v Speaker 0>Words.

00:44:57.345 --> 00:45:00.385
<v Speaker 0>Cat bar log cloud in it.

00:45:01.665 --> 00:45:02.945
<v Speaker 0>Get all of this.

00:45:05.825 --> 00:45:06.785
<v Speaker 0>Go back to here.

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:13.380
<v Speaker 0>I closed it.

00:45:27.015 --> 00:45:27.734
<v Speaker 0>This one.

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:36.859
<v Speaker 0>Change the list of crypt to false.

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:39.420
<v Speaker 0>Course, that's not gonna work.

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:46.859
<v Speaker 0>Good to uninstall my computer. Just never fit

00:45:46.859 --> 00:45:48.220
<v Speaker 0>on it. I think it's time for it

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:48.700
<v Speaker 0>to go away.

00:45:50.915 --> 00:45:51.555
<v Speaker 0>So

00:45:53.875 --> 00:45:55.395
<v Speaker 0>this panel will work.

00:45:56.435 --> 00:45:58.115
<v Speaker 0>The job will be replaced.

00:45:59.315 --> 00:46:00.515
<v Speaker 0>It has been replaced.

00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:07.329
<v Speaker 0>Do a deploy.

00:46:13.809 --> 00:46:16.130
<v Speaker 0>Twenty minutes stream, my ass. Anyway.

00:46:25.235 --> 00:46:26.595
<v Speaker 0>Just sort of giggles

00:46:27.475 --> 00:46:28.915
<v Speaker 0>or on the pseudo mtr.

00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:39.490
<v Speaker 0>Don't know why those are

00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:41.570
<v Speaker 0>just therapeutic.

00:46:45.325 --> 00:46:47.484
<v Speaker 0>It's during that Carl command back.

00:46:49.484 --> 00:46:50.925
<v Speaker 0>And we get hello from you.

00:46:51.484 --> 00:46:53.964
<v Speaker 0>The MTR is probably not gonna ever work.

00:46:53.964 --> 00:46:55.644
<v Speaker 0>So we're gonna go back to this wonderful

00:46:55.644 --> 00:46:57.164
<v Speaker 0>random website that we found.

00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:00.970
<v Speaker 0>And I wonder if I can just refresh

00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:01.850
<v Speaker 0>the page.

00:47:02.569 --> 00:47:03.130
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:07.609
<v Speaker 0>Run now.

00:47:12.135 --> 00:47:13.655
<v Speaker 0>Now let's see if it's any faster.

00:47:40.234 --> 00:47:41.835
<v Speaker 0>Give it up an empty hour.

00:47:42.875 --> 00:47:44.795
<v Speaker 0>Well, this should not be a fast test,

00:47:44.795 --> 00:47:45.595
<v Speaker 0>a slow test.

00:48:02.535 --> 00:48:04.934
<v Speaker 0>So now it's a hundred milliseconds instead of

00:48:04.934 --> 00:48:06.934
<v Speaker 0>three hundred. I should expect it to be

00:48:06.934 --> 00:48:07.575
<v Speaker 0>faster,

00:48:07.734 --> 00:48:08.855
<v Speaker 0>but I

00:48:10.214 --> 00:48:12.775
<v Speaker 0>am not going to try and push

00:48:13.095 --> 00:48:16.454
<v Speaker 0>this hodgepodge of automation any further because clearly

00:48:16.454 --> 00:48:19.110
<v Speaker 0>the odds against anything working today.

00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:23.030
<v Speaker 0>So what is the take home from today's

00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.910
<v Speaker 0>session?

00:48:25.109 --> 00:48:26.310
<v Speaker 0>Things go wrong,

00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:27.190
<v Speaker 0>granted.

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:31.484
<v Speaker 0>Firming on platform is open source. Right? There's

00:48:31.484 --> 00:48:33.085
<v Speaker 0>nothing particularly special

00:48:33.085 --> 00:48:35.565
<v Speaker 0>about it. It uses Nomad,

00:48:35.565 --> 00:48:36.365
<v Speaker 0>Vault,

00:48:36.605 --> 00:48:37.645
<v Speaker 0>and Console

00:48:37.805 --> 00:48:40.765
<v Speaker 0>as your building blocks for a

00:48:40.765 --> 00:48:41.725
<v Speaker 0>distributed

00:48:41.964 --> 00:48:45.180
<v Speaker 0>orchestration system against multiple hosts. I took the

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:47.980
<v Speaker 0>easy approach today and deployed unique ones to

00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:50.380
<v Speaker 0>each metro. Of course, there are more advanced

00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:53.820
<v Speaker 0>architecture there. Right? Nomads can scale horizontally.

00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:55.500
<v Speaker 0>We could have used the same Nomad cluster

00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:58.220
<v Speaker 0>on multiple machines. However, that's a session for

00:48:58.220 --> 00:48:58.700
<v Speaker 0>another day.

00:48:59.435 --> 00:49:01.435
<v Speaker 0>Once we have that substrate to build our

00:49:01.435 --> 00:49:04.955
<v Speaker 0>platform, we're deploying Hippo and Bundle from data

00:49:04.955 --> 00:49:05.675
<v Speaker 0>slabs,

00:49:05.835 --> 00:49:08.715
<v Speaker 0>which allows us to run web assembly applications.

00:49:09.995 --> 00:49:11.835
<v Speaker 0>And we also get that nice Hippo UI

00:49:11.835 --> 00:49:13.275
<v Speaker 0>where you can see I could log in.

00:49:13.275 --> 00:49:14.870
<v Speaker 0>I could see my applications, it gave me

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:16.390
<v Speaker 0>the URL, it gave me the logs, it

00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:17.750
<v Speaker 0>gave me the environment details,

00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:19.750
<v Speaker 0>all the components that you've come to know

00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:21.270
<v Speaker 0>and love with Fermion Cloud.

00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:23.190
<v Speaker 0>But we ran it ourselves.

00:49:23.590 --> 00:49:25.510
<v Speaker 0>And using Equinix medal, we were able to

00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:27.590
<v Speaker 0>be able to distribute this geographically.

00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:28.950
<v Speaker 0>I only use two metros,

00:49:29.345 --> 00:49:31.904
<v Speaker 0>Dallas in The US and Amsterdam in Europe,

00:49:31.904 --> 00:49:33.265
<v Speaker 0>but you could do that to wherever your

00:49:33.265 --> 00:49:36.385
<v Speaker 0>customers are to deliver them via BGP written

00:49:36.385 --> 00:49:38.065
<v Speaker 0>low latency applications.

00:49:38.464 --> 00:49:40.944
<v Speaker 0>And that all coming together, I think is

00:49:40.944 --> 00:49:43.025
<v Speaker 0>really cool. Now clearly the automation needs a

00:49:43.025 --> 00:49:45.240
<v Speaker 0>little bit of work. I hope that by

00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:47.080
<v Speaker 0>me debugging this on the go.

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:50.040
<v Speaker 0>You cannot understand a little bit more about

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:51.880
<v Speaker 0>what was actually happening. But of course as

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.800
<v Speaker 0>always, if you have any questions or you

00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:56.600
<v Speaker 0>wanna do something slightly bespoke, just jump straight

00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:58.040
<v Speaker 0>into the comment section.

00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:00.360
<v Speaker 0>Ask away. I'll do my best to ask

00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:00.600
<v Speaker 0>this.

00:50:03.375 --> 00:50:05.295
<v Speaker 0>What's Russell's last comment before I sign off

00:50:05.295 --> 00:50:06.095
<v Speaker 0>for today?

00:50:06.655 --> 00:50:08.495
<v Speaker 0>If you make changes on the fly, does

00:50:08.495 --> 00:50:10.415
<v Speaker 0>it become get ignore ops?

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:15.830
<v Speaker 0>This is why I've been doing more pre

00:50:15.830 --> 00:50:19.190
<v Speaker 0>recorded video lately because then you never see

00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:20.230
<v Speaker 0>my mistakes,

00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:23.190
<v Speaker 0>but then it's nice to have fun and

00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:24.790
<v Speaker 0>say hello to y'all while I do this.

00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:26.885
<v Speaker 0>So go check out family on platform, Check

00:50:26.885 --> 00:50:28.484
<v Speaker 0>out the pull request if you wanna play

00:50:28.484 --> 00:50:30.645
<v Speaker 0>it with an equest metal. However, there are

00:50:30.724 --> 00:50:33.444
<v Speaker 0>there is TerraForm code to deploy to AWS,

00:50:33.444 --> 00:50:35.765
<v Speaker 0>GCP, SQL cloud, and many others. So go

00:50:35.765 --> 00:50:38.165
<v Speaker 0>check it out. Thank you all for joining

00:50:38.165 --> 00:50:40.005
<v Speaker 0>me today. Thank you for persisting with me

00:50:40.005 --> 00:50:41.950
<v Speaker 0>if you're still here, I'll see you all

00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:43.150
<v Speaker 0>on the next session.

00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:44.430
<v Speaker 0>Have a great day.
