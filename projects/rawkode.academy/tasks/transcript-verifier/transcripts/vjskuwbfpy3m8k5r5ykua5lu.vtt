00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.159
<v Speaker 0>Here's a really cool tip I found with

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.600
<v Speaker 0>Versus Code. Open your command palette, type issue,

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.640
<v Speaker 0>and say create.

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:08.880
<v Speaker 0>From here, you can see new

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.120
<v Speaker 0>issue. What's really cool about this is it

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.360
<v Speaker 0>can autocomplete your assignees

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.200
<v Speaker 0>and

00:00:15.684 --> 00:00:16.725
<v Speaker 0>your labels.

00:00:18.325 --> 00:00:19.205
<v Speaker 0>Lastly,

00:00:19.845 --> 00:00:21.445
<v Speaker 0>if you select some code,

00:00:22.244 --> 00:00:24.884
<v Speaker 0>you can say create an issue from selection

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:27.525
<v Speaker 0>and write new issue

00:00:27.605 --> 00:00:28.165
<v Speaker 0>like so.

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:30.739
<v Speaker 0>Then you copy the URL,

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:32.259
<v Speaker 0>jump to your browser,

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:33.539
<v Speaker 0>and voila.

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:34.899
<v Speaker 0>Thanks for your S code.
