00:01:34.785 --> 00:01:36.305
<v Speaker 0>Those downtime

00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:38.385
<v Speaker 0>worries goodbye, my friend.

00:01:39.825 --> 00:01:40.545
<v Speaker 0>Quality

00:01:40.705 --> 00:01:42.225
<v Speaker 0>and uptime,

00:01:42.225 --> 00:01:43.825
<v Speaker 0>the stacks will descend

00:01:45.025 --> 00:01:46.705
<v Speaker 0>with a platform

00:01:46.865 --> 00:01:48.625
<v Speaker 0>that

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:47.239
<v Speaker 1>Hello,

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.040
<v Speaker 1>and welcome back to the Rawkode Academy. I'm

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.480
<v Speaker 1>your host, David Flanagan,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.400
<v Speaker 1>also known across the Internet as Rawkode.

00:02:54.165 --> 00:02:56.405
<v Speaker 1>Today is another episode of Rawkode live, the

00:02:56.405 --> 00:02:58.484
<v Speaker 1>show where we get hands on keyboards and

00:02:58.484 --> 00:03:00.564
<v Speaker 1>take a live look at cloud native and

00:03:00.564 --> 00:03:02.325
<v Speaker 1>cloud native adjacent technologies.

00:03:02.644 --> 00:03:05.125
<v Speaker 1>And the title of today's episode is DevOps

00:03:05.125 --> 00:03:06.405
<v Speaker 1>on Autopilot,

00:03:06.405 --> 00:03:08.165
<v Speaker 1>which is a bold claim, so I'm very

00:03:08.165 --> 00:03:09.525
<v Speaker 1>excited to see Qovery

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.970
<v Speaker 1>and be joined by the CEO,

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.250
<v Speaker 1>Romeric.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.610
<v Speaker 1>Hey. How's it going?

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.370
<v Speaker 2>Hey. I'm good, David. Thanks for having me.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.450
<v Speaker 1>How are My pleasure. Thank you for joining

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.690
<v Speaker 1>me.

00:03:24.985 --> 00:03:27.225
<v Speaker 2>That's an amazing song like that you get,

00:03:27.225 --> 00:03:28.345
<v Speaker 2>like, for the intro.

00:03:28.825 --> 00:03:30.505
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy that you can do now with

00:03:30.505 --> 00:03:31.305
<v Speaker 3>Jet AI.

00:03:31.705 --> 00:03:34.425
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. I started doing that, I think, like,

00:03:34.425 --> 00:03:36.505
<v Speaker 1>four or five episodes ago. I mean, AI

00:03:36.505 --> 00:03:39.580
<v Speaker 1>tools are getting so good now and generating

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.100
<v Speaker 1>music is

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean, I I I generally enjoy them.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.900
<v Speaker 1>I I I think they're little catchy numbers.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean, they're not, you know, pushing the

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
<v Speaker 1>envelope or anything like that, but music doesn't

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.940
<v Speaker 1>always have to. So I think it's nice

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.540
<v Speaker 1>that we get a special little,

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.475
<v Speaker 1>you know, song to commemorate our time together

00:03:55.475 --> 00:03:58.355
<v Speaker 1>today. So That's amazing. That's amazing. Especially that

00:03:58.355 --> 00:04:00.435
<v Speaker 2>I was, like, doing actually, so it's completely

00:04:00.435 --> 00:04:02.675
<v Speaker 2>out of topic, but I did practice. I

00:04:02.675 --> 00:04:05.155
<v Speaker 2>did, like, some music, produce music, and you

00:04:05.155 --> 00:04:06.755
<v Speaker 2>know how much time it takes just to

00:04:06.755 --> 00:04:07.155
<v Speaker 2>get that.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.780
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy. Like, today, you can just, like,

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.620
<v Speaker 2>in a few clicks, few prompt,

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.940
<v Speaker 2>just get something that is ready to be

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:14.660
<v Speaker 2>uploaded.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.580
<v Speaker 2>Crazy. Yeah. One

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.899
<v Speaker 1>prompt that are rigos over and over again.

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:20.420
<v Speaker 1>I tweak it for each tool and and

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.500
<v Speaker 1>and each guest, and I'd like the music

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.355
<v Speaker 1>to be somewhat familiar. So it's all kind

00:04:24.355 --> 00:04:25.155
<v Speaker 1>of similar,

00:04:25.555 --> 00:04:28.035
<v Speaker 1>you know, mellow, electronic, chilled beat,

00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:30.035
<v Speaker 1>but it works really well. And, also, it's

00:04:30.035 --> 00:04:31.235
<v Speaker 1>really good at metal. I don't wanna, like,

00:04:31.235 --> 00:04:32.915
<v Speaker 1>just deviate right on the music path in

00:04:32.915 --> 00:04:35.155
<v Speaker 1>the AI chat already, but, yeah, you could

00:04:35.155 --> 00:04:36.755
<v Speaker 1>do some pretty powerful things with that. Anyway,

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:38.910
<v Speaker 1>people are here to learn about DevOps and

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.910
<v Speaker 1>Autopilot. They wanna learn about your tool, Qovery,

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.430
<v Speaker 1>and they wanna learn about you. So could

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.870
<v Speaker 1>you do us a favor and tell us

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.630
<v Speaker 1>the history and a little bit of flavor

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.590
<v Speaker 1>of Ruric?

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Absolutely.

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.550
<v Speaker 2>So just quickly introduce me introducing myself. So

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.685
<v Speaker 2>I'm Omar, IT, and cofounder of Qovery. I

00:04:53.685 --> 00:04:55.205
<v Speaker 2>used to be a software

00:04:55.365 --> 00:04:57.764
<v Speaker 2>engineer, DevOps engineer, like, for a long time.

00:04:57.764 --> 00:04:59.525
<v Speaker 2>Now I can

00:04:59.605 --> 00:05:01.764
<v Speaker 2>no longer say that because I've been doing

00:05:01.764 --> 00:05:03.205
<v Speaker 2>that, like, for years now.

00:05:03.604 --> 00:05:05.604
<v Speaker 2>I'm still practicing. I still have, like, some,

00:05:05.604 --> 00:05:08.005
<v Speaker 2>like, open source project that I'm just getting

00:05:08.005 --> 00:05:09.890
<v Speaker 2>my hand on. But, anyway

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.050
<v Speaker 2>so, yeah, basically, what we do at Qovery

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.810
<v Speaker 2>is that we we try just to make

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.130
<v Speaker 2>sure that developers are much more, like, autonomous

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.570
<v Speaker 2>in their day to day journey. You know,

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.210
<v Speaker 2>that they are not the most, like, proficient

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.410
<v Speaker 2>in infrastructure management, like, deploying the applications. All

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:23.890
<v Speaker 2>of that

00:05:24.505 --> 00:05:27.945
<v Speaker 2>is something still under by mostly DevOps engineers

00:05:27.945 --> 00:05:30.505
<v Speaker 2>or actually so or at least, like, people

00:05:30.505 --> 00:05:33.465
<v Speaker 2>that they are familiar with infrastructure. And what

00:05:33.465 --> 00:05:36.105
<v Speaker 2>we do provide is the platforms that helps,

00:05:36.105 --> 00:05:39.320
<v Speaker 2>like, any developer to deploy their application in

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.720
<v Speaker 2>their own cloud account. And that's something that

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.320
<v Speaker 2>is quite interesting because

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure you're familiar with Fly and,

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.600
<v Speaker 2>like, all the other paths, so platform as

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.200
<v Speaker 2>a service. And, actually, you can see Qovery

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.715
<v Speaker 2>as a platform as a service, but next

00:05:52.715 --> 00:05:54.155
<v Speaker 2>generations. Why?

00:05:54.315 --> 00:05:56.475
<v Speaker 2>Because, actually, you can run Qovery on your

00:05:56.475 --> 00:05:59.355
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure, and Qovery runs on top of Kubernetes.

00:06:00.074 --> 00:06:01.995
<v Speaker 2>And this is why it's quite interesting because

00:06:01.995 --> 00:06:04.235
<v Speaker 2>you get the benefits of those PaaS platform,

00:06:04.235 --> 00:06:07.030
<v Speaker 2>but on top of your infrastructure, basically. So

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.350
<v Speaker 2>in just a few minutes, you can start

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.230
<v Speaker 2>getting a fully state of the art infrastructure

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.030
<v Speaker 2>ready

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.670
<v Speaker 2>on your cloud account without any knowledge. So

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.270
<v Speaker 2>we have customer in five minutes. They can

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.910
<v Speaker 2>do that.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.790
<v Speaker 2>And then you can start deploying and shipping

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.595
<v Speaker 2>your your application. And we have really, like,

00:06:23.595 --> 00:06:25.435
<v Speaker 2>focused on the developer experience,

00:06:25.435 --> 00:06:27.115
<v Speaker 2>what makes, like, our platform

00:06:27.354 --> 00:06:29.754
<v Speaker 2>loved by our users. So, yeah, that's

00:06:30.315 --> 00:06:32.474
<v Speaker 2>we can dig into all of all of

00:06:32.474 --> 00:06:33.115
<v Speaker 2>that, obviously.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I mean, back in bold claims, which

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:37.610
<v Speaker 1>I love, you know, there's a lot of

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.570
<v Speaker 1>challenges in, you know, the DevOps space, the

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.970
<v Speaker 1>platform engineering space, all of this these days.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.130
<v Speaker 1>You know, come software architectures

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.330
<v Speaker 1>are getting more complicated and the with the

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.290
<v Speaker 1>aim of simplifying,

00:06:49.745 --> 00:06:50.865
<v Speaker 1>know, developers'

00:06:50.865 --> 00:06:52.545
<v Speaker 1>time, like work on microservices.

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:55.105
<v Speaker 1>But all that complexity doesn't just disappear. It's

00:06:55.105 --> 00:06:57.425
<v Speaker 1>getting pushed down that stack to the platform,

00:06:57.425 --> 00:06:59.665
<v Speaker 1>the Kubernetes, the cloud providers, etcetera.

00:06:59.985 --> 00:07:01.985
<v Speaker 1>And then there's there's just a lot of

00:07:01.985 --> 00:07:04.450
<v Speaker 1>tooling needed in a space that people can

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.050
<v Speaker 1>still go to sleep at night and not

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.490
<v Speaker 1>have to worry about the pager going off

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.090
<v Speaker 1>and a whole bunch of other things. And

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.010
<v Speaker 1>I feel like we're pushing a lot of

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.730
<v Speaker 1>this away from developers too and fragmenting

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:15.330
<v Speaker 1>things. You know, the dev ops teams, the

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.650
<v Speaker 1>platform teams are taking on all these responsibilities,

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.730
<v Speaker 1>but there's not always that collaboration that dev

00:07:20.185 --> 00:07:22.105
<v Speaker 1>encourages us or wants us to kind of

00:07:22.105 --> 00:07:25.545
<v Speaker 1>achieve. So yeah. It's interesting times these days

00:07:25.545 --> 00:07:26.185
<v Speaker 1>for sure.

00:07:26.585 --> 00:07:29.465
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Absolutely. And, actually, that's quite interesting what

00:07:29.465 --> 00:07:31.225
<v Speaker 2>you're saying because we are seeing also, like,

00:07:31.225 --> 00:07:32.425
<v Speaker 2>when we started the company,

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.889
<v Speaker 2>even Kubernetes were were not, like, the standard.

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:37.410
<v Speaker 2>Like, if we were looking if we are

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.410
<v Speaker 2>looking, like, four years back, like, only

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:42.210
<v Speaker 2>companies that they were, like, quite a bleeding

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:45.010
<v Speaker 2>edge were, like, considering and starting using Kubernetes

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.010
<v Speaker 2>for real in productions, and now you have

00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:49.305
<v Speaker 2>So now it's the it's the standard, like,

00:07:49.305 --> 00:07:51.625
<v Speaker 2>the operating system of the cloud. But what

00:07:51.625 --> 00:07:53.465
<v Speaker 2>we are seeing now is also, like, even

00:07:53.465 --> 00:07:55.544
<v Speaker 2>DevOps engineers that they are proficient

00:07:55.784 --> 00:07:58.664
<v Speaker 2>in Kubernetes that they are looking to solutions

00:07:58.664 --> 00:08:01.770
<v Speaker 2>just, for the data operations, obviously, but also

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:04.090
<v Speaker 2>to bring, like, a better experience, like, to

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:06.730
<v Speaker 2>the end user because it's quite whole, like,

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.410
<v Speaker 2>doing cube control,

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:09.530
<v Speaker 2>comments.

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:11.050
<v Speaker 2>We have done all that.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.090
<v Speaker 2>That's that's pretty good. But in terms of

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:16.810
<v Speaker 2>experience, especially for developers, it's not. So

00:08:18.065 --> 00:08:18.785
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:08:19.185 --> 00:08:20.145
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.305
<v Speaker 1>Hi, Ravi. Thank you for joining us and

00:08:22.305 --> 00:08:23.905
<v Speaker 1>saying hello in the chat. Feel free, anyone

00:08:23.905 --> 00:08:25.265
<v Speaker 1>else watching, to say hello and let us

00:08:25.265 --> 00:08:26.145
<v Speaker 1>know where you're from.

00:08:26.785 --> 00:08:27.505
<v Speaker 1>Rawkode,

00:08:28.225 --> 00:08:28.705
<v Speaker 1>before we

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.680
<v Speaker 1>talk about the problems that Qovery solves and

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.960
<v Speaker 1>get hands on with it and show people

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.400
<v Speaker 1>how to get started, maybe you could give

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.240
<v Speaker 1>us a better information on the the origin

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.080
<v Speaker 1>story. Like, did you just wake up one

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.159
<v Speaker 1>day and go and go to fix DevOps,

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:42.755
<v Speaker 1>or were you did you have challenges within

00:08:42.755 --> 00:08:44.514
<v Speaker 1>your own career or your own job? Like,

00:08:44.514 --> 00:08:46.035
<v Speaker 1>I mean, how did you go? Yeah.

00:08:46.834 --> 00:08:48.834
<v Speaker 2>I do think it's a classic story.

00:08:50.915 --> 00:08:52.755
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I used to start when I start

00:08:52.755 --> 00:08:54.595
<v Speaker 2>working, and this is where I met my

00:08:54.595 --> 00:08:57.180
<v Speaker 2>cofounder actually, like, in the HFT, so high

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.300
<v Speaker 2>frequency trading. We were, like, managing thousands of

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.820
<v Speaker 2>servers, like, globally.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.220
<v Speaker 2>We have a very small team, so quite

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.940
<v Speaker 2>proficient in infrastructure management. I used to work

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.060
<v Speaker 2>with VMware system, Solaris. So you remember at

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.695
<v Speaker 2>the time? So before that, the cloud was

00:09:12.695 --> 00:09:13.415
<v Speaker 2>something.

00:09:13.735 --> 00:09:15.735
<v Speaker 2>And then I transitioned,

00:09:15.735 --> 00:09:18.295
<v Speaker 2>actually, is, like, from the infrastructure side to

00:09:18.295 --> 00:09:19.895
<v Speaker 2>software engineering side.

00:09:20.215 --> 00:09:22.455
<v Speaker 2>And I was in the position that, okay.

00:09:22.455 --> 00:09:24.295
<v Speaker 2>Now I was no longer, like, the ones

00:09:24.295 --> 00:09:26.610
<v Speaker 2>that were, like, dealing with tickets coming from

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:28.770
<v Speaker 2>the software engineering department

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:31.570
<v Speaker 2>and provisioning, like, infrastructure, but I was the

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:34.290
<v Speaker 2>one that were claiming for, like, that infrastructure

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:36.530
<v Speaker 2>because I needed just to run my software

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:37.570
<v Speaker 2>to deploy

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:39.810
<v Speaker 2>live, obviously, in productions,

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.730
<v Speaker 2>iterate, like, in the development

00:09:42.105 --> 00:09:43.625
<v Speaker 2>servers and so on and so forth. And

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:45.225
<v Speaker 2>this is where, like, I just realized that

00:09:45.225 --> 00:09:47.625
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy. Like, the experience and when you're

00:09:47.625 --> 00:09:49.145
<v Speaker 2>a developer, it's very

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:51.865
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of broken, like, kind of broken.

00:09:51.865 --> 00:09:53.945
<v Speaker 2>So I used to move, like, from one

00:09:53.945 --> 00:09:55.145
<v Speaker 2>company to another,

00:09:55.625 --> 00:09:58.400
<v Speaker 2>like and instead of doing, like, the same

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.720
<v Speaker 2>thing, which was, like, at some points, building

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.120
<v Speaker 2>a platform internally, like, into the company that

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.120
<v Speaker 2>I was working for,

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.520
<v Speaker 2>I decided just to say, okay. Instead of,

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.920
<v Speaker 2>like, working for the next successful companies,

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.160
<v Speaker 2>like, that they they they would hire us

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.375
<v Speaker 2>and ask us just to build up, like,

00:10:14.375 --> 00:10:16.615
<v Speaker 2>a platform. Okay. Let's build up a product.

00:10:16.855 --> 00:10:18.455
<v Speaker 2>Let's deliver that for you to all the

00:10:18.455 --> 00:10:20.375
<v Speaker 2>companies that would hire us, and that's the

00:10:20.375 --> 00:10:22.455
<v Speaker 2>way we started just basic recovery.

00:10:22.774 --> 00:10:25.175
<v Speaker 2>That's that's very, like, very classic. You were

00:10:25.175 --> 00:10:27.334
<v Speaker 2>doing that before. You have done that, like,

00:10:27.334 --> 00:10:29.930
<v Speaker 2>four years. Now you have the experience, then,

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:32.089
<v Speaker 2>okay, let's speed up a product. But it's

00:10:32.089 --> 00:10:34.090
<v Speaker 2>quite challenging because I'm technical,

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.010
<v Speaker 2>and now I'm much more, like, in position

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.490
<v Speaker 2>where I'm I'm a salesman. I'm spending all

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:40.730
<v Speaker 2>my day just, like, selling the software, talking

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:41.690
<v Speaker 2>to engineer,

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:42.170
<v Speaker 2>to

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:44.485
<v Speaker 2>CTO,

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:45.685
<v Speaker 2>like VPs,

00:10:46.005 --> 00:10:48.885
<v Speaker 2>and it's quite interesting, like, the two aspect.

00:10:48.885 --> 00:10:51.045
<v Speaker 2>But, anyway, it's completely something

00:10:51.045 --> 00:10:51.685
<v Speaker 2>else.

00:10:52.885 --> 00:10:53.605
<v Speaker 2>Nice.

00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:56.644
<v Speaker 1>What would be you know, if if people

00:10:56.644 --> 00:10:57.445
<v Speaker 1>watch us,

00:10:57.764 --> 00:10:58.725
<v Speaker 1>what's the

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.150
<v Speaker 1>the one use case right off the bat

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.310
<v Speaker 1>that anyone's setting right now is struggling trying

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:06.750
<v Speaker 1>to wrangle platforms, DevOps, Kubernetes clusters? Like, what

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.830
<v Speaker 1>is that one first use case that you

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:11.070
<v Speaker 1>think Qovery can come in and help people

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.995
<v Speaker 1>with? Yeah. Yeah. That's a very good question.

00:11:14.235 --> 00:11:16.875
<v Speaker 2>We have a very good use case, and,

00:11:16.875 --> 00:11:18.475
<v Speaker 2>actually, it's part of our go to market

00:11:18.475 --> 00:11:21.035
<v Speaker 2>strategies since we are accelerating and we're getting

00:11:21.035 --> 00:11:22.954
<v Speaker 2>more and more customers. We do focus and

00:11:22.954 --> 00:11:25.274
<v Speaker 2>need to focus on one main use case,

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:28.630
<v Speaker 2>but it's basically, like, all companies, like SMBs

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.630
<v Speaker 2>companies that they are transitioning

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.510
<v Speaker 2>from past platform. They need, at some point,

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.230
<v Speaker 2>they are, like, limit limited by, like, the

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:37.990
<v Speaker 2>platform as a service. You are taking hair

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:39.270
<v Speaker 2>or cure, render, fly.

00:11:39.774 --> 00:11:42.575
<v Speaker 2>You get the limits because of technical limits,

00:11:42.575 --> 00:11:44.334
<v Speaker 2>but also in terms of security, in terms

00:11:44.334 --> 00:11:46.654
<v Speaker 2>of compliance, and you need to get into

00:11:46.735 --> 00:11:48.495
<v Speaker 2>the, yes, like AWS,

00:11:48.495 --> 00:11:51.055
<v Speaker 2>GCP, Azure, scale away. You can name it.

00:11:51.295 --> 00:11:53.950
<v Speaker 2>And, basically, here, you have two options. The

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.269
<v Speaker 2>first is hiring, like, a DevOps engineer. When

00:11:56.269 --> 00:11:58.910
<v Speaker 2>you are, like, a very well funded and

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:01.470
<v Speaker 2>famous company and you want to build up

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.470
<v Speaker 2>anyway, like, a a

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:06.190
<v Speaker 2>DevOps engineering team, that there is no problem

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:07.870
<v Speaker 2>for that. But when you are not an

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.464
<v Speaker 2>not all companies, they can just afford, like,

00:12:10.464 --> 00:12:12.865
<v Speaker 2>hiring a DevOps engineering team. Then this is

00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:14.865
<v Speaker 2>why it's quite interesting because Qovery can be

00:12:14.865 --> 00:12:17.185
<v Speaker 2>a good very, very strong and good option.

00:12:17.185 --> 00:12:19.425
<v Speaker 2>Because in just a few minutes, you get

00:12:19.584 --> 00:12:21.825
<v Speaker 2>a state of the art infrastructure with a

00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:24.839
<v Speaker 2>very good developer experience. So meaning that you

00:12:24.839 --> 00:12:27.399
<v Speaker 2>can just stop right away deploying your vision.

00:12:27.399 --> 00:12:28.920
<v Speaker 2>That's a very good use case,

00:12:29.399 --> 00:12:31.399
<v Speaker 2>that we are solving with our product, and

00:12:31.399 --> 00:12:33.480
<v Speaker 2>that's the main use case because it's production

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.160
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure mostly. Yeah.

00:12:35.675 --> 00:12:36.714
<v Speaker 2>So Okay.

00:12:38.074 --> 00:12:40.074
<v Speaker 1>One more question, and then we'll share my

00:12:40.074 --> 00:12:42.315
<v Speaker 1>screen, and we'll actually show people how to

00:12:42.315 --> 00:12:43.195
<v Speaker 1>get started.

00:12:45.115 --> 00:12:47.675
<v Speaker 1>Obviously, this is 2024. Right? I think the

00:12:47.675 --> 00:12:50.475
<v Speaker 1>last twelve to eighteen months have been a

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.380
<v Speaker 1>turbulent time for open source projects. He's I

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna name them. I'm not gonna

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.339
<v Speaker 1>talk about licenses or any of that. Right?

00:12:55.339 --> 00:12:56.620
<v Speaker 1>But well, very

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.980
<v Speaker 1>does it is open source. Right? So, like,

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:00.540
<v Speaker 1>why

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:02.300
<v Speaker 1>did you go down that route?

00:13:03.665 --> 00:13:06.945
<v Speaker 2>That's quite interesting, and I really and I'm

00:13:06.945 --> 00:13:09.745
<v Speaker 2>gonna respond to that question. Actually, we don't

00:13:09.745 --> 00:13:12.305
<v Speaker 2>even define ourself, like, as an open source

00:13:12.305 --> 00:13:15.585
<v Speaker 2>company. But if you look at our GitHub

00:13:15.585 --> 00:13:16.545
<v Speaker 2>repository,

00:13:16.545 --> 00:13:19.430
<v Speaker 2>we have a lot of and, all deployment

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:21.590
<v Speaker 2>engine is, like, fully open source. And we

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:23.270
<v Speaker 2>have a lot of components that they open

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:25.510
<v Speaker 2>to. But you see, we are not defining

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:28.390
<v Speaker 2>ourself as an open source company. Why?

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:32.310
<v Speaker 2>Because, actually, the product can't work, like, without

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:35.485
<v Speaker 2>the control plane. So we did, like, take

00:13:35.485 --> 00:13:37.565
<v Speaker 2>the decisions off, and I did take the

00:13:37.565 --> 00:13:39.245
<v Speaker 2>decision of delivering

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:41.245
<v Speaker 2>as much as we can, like, in open

00:13:41.245 --> 00:13:43.485
<v Speaker 2>source. So mostly, like, the parts that they

00:13:43.485 --> 00:13:46.685
<v Speaker 2>are installed on the infrastructure of our customers

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:50.210
<v Speaker 2>because it's for, like, security, like, reason

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:52.130
<v Speaker 2>and retransparency

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:54.130
<v Speaker 2>because all those elements, there is a lot

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.450
<v Speaker 2>of small elements that they are running and

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:59.090
<v Speaker 2>operate they are operated, like, remotely

00:13:59.454 --> 00:14:02.495
<v Speaker 2>on their infrastructure, on their Kubernetes cluster, on

00:14:02.495 --> 00:14:05.375
<v Speaker 2>their cloud account. And so for transparency,

00:14:05.774 --> 00:14:08.895
<v Speaker 2>we have decided just to open source everything,

00:14:09.295 --> 00:14:11.214
<v Speaker 2>and we have also, like, a few other

00:14:11.214 --> 00:14:14.255
<v Speaker 2>elements, like, tooling that we are using internally

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:16.820
<v Speaker 2>that they are completely open source and they

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.060
<v Speaker 2>can be used by our customers. So we

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.700
<v Speaker 2>have the open source philosophy at her, and

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.780
<v Speaker 2>we do contribute. We are even doing some

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:24.580
<v Speaker 2>contribution.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.660
<v Speaker 2>But we don't define recovery as, like, a

00:14:27.975 --> 00:14:29.175
<v Speaker 2>100%,

00:14:29.175 --> 00:14:30.535
<v Speaker 2>like, a %

00:14:30.694 --> 00:14:33.495
<v Speaker 2>open source product because, actually, the control plane

00:14:34.454 --> 00:14:35.095
<v Speaker 2>is,

00:14:35.255 --> 00:14:37.334
<v Speaker 2>like, not open source today.

00:14:37.574 --> 00:14:38.214
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:14:38.935 --> 00:14:40.134
<v Speaker 1>Well, yeah. I mean, I think,

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:43.190
<v Speaker 1>you know, I jumped on to the organization

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:44.950
<v Speaker 1>on GitHub. There's a lot of open source

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.270
<v Speaker 1>happening, but, you know, that can only happen

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:50.310
<v Speaker 1>if companies can be sustainably making things open

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:52.310
<v Speaker 1>source. Yeah. I think that's the way to

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:53.350
<v Speaker 1>do it. I mean, it's a very big

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:56.005
<v Speaker 1>challenge right now to Yep. Write all these

00:14:56.005 --> 00:14:58.565
<v Speaker 1>amazing products, make them open source. But then,

00:14:58.565 --> 00:15:00.005
<v Speaker 1>you know, if you can't pay your bills,

00:15:00.005 --> 00:15:02.325
<v Speaker 1>feed your family, then what's the point? So

00:15:02.725 --> 00:15:04.805
<v Speaker 1>yeah. Yeah. That makes lot of sense.

00:15:05.205 --> 00:15:06.885
<v Speaker 1>But I I like the the trust aspect

00:15:06.885 --> 00:15:09.260
<v Speaker 1>and the transparency aspect. I think it is

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.980
<v Speaker 1>a really good reason for companies to push

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.060
<v Speaker 1>out more open source components even if the

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.580
<v Speaker 1>whole thing has an open source because it

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.820
<v Speaker 1>does give people trust that,

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:19.740
<v Speaker 1>you know Yeah. And

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:23.740
<v Speaker 2>yeah. Maybe the same as yeah. I'm sorry,

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:26.275
<v Speaker 2>but I'm a I'm a really hard believer

00:15:26.275 --> 00:15:29.395
<v Speaker 2>in in open source. I do think I'm

00:15:29.395 --> 00:15:31.715
<v Speaker 2>doing this job because of hope open source

00:15:31.715 --> 00:15:32.835
<v Speaker 2>and a lot,

00:15:33.155 --> 00:15:35.635
<v Speaker 2>and open source is really something. But I

00:15:35.635 --> 00:15:38.035
<v Speaker 2>do think and that's another discussion, but

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.170
<v Speaker 2>there is a kind, like, of

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:43.570
<v Speaker 2>I would not say a lie, like, in

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:46.050
<v Speaker 2>the industry, but it's really for me, something

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:47.490
<v Speaker 2>that is open to us is really open

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:49.010
<v Speaker 2>to us. Like, really, you can do, you

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:50.690
<v Speaker 2>can take it, you can change it, you

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:53.090
<v Speaker 2>can commercialize it, you can do whatever you

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:55.155
<v Speaker 2>want, and it must be, like, very important.

00:15:55.155 --> 00:15:57.395
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise, like, all the software that they are

00:15:57.395 --> 00:15:59.635
<v Speaker 2>not, like, in that aspect, you can really

00:15:59.715 --> 00:16:02.115
<v Speaker 2>and because of the license aspect and so,

00:16:02.275 --> 00:16:03.955
<v Speaker 2>that for me, they are not just they

00:16:03.955 --> 00:16:06.115
<v Speaker 2>are not really open, but it's another, again,

00:16:06.115 --> 00:16:06.835
<v Speaker 2>like, discussion.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.840
<v Speaker 2>And and I I prefer just to be

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.320
<v Speaker 2>super transparent and very clear to our users

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.720
<v Speaker 2>as well. Yes. We have components that they

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.880
<v Speaker 2>are open source, but cover itself is not

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.520
<v Speaker 2>open source. Right. Yeah.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.200
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Awesome.

00:16:22.145 --> 00:16:23.745
<v Speaker 1>So shall we show people how to get

00:16:23.745 --> 00:16:25.905
<v Speaker 1>started and what Qovery does?

00:16:26.705 --> 00:16:28.305
<v Speaker 2>Yes. Let's do it.

00:16:29.665 --> 00:16:31.265
<v Speaker 2>Let's let's do it.

00:16:33.905 --> 00:16:36.945
<v Speaker 1>Alright. I am on the

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.560
<v Speaker 1>Qovery website.

00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:42.240
<v Speaker 1>As always, on Rawkode Live, nothing is planned

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:42.959
<v Speaker 1>up front.

00:16:43.519 --> 00:16:44.079
<v Speaker 1>I

00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:46.480
<v Speaker 1>am in a very nice position where I've

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.920
<v Speaker 1>had my eye on Qovery for a while,

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.519
<v Speaker 1>but I've never actually kicked the tires on

00:16:49.519 --> 00:16:51.465
<v Speaker 1>it. So this is this is legit for

00:16:51.465 --> 00:16:53.465
<v Speaker 1>me. This is my first time ever having

00:16:53.465 --> 00:16:55.145
<v Speaker 1>to play with it. So we'll go straight

00:16:55.145 --> 00:16:56.665
<v Speaker 1>to the get and start to guide,

00:16:57.465 --> 00:16:59.865
<v Speaker 1>and we can see there's a this is

00:16:59.865 --> 00:17:01.305
<v Speaker 1>quite nice, actually. You've got a whole bunch

00:17:01.305 --> 00:17:01.545
<v Speaker 1>of,

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:04.900
<v Speaker 1>like, tracks and scenarios and tutorials.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.539
<v Speaker 1>Wow. I don't often see that. That's awesome.

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:10.580
<v Speaker 1>Very cool. I'm assuming we're gonna start with

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:12.660
<v Speaker 1>that's a nice effect too. So I'm just

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.580
<v Speaker 1>gonna geek out over your website. Nice.

00:17:15.514 --> 00:17:17.355
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming we're gonna start with Fumble World.

00:17:17.355 --> 00:17:17.595
<v Speaker 1>So

00:17:18.234 --> 00:17:20.714
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. And the documentation is open source. We

00:17:20.714 --> 00:17:21.594
<v Speaker 2>open source.

00:17:25.194 --> 00:17:27.194
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So to begin, I need to get

00:17:27.194 --> 00:17:29.355
<v Speaker 1>hub account checked. I can manage that at

00:17:29.355 --> 00:17:31.990
<v Speaker 1>least. And we are gonna sign up for

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:34.070
<v Speaker 1>the Qovery web interface.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:36.309
<v Speaker 1>So let's do that.

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:38.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. You will be you will be surprised

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:41.590
<v Speaker 2>by the the the sign up workflow. Let's

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:42.310
<v Speaker 2>let's do it.

00:17:54.355 --> 00:17:55.154
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:17:55.395 --> 00:17:56.755
<v Speaker 1>So I need to pick my cloud.

00:18:00.039 --> 00:18:02.360
<v Speaker 1>I have access to to to all of

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:04.999
<v Speaker 1>them, so we'll just go with AWS.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.479
<v Speaker 1>Where's where's DevOps on autopilot?

00:18:11.639 --> 00:18:12.679
<v Speaker 1>Why is that not an option?

00:18:13.675 --> 00:18:16.315
<v Speaker 2>That's a that's a good one. That's that's

00:18:16.315 --> 00:18:17.435
<v Speaker 2>a feedback that we should

00:18:19.995 --> 00:18:22.635
<v Speaker 1>Alright. And now I just need to confirm

00:18:22.635 --> 00:18:24.555
<v Speaker 1>my email address. I'll do that over here.

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:26.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:18:27.059 --> 00:18:29.220
<v Speaker 2>And you see yeah. Absolutely.

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:32.019
<v Speaker 2>Actually, you you would be, like, surprised.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.460
<v Speaker 2>There's something.

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.820
<v Speaker 2>So when you sign up, you you you

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.140
<v Speaker 2>you're blocked by this this page.

00:18:40.955 --> 00:18:43.595
<v Speaker 2>So you can confirm, and, usually, what you

00:18:43.595 --> 00:18:45.515
<v Speaker 2>get is that an automated message,

00:18:45.915 --> 00:18:47.915
<v Speaker 2>Jackie, like, in your mailbox. And then from

00:18:47.915 --> 00:18:49.275
<v Speaker 2>that, we give you access

00:18:49.435 --> 00:18:50.075
<v Speaker 2>to

00:18:50.315 --> 00:18:52.795
<v Speaker 2>the platform so when you reply to it.

00:18:53.389 --> 00:18:56.349
<v Speaker 2>But I'm gonna just give you so

00:18:56.509 --> 00:18:59.070
<v Speaker 2>I can give you access, actually. So Oh,

00:18:59.070 --> 00:18:59.549
<v Speaker 1>okay.

00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:17.505
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking for you yourself.

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.580
<v Speaker 2>Ah, yes. I can see you.

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.740
<v Speaker 1>It's good. An enterprise license, please.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.340
<v Speaker 2>You have to choose your plan then right

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.940
<v Speaker 2>after this screen. If you go back now

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.060
<v Speaker 2>and you and

00:19:33.485 --> 00:19:35.725
<v Speaker 2>and you go and you move forward and

00:19:35.725 --> 00:19:36.605
<v Speaker 2>you validate.

00:19:36.925 --> 00:19:38.605
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. You have Alright.

00:19:39.085 --> 00:19:40.365
<v Speaker 1>Rawkode

00:19:40.365 --> 00:19:41.325
<v Speaker 1>Academy.

00:19:42.285 --> 00:19:43.485
<v Speaker 1>I'll call this platform.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.320
<v Speaker 2>Alright.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.159
<v Speaker 2>You can start with the free. Yeah. There

00:19:49.159 --> 00:19:51.159
<v Speaker 2>is no yeah. No problem. Or you can

00:19:51.159 --> 00:19:52.760
<v Speaker 2>take the team plan, then you have no

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.000
<v Speaker 2>restriction, actually. It's there is no credit card

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.519
<v Speaker 2>needed, so that's good.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.159
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So you got three plans.

00:19:59.684 --> 00:20:02.085
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And up to twenty five years, so

00:20:02.085 --> 00:20:03.764
<v Speaker 1>it's three cluster of 20. So okay. I

00:20:03.764 --> 00:20:05.365
<v Speaker 1>mean, this is perfect. This is fine for

00:20:05.365 --> 00:20:07.124
<v Speaker 1>me. Yeah. Absolutely.

00:20:08.565 --> 00:20:10.164
<v Speaker 1>I like it when it's a a pretty

00:20:10.164 --> 00:20:11.205
<v Speaker 1>generous free tier.

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:13.139
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.099
<v Speaker 1>Alright. I've got Qovery.

00:20:16.419 --> 00:20:18.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh. Yeah. You're ready to go.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.779
<v Speaker 2>So I let you just discovering the product

00:20:21.779 --> 00:20:24.260
<v Speaker 2>that's quite interesting, actually. I don't want to,

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.460
<v Speaker 2>like, influence you all.

00:20:27.115 --> 00:20:29.514
<v Speaker 2>Well It's kind of a product session.

00:20:29.675 --> 00:20:31.915
<v Speaker 2>I'm just looking at how you interact with

00:20:31.915 --> 00:20:32.794
<v Speaker 2>the product.

00:20:33.675 --> 00:20:35.675
<v Speaker 1>Wait. Obviously, my eyes are already getting right

00:20:35.675 --> 00:20:37.595
<v Speaker 1>to this big create custom button,

00:20:37.755 --> 00:20:39.290
<v Speaker 1>which I know I should be back and

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.049
<v Speaker 1>follow on the tutorial, but I I'm just

00:20:41.049 --> 00:20:43.610
<v Speaker 1>gonna go rogue and, like Yeah.

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:46.010
<v Speaker 1>Let's see. So You are doing, like, a

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:46.970
<v Speaker 2>99%

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:49.369
<v Speaker 2>of all the users, like, share the documentation.

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:51.370
<v Speaker 2>And, actually, it's the it's the well so

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:53.385
<v Speaker 2>that we consider product is that if you

00:20:53.385 --> 00:20:55.545
<v Speaker 2>have to look at the documentation to use

00:20:55.545 --> 00:20:56.745
<v Speaker 2>it, there is a problem.

00:20:57.385 --> 00:20:59.545
<v Speaker 2>But sometime, it's necessary still.

00:21:00.105 --> 00:21:03.225
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So, I mean, sensibly, I I mean,

00:21:03.225 --> 00:21:05.225
<v Speaker 1>I will do a local machine because I

00:21:05.225 --> 00:21:06.910
<v Speaker 1>want to see that workflow. But I clicked

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:08.910
<v Speaker 1>on AWS just to see what the options

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:11.790
<v Speaker 1>were. And we've got our Qovery managed

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:14.510
<v Speaker 1>cluster or self managed cluster. So I just

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:16.350
<v Speaker 1>wanna make sure I understand this correctly.

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:19.230
<v Speaker 1>If I I say I've got my own

00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:22.335
<v Speaker 1>company or my own team, we use AWS,

00:21:22.735 --> 00:21:24.815
<v Speaker 1>you can I'm assuming if I give you

00:21:24.815 --> 00:21:26.975
<v Speaker 1>the right credentials, you're gonna manage a Kubernetes

00:21:26.975 --> 00:21:28.975
<v Speaker 1>cluster for us. But if I have an

00:21:28.975 --> 00:21:30.974
<v Speaker 1>existing, say, AKS cluster,

00:21:31.054 --> 00:21:33.135
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming we just have self managed and

00:21:33.135 --> 00:21:35.700
<v Speaker 1>we deploy some sort of Qovery agent to

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.100
<v Speaker 1>it. I mean, is that the right assumption?

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.419
<v Speaker 2>That's perfect. That's exactly that.

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.940
<v Speaker 2>You get it right. Perfect. With Qovery managed,

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:46.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean, is that in my own AWS

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:47.220
<v Speaker 1>account? Do you run it in your own

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.500
<v Speaker 1>account? How does that work? Okay.

00:21:49.144 --> 00:21:51.705
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. That's a very good question. And, actually,

00:21:51.865 --> 00:21:54.745
<v Speaker 2>so you do just, like, provide the region

00:21:54.745 --> 00:21:56.745
<v Speaker 2>the way you wants to deploy. So you

00:21:56.745 --> 00:21:57.464
<v Speaker 2>have that.

00:21:58.505 --> 00:21:59.544
<v Speaker 2>The credential

00:21:59.945 --> 00:22:02.264
<v Speaker 2>so you provide your credentials. So we give

00:22:02.264 --> 00:22:04.370
<v Speaker 2>the permissions that we need just to create

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:05.570
<v Speaker 2>the different resources.

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:07.250
<v Speaker 2>But then from that,

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:10.450
<v Speaker 2>you have few other options like Carpenter. You

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:12.210
<v Speaker 2>can install, like, some add ons on your

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:14.130
<v Speaker 2>Kubernetes customs and so forth.

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:16.770
<v Speaker 2>We'll generate so at the end, like, the

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:20.035
<v Speaker 2>work configuration. So we'll create the VPC security

00:22:20.035 --> 00:22:21.475
<v Speaker 2>group load balancer,

00:22:22.195 --> 00:22:25.235
<v Speaker 2>the the the cluster in, like, multiple availability

00:22:25.235 --> 00:22:27.315
<v Speaker 2>zone. So we make sure that you get,

00:22:27.315 --> 00:22:28.275
<v Speaker 2>like, a really

00:22:28.675 --> 00:22:31.235
<v Speaker 2>fully fledged, like, production infrastructure

00:22:31.235 --> 00:22:33.380
<v Speaker 2>running on your cloud account. So it's really

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:35.940
<v Speaker 2>running on your cloud again. And the beauty

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.260
<v Speaker 2>here is that you don't have to invest,

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:40.260
<v Speaker 2>like, in day two operation. Meaning, the upgrades

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.099
<v Speaker 2>of those clusters, but because

00:22:42.419 --> 00:22:45.059
<v Speaker 2>with AWS, you have an upgrade of EKS,

00:22:45.059 --> 00:22:46.875
<v Speaker 2>like, every three months. So you need to

00:22:46.875 --> 00:22:49.115
<v Speaker 2>spend time, like, on that. And that's a

00:22:49.115 --> 00:22:51.195
<v Speaker 2>big value that you get out of discovery

00:22:51.195 --> 00:22:53.995
<v Speaker 2>manage, offer because you do once it's done,

00:22:53.995 --> 00:22:55.914
<v Speaker 2>you get the power of Kubernetes,

00:22:55.915 --> 00:22:57.995
<v Speaker 2>but we are the asset of maintaining that.

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Got it. Let's

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.600
<v Speaker 1>keep things simple.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.160
<v Speaker 1>And oh, here we go.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.360
<v Speaker 1>So this is where it's become a a

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.800
<v Speaker 1>common theme recently

00:23:10.905 --> 00:23:12.905
<v Speaker 1>where people ask me to install command line

00:23:12.905 --> 00:23:14.665
<v Speaker 1>applications, and then I have to tell them

00:23:14.665 --> 00:23:15.945
<v Speaker 1>that I use Nexus.

00:23:16.345 --> 00:23:16.905
<v Speaker 1>So

00:23:17.785 --> 00:23:19.225
<v Speaker 1>is it a next package?

00:23:19.545 --> 00:23:21.225
<v Speaker 1>No. Is it a static binary?

00:23:21.705 --> 00:23:23.465
<v Speaker 2>I do think there is a next

00:23:24.025 --> 00:23:26.350
<v Speaker 2>I do think there is a next package,

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:29.070
<v Speaker 2>but it's not maintained by I'm not sure

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:30.269
<v Speaker 2>if it's managed

00:23:30.429 --> 00:23:32.190
<v Speaker 2>and still maintained by

00:23:32.909 --> 00:23:34.909
<v Speaker 2>the team. I I do know that it

00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:37.390
<v Speaker 2>was a customer that did provide that,

00:23:37.934 --> 00:23:38.494
<v Speaker 2>but

00:23:39.054 --> 00:23:42.254
<v Speaker 2>you can find it on the QWERADI.

00:23:43.375 --> 00:23:45.134
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna just look at that.

00:23:46.495 --> 00:23:48.095
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I mean, I can always jump into

00:23:48.095 --> 00:23:49.934
<v Speaker 1>a desktop box. It's not a big deal.

00:23:50.174 --> 00:23:52.815
<v Speaker 2>Oh, we don't yeah. But it has not

00:23:52.815 --> 00:23:53.970
<v Speaker 2>been. Yeah.

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:56.130
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:57.649
<v Speaker 1>I found it.

00:23:58.290 --> 00:23:59.970
<v Speaker 1>Is 092.8,

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:02.610
<v Speaker 1>is that old or recent? No. It's old

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:05.010
<v Speaker 2>one, actually. Okay. Let's not do that. Yeah.

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:07.090
<v Speaker 1>So let's pop this open. Yeah. And let's

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:08.370
<v Speaker 1>see if it's a static. Is it running

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:08.690
<v Speaker 1>go?

00:24:09.615 --> 00:24:12.174
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. It's go. Oh, it should be okay.

00:24:13.615 --> 00:24:14.015
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.860
<v Speaker 2>The the path the path maybe is not

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:28.900
<v Speaker 2>the right one. Like, the Yeah. You can

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.500
<v Speaker 2>change the path. Like

00:24:34.565 --> 00:24:36.165
<v Speaker 1>I was looking for local

00:24:36.565 --> 00:24:38.644
<v Speaker 1>the destination. Yeah. Just

00:24:41.605 --> 00:24:42.325
<v Speaker 2>dot.

00:24:43.045 --> 00:24:43.845
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:24:44.085 --> 00:24:44.804
<v Speaker 2>Yep.

00:24:44.885 --> 00:24:45.525
<v Speaker 2>Makes sense.

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:51.169
<v Speaker 1>Alright. I need to trim audit.

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:52.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:53.730
<v Speaker 2>That's a good one.

00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:55.730
<v Speaker 1>It's not static.

00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:57.810
<v Speaker 2>Oh, it's not it's not static. It's linked?

00:24:57.810 --> 00:24:59.730
<v Speaker 2>Okay. Yeah. Dynamic is linked.

00:25:00.585 --> 00:25:02.745
<v Speaker 1>That's Alright. That's

00:25:02.745 --> 00:25:02.905
<v Speaker 2>a

00:25:04.025 --> 00:25:04.744
<v Speaker 2>yeah.

00:25:06.985 --> 00:25:08.105
<v Speaker 2>He seems to be used to

00:25:08.825 --> 00:25:10.985
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I'm I'm getting so used to it.

00:25:11.225 --> 00:25:14.184
<v Speaker 1>I mean, Nexus has a lot of power,

00:25:14.345 --> 00:25:16.620
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of paper cuts all the

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:19.820
<v Speaker 1>time, especially if it's not in next packages

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:21.020
<v Speaker 1>or if it's not up to date in

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.180
<v Speaker 1>next packages, it it it could be pretty

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:23.900
<v Speaker 1>painful.

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:26.460
<v Speaker 1>But we'll get that extra box just it's

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:28.060
<v Speaker 1>only gonna take a minute, and then we'll

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:29.340
<v Speaker 1>install it and just run from there.

00:25:30.075 --> 00:25:31.515
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if there's anything I can do

00:25:31.515 --> 00:25:32.955
<v Speaker 1>in the meantime. Do I need a Kubernetes

00:25:32.955 --> 00:25:33.994
<v Speaker 1>cluster locally?

00:25:35.434 --> 00:25:37.995
<v Speaker 2>Actually, Qovery is gonna, like, spin up everything

00:25:37.995 --> 00:25:40.234
<v Speaker 2>for you. You just need the docker runtime,

00:25:40.235 --> 00:25:41.114
<v Speaker 2>and that's it.

00:25:42.075 --> 00:25:43.754
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So yeah.

00:25:44.395 --> 00:25:45.195
<v Speaker 2>And

00:25:56.750 --> 00:26:00.590
<v Speaker 1>really, I should just start writing next shells

00:25:59.055 --> 00:26:00.815
<v Speaker 1>for all of these streams where I get,

00:26:00.815 --> 00:26:03.135
<v Speaker 1>like, a proper Linux file system and a

00:26:03.135 --> 00:26:03.935
<v Speaker 1>directory

00:26:04.255 --> 00:26:06.895
<v Speaker 1>just for stuff like this. Because, again, this

00:26:06.895 --> 00:26:08.415
<v Speaker 1>this is not the first thing this happens.

00:26:08.415 --> 00:26:10.255
<v Speaker 1>It's it's it's a common theme there.

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:14.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. But it's good. It's good. It's, like,

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:15.230
<v Speaker 2>re unscript.

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:16.510
<v Speaker 2>It's it's live. Alright.

00:26:29.215 --> 00:26:31.215
<v Speaker 1>Wish I'd done arch instead of the door

00:26:31.215 --> 00:26:31.535
<v Speaker 1>now.

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Okay. I I used to I used to

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.180
<v Speaker 2>be a Debbie Allen guy

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.140
<v Speaker 2>for a long time. It's been a while

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:46.700
<v Speaker 2>now.

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:49.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Me too. Until Arch came along and

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.220
<v Speaker 1>but I just rolling releases are

00:26:52.515 --> 00:26:54.355
<v Speaker 1>the best way. I always need the the

00:26:54.355 --> 00:26:56.915
<v Speaker 1>latest and greatest versions of packages, which Nextos

00:26:56.915 --> 00:26:59.875
<v Speaker 1>is generally really good for actually, especially these

00:26:59.875 --> 00:27:00.434
<v Speaker 1>days.

00:27:01.315 --> 00:27:03.475
<v Speaker 1>But there are always packages you find are

00:27:03.475 --> 00:27:05.075
<v Speaker 1>just that little bit behind where they need

00:27:05.075 --> 00:27:05.635
<v Speaker 1>to be.

00:27:06.275 --> 00:27:06.755
<v Speaker 2>Mhmm.

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:11.820
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.500
<v Speaker 1>So I might need to install the Docker

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.940
<v Speaker 1>CLI, but that's okay.

00:27:15.659 --> 00:27:16.860
<v Speaker 1>Let's

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:17.979
<v Speaker 1>get Qovery.

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:19.820
<v Speaker 2>Again.

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:21.580
<v Speaker 1>Qovery

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:22.460
<v Speaker 1>off.

00:27:23.284 --> 00:27:24.644
<v Speaker 1>Alright. We're cooking.

00:27:25.365 --> 00:27:26.644
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Perfect.

00:27:28.005 --> 00:27:28.964
<v Speaker 2>That's good.

00:27:29.684 --> 00:27:31.445
<v Speaker 2>You even have like, in the case that

00:27:31.445 --> 00:27:32.484
<v Speaker 2>you don't have

00:27:32.885 --> 00:27:36.085
<v Speaker 2>a brother, you can just type, like, dash

00:27:36.085 --> 00:27:37.125
<v Speaker 2>dash headless,

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:39.080
<v Speaker 2>and you get, like, a code that you

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.120
<v Speaker 2>can just validate. Like

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh, no. DustroBox is the coolest thing I've

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.759
<v Speaker 1>seen in a while. Like, I am in

00:27:44.759 --> 00:27:47.080
<v Speaker 1>a container. It is a fedora container, but

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.320
<v Speaker 1>it hooks up everything to your host. Like,

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.159
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually still in my own directory and

00:27:51.159 --> 00:27:53.835
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that. That's really nice. Yeah. Yeah.

00:27:53.835 --> 00:27:55.514
<v Speaker 1>It's really slick the way they've done it.

00:27:55.595 --> 00:27:56.235
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:27:57.115 --> 00:27:59.755
<v Speaker 2>So great. Alright. You're authenticated now. You can

00:27:59.755 --> 00:28:02.315
<v Speaker 2>just, like, basically run ready for for this

00:28:02.315 --> 00:28:02.955
<v Speaker 2>command.

00:28:04.315 --> 00:28:06.690
<v Speaker 1>So we're gonna need a a Docker engine.

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:08.290
<v Speaker 1>Right? Now does it need a Docker CLI,

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:09.809
<v Speaker 1>or does it use a Go SDK?

00:28:12.929 --> 00:28:15.649
<v Speaker 2>I do think it's a bash

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:17.570
<v Speaker 2>script, so we are using just the the

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:18.050
<v Speaker 2>binary.

00:28:18.585 --> 00:28:20.585
<v Speaker 2>That's possible that we're using the binary. And

00:28:20.585 --> 00:28:22.024
<v Speaker 2>you see It's installing all the tools it

00:28:22.024 --> 00:28:24.505
<v Speaker 1>needs? Oh, no. Yeah. Yeah. I wanted Docker

00:28:24.505 --> 00:28:25.065
<v Speaker 1>though. It's

00:28:25.705 --> 00:28:26.744
<v Speaker 2>you don't.

00:28:27.065 --> 00:28:28.664
<v Speaker 1>It's okay. I can get Docker.

00:28:29.065 --> 00:28:30.585
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.

00:28:30.825 --> 00:28:32.904
<v Speaker 2>But, yeah, basically, this command is here just

00:28:32.904 --> 00:28:33.865
<v Speaker 2>to install, like,

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.840
<v Speaker 2>we do install what what did you install?

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:38.640
<v Speaker 2>I do think

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.000
<v Speaker 2>a Debian with, like, a k k three

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:42.560
<v Speaker 2>s

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.120
<v Speaker 2>that is running, and then we install, like,

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:45.600
<v Speaker 2>the

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.545
<v Speaker 2>different charts, the QWERADE. We do generate the

00:28:48.545 --> 00:28:50.305
<v Speaker 2>M charts, and we install the M chart

00:28:50.305 --> 00:28:51.024
<v Speaker 2>on it.

00:28:51.425 --> 00:28:52.065
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:28:59.105 --> 00:29:00.225
<v Speaker 2>Let's see if it works.

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.080
<v Speaker 2>At least on my side, it works.

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.239
<v Speaker 1>Oh, we'll get there.

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.679
<v Speaker 1>The the challenge is is the Internet in

00:29:10.679 --> 00:29:13.160
<v Speaker 1>my office has been, like, potato net for

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:13.799
<v Speaker 1>a while now.

00:29:14.524 --> 00:29:16.605
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. They they really need to fix

00:29:16.605 --> 00:29:17.164
<v Speaker 1>it.

00:29:18.845 --> 00:29:20.364
<v Speaker 1>Alright. It's getting there.

00:29:21.404 --> 00:29:22.604
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So

00:29:22.845 --> 00:29:25.164
<v Speaker 1>Qovery demo app.

00:29:25.885 --> 00:29:26.524
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:29:27.404 --> 00:29:28.524
<v Speaker 1>Oh, there we go. This is all in

00:29:28.524 --> 00:29:29.164
<v Speaker 1>case three d.

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:32.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay. That's

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.900
<v Speaker 1>Installing how okay. So it's installing all the

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:36.900
<v Speaker 1>tools, but it does expect Docker to be

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:38.580
<v Speaker 1>on the host, which is fair enough. Right?

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:40.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean, everybody has Podman, Docker, or something

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:42.020
<v Speaker 1>like that running these days.

00:29:43.265 --> 00:29:43.825
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:29:44.945 --> 00:29:47.585
<v Speaker 2>But this this command can be, like, flaky

00:29:47.585 --> 00:29:50.304
<v Speaker 2>sometimes because we do not control all the

00:29:50.304 --> 00:29:53.105
<v Speaker 2>environment, like, on your machines. So sometimes we

00:29:53.105 --> 00:29:55.345
<v Speaker 2>have, like, some weird issues. But,

00:29:55.745 --> 00:29:57.105
<v Speaker 2>yeah, in general, it works.

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:00.820
<v Speaker 2>But it happens that it didn't work. Uh-huh.

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:02.660
<v Speaker 2>So people, they fall back, like, on the

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:03.860
<v Speaker 2>classic installer

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:06.500
<v Speaker 2>of running that on their cloud account.

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:09.700
<v Speaker 2>Or if they have already a Kubernetes cluster,

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:10.580
<v Speaker 2>so they install

00:30:10.855 --> 00:30:13.014
<v Speaker 2>Qovery on it, and it just works.

00:30:13.174 --> 00:30:13.734
<v Speaker 2>So

00:30:15.014 --> 00:30:17.414
<v Speaker 2>yeah. But that's quite convenient here because you

00:30:17.414 --> 00:30:19.575
<v Speaker 2>can just run that command. Once you've you're

00:30:19.575 --> 00:30:22.615
<v Speaker 2>done, you can just drop, like, destroy run

00:30:22.615 --> 00:30:24.695
<v Speaker 2>the same command and destroy, like, the the

00:30:24.695 --> 00:30:25.255
<v Speaker 2>configuration.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.240
<v Speaker 2>Nice.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:29.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.480
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So it now appears to be installing

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.320
<v Speaker 1>Qovery to the cluster.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:36.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. Congratulations.

00:30:50.865 --> 00:30:52.145
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what. I'll do you a

00:30:52.145 --> 00:30:54.865
<v Speaker 1>favor after this stream. I will update the

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.240
<v Speaker 1>next package for you to the latest release.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh, if you're doing that, then you will

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.279
<v Speaker 2>get, for sure,

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.440
<v Speaker 2>a t shirt or

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:06.240
<v Speaker 2>something.

00:31:06.725 --> 00:31:08.885
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. I'll take it. Don't you worry.

00:31:13.525 --> 00:31:15.205
<v Speaker 2>That's good. Hopefully,

00:31:15.205 --> 00:31:17.365
<v Speaker 1>it's getting there. I mean, what's that installed

00:31:17.365 --> 00:31:19.525
<v Speaker 1>into the cluster right now? Like, what what

00:31:19.525 --> 00:31:21.125
<v Speaker 1>is that Qovery Home Chart doing here?

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:24.850
<v Speaker 2>It's installing. So QWER is so it's written

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:26.049
<v Speaker 2>in in Rust.

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:29.169
<v Speaker 2>Okay? So we are installing, like, basically, the

00:31:29.169 --> 00:31:30.049
<v Speaker 2>binaries.

00:31:30.289 --> 00:31:32.289
<v Speaker 2>I can even share my screen, like, during

00:31:32.289 --> 00:31:33.970
<v Speaker 2>the installation so I can Yeah. Go for

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:34.849
<v Speaker 1>it. How

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:38.255
<v Speaker 2>how things work. So you will see it's,

00:31:38.255 --> 00:31:40.655
<v Speaker 2>like, public. It's quite it's quite interesting just

00:31:40.655 --> 00:31:42.014
<v Speaker 2>to get into that.

00:31:42.975 --> 00:31:45.775
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't support share. Mac OS is just

00:31:45.934 --> 00:31:48.495
<v Speaker 2>There you go. It's it's there. Oh, it's

00:31:48.495 --> 00:31:49.855
<v Speaker 2>mine. Okay. Perfect.

00:31:50.495 --> 00:31:51.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. So,

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:54.710
<v Speaker 2>yeah, basically, we so how it works, it

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:56.870
<v Speaker 2>it works this way. So you have the

00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:59.750
<v Speaker 2>control pane running on our side. Okay? And

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:01.750
<v Speaker 2>you have the the Qovery binaries that they're

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:03.590
<v Speaker 2>running on your Kubernetes cluster. So what we

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:04.985
<v Speaker 2>do in style is that we create a

00:32:04.985 --> 00:32:07.545
<v Speaker 2>namespace, Qovery namespace, and we do install those

00:32:07.545 --> 00:32:09.145
<v Speaker 2>binaries. Those binaries,

00:32:09.465 --> 00:32:10.185
<v Speaker 2>they are

00:32:10.905 --> 00:32:13.385
<v Speaker 2>they are written in Rust. Okay? So that's

00:32:13.385 --> 00:32:15.385
<v Speaker 2>the part. Like, all those components, they are

00:32:15.385 --> 00:32:17.440
<v Speaker 2>like open source. So you can dig into

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.120
<v Speaker 2>that, and you can see exactly how it

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.239
<v Speaker 2>works. But, basically,

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.159
<v Speaker 2>the way it works, you will see it's

00:32:22.159 --> 00:32:22.959
<v Speaker 2>very dumb,

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.960
<v Speaker 2>but it's done in very good way. But

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.600
<v Speaker 2>we interact with the Kubernetes API, but we

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.559
<v Speaker 2>also do generate, like, all the configuration file

00:32:30.559 --> 00:32:32.765
<v Speaker 2>on the fly. So based on the configuration

00:32:32.765 --> 00:32:34.365
<v Speaker 2>and the stuff that you select

00:32:34.684 --> 00:32:37.005
<v Speaker 2>on the interface, and then they are translating

00:32:37.005 --> 00:32:39.885
<v Speaker 2>into the control plane. Okay. And you see

00:32:39.885 --> 00:32:42.764
<v Speaker 2>something which is quite interesting is that

00:32:43.804 --> 00:32:46.760
<v Speaker 2>our control plane is like a public API.

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.480
<v Speaker 2>Okay? And your machine is not exposed. Right?

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.120
<v Speaker 2>So you are installing QM recovery

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.360
<v Speaker 2>on your own Kubernetes,

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.559
<v Speaker 2>like local machine.

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.880
<v Speaker 2>And what happened is that it's the cover

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.080
<v Speaker 2>engine that is

00:32:59.585 --> 00:33:01.665
<v Speaker 2>getting the connections to the control plane and

00:33:01.665 --> 00:33:02.625
<v Speaker 2>not the opposite.

00:33:03.105 --> 00:33:05.345
<v Speaker 2>So which is like a reverse connection. And

00:33:05.345 --> 00:33:06.385
<v Speaker 2>then from that,

00:33:07.585 --> 00:33:09.505
<v Speaker 2>the cover engine your cover engine, when you

00:33:09.505 --> 00:33:11.985
<v Speaker 2>deploy an application and you do some operation,

00:33:12.305 --> 00:33:15.590
<v Speaker 2>actually, they pull, like, task from the control

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:17.910
<v Speaker 2>plane. And then they are executed, and then

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:19.190
<v Speaker 2>they report back

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:20.150
<v Speaker 2>to,

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:22.470
<v Speaker 2>basically, the control plane so you can get

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:24.150
<v Speaker 2>the information from the interface.

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:26.230
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Nice.

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:29.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Those are pretty cool diagrams. How'd you

00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:29.430
<v Speaker 1>make those?

00:33:30.815 --> 00:33:32.255
<v Speaker 1>It's Excalidraw,

00:33:32.255 --> 00:33:33.615
<v Speaker 1>of course. Scalidraw.

00:33:33.615 --> 00:33:35.855
<v Speaker 1>Nice. Yeah. But now I'm using t l

00:33:35.855 --> 00:33:36.495
<v Speaker 2>draw.

00:33:37.055 --> 00:33:39.535
<v Speaker 2>Now I don't know why I'm yeah. I

00:33:39.535 --> 00:33:40.735
<v Speaker 2>think we've got t l draw now.

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:44.030
<v Speaker 1>I see. I like it's ScallyDraw because I've

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:45.470
<v Speaker 1>got a Versus Code plugin, so I can

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:47.150
<v Speaker 1>just pop up like a new window in

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:48.830
<v Speaker 1>this. I mean, I'm sure TLDraw may have

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:51.950
<v Speaker 1>one too. We now have Qovery clusters, so

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:54.350
<v Speaker 1>I am gonna switch this back now.

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:55.390
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Ta da.

00:33:58.715 --> 00:33:59.915
<v Speaker 1>So I'm assuming

00:34:00.635 --> 00:34:02.315
<v Speaker 2>So now yeah. Hopefully, if

00:34:02.795 --> 00:34:03.755
<v Speaker 1>I come here

00:34:04.235 --> 00:34:06.475
<v Speaker 2>And you go back. We have a cluster.

00:34:06.715 --> 00:34:07.434
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:34:09.755 --> 00:34:11.195
<v Speaker 1>Let's click. I'm not even gonna look at

00:34:11.195 --> 00:34:12.795
<v Speaker 1>the tutorial. I'm just gonna start clicking on

00:34:12.795 --> 00:34:15.969
<v Speaker 1>buttons. But alright, I've got question there. Clicking

00:34:16.289 --> 00:34:18.449
<v Speaker 2>yeah. I'll let you click everywhere if you

00:34:18.449 --> 00:34:20.449
<v Speaker 2>want. There is no problem. I'll let you

00:34:20.449 --> 00:34:22.849
<v Speaker 2>discovering the product and what you have to

00:34:23.489 --> 00:34:25.569
<v Speaker 2>so, yeah, what you have to do. But,

00:34:25.569 --> 00:34:27.409
<v Speaker 2>basically, here so maybe I can just give

00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:29.594
<v Speaker 2>some explanations, but you are getting into the

00:34:29.594 --> 00:34:31.594
<v Speaker 2>settings of your cluster. So we have a

00:34:31.594 --> 00:34:32.475
<v Speaker 2>concept,

00:34:33.195 --> 00:34:35.195
<v Speaker 2>what we call advanced settings. So we'll not

00:34:35.195 --> 00:34:37.594
<v Speaker 2>cover that. But, basically, once you have your

00:34:37.594 --> 00:34:39.915
<v Speaker 2>cluster that is ready, okay, you can start

00:34:39.915 --> 00:34:41.115
<v Speaker 2>deploying application.

00:34:41.355 --> 00:34:41.594
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:45.179
<v Speaker 2>And you see something very cool is that,

00:34:45.179 --> 00:34:47.260
<v Speaker 2>for instance, in my demo account, I have,

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:48.940
<v Speaker 2>like, dozens of clusters. So you can have

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:50.860
<v Speaker 2>clusters coming from anywhere,

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:51.900
<v Speaker 2>AWS,

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:53.660
<v Speaker 2>GCP, Scaleway,

00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:54.140
<v Speaker 2>Azure,

00:34:54.554 --> 00:34:56.954
<v Speaker 2>and you can plug them and unify the

00:34:56.954 --> 00:34:59.035
<v Speaker 2>work experience. That's why we have customers actually

00:34:59.035 --> 00:35:00.315
<v Speaker 2>that they're using Qovery.

00:35:00.555 --> 00:35:01.115
<v Speaker 2>So,

00:35:02.555 --> 00:35:04.555
<v Speaker 2>yeah, basically, yeah, you have to click here.

00:35:04.555 --> 00:35:06.954
<v Speaker 2>It's not super, so we are reworking on

00:35:06.954 --> 00:35:09.310
<v Speaker 2>that interface. But, yeah, that's exactly what you

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:10.590
<v Speaker 2>need to do, actually.

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:14.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna call it production.

00:35:15.069 --> 00:35:18.030
<v Speaker 1>Yep. I know it says I've got constraints,

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:19.310
<v Speaker 1>but I wanna know what those are. So

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:21.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna go straight and Yolo it.

00:35:22.589 --> 00:35:25.135
<v Speaker 2>Yep. I'm gonna click on settings first just

00:35:25.135 --> 00:35:26.335
<v Speaker 1>because I'm curious.

00:35:26.415 --> 00:35:28.255
<v Speaker 1>Uh-huh. Alright. Very nice.

00:35:29.535 --> 00:35:30.175
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:35:31.855 --> 00:35:34.015
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Yeah. I'm I'm starting to get a

00:35:34.015 --> 00:35:34.975
<v Speaker 1>feel for this now.

00:35:35.375 --> 00:35:37.855
<v Speaker 1>Cool. What can I deploy? Let me see.

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:43.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Nothing complicated.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.160
<v Speaker 2>Nothing complicated?

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.560
<v Speaker 2>So you can deploy an application

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:52.560
<v Speaker 2>coming from, a GitHub rep. So you can

00:35:51.675 --> 00:35:53.755
<v Speaker 2>you can take do you have some codes,

00:35:53.755 --> 00:35:55.515
<v Speaker 2>like, on your GitHub repository,

00:35:55.515 --> 00:35:56.155
<v Speaker 2>for instance?

00:35:56.795 --> 00:35:58.875
<v Speaker 1>Sorry. Can you say that again? Yeah. Do

00:35:58.875 --> 00:36:01.915
<v Speaker 2>you have any applications available on your GitHub

00:36:01.915 --> 00:36:02.955
<v Speaker 2>repository

00:36:02.955 --> 00:36:04.395
<v Speaker 2>on GitHub account?

00:36:05.195 --> 00:36:06.955
<v Speaker 1>You mean, like, a deployment dot YAML?

00:36:07.869 --> 00:36:09.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Or you can deploy oh, you can

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:11.630
<v Speaker 2>deploy your hand charts if you want. We

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:13.470
<v Speaker 2>have a very nice experience for that.

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:16.190
<v Speaker 2>You can deploy your container directly from a

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:19.070
<v Speaker 2>container registry. You can deploy an applications coming

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:22.505
<v Speaker 2>from GitHub. So Qovery will clone the repository

00:36:22.505 --> 00:36:23.865
<v Speaker 2>for you, build

00:36:24.185 --> 00:36:25.705
<v Speaker 2>if you have a Docker file and so

00:36:25.705 --> 00:36:27.065
<v Speaker 2>on and so forth. So you can really

00:36:27.065 --> 00:36:27.625
<v Speaker 2>choose.

00:36:28.025 --> 00:36:30.265
<v Speaker 2>So just put yourself, like, in the shoes

00:36:30.265 --> 00:36:32.745
<v Speaker 2>of a developer. Okay? You are software engineer.

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:35.369
<v Speaker 2>You are used to use a pass, and

00:36:35.369 --> 00:36:37.450
<v Speaker 2>you want to deploy in applications coming from

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:38.890
<v Speaker 2>your Git repository.

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:40.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:45.370
<v Speaker 1>Container registry.

00:36:46.089 --> 00:36:47.130
<v Speaker 1>New registry.

00:36:49.424 --> 00:36:51.345
<v Speaker 1>Get go away with password.

00:36:55.025 --> 00:36:56.625
<v Speaker 1>Anonymous is fine.

00:36:58.464 --> 00:37:00.305
<v Speaker 1>And image name, oh,

00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:06.170
<v Speaker 2>Rawkode.

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Mustard

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:12.810
<v Speaker 1>v one. I'm gonna just check back. Yeah.

00:37:15.035 --> 00:37:17.275
<v Speaker 2>That's a that's a that's a good thing

00:37:17.275 --> 00:37:19.755
<v Speaker 2>just to to take a look at. Yeah.

00:37:19.755 --> 00:37:20.475
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.

00:37:20.955 --> 00:37:21.435
<v Speaker 1>Just

00:37:21.835 --> 00:37:23.995
<v Speaker 1>V one and v two. And and okay.

00:37:23.995 --> 00:37:26.795
<v Speaker 2>What's the what's the the image name? Like,

00:37:26.795 --> 00:37:29.035
<v Speaker 2>because it's longer than just that, I do

00:37:29.035 --> 00:37:30.795
<v Speaker 2>think. Maybe it's the

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:34.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah. Oh, you find the tags as well.

00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:35.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Great. Absolutely.

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:38.690
<v Speaker 1>So we don't need to set that. It's

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:39.650
<v Speaker 1>all done for me.

00:37:42.924 --> 00:37:43.645
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:37:44.365 --> 00:37:45.484
<v Speaker 1>Deploy me.

00:37:49.805 --> 00:37:52.204
<v Speaker 2>Woah. That's a lot. Do you have enough,

00:37:52.204 --> 00:37:53.484
<v Speaker 2>like, in your current time?

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:58.070
<v Speaker 1>It's actually one core. Right? We we'll see.

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:00.230
<v Speaker 2>We'll see. Yeah. It's one core. Yeah. Absolutely.

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:02.790
<v Speaker 2>We'll see. We'll see. No problem if it's

00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:05.350
<v Speaker 2>not the case, actually. I mean,

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:09.190
<v Speaker 1>this is a this is a nice machine.

00:38:11.964 --> 00:38:12.925
<v Speaker 2>Lucky you.

00:38:13.484 --> 00:38:16.445
<v Speaker 1>I'm the CEO. Supposed to have course.

00:38:17.005 --> 00:38:18.845
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Now I'm the CEO. I'm not supposed

00:38:18.845 --> 00:38:20.365
<v Speaker 2>to have, like, a cool machine.

00:38:20.685 --> 00:38:22.445
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Although you can see, it's just all

00:38:22.445 --> 00:38:23.645
<v Speaker 1>good Google Chrome.

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:26.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I don't even use Chrome. I use

00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:27.650
<v Speaker 1>Firefox, but I have to use Chrome for

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:30.450
<v Speaker 1>streaming because not Firefox just can't do

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:33.570
<v Speaker 1>multimedia. It's awful. Awful. Awful.

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:34.930
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:38:35.089 --> 00:38:37.410
<v Speaker 1>It has a port six six six.

00:38:38.369 --> 00:38:39.970
<v Speaker 1>Let's publicly expose it.

00:38:40.905 --> 00:38:41.465
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:38:42.105 --> 00:38:42.745
<v Speaker 1>And

00:38:43.865 --> 00:38:45.465
<v Speaker 1>Cool. Cool. Yeah.

00:38:46.025 --> 00:38:48.905
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. You you can set that afterwards,

00:38:48.905 --> 00:38:51.705
<v Speaker 2>actually, so you don't need to necessarily just,

00:38:51.865 --> 00:38:54.860
<v Speaker 2>yeah, do anything. I'm just clicking on stuff

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:56.700
<v Speaker 1>now, to be honest. You're right. Just I'm

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:59.740
<v Speaker 1>just curious. So You're right. We can set

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:01.820
<v Speaker 2>the interface and see if the front end

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:03.100
<v Speaker 2>team is is

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:04.300
<v Speaker 2>good.

00:39:07.565 --> 00:39:09.325
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Let's see what happens.

00:39:09.805 --> 00:39:12.605
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. That's the most interesting part. So now

00:39:12.605 --> 00:39:13.805
<v Speaker 2>what you have done is that you have

00:39:13.805 --> 00:39:16.204
<v Speaker 2>created a service. And, actually, inside this environment,

00:39:16.204 --> 00:39:19.760
<v Speaker 2>you can create multiple services. So your database,

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.920
<v Speaker 2>your different stuff. Oh, there is an error.

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:22.960
<v Speaker 2>That's perfect.

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:23.840
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:25.760
<v Speaker 2>Okay. Hit one.

00:39:30.945 --> 00:39:33.585
<v Speaker 1>So we got the It says to look

00:39:33.585 --> 00:39:35.425
<v Speaker 1>at my deployment.

00:39:36.065 --> 00:39:37.425
<v Speaker 1>I mean, I thought I was looking at

00:39:37.425 --> 00:39:38.225
<v Speaker 1>my deployment.

00:39:38.465 --> 00:39:41.745
<v Speaker 2>But, actually, it's just yeah. That's the yeah.

00:39:41.745 --> 00:39:44.319
<v Speaker 2>You're already on that. I'm just I'm looking

00:39:44.319 --> 00:39:45.680
<v Speaker 2>at the fade,

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.920
<v Speaker 2>but we're all back into the version.

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.200
<v Speaker 1>And Built to matter image.

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.520
<v Speaker 2>What will be the error, actually? So if

00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.925
<v Speaker 2>you fade mirror image,

00:40:01.045 --> 00:40:02.484
<v Speaker 2>that's quite interesting.

00:40:03.285 --> 00:40:06.404
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure about this. So we can

00:40:06.404 --> 00:40:08.325
<v Speaker 2>we can dig we we can dig into

00:40:08.325 --> 00:40:09.685
<v Speaker 2>that together, actually.

00:40:10.484 --> 00:40:11.444
<v Speaker 1>I'm

00:40:11.444 --> 00:40:13.170
<v Speaker 1>just gonna make sure.

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:18.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. If you can just do that. But

00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:20.210
<v Speaker 2>we found the the image. So

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:24.450
<v Speaker 2>Must be the one.

00:40:25.625 --> 00:40:28.505
<v Speaker 1>Really? Yeah. Docker emojis aren't allowed to use

00:40:28.505 --> 00:40:29.465
<v Speaker 1>mixed case.

00:40:30.025 --> 00:40:30.905
<v Speaker 2>Oh,

00:40:31.065 --> 00:40:32.744
<v Speaker 2>that's I wonder if that's the problem. That's

00:40:32.744 --> 00:40:34.825
<v Speaker 2>that's that's a that's a good so I

00:40:34.825 --> 00:40:37.385
<v Speaker 2>will report back that to my team. So

00:40:37.385 --> 00:40:40.170
<v Speaker 2>they they need to be very good. Yeah.

00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:41.849
<v Speaker 2>So now you get to add add a

00:40:41.849 --> 00:40:44.410
<v Speaker 1>service. Right? So Yeah. You you you can't

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:46.890
<v Speaker 2>expect, like, developers just digging into that kind

00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:49.050
<v Speaker 2>of error. So when it happens,

00:40:49.849 --> 00:40:52.329
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of it's kind of messy for

00:40:52.329 --> 00:40:52.490
<v Speaker 2>them.

00:40:53.285 --> 00:40:55.285
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So it's now redeploying.

00:40:55.845 --> 00:40:57.205
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Absolutely.

00:40:57.285 --> 00:40:58.965
<v Speaker 2>So you can look at the logs.

00:41:04.245 --> 00:41:05.445
<v Speaker 1>It seems happier.

00:41:06.405 --> 00:41:08.325
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. You can look at the

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:11.630
<v Speaker 2>yeah, the details.

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:14.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Seems to be much, much, much happy

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:15.390
<v Speaker 2>happier.

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:16.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:19.310
<v Speaker 1>Well done. I'm now pulling it here.

00:41:21.875 --> 00:41:22.515
<v Speaker 2>You're now

00:41:23.075 --> 00:41:25.235
<v Speaker 2>Slowly pulling it here. But yeah.

00:41:29.875 --> 00:41:30.595
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:41:32.035 --> 00:41:33.555
<v Speaker 2>Oh, come on, Internet.

00:41:33.714 --> 00:41:34.994
<v Speaker 1>You're fast open this.

00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:38.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:41:39.809 --> 00:41:43.570
<v Speaker 2>That's a that's that's that's the counterpart of

00:41:43.809 --> 00:41:45.890
<v Speaker 2>of running that on your local machine. But

00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:47.250
<v Speaker 2>at least you you see and you get

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:48.930
<v Speaker 2>the experience, like, it's

00:41:49.775 --> 00:41:51.695
<v Speaker 1>Well, let's do some hellos while we wait.

00:41:51.695 --> 00:41:54.095
<v Speaker 1>So hello, Mozz. Welcome back. Good to see

00:41:54.095 --> 00:41:54.895
<v Speaker 1>you again.

00:41:55.455 --> 00:41:57.455
<v Speaker 1>Thank you. Yep. You were here last time

00:41:57.455 --> 00:41:59.375
<v Speaker 1>too. Thank you for joining us again. Thank

00:41:59.375 --> 00:41:59.855
<v Speaker 1>you.

00:42:00.255 --> 00:42:01.135
<v Speaker 1>And we have a question.

00:42:02.529 --> 00:42:04.849
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Y m o wants to know if

00:42:04.849 --> 00:42:07.089
<v Speaker 1>we're going to cover self hosting Qovery.

00:42:07.089 --> 00:42:07.570
<v Speaker 1>So

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:09.329
<v Speaker 1>I know you set the control plan as

00:42:09.329 --> 00:42:10.290
<v Speaker 1>an open source.

00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:12.130
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean for people that are

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:13.809
<v Speaker 1>in that kind of self hosting land?

00:42:14.934 --> 00:42:17.095
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. That's a very good question. Actually, we

00:42:17.095 --> 00:42:19.575
<v Speaker 2>are working on an enterprise version, like, for

00:42:19.974 --> 00:42:22.934
<v Speaker 2>next year. It's in our plan, like, just

00:42:22.934 --> 00:42:25.015
<v Speaker 2>to provide the ability to also self host

00:42:25.015 --> 00:42:26.135
<v Speaker 2>the control plane,

00:42:26.295 --> 00:42:27.255
<v Speaker 2>but only in

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:31.570
<v Speaker 2>enterprise, like, offer just for, like, security compliance

00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:34.770
<v Speaker 2>reasons, mostly bank, for instance. They need that.

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:37.010
<v Speaker 2>So, yeah, that's the options that we do.

00:42:41.205 --> 00:42:44.005
<v Speaker 1>Mozz has got a question for you. So

00:42:44.565 --> 00:42:47.205
<v Speaker 1>does Qovery support deployment to instances or virtual

00:42:47.205 --> 00:42:48.725
<v Speaker 1>machines? For instance,

00:42:48.805 --> 00:42:50.725
<v Speaker 1>can I manage

00:42:50.725 --> 00:42:52.645
<v Speaker 1>Ansible deployments with Qovery?

00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:55.790
<v Speaker 2>That's a very good, very good question. I

00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:58.190
<v Speaker 2>like that I like this question. Yeah. This

00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:00.430
<v Speaker 2>is real real world question,

00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:02.190
<v Speaker 2>and the response is yes.

00:43:02.590 --> 00:43:05.870
<v Speaker 2>Actually, Qovery is we use Kubernetes as, like,

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:09.065
<v Speaker 2>an orchestration layer, And you can deploy Terraform

00:43:09.065 --> 00:43:11.545
<v Speaker 2>script. You can deploy your own Terraform module.

00:43:11.545 --> 00:43:13.545
<v Speaker 2>You can deploy your CloudFormation

00:43:13.545 --> 00:43:15.065
<v Speaker 2>script, Handsible script.

00:43:15.385 --> 00:43:16.745
<v Speaker 2>You can deploy anything.

00:43:16.905 --> 00:43:18.984
<v Speaker 2>And I'm gonna show you, like, a much

00:43:18.984 --> 00:43:21.224
<v Speaker 2>more complete, if you want, a pipeline where

00:43:21.224 --> 00:43:23.750
<v Speaker 2>we deploy such things like different type of

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:26.150
<v Speaker 2>stuff. We even have customers actually that they

00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:28.310
<v Speaker 2>are only deploying Lambda application.

00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:29.270
<v Speaker 2>You imagine?

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:32.150
<v Speaker 2>So, actually, they use Kubernetes just as an

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:35.109
<v Speaker 2>orchestral year with Qovery, and they deploy Lambda

00:43:35.109 --> 00:43:35.990
<v Speaker 2>applications

00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:39.670
<v Speaker 2>for ephemeral environment to create dynamic environments for

00:43:38.925 --> 00:43:40.125
<v Speaker 2>testing purpose.

00:43:40.685 --> 00:43:42.285
<v Speaker 2>That's quite interesting. Right?

00:43:43.405 --> 00:43:45.805
<v Speaker 2>It's different, like, from the main use case

00:43:45.805 --> 00:43:47.245
<v Speaker 2>of using Kubernetes,

00:43:47.245 --> 00:43:50.525
<v Speaker 2>but Kubernetes is really good at just orchestrating

00:43:50.525 --> 00:43:51.405
<v Speaker 2>stuff.

00:43:51.565 --> 00:43:51.805
<v Speaker 2>So

00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:55.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I think that the Kubernetes model,

00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:58.430
<v Speaker 1>if you're comfortable and happy to write controllers

00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:00.430
<v Speaker 1>that can live in there and engage in

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:02.190
<v Speaker 1>that fashion, you can do a lot and

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:03.870
<v Speaker 1>build a lot of really powerful software on

00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:04.430
<v Speaker 1>top of it.

00:44:05.285 --> 00:44:06.645
<v Speaker 1>You know, I was just to talk about

00:44:06.645 --> 00:44:09.445
<v Speaker 1>SaltStack that like, before Kubernetes, SaltStack was one

00:44:09.445 --> 00:44:10.885
<v Speaker 1>of my favorite pieces of software, but I

00:44:10.885 --> 00:44:13.445
<v Speaker 1>excelled at that exact use case as well.

00:44:13.845 --> 00:44:16.165
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So Yeah. We have a deployment.

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:18.830
<v Speaker 2>That's very good. So you can click on

00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:20.270
<v Speaker 2>for the overview,

00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:21.070
<v Speaker 2>for instance.

00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:23.390
<v Speaker 2>And this is something interesting. So now you

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:25.310
<v Speaker 2>can just look at the you can open

00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:27.070
<v Speaker 2>the links. You see the links on the

00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:28.510
<v Speaker 2>the right the top right?

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:29.630
<v Speaker 1>Uh-huh. Yeah.

00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:32.030
<v Speaker 2>You can open this link. It will work.

00:44:32.904 --> 00:44:35.464
<v Speaker 2>Is that not found? Like oh, maybe your

00:44:35.464 --> 00:44:38.585
<v Speaker 2>machine is not like do you ex oh,

00:44:38.585 --> 00:44:39.224
<v Speaker 2>yeah.

00:44:39.704 --> 00:44:41.704
<v Speaker 2>Is that supposed to to work like these

00:44:41.704 --> 00:44:43.545
<v Speaker 2>things or not really?

00:44:44.025 --> 00:44:44.424
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:46.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Okay.

00:44:47.810 --> 00:44:48.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean

00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:51.810
<v Speaker 2>Is that working on your can you just

00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:52.930
<v Speaker 2>look at the

00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:54.530
<v Speaker 2>yeah. Quick. Quick. Quick.

00:44:57.585 --> 00:44:58.145
<v Speaker 1>Tick.

00:45:00.945 --> 00:45:01.425
<v Speaker 1>No. I

00:45:02.945 --> 00:45:05.105
<v Speaker 1>that's not gonna work because it's a cane

00:45:05.105 --> 00:45:07.505
<v Speaker 1>cluster. That's my oh, that is the cluster.

00:45:07.505 --> 00:45:09.505
<v Speaker 2>No. No. It's not the cluster. Yeah. You

00:45:09.505 --> 00:45:12.400
<v Speaker 2>can see the application. So it's running here.

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:12.960
<v Speaker 2>Yes.

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Mhmm. That's good. And Okay. So let's do

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Forward.

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:21.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Let's do that, and let's see. Apart.

00:45:28.135 --> 00:45:29.015
<v Speaker 1>666.

00:45:29.015 --> 00:45:31.335
<v Speaker 1>I'll just pick around 8080.

00:45:31.735 --> 00:45:32.375
<v Speaker 1>Oh.

00:45:32.695 --> 00:45:35.175
<v Speaker 2>Not found. Oh, the namespace? No. No. You

00:45:35.175 --> 00:45:36.935
<v Speaker 2>you missed the maybe the six.

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:40.700
<v Speaker 1>You still need No. It's just the namespace.

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:41.660
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:42.620
<v Speaker 2>But

00:45:44.619 --> 00:45:47.180
<v Speaker 2>the part is, like, four times six. Right?

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:50.540
<v Speaker 1>That's I know. I know it's three times

00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:52.540
<v Speaker 2>six or four times Three sixties.

00:45:54.125 --> 00:45:55.964
<v Speaker 1>Because it's part of custard, so it's the

00:45:55.964 --> 00:45:57.085
<v Speaker 1>number of the devil.

00:45:57.244 --> 00:45:58.365
<v Speaker 1>Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah.

00:46:00.204 --> 00:46:01.325
<v Speaker 2>That's a good one.

00:46:01.964 --> 00:46:03.645
<v Speaker 1>So that field

00:46:03.964 --> 00:46:05.165
<v Speaker 1>for binding reasons,

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:08.620
<v Speaker 1>means I probably got that the wrong way

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:10.940
<v Speaker 1>around. Right? Because it should

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:14.060
<v Speaker 1>I can never remember.

00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:17.740
<v Speaker 1>So

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:19.260
<v Speaker 1>local host.

00:46:21.585 --> 00:46:22.225
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:46:22.385 --> 00:46:24.065
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. It it works

00:46:24.225 --> 00:46:26.865
<v Speaker 2>that way. Can you try something for me?

00:46:27.425 --> 00:46:29.745
<v Speaker 2>You see you have the access info.

00:46:30.065 --> 00:46:31.265
<v Speaker 2>Just try something.

00:46:32.385 --> 00:46:33.025
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:46:33.185 --> 00:46:36.730
<v Speaker 2>You can local machine. So you have if

00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:38.970
<v Speaker 2>you you have a tab that is local

00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:41.370
<v Speaker 2>machine actually, so, Qovery, we do provide, like,

00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:43.210
<v Speaker 2>a way just to pull forward through

00:46:43.450 --> 00:46:45.690
<v Speaker 2>our CLI, and we have a system that

00:46:45.690 --> 00:46:48.490
<v Speaker 2>makes makes it possible because we install

00:46:49.075 --> 00:46:51.475
<v Speaker 2>a REST agent, like, that is forwarding

00:46:51.715 --> 00:46:53.635
<v Speaker 2>the thing through the control plane.

00:46:54.435 --> 00:46:56.755
<v Speaker 2>If you execute that command,

00:46:57.395 --> 00:46:58.675
<v Speaker 2>maybe that should be

00:47:00.355 --> 00:47:02.115
<v Speaker 2>the p, so it's something that is a

00:47:02.115 --> 00:47:04.035
<v Speaker 2>bit dumb, but we at the local.

00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:05.580
<v Speaker 2>And

00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:07.340
<v Speaker 2>yeah. Exactly.

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:13.660
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:16.220
<v Speaker 2>And now if you are doing local parts

00:47:19.105 --> 00:47:19.745
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:47:20.225 --> 00:47:21.745
<v Speaker 2>That's that's probably

00:47:22.705 --> 00:47:23.585
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's

00:47:24.065 --> 00:47:26.065
<v Speaker 2>maybe there is something that is not rooted,

00:47:26.065 --> 00:47:28.785
<v Speaker 2>like, properly, like, through this, yes, disengaged.

00:47:29.105 --> 00:47:29.665
<v Speaker 2>So

00:47:29.985 --> 00:47:31.905
<v Speaker 2>but, anyway actually, it works, so it's well

00:47:31.905 --> 00:47:34.220
<v Speaker 2>it's well, like, exposed. Right? Yeah.

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:37.579
<v Speaker 2>And that's something you see. Actually, if I'm

00:47:37.579 --> 00:47:37.900
<v Speaker 2>look

00:47:39.339 --> 00:47:41.100
<v Speaker 2>so that's quite fun, David.

00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:43.180
<v Speaker 2>If I'm doing this command, you give me

00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:45.020
<v Speaker 2>access to your organization and you give me

00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:46.859
<v Speaker 2>the permissions to do that, like, to your

00:47:46.859 --> 00:47:47.260
<v Speaker 2>application.

00:47:48.015 --> 00:47:49.535
<v Speaker 2>From my machine here,

00:47:49.934 --> 00:47:52.255
<v Speaker 2>I can connect to your your application.

00:47:53.934 --> 00:47:56.015
<v Speaker 1>Nice. So you're running some sort of proxy

00:47:56.015 --> 00:47:57.775
<v Speaker 1>in the cluster that Yeah. Handles all of

00:47:57.775 --> 00:48:00.654
<v Speaker 1>the traffic. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And it's the

00:48:00.654 --> 00:48:02.974
<v Speaker 2>reverse connection to the control plane. So everything

00:48:02.974 --> 00:48:05.490
<v Speaker 2>is transiting, like, the control plane, but nothing

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:07.570
<v Speaker 2>is stored in the control plane because we

00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:11.010
<v Speaker 2>don't store any information for security purpose. So

00:48:11.010 --> 00:48:13.090
<v Speaker 2>it's all just proxy.

00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:18.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So I'm I'm I'm curious. Right?

00:48:21.145 --> 00:48:22.825
<v Speaker 1>We have deployed something.

00:48:23.385 --> 00:48:25.785
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. We've got a bunch of variables, some

00:48:25.785 --> 00:48:27.305
<v Speaker 1>of which I set myself.

00:48:28.105 --> 00:48:28.744
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:48:29.625 --> 00:48:31.945
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't actually see a way

00:48:33.625 --> 00:48:35.224
<v Speaker 1>to expose these

00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:37.600
<v Speaker 1>to the workload?

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:42.960
<v Speaker 1>To expose the the environment Yeah.

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:44.720
<v Speaker 1>How how do I add the environment variable

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:45.680
<v Speaker 1>to the workload?

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:48.640
<v Speaker 2>Actually, they are they are. Like, they are

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.694
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be in the workload. So Oh,

00:48:50.694 --> 00:48:52.375
<v Speaker 1>they are? Okay. So that's just done

00:48:52.775 --> 00:48:55.575
<v Speaker 1>for me. Yeah. The yeah. Again, put yourself

00:48:55.575 --> 00:48:57.495
<v Speaker 2>in the shoes of a developer.

00:48:57.815 --> 00:49:00.934
<v Speaker 2>They add environment variables. They add secrets. They

00:49:00.934 --> 00:49:02.055
<v Speaker 2>want just to see them.

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:06.140
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Then I put this to you then.

00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:08.859
<v Speaker 1>One of the biggest frustration and I work

00:49:08.859 --> 00:49:10.220
<v Speaker 1>with a lot of people that need help

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:11.260
<v Speaker 1>with Kubernetes.

00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:13.579
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. One of the biggest frustrations is they

00:49:13.579 --> 00:49:15.819
<v Speaker 1>have an environment variable or a config map,

00:49:15.819 --> 00:49:17.420
<v Speaker 1>and they come in and they say, okay.

00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Actually, that value is wrong,

00:49:20.035 --> 00:49:21.475
<v Speaker 1>and they save it.

00:49:22.115 --> 00:49:24.355
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So you offer to redeploy that for

00:49:24.355 --> 00:49:26.675
<v Speaker 1>me? Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.

00:49:26.995 --> 00:49:29.235
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Is there any status here that says

00:49:29.235 --> 00:49:30.035
<v Speaker 1>this is

00:49:30.755 --> 00:49:31.715
<v Speaker 1>sync? Yeah. You

00:49:33.635 --> 00:49:35.910
<v Speaker 2>have, like, you are supposed to have a

00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:37.750
<v Speaker 2>probably, like, you just a bar, like, saying

00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:39.349
<v Speaker 2>that you have to redeploy. For the environment

00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:41.830
<v Speaker 2>viable, maybe not. But if you are changing

00:49:41.830 --> 00:49:43.670
<v Speaker 2>any things like else, yes.

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.550
<v Speaker 2>But,

00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:47.190
<v Speaker 2>yeah, you get the live status. So if

00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:48.869
<v Speaker 2>you are redeploying, you get the live status

00:49:48.869 --> 00:49:51.395
<v Speaker 2>and info from your your application. Yeah.

00:49:52.355 --> 00:49:54.675
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So okay. Now it's telling me that

00:49:54.675 --> 00:49:57.235
<v Speaker 1>this needs to be deployed for those changes.

00:49:57.635 --> 00:49:58.755
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Okay.

00:49:59.715 --> 00:50:01.315
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Go for it.

00:50:02.035 --> 00:50:03.155
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Absolutely.

00:50:04.115 --> 00:50:04.515
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:07.730
<v Speaker 2>So there is something also, like, that that

00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:10.050
<v Speaker 2>you you didn't click on is the service

00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:12.130
<v Speaker 2>logs. So you can see also, like, the

00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:14.370
<v Speaker 2>logs in real time of your application. You

00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:17.010
<v Speaker 2>have the tabs just to write to to

00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:18.450
<v Speaker 2>deployment logs, actually.

00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:21.735
<v Speaker 2>So, yeah, it was just next to

00:50:22.214 --> 00:50:24.454
<v Speaker 2>Mhmm. You have two tabs, deployment logs and

00:50:24.454 --> 00:50:25.255
<v Speaker 2>service logs.

00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:35.680
<v Speaker 1>Where's the service box? Oh, yeah. It was,

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:37.680
<v Speaker 2>yeah, it was exactly in the same. You

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.040
<v Speaker 2>see, you have two tabs

00:50:39.599 --> 00:50:41.839
<v Speaker 2>here. No. Actually, when you are just in

00:50:41.839 --> 00:50:43.520
<v Speaker 2>that in that console screen,

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:46.775
<v Speaker 2>there's there's two tabs. I know that it's

00:50:46.775 --> 00:50:48.375
<v Speaker 2>a bit confusing. That's something that we are

00:50:48.375 --> 00:50:49.175
<v Speaker 2>working on,

00:50:49.655 --> 00:50:50.215
<v Speaker 2>but

00:50:50.535 --> 00:50:52.615
<v Speaker 2>you can just yeah. If you go you

00:50:52.615 --> 00:50:54.215
<v Speaker 2>go back, like, to the logs.

00:50:55.735 --> 00:50:58.695
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Oh, right. Yes. Yes.

00:50:58.775 --> 00:50:59.495
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.

00:50:59.575 --> 00:51:01.830
<v Speaker 2>Right. Exactly. That's a bit confusing. Yeah. Yeah.

00:51:01.830 --> 00:51:03.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know. Yeah. I completely

00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:04.710
<v Speaker 1>missed that. I just

00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:07.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Right over my head. Service logs is

00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:09.190
<v Speaker 2>the logs, the live logs. Like, if you

00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:11.590
<v Speaker 2>were, like, doing Kube CTLs logs,

00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:12.230
<v Speaker 2>basically,

00:51:14.145 --> 00:51:15.985
<v Speaker 2>that you get, but in much more, like,

00:51:15.985 --> 00:51:17.025
<v Speaker 2>a detailed way.

00:51:18.065 --> 00:51:19.105
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Yeah.

00:51:20.065 --> 00:51:20.785
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.

00:51:21.185 --> 00:51:22.145
<v Speaker 1>That's nice.

00:51:22.625 --> 00:51:24.785
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. And this is transitioning

00:51:24.785 --> 00:51:26.625
<v Speaker 2>from directly the

00:51:27.025 --> 00:51:27.425
<v Speaker 2>so

00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:31.270
<v Speaker 2>from the control plane again. You see? So

00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I can switch pods.

00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:37.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean, I've only got one. Okay. That's

00:51:37.590 --> 00:51:39.030
<v Speaker 1>a really cool feature. I wanna play with

00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:41.190
<v Speaker 1>that. So I'm gonna come into my settings,

00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:42.070
<v Speaker 1>and I'm gonna say,

00:51:43.105 --> 00:51:44.785
<v Speaker 1>how do I scale this up?

00:51:46.545 --> 00:51:47.345
<v Speaker 1>Give

00:51:48.305 --> 00:51:49.745
<v Speaker 1>me three,

00:51:50.385 --> 00:51:52.065
<v Speaker 1>five. So I'm assuming this

00:51:52.705 --> 00:51:55.585
<v Speaker 1>see, the existence of InstanceMen and InstanceMax

00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:57.569
<v Speaker 1>tells me that there's probably some sort of

00:51:57.569 --> 00:51:59.650
<v Speaker 1>auto scaling that's being managed for me. I

00:51:59.650 --> 00:52:01.809
<v Speaker 1>haven't seen a way to set thresholds or

00:52:01.809 --> 00:52:03.569
<v Speaker 1>settings yet, so maybe you can lean into

00:52:03.569 --> 00:52:05.089
<v Speaker 1>that a little bit. But I just wanna

00:52:05.089 --> 00:52:07.010
<v Speaker 1>spend up more than one because if that

00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:08.609
<v Speaker 1>does what I think it does from the

00:52:08.609 --> 00:52:10.210
<v Speaker 1>terminal point of view, that's really cool.

00:52:10.865 --> 00:52:12.224
<v Speaker 1>But maybe you can tell us a little

00:52:12.224 --> 00:52:12.945
<v Speaker 1>bit about

00:52:14.464 --> 00:52:15.905
<v Speaker 1>where was that thing?

00:52:16.224 --> 00:52:16.945
<v Speaker 1>Services,

00:52:17.184 --> 00:52:17.744
<v Speaker 1>cluster

00:52:17.984 --> 00:52:19.345
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Settings.

00:52:19.345 --> 00:52:21.505
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So we have the ability to set

00:52:21.505 --> 00:52:22.545
<v Speaker 1>meta and max.

00:52:22.785 --> 00:52:24.865
<v Speaker 1>Do you handle auto scaling as part of

00:52:24.865 --> 00:52:26.970
<v Speaker 1>your control plan? Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.

00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:29.930
<v Speaker 2>So the way it works is you can

00:52:30.010 --> 00:52:31.850
<v Speaker 2>so you have the default values. You can't

00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:34.250
<v Speaker 2>cover it as a video game. Okay? We

00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:36.410
<v Speaker 2>cover, like, 90% of your need

00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:38.890
<v Speaker 2>out of the box. Okay? We are just,

00:52:38.890 --> 00:52:41.050
<v Speaker 2>like, doing the things the way that most

00:52:41.050 --> 00:52:44.005
<v Speaker 2>people do. Then if you need to change

00:52:44.005 --> 00:52:46.645
<v Speaker 2>some internal parameters, you can get into the

00:52:46.645 --> 00:52:48.885
<v Speaker 2>advanced settings. So you see the tab that

00:52:48.885 --> 00:52:51.205
<v Speaker 2>you have on the left, advanced settings?

00:52:51.525 --> 00:52:53.365
<v Speaker 2>You can get into that. And this is

00:52:53.365 --> 00:52:54.965
<v Speaker 2>where you can start to tweak, like, the

00:52:54.965 --> 00:52:57.445
<v Speaker 2>internals and change, like, some specific parameters.

00:52:57.869 --> 00:53:00.670
<v Speaker 2>It's a key value stores like a system.

00:53:02.349 --> 00:53:04.589
<v Speaker 2>And, basically, you have HPA.

00:53:05.309 --> 00:53:07.309
<v Speaker 2>Like so if you are looking so if

00:53:07.309 --> 00:53:08.990
<v Speaker 2>you search for HPA,

00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:12.985
<v Speaker 2>you can you can find, like, the the

00:53:12.985 --> 00:53:15.785
<v Speaker 2>the way just to to change also, like,

00:53:15.785 --> 00:53:18.185
<v Speaker 2>the percent like, the CPU percentage for the

00:53:18.185 --> 00:53:19.465
<v Speaker 2>auto scaling part.

00:53:19.625 --> 00:53:20.425
<v Speaker 2>You see?

00:53:21.305 --> 00:53:21.945
<v Speaker 2>So,

00:53:22.425 --> 00:53:23.065
<v Speaker 2>yeah,

00:53:23.305 --> 00:53:25.625
<v Speaker 2>those are elements that we add

00:53:26.369 --> 00:53:29.650
<v Speaker 2>depending on, like, what our customers want and

00:53:29.890 --> 00:53:33.490
<v Speaker 2>yeah. Exactly. Recreate recreate is is available.

00:53:33.970 --> 00:53:35.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna break stuff now because it

00:53:35.890 --> 00:53:37.970
<v Speaker 1>was fun. No. That's good. That's good. Breaking

00:53:37.970 --> 00:53:40.265
<v Speaker 2>is good. I've turned on read only file

00:53:40.265 --> 00:53:42.585
<v Speaker 1>system. The application doesn't touch the file system,

00:53:42.585 --> 00:53:43.705
<v Speaker 1>so we should be alright.

00:53:44.745 --> 00:53:47.305
<v Speaker 1>I changed the deployment model to recreate,

00:53:47.305 --> 00:53:49.145
<v Speaker 1>which should speed up my deploys. But, obviously,

00:53:49.145 --> 00:53:51.225
<v Speaker 1>I'll I'll sacrifice and accept some downtime.

00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:55.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't wanna redeploy it just because, you

00:53:55.950 --> 00:53:57.390
<v Speaker 1>know, we have a deployment that I wanna

00:53:57.390 --> 00:54:00.110
<v Speaker 1>play with first. Right? So we can now

00:54:00.110 --> 00:54:01.790
<v Speaker 1>see that I have three pods.

00:54:02.350 --> 00:54:02.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:05.790
<v Speaker 1>And the thing that piqued my interest

00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:08.190
<v Speaker 1>was

00:54:07.275 --> 00:54:08.315
<v Speaker 1>this. Yeah. That's

00:54:09.674 --> 00:54:10.395
<v Speaker 1>so

00:54:11.194 --> 00:54:13.194
<v Speaker 1>oh, now I'm in the wrong pod. Okay.

00:54:13.194 --> 00:54:16.395
<v Speaker 1>Let's pop over here. Ah, that's nice. Okay.

00:54:16.954 --> 00:54:17.755
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:54:17.915 --> 00:54:18.795
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.

00:54:19.035 --> 00:54:21.035
<v Speaker 2>Okay. That's a nice it's such a I'm

00:54:21.035 --> 00:54:21.915
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure

00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:24.359
<v Speaker 1>it's a simple feature in the back end

00:54:24.359 --> 00:54:26.040
<v Speaker 1>and all that. But to me, that's just

00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:27.640
<v Speaker 1>one of those, you know, when I find

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:29.240
<v Speaker 1>a quality of life thing like that, it

00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:31.240
<v Speaker 1>just makes me happy because it shows that

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:33.560
<v Speaker 1>people understand how hard it is to debug,

00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:34.760
<v Speaker 1>and you need to be able to switch

00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:37.160
<v Speaker 1>context, especially across pods within services.

00:54:37.645 --> 00:54:40.525
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I'm so interested about it. So Even

00:54:40.525 --> 00:54:41.725
<v Speaker 2>even developers.

00:54:41.965 --> 00:54:43.725
<v Speaker 2>And just to to tell you, like, this

00:54:43.725 --> 00:54:45.885
<v Speaker 2>feature is not, like, an easy feature

00:54:46.205 --> 00:54:48.125
<v Speaker 2>because it works again, like, in real time.

00:54:48.125 --> 00:54:50.765
<v Speaker 2>It's IO, and we are playing. So I

00:54:50.765 --> 00:54:53.610
<v Speaker 2>know that my one of my staff, a

00:54:53.610 --> 00:54:55.850
<v Speaker 2>back end engineer, explained how we he did

00:54:55.850 --> 00:54:58.170
<v Speaker 2>that. So it's written in in Rust again,

00:54:58.410 --> 00:55:01.290
<v Speaker 2>and he's interacting directly with the Kubernetes API

00:55:01.290 --> 00:55:03.450
<v Speaker 2>just to stream the the input and the

00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:05.370
<v Speaker 2>output. But you have, like, some restriction,

00:55:06.045 --> 00:55:08.365
<v Speaker 2>and, also, you need to transfer back the

00:55:08.365 --> 00:55:10.684
<v Speaker 2>information to the control plane. The control plane

00:55:10.684 --> 00:55:12.925
<v Speaker 2>needs to transfer back those information in real

00:55:12.925 --> 00:55:14.525
<v Speaker 2>time via WebSocket

00:55:14.684 --> 00:55:15.405
<v Speaker 2>to,

00:55:15.484 --> 00:55:18.300
<v Speaker 2>like, the the browser. You see? So there

00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:20.460
<v Speaker 2>is some challenges, and we have some customers

00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:22.300
<v Speaker 2>that they are doing some crazy stuff, like

00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:23.500
<v Speaker 2>just streaming,

00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:26.300
<v Speaker 2>for instance, megabytes of data, you know, doing

00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:29.260
<v Speaker 2>those tail stuff. And and this is the

00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:30.140
<v Speaker 2>type of, like,

00:55:31.155 --> 00:55:33.875
<v Speaker 2>experience that just overload, like, the whole system

00:55:33.875 --> 00:55:36.675
<v Speaker 2>that can overload the system. So if it's

00:55:36.675 --> 00:55:38.595
<v Speaker 2>not, like, tailored, like, the right way. But,

00:55:38.595 --> 00:55:39.235
<v Speaker 2>anyway,

00:55:40.115 --> 00:55:40.515
<v Speaker 2>that's

00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:46.230
<v Speaker 1>I am now watching it stop all three

00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:47.910
<v Speaker 1>instances at the same time and, hopefully, spin

00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:50.230
<v Speaker 1>up three more for some pretty tightened up

00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:51.510
<v Speaker 1>resource restrictions.

00:55:51.830 --> 00:55:53.990
<v Speaker 1>But let's tackle a couple of questions just

00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:57.095
<v Speaker 1>now as well. So Mozz asked, is there

00:55:57.095 --> 00:55:59.494
<v Speaker 1>an ingress controller here? How are we handling

00:55:59.494 --> 00:56:00.855
<v Speaker 1>traffic to the cluster?

00:56:01.655 --> 00:56:04.214
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. There is an ingress controller. Yeah. Absolutely.

00:56:04.214 --> 00:56:05.895
<v Speaker 2>It's a ingress controller.

00:56:06.375 --> 00:56:08.375
<v Speaker 2>And, actually, when you install Qovery on your

00:56:08.375 --> 00:56:11.090
<v Speaker 2>Kubernetes cluster, you can tweak. So something that

00:56:11.090 --> 00:56:13.490
<v Speaker 2>you didn't see, David, because you are using

00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:15.490
<v Speaker 2>the demo mode, is that when you do

00:56:15.490 --> 00:56:17.810
<v Speaker 2>generate, like, for real, the configuration

00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:20.450
<v Speaker 2>with the CLI, the QCRI for your Kubernetes

00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:23.490
<v Speaker 2>cluster, actually, Qovery do generate for you the

00:56:23.490 --> 00:56:23.890
<v Speaker 2>final

00:56:24.714 --> 00:56:27.275
<v Speaker 2>hem charts, like hem values file. So you

00:56:27.275 --> 00:56:29.194
<v Speaker 2>can apply, you can change the parameters, and

00:56:29.194 --> 00:56:31.435
<v Speaker 2>you have access to those parameters like the

00:56:31.435 --> 00:56:33.915
<v Speaker 2>engine's eGAS controller and so on and forth.

00:56:35.435 --> 00:56:36.075
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:56:36.795 --> 00:56:39.330
<v Speaker 1>I wanna make sure I understood that. So

00:56:41.090 --> 00:56:43.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Let's pop over to production. Let's say

00:56:43.330 --> 00:56:44.530
<v Speaker 1>new service.

00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:45.570
<v Speaker 1>You're saying

00:56:45.810 --> 00:56:47.330
<v Speaker 1>if I pick a Helm chart, which I'm

00:56:47.330 --> 00:56:48.450
<v Speaker 1>assuming Postgres,

00:56:48.450 --> 00:56:49.730
<v Speaker 1>is that a Helm chart?

00:56:50.610 --> 00:56:52.930
<v Speaker 2>So it's a it's a yeah.

00:56:53.115 --> 00:56:54.875
<v Speaker 2>Under the hood, it's a it's a hand

00:56:54.875 --> 00:56:56.555
<v Speaker 2>chart. You're right. You're right.

00:56:58.475 --> 00:57:01.195
<v Speaker 2>But here, it's a it's a prebuilt, like,

00:57:01.195 --> 00:57:03.035
<v Speaker 2>hand chart. So we are doing so you

00:57:03.035 --> 00:57:05.435
<v Speaker 2>see, like, this fancy interface for developers that

00:57:05.435 --> 00:57:07.380
<v Speaker 2>they can use. But if you want to

00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:09.940
<v Speaker 2>deploy your Hemcharts, you if you want, you

00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:11.780
<v Speaker 2>can go just up, and you see you

00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:12.900
<v Speaker 2>have the Hem yeah.

00:57:13.859 --> 00:57:16.339
<v Speaker 2>And Hem integration is very good. Like, it's

00:57:16.339 --> 00:57:17.540
<v Speaker 2>very people,

00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:19.425
<v Speaker 2>most of the time, when they see how

00:57:19.425 --> 00:57:21.505
<v Speaker 2>we deintegrate that, they they really love, like,

00:57:21.505 --> 00:57:22.945
<v Speaker 2>even DevOps engineers,

00:57:23.185 --> 00:57:23.985
<v Speaker 2>actually.

00:57:25.105 --> 00:57:25.745
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:57:27.025 --> 00:57:28.625
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I don't know where they are.

00:57:30.065 --> 00:57:31.505
<v Speaker 2>So it's TTPS probably,

00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:33.860
<v Speaker 2>I do think. Yeah.

00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:37.140
<v Speaker 1>Art backup.

00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if we can get our final

00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:41.860
<v Speaker 1>one.

00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:44.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:57:45.045 --> 00:57:47.285
<v Speaker 1>And we have their own chart. Okay. I

00:57:47.285 --> 00:57:48.485
<v Speaker 2>love this product.

00:57:50.565 --> 00:57:52.405
<v Speaker 2>I'm spending 20%

00:57:52.405 --> 00:57:55.525
<v Speaker 2>of my day on Grafana looking at statistics

00:57:55.525 --> 00:57:57.365
<v Speaker 2>of stuff to report.

00:57:58.165 --> 00:57:59.125
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's

00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:00.720
<v Speaker 1>fantastic.

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:02.800
<v Speaker 1>So alright. So you got the repository. You

00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:04.640
<v Speaker 1>scanned it and pulled down all the charts,

00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:06.160
<v Speaker 1>which I'm appreciating.

00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Nice.

00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:10.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. It's Grafana.

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:13.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Oh, let's go with Grafana.

00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Latest.

00:58:16.905 --> 00:58:19.625
<v Speaker 2>And something that you didn't notice, probably, David,

00:58:19.625 --> 00:58:21.145
<v Speaker 2>is that when you are looking, you know,

00:58:21.145 --> 00:58:24.585
<v Speaker 2>all those elements, version, Grafana, the chart name,

00:58:24.585 --> 00:58:27.145
<v Speaker 2>you can type directly with your your keyboard.

00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:29.549
<v Speaker 2>Actually, it will work, and it will filter

00:58:29.549 --> 00:58:32.750
<v Speaker 2>automatically, like, the the elements for you. Ah.

00:58:33.309 --> 00:58:35.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. So you can type directly the the

00:58:35.230 --> 00:58:37.390
<v Speaker 2>comment. That's something probably we need to improve

00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:39.310
<v Speaker 2>in the design system that we have.

00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:41.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Oh, nice. Okay.

00:58:46.085 --> 00:58:47.685
<v Speaker 2>So I break everything.

00:58:47.845 --> 00:58:48.325
<v Speaker 2>I

00:58:49.925 --> 00:58:50.245
<v Speaker 2>I

00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:58.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Oh, okay. So if I have a

00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:00.880
<v Speaker 1>values file in either my own GAML or

00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:02.400
<v Speaker 1>a public repository. Yeah.

00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:05.040
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely. And you you want to see something

00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:07.760
<v Speaker 2>very nice? Yeah. It's the whole mode, like

00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:08.800
<v Speaker 2>the whole YAML mode.

00:59:09.684 --> 00:59:12.085
<v Speaker 2>So he yes. And you create override.

00:59:12.085 --> 00:59:13.925
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. And here, we do load

00:59:14.165 --> 00:59:16.805
<v Speaker 2>to have the different values for you. Yeah.

00:59:16.805 --> 00:59:18.724
<v Speaker 2>And you can create your own one, like,

00:59:18.724 --> 00:59:20.325
<v Speaker 2>on the left. So it's good, like, just

00:59:20.325 --> 00:59:23.045
<v Speaker 2>to kick start quickly and do the stuff.

00:59:24.190 --> 00:59:26.350
<v Speaker 1>You need to add a feature where there's

00:59:26.350 --> 00:59:28.110
<v Speaker 1>a little arrow here, and I click it,

00:59:28.110 --> 00:59:30.590
<v Speaker 1>and it copies it over here. That's

00:59:30.590 --> 00:59:33.070
<v Speaker 2>that's a very good yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.

00:59:33.070 --> 00:59:33.630
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.

00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:37.285
<v Speaker 1>Alright. I'm not I I want I think

00:59:37.285 --> 00:59:37.605
<v Speaker 2>you might

00:59:38.165 --> 00:59:40.405
<v Speaker 2>for the developer, they will just hate you.

00:59:43.045 --> 00:59:44.645
<v Speaker 2>But at least in terms of experience, it

00:59:44.645 --> 00:59:45.845
<v Speaker 2>will be very

00:59:46.165 --> 00:59:46.805
<v Speaker 2>nice.

00:59:48.165 --> 00:59:48.805
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Go.

00:59:53.980 --> 00:59:56.859
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Another question from Miles while we wait

00:59:56.859 --> 00:59:57.820
<v Speaker 1>for to

00:59:57.820 --> 01:00:00.619
<v Speaker 1>to roll out. Do you support backup and

01:00:00.619 --> 01:00:02.540
<v Speaker 1>restore of persistent volumes?

01:00:04.875 --> 01:00:05.435
<v Speaker 2>So

01:00:05.675 --> 01:00:08.715
<v Speaker 2>we have also, we support, like, persistent volume

01:00:08.715 --> 01:00:11.275
<v Speaker 2>first. So you can add persistent volumes to

01:00:11.275 --> 01:00:13.755
<v Speaker 2>your application. You have an option to, like,

01:00:13.755 --> 01:00:16.555
<v Speaker 2>all the settings of your apps. Like, yes,

01:00:16.555 --> 01:00:18.715
<v Speaker 2>the settings, storage. Yes. Exactly.

01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:21.809
<v Speaker 2>Oh, that's something that is disable disable, like,

01:00:21.809 --> 01:00:24.369
<v Speaker 2>probably. Okay. Yeah. Probably because it's the demo

01:00:24.369 --> 01:00:26.369
<v Speaker 2>mode, and we have, like, some features that

01:00:26.369 --> 01:00:28.450
<v Speaker 2>you can add on the end values, because

01:00:28.450 --> 01:00:30.690
<v Speaker 2>you need to define, like, the storage type.

01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:31.970
<v Speaker 2>I do think that's the reason.

01:00:33.775 --> 01:00:36.895
<v Speaker 2>In terms of automatic backup and restoration,

01:00:36.895 --> 01:00:38.575
<v Speaker 2>no. We do not support that.

01:00:39.375 --> 01:00:41.375
<v Speaker 2>We didn't have, like, any request, and that's

01:00:41.375 --> 01:00:43.055
<v Speaker 2>the way also we work is that we

01:00:43.295 --> 01:00:44.975
<v Speaker 2>obviously, there's so many things that we can

01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:47.190
<v Speaker 2>do. The way we work is that we

01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:48.550
<v Speaker 2>have a public road map, and we are

01:00:48.550 --> 01:00:50.390
<v Speaker 2>very close to our customers so they can

01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:52.150
<v Speaker 2>just report back, like, the things that they

01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:52.790
<v Speaker 2>want

01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:54.390
<v Speaker 2>or they might want, and they can do

01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:55.190
<v Speaker 2>that. But

01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:58.390
<v Speaker 2>if there is a specific features into Qovery

01:00:58.390 --> 01:01:00.230
<v Speaker 2>that makes, like, everything possible,

01:01:00.845 --> 01:01:03.244
<v Speaker 2>is can you just show

01:01:03.325 --> 01:01:03.964
<v Speaker 2>this

01:01:04.204 --> 01:01:06.045
<v Speaker 2>maybe, David? So if you go back to

01:01:06.045 --> 01:01:07.165
<v Speaker 2>create a service

01:01:07.644 --> 01:01:09.085
<v Speaker 2>instead of creating a

01:01:10.204 --> 01:01:12.444
<v Speaker 2>so, yeah, if you go back here, new

01:01:12.444 --> 01:01:13.085
<v Speaker 2>service.

01:01:13.325 --> 01:01:16.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. You have the life cycle job. The

01:01:16.070 --> 01:01:17.990
<v Speaker 2>life cycle job is a

01:01:18.550 --> 01:01:19.990
<v Speaker 2>is a is a is

01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:22.790
<v Speaker 2>is basically a container that you will provide

01:01:22.790 --> 01:01:24.550
<v Speaker 2>so it could come from, like, a git

01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:27.670
<v Speaker 2>repository or container history where we'll execute that

01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:29.910
<v Speaker 2>task. So you can specify actions,

01:01:30.605 --> 01:01:32.525
<v Speaker 2>and we can and you can build your

01:01:32.525 --> 01:01:34.845
<v Speaker 2>own pipeline and your own stuff. So, basically,

01:01:34.845 --> 01:01:36.845
<v Speaker 2>you can execute comments. So let's say you

01:01:36.845 --> 01:01:38.845
<v Speaker 2>want to automatically backup

01:01:38.924 --> 01:01:40.765
<v Speaker 2>and restore stuff and you want to create

01:01:40.765 --> 01:01:43.005
<v Speaker 2>an action for that, you can do it,

01:01:43.005 --> 01:01:45.330
<v Speaker 2>and you can automate the whole process. That's

01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:47.570
<v Speaker 2>the way that, things like everything

01:01:48.050 --> 01:01:50.770
<v Speaker 2>possible, basically. Yeah. I hope I'm responding to

01:01:50.770 --> 01:01:51.890
<v Speaker 2>your question, Moses.

01:01:53.330 --> 01:01:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Thanks.

01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:58.325
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I didn't really when we came to

01:01:58.325 --> 01:01:59.845
<v Speaker 1>this page, I didn't pay a lot of

01:01:59.845 --> 01:02:01.365
<v Speaker 1>attention to the first ones. I went straight

01:02:01.365 --> 01:02:03.605
<v Speaker 1>down to, like, okay. What's difficult to deploy?

01:02:03.605 --> 01:02:04.165
<v Speaker 1>But,

01:02:04.724 --> 01:02:06.405
<v Speaker 1>yeah, life cycle jobs are

01:02:06.724 --> 01:02:07.925
<v Speaker 1>that's a neat feature.

01:02:08.244 --> 01:02:09.285
<v Speaker 1>Databases.

01:02:10.005 --> 01:02:10.724
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:02:10.885 --> 01:02:11.525
<v Speaker 1>Nice. Okay.

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:14.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. And when you are running on your

01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:16.740
<v Speaker 2>own so if you use the query manage

01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:20.260
<v Speaker 2>option, let's say you run that into AWS,

01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:22.900
<v Speaker 2>you will get access to the manage databases

01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:23.620
<v Speaker 2>as well.

01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:26.725
<v Speaker 2>So meaning that here, we'll in just one

01:02:26.725 --> 01:02:28.885
<v Speaker 2>click, you can put in manage database, manage

01:02:28.885 --> 01:02:30.565
<v Speaker 2>progress, RDS.

01:02:30.725 --> 01:02:31.925
<v Speaker 1>Right. Okay. Yeah.

01:02:33.685 --> 01:02:36.405
<v Speaker 2>Which is convenient, like, for companies. Again, remember,

01:02:36.405 --> 01:02:38.885
<v Speaker 2>like, the perfect scenario is companies that they

01:02:38.885 --> 01:02:40.565
<v Speaker 2>are coming out of past. They wants to

01:02:40.565 --> 01:02:42.450
<v Speaker 2>move into The US. They are not super

01:02:42.450 --> 01:02:44.369
<v Speaker 2>familiar with all of that, so they just

01:02:44.369 --> 01:02:46.050
<v Speaker 2>wants to to deal with that.

01:02:46.770 --> 01:02:47.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

01:02:47.970 --> 01:02:49.170
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So,

01:02:51.010 --> 01:02:53.010
<v Speaker 1>again, I'm just clicking on stuff,

01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:54.530
<v Speaker 1>but I'm curious because

01:02:55.125 --> 01:02:56.485
<v Speaker 2>Tell you. You're curious.

01:02:57.605 --> 01:02:59.285
<v Speaker 1>Well, I mean, that just means I'm excited.

01:02:59.285 --> 01:03:00.885
<v Speaker 1>Right? I'm enjoying what I'm seeing.

01:03:01.365 --> 01:03:01.925
<v Speaker 1>So

01:03:02.245 --> 01:03:04.405
<v Speaker 1>having built a lot of platforms,

01:03:05.285 --> 01:03:07.605
<v Speaker 1>what happens is, you know, we roll out

01:03:07.605 --> 01:03:08.005
<v Speaker 1>production.

01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:10.500
<v Speaker 1>We're all happy with it. At some point,

01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:12.340
<v Speaker 1>we need the staging environment. And what I

01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:13.620
<v Speaker 1>was hoping to see when I clicked I

01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:15.140
<v Speaker 1>mean, export is TerraFarm is nice. Right? I

01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:16.740
<v Speaker 1>wanna take into that a minute. I was

01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:18.500
<v Speaker 1>hoping for, like, a clone

01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:19.780
<v Speaker 1>to staging. Luke,

01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:22.820
<v Speaker 2>you have you have the option.

01:03:25.295 --> 01:03:26.175
<v Speaker 1>Oh.

01:03:28.575 --> 01:03:30.255
<v Speaker 1>Oh, you just made me happy. And I

01:03:30.255 --> 01:03:31.775
<v Speaker 1>can change the cluster so I could close

01:03:31.775 --> 01:03:33.215
<v Speaker 1>that to AWS or somewhere Yeah.

01:03:34.815 --> 01:03:35.855
<v Speaker 1>Oh, look at that.

01:03:36.930 --> 01:03:38.770
<v Speaker 1>That is a that is a pure joy

01:03:38.770 --> 01:03:39.490
<v Speaker 1>smile.

01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:43.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. That's a very, very, very we have

01:03:43.490 --> 01:03:45.970
<v Speaker 2>even Nasdaq companies that are using

01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:48.690
<v Speaker 2>Qovery just for that feature, just to tell

01:03:48.690 --> 01:03:51.464
<v Speaker 2>you, Because they can create their own environments,

01:03:51.464 --> 01:03:53.545
<v Speaker 2>and they can duplicate for their QA,

01:03:53.545 --> 01:03:55.625
<v Speaker 2>sales engineers, and stuff like that. They can

01:03:55.625 --> 01:03:56.585
<v Speaker 2>just duplicate

01:03:56.585 --> 01:03:58.745
<v Speaker 2>stuff once it's defined.

01:03:59.625 --> 01:04:00.265
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

01:04:00.505 --> 01:04:01.545
<v Speaker 1>And let's

01:04:01.785 --> 01:04:03.625
<v Speaker 1>click on export to Terraform now because I'm

01:04:03.625 --> 01:04:04.665
<v Speaker 1>curious what this does.

01:04:05.410 --> 01:04:06.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Absolutely.

01:04:10.690 --> 01:04:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Downloads.

01:04:12.690 --> 01:04:13.650
<v Speaker 1>Unzip.

01:04:17.570 --> 01:04:18.930
<v Speaker 1>Where did it go? Oh, no. Send this

01:04:18.930 --> 01:04:21.010
<v Speaker 1>to alright. Okay. Main

01:04:20.744 --> 01:04:21.625
<v Speaker 1>variables.

01:04:23.464 --> 01:04:25.145
<v Speaker 1>Sorry for the light mode, everyone.

01:04:31.224 --> 01:04:33.384
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Okay. So that is Qovery automation

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:36.000
<v Speaker 1>for what I've been doing on the UI.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.640
<v Speaker 1>Right? Yeah. We have a telephone provider.

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:40.960
<v Speaker 2>That's one more reason why

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:43.440
<v Speaker 2>DevOps people, they like it because they can

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:44.880
<v Speaker 2>control it everything

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:47.995
<v Speaker 2>through our telephone provider. That's usually for pollution.

01:04:47.995 --> 01:04:50.235
<v Speaker 2>That's what happened is that at some point,

01:04:50.555 --> 01:04:52.715
<v Speaker 2>they do they start fast,

01:04:52.955 --> 01:04:55.035
<v Speaker 2>but then they move into, like, a GitHub's

01:04:55.035 --> 01:04:56.635
<v Speaker 2>way of managing everything.

01:04:57.115 --> 01:04:59.790
<v Speaker 2>And that's very convenient here because they can

01:04:59.790 --> 01:05:01.790
<v Speaker 2>start at least from something and then adapt

01:05:01.790 --> 01:05:03.150
<v Speaker 2>to what they need.

01:05:05.310 --> 01:05:07.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So this is a Qovery container.

01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:10.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Yeah. We do maintain that for our

01:05:10.030 --> 01:05:10.670
<v Speaker 2>customer.

01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:11.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:12.830
<v Speaker 2>It's

01:05:14.295 --> 01:05:16.055
<v Speaker 2>it's our own provider.

01:05:17.255 --> 01:05:18.215
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So

01:05:18.694 --> 01:05:21.975
<v Speaker 1>now I mean, I'm I'm more curious now.

01:05:22.454 --> 01:05:23.255
<v Speaker 1>Production,

01:05:23.734 --> 01:05:24.615
<v Speaker 1>clustered,

01:05:25.015 --> 01:05:25.815
<v Speaker 1>settings,

01:05:25.815 --> 01:05:26.535
<v Speaker 1>storage,

01:05:26.694 --> 01:05:27.015
<v Speaker 1>no.

01:05:27.810 --> 01:05:30.210
<v Speaker 1>What happens if I then add a volume

01:05:30.210 --> 01:05:31.970
<v Speaker 1>to the TerraForm HCL?

01:05:33.330 --> 01:05:34.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

01:05:34.290 --> 01:05:35.250
<v Speaker 1>Will it work?

01:05:37.490 --> 01:05:39.570
<v Speaker 2>If you add, like, a storage now, like,

01:05:39.570 --> 01:05:42.130
<v Speaker 2>an object, like, into that? Probably not.

01:05:42.695 --> 01:05:44.775
<v Speaker 2>I do think you will be rejected by

01:05:44.775 --> 01:05:48.215
<v Speaker 2>the by the API, actually. Right. Okay. Okay.

01:05:48.215 --> 01:05:49.415
<v Speaker 1>I was just curious.

01:05:49.895 --> 01:05:50.535
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:05:51.015 --> 01:05:52.855
<v Speaker 1>I mean, it's nice that we can eject

01:05:52.855 --> 01:05:55.335
<v Speaker 1>away from the UI. And, again, you know,

01:05:55.335 --> 01:05:56.615
<v Speaker 1>the best can live and get

01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And could be cloned and and reapplied

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:02.280
<v Speaker 1>across different clusters and stuff like that. But

01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:04.280
<v Speaker 1>then I think when the UI

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:05.720
<v Speaker 1>is right there,

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.200
<v Speaker 1>it'd probably be inclined just to kind of

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:10.040
<v Speaker 1>stick with this. I mean, the export is

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:12.120
<v Speaker 1>nice. I I could have snapshots of point

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:14.415
<v Speaker 1>in times, but I I I wouldn't I'm

01:06:14.415 --> 01:06:16.175
<v Speaker 1>not sure I would wanna jump back down

01:06:16.175 --> 01:06:17.775
<v Speaker 1>to modifying HCL.

01:06:18.255 --> 01:06:20.495
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That's I guess that's the choice. Right?

01:06:20.495 --> 01:06:22.255
<v Speaker 1>People can decide what they want and what's

01:06:22.255 --> 01:06:25.295
<v Speaker 1>best for them. Yeah. Absolutely. And something that

01:06:25.295 --> 01:06:26.960
<v Speaker 2>we are working on is that we are

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:28.640
<v Speaker 2>more and more we have more and more,

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:30.960
<v Speaker 2>like, software engine, one side, DevOps that they're

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:32.960
<v Speaker 2>using the platform and controlling it. What we

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:35.200
<v Speaker 2>want to do is that when a mode

01:06:35.359 --> 01:06:36.960
<v Speaker 2>so that's something that will come, like, next

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.119
<v Speaker 2>year. But, basically, when you modify the web

01:06:39.119 --> 01:06:39.599
<v Speaker 2>interface,

01:06:40.145 --> 01:06:42.305
<v Speaker 2>instead of applying the changes

01:06:42.945 --> 01:06:45.825
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. Instead of applying the changes right away

01:06:45.825 --> 01:06:47.185
<v Speaker 3>into the API

01:06:47.425 --> 01:06:49.425
<v Speaker 3>and doing those changes, we'll

01:06:49.505 --> 01:06:52.385
<v Speaker 3>to deny, like, the top configuration and update,

01:06:52.385 --> 01:06:53.505
<v Speaker 3>like, the gateway,

01:06:54.090 --> 01:06:57.050
<v Speaker 3>like, appearance of it in the overview and

01:06:57.050 --> 01:06:58.890
<v Speaker 3>then apply. And then

01:07:00.970 --> 01:07:01.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

01:07:01.770 --> 01:07:04.410
<v Speaker 3>Usually, people today, they choose one or the

01:07:04.410 --> 01:07:04.570
<v Speaker 3>other.

01:07:07.625 --> 01:07:08.265
<v Speaker 1>Nice.

01:07:08.984 --> 01:07:09.785
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

01:07:10.105 --> 01:07:11.945
<v Speaker 1>I think we've kicked the tires on we

01:07:12.025 --> 01:07:13.065
<v Speaker 1>I mean, we don't even use the get

01:07:13.065 --> 01:07:14.825
<v Speaker 1>started page. Right? We just let me go

01:07:14.825 --> 01:07:16.825
<v Speaker 1>click happy on your UI, which is which

01:07:16.825 --> 01:07:17.625
<v Speaker 1>is nice.

01:07:17.865 --> 01:07:19.225
<v Speaker 1>But I feel like, you know, we have

01:07:19.225 --> 01:07:20.265
<v Speaker 1>showed people a small

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:24.040
<v Speaker 1>contrived example, but powerful example of what people

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.560
<v Speaker 1>could can do with Qovery.

01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything else that you want to

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:29.240
<v Speaker 1>show people that gives them a snapshot or

01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:30.600
<v Speaker 1>a look into what

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.640
<v Speaker 1>you or your customers or production deployments look

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:34.760
<v Speaker 1>like with Qovery?

01:07:35.565 --> 01:07:37.405
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I can I can show I can

01:07:37.405 --> 01:07:39.724
<v Speaker 2>show maybe, like, a few things? So maybe

01:07:39.724 --> 01:07:40.685
<v Speaker 2>a much more like a

01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:43.405
<v Speaker 2>so maybe a much more

01:07:44.045 --> 01:07:44.845
<v Speaker 2>detailed

01:07:45.325 --> 01:07:46.045
<v Speaker 2>configuration.

01:07:48.590 --> 01:07:50.750
<v Speaker 1>K. You happy for me to to throw

01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:53.310
<v Speaker 1>your your screen up? Yeah. My screen yeah.

01:07:53.310 --> 01:07:55.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. You can. Yeah. Absolutely.

01:07:59.470 --> 01:07:59.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

01:08:00.455 --> 01:08:02.535
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I can I can show, yeah, I

01:08:02.535 --> 01:08:03.975
<v Speaker 2>can show a much more, like,

01:08:04.695 --> 01:08:07.415
<v Speaker 2>bigger view, like, of different type of services

01:08:07.415 --> 01:08:09.495
<v Speaker 2>that they're running on on on the coverage?

01:08:09.495 --> 01:08:11.895
<v Speaker 2>So this is a an environment containing,

01:08:11.895 --> 01:08:12.775
<v Speaker 2>like, a production,

01:08:13.450 --> 01:08:16.170
<v Speaker 2>but, actually, it's not. It's just for my

01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:17.210
<v Speaker 2>my test.

01:08:17.370 --> 01:08:18.970
<v Speaker 2>But here, you have a bunch of so

01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:21.370
<v Speaker 2>it's running on AWS on a managed cluster.

01:08:21.370 --> 01:08:23.850
<v Speaker 2>And, actually, this cluster has even, like, Kubernetes

01:08:24.250 --> 01:08:26.970
<v Speaker 2>Carpenter turned on. We have an integrations with

01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:29.689
<v Speaker 2>Carpenter, so we do install and manage that

01:08:29.015 --> 01:08:31.495
<v Speaker 2>with our manager for. So meaning that I

01:08:31.495 --> 01:08:33.975
<v Speaker 2>can benefit from the spot instances and the

01:08:34.455 --> 01:08:36.535
<v Speaker 2>the downscale part, like, of this, know, the

01:08:36.535 --> 01:08:39.574
<v Speaker 2>the scaler, which is great. K? And,

01:08:40.135 --> 01:08:41.175
<v Speaker 2>basically, here,

01:08:41.335 --> 01:08:42.055
<v Speaker 2>you have, like,

01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:44.790
<v Speaker 2>back end, front end databases,

01:08:44.790 --> 01:08:46.790
<v Speaker 2>even Terraform script. That's what I wanted just

01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:48.870
<v Speaker 2>to show you. So you see I've deployed

01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:52.229
<v Speaker 2>RDS instance with my own Terraform module,

01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:53.989
<v Speaker 2>and this module is just

01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:57.110
<v Speaker 2>is just that. You know? Look. It's a

01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.830
<v Speaker 2>pure

01:08:58.265 --> 01:09:00.344
<v Speaker 2>Terraform script. Okay? So

01:09:00.905 --> 01:09:02.824
<v Speaker 2>where I declare my resources,

01:09:03.545 --> 01:09:06.024
<v Speaker 2>and I have, like, some inputs and some,

01:09:06.024 --> 01:09:08.745
<v Speaker 2>like, output and variables. So I can define

01:09:08.745 --> 01:09:09.864
<v Speaker 2>that. And you see,

01:09:10.265 --> 01:09:12.939
<v Speaker 2>the beauty here is this. Because once you

01:09:12.939 --> 01:09:15.739
<v Speaker 2>have executed this Terraform script from Qovery, you

01:09:15.739 --> 01:09:17.899
<v Speaker 2>want to get back the informations from, like,

01:09:17.899 --> 01:09:20.300
<v Speaker 2>the endpoint, username, password that they are do

01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:22.540
<v Speaker 2>generate it at the end time. And even

01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:25.420
<v Speaker 2>that, we do manage that properly into Qovery.

01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:28.295
<v Speaker 2>So when you start deploying Terraform script,

01:09:28.774 --> 01:09:31.415
<v Speaker 2>look. I got the job output values

01:09:31.575 --> 01:09:33.895
<v Speaker 2>that they are available, like, at the execution.

01:09:33.895 --> 01:09:37.335
<v Speaker 2>And that's what makes, like, Qovery so powerful

01:09:37.335 --> 01:09:39.175
<v Speaker 2>because here, actually, what you get is a

01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:40.055
<v Speaker 2>deployment pipeline.

01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:43.390
<v Speaker 2>So all my services, I can just execute

01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:45.950
<v Speaker 2>in the right order. I can deploy in

01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:47.469
<v Speaker 2>the right order of my different

01:09:48.270 --> 01:09:50.830
<v Speaker 2>services, so even my Terraform RDS.

01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:54.350
<v Speaker 2>And when it happens, like, Terraform is that

01:09:53.725 --> 01:09:56.205
<v Speaker 2>those output values, they are injected into the

01:09:56.205 --> 01:09:58.364
<v Speaker 2>other services. They are available to the other

01:09:58.364 --> 01:09:59.085
<v Speaker 2>services

01:09:59.565 --> 01:10:01.324
<v Speaker 2>at the time of the execution.

01:10:01.805 --> 01:10:03.805
<v Speaker 2>So you see? So that that's something that

01:10:03.805 --> 01:10:07.260
<v Speaker 2>is very, like, much more much closer than

01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:09.659
<v Speaker 2>than ever, like, to the to the production

01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:12.460
<v Speaker 2>to something that runs, like, from our customers.

01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:14.860
<v Speaker 2>And, yeah, I just wanted to show you

01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:15.659
<v Speaker 2>that because,

01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:19.260
<v Speaker 2>obviously, when you you deploy one application, it's

01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:21.985
<v Speaker 2>very simple. But when you need to interconnect,

01:10:21.985 --> 01:10:23.825
<v Speaker 2>like, microservices

01:10:23.825 --> 01:10:27.425
<v Speaker 2>applications altogether and just order the right way

01:10:27.425 --> 01:10:30.225
<v Speaker 2>those different services, then this is why it's,

01:10:30.225 --> 01:10:31.585
<v Speaker 2>like, much more harder.

01:10:31.905 --> 01:10:33.985
<v Speaker 2>And we cover, like, all of that, obviously.

01:10:34.065 --> 01:10:36.500
<v Speaker 2>And you can clone just for your own

01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:41.060
<v Speaker 2>you can clone even that environment, David. So

01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:42.900
<v Speaker 2>I can choose, like, even another, like, a

01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:44.420
<v Speaker 2>cluster. So for instance,

01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:46.740
<v Speaker 2>let's say Tokyo cluster

01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:48.340
<v Speaker 2>on Google,

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:50.985
<v Speaker 2>I can just clone that one. Obviously,

01:10:51.065 --> 01:10:52.184
<v Speaker 2>the RDS,

01:10:52.745 --> 01:10:55.545
<v Speaker 2>so will not be, like, properly working. So

01:10:55.545 --> 01:10:57.784
<v Speaker 2>you you can adjust and adapt, like, based

01:10:57.784 --> 01:10:59.784
<v Speaker 2>on the the meta informations that you have

01:10:59.784 --> 01:11:00.664
<v Speaker 2>from Qovery.

01:11:01.065 --> 01:11:02.905
<v Speaker 2>But, yeah, you can clone, like, all the

01:11:02.905 --> 01:11:03.225
<v Speaker 2>resources.

01:11:05.570 --> 01:11:07.250
<v Speaker 1>Very cool. I like that.

01:11:07.810 --> 01:11:08.449
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

01:11:08.930 --> 01:11:10.930
<v Speaker 1>And if you just go to that pipeline

01:11:10.930 --> 01:11:13.409
<v Speaker 1>where we see that phased rollout

01:11:15.650 --> 01:11:17.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. If you go to the pipeline, you

01:11:17.410 --> 01:11:20.614
<v Speaker 2>get exactly the same. Alright. So it like,

01:11:21.175 --> 01:11:23.095
<v Speaker 1>will that update and say, oh, there's an

01:11:23.095 --> 01:11:25.015
<v Speaker 1>SQS there, which isn't gonna work on GCP.

01:11:25.015 --> 01:11:27.175
<v Speaker 1>Right? But, you know, I was curious if

01:11:27.175 --> 01:11:28.215
<v Speaker 1>it visualized

01:11:28.215 --> 01:11:30.775
<v Speaker 1>the progress through the pipeline from left to

01:11:30.775 --> 01:11:30.935
<v Speaker 1>right.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.920
<v Speaker 2>No. No. No. But that's something that we

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:35.680
<v Speaker 2>want to bring, like, a much more, like,

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:38.240
<v Speaker 2>visual view of when something is deployed. But

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:38.880
<v Speaker 2>today,

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:42.320
<v Speaker 2>when you do deploy, a a pipeline

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:45.360
<v Speaker 2>so if I redeploy this, for instance, pollution,

01:11:46.385 --> 01:11:48.145
<v Speaker 2>you you you can see, like, from the

01:11:48.145 --> 01:11:49.825
<v Speaker 2>logs interface, you have a

01:11:50.465 --> 01:11:51.425
<v Speaker 1>view Nice.

01:11:51.585 --> 01:11:53.585
<v Speaker 2>Of the pipeline. Yes. You have the first

01:11:53.585 --> 01:11:55.345
<v Speaker 2>stage here that you can create. You can

01:11:55.345 --> 01:11:57.585
<v Speaker 2>customize everything, but you have the first stage,

01:11:57.585 --> 01:12:00.065
<v Speaker 2>then the second stage, third, and so on

01:12:00.065 --> 01:12:01.345
<v Speaker 2>and so forth. So you can see you

01:12:01.345 --> 01:12:01.745
<v Speaker 2>see, boom,

01:12:02.389 --> 01:12:03.590
<v Speaker 2>here, like, the

01:12:03.909 --> 01:12:06.230
<v Speaker 2>the deployment of the different resources that they

01:12:06.230 --> 01:12:08.309
<v Speaker 2>are done in parallel in each stage.

01:12:08.710 --> 01:12:11.030
<v Speaker 2>So if something goes wrong and that's something

01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:12.709
<v Speaker 2>that is very nice because

01:12:13.190 --> 01:12:15.590
<v Speaker 2>when you deploy an environment, like, your service

01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:17.695
<v Speaker 2>can go wrong, so you can just see

01:12:17.695 --> 01:12:20.895
<v Speaker 2>exactly which one at which time, and you

01:12:20.895 --> 01:12:23.135
<v Speaker 2>can troubleshoot that service, and you can redeploy

01:12:23.135 --> 01:12:25.135
<v Speaker 2>just that service or set of service and

01:12:25.135 --> 01:12:26.095
<v Speaker 2>so on and so forth.

01:12:27.055 --> 01:12:28.495
<v Speaker 1>Awesome. I like that.

01:12:30.190 --> 01:12:32.510
<v Speaker 1>Alright. I'm gonna push this back to is

01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:33.789
<v Speaker 1>there anything else you want to show before

01:12:33.789 --> 01:12:34.989
<v Speaker 1>I I push this back to back face

01:12:34.989 --> 01:12:35.550
<v Speaker 1>mode?

01:12:35.949 --> 01:12:38.989
<v Speaker 2>No. Actually, you know, otherwise, we can spend,

01:12:40.429 --> 01:12:42.349
<v Speaker 2>day. Yeah. I mean, it was it was

01:12:42.349 --> 01:12:45.869
<v Speaker 1>daytime when I started the session and it's

01:12:45.005 --> 01:12:46.925
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. That's good to hear. Alright.

01:12:49.885 --> 01:12:52.125
<v Speaker 1>Let's wrap this up. Maybe you could share

01:12:52.125 --> 01:12:53.885
<v Speaker 1>a little bit about, you know, I I

01:12:53.885 --> 01:12:55.965
<v Speaker 1>think you've you've given us the history about

01:12:55.965 --> 01:12:58.525
<v Speaker 1>you and and Qovery. We've seen the product.

01:12:58.525 --> 01:12:59.805
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people are really

01:12:59.805 --> 01:13:01.130
<v Speaker 1>gonna enjoy what they see.

01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:03.690
<v Speaker 1>What's next? What what what's what's on your

01:13:03.690 --> 01:13:04.409
<v Speaker 1>road map?

01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:08.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Yeah. That's a very good question.

01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:09.849
<v Speaker 2>So the goal for us is to use,

01:13:09.849 --> 01:13:11.530
<v Speaker 2>like, the integration as much as we can.

01:13:11.530 --> 01:13:14.224
<v Speaker 2>We have worked on the AI agent that

01:13:14.224 --> 01:13:16.385
<v Speaker 2>is open source and have, like, our customers

01:13:16.385 --> 01:13:19.985
<v Speaker 2>to transition very easily, like, from past solutions

01:13:19.985 --> 01:13:22.065
<v Speaker 2>to, yes, using covering in just, like, no

01:13:22.065 --> 01:13:24.465
<v Speaker 2>time. Today, it works from to AWS and

01:13:24.465 --> 01:13:26.385
<v Speaker 2>the different those account provider. In just five

01:13:26.385 --> 01:13:28.470
<v Speaker 2>weeks, we can move out the workload. That's

01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:30.869
<v Speaker 2>crazy. That's something that were not even possible,

01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:33.030
<v Speaker 2>like, before

01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:33.989
<v Speaker 2>LLM.

01:13:34.150 --> 01:13:36.550
<v Speaker 2>That's really it's interesting. We can drop the

01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:38.550
<v Speaker 2>link because it's available on GitHub.

01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:41.525
<v Speaker 2>But, basically, we focus on that, And then

01:13:41.525 --> 01:13:43.445
<v Speaker 2>there is, like, many more that we we

01:13:43.445 --> 01:13:44.965
<v Speaker 2>want to provide, like, supporting

01:13:45.605 --> 01:13:47.445
<v Speaker 2>also providing, like, Azure

01:13:47.685 --> 01:13:50.165
<v Speaker 2>managed, like, offer. That's something that we are

01:13:50.165 --> 01:13:52.245
<v Speaker 2>working on. And you talk about that, but

01:13:52.245 --> 01:13:54.565
<v Speaker 2>those enterprise features that we want, like the

01:13:54.565 --> 01:13:55.525
<v Speaker 2>self managed

01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:57.900
<v Speaker 2>control plane, that's something also we want to

01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:58.460
<v Speaker 2>deliver.

01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:02.060
<v Speaker 2>But, yeah, the product is, like, evolving all

01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:03.820
<v Speaker 2>the time. We have invested a lot, like,

01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:05.900
<v Speaker 2>in the developer experience, and we are eager

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:08.620
<v Speaker 2>just to get feedback from users when you

01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:10.060
<v Speaker 2>see something so we can just,

01:14:10.715 --> 01:14:12.715
<v Speaker 2>like, work on it. But those are, like,

01:14:12.715 --> 01:14:14.715
<v Speaker 2>the main the main big things that we

01:14:14.715 --> 01:14:17.594
<v Speaker 2>are working on. Yeah. Nice. Awesome.

01:14:18.074 --> 01:14:20.315
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Well, I mean, thank you so much

01:14:20.315 --> 01:14:21.994

01:14:21.994 --> 01:14:24.155
<v Speaker 1>sit here, talk about your product, show it

01:14:24.155 --> 01:14:26.739
<v Speaker 1>to people. And, yeah, it's been an absolute

01:14:26.739 --> 01:14:28.739
<v Speaker 1>pleasure. I think it's a fantastic

01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:31.860
<v Speaker 1>developer experience and user interface on what is

01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:34.900
<v Speaker 1>a pretty cumbersome and and difficult challenge for

01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:37.219
<v Speaker 1>many people and many teams and many organizations.

01:14:37.219 --> 01:14:39.185
<v Speaker 1>And I hope that it will vary for

01:14:39.185 --> 01:14:40.625
<v Speaker 1>the people that are out there going I

01:14:40.625 --> 01:14:43.105
<v Speaker 1>need this. We'll solve some real challenges for

01:14:43.105 --> 01:14:44.945
