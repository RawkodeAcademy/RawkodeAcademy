00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.440
<v Speaker 0>Hello, and welcome back to the Rawkode Academy.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.520
<v Speaker 0>My name is David Flanagan,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.960
<v Speaker 0>although I also go by the hand of

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.840
<v Speaker 0>Rawkode.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.040
<v Speaker 0>Go figure. And today is the launch of

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.985
<v Speaker 0>our third course at the academy, and we're

00:02:09.985 --> 00:02:12.385
<v Speaker 0>taking a look at BGP.

00:02:13.025 --> 00:02:15.504
<v Speaker 0>BGP is a a really cool technology

00:02:15.504 --> 00:02:19.345
<v Speaker 0>that probably does provide the foundation of scaling

00:02:19.345 --> 00:02:22.064
<v Speaker 0>your applications to the edge and globally.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.120
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.440
<v Speaker 0>For today's first session, we're doing things a

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.360
<v Speaker 0>little bit different, and we do have a

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.040
<v Speaker 0>guest. I can't find my mic.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.960
<v Speaker 0>There we go. And if you enable that

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.800
<v Speaker 0>option where you kinda spiral it around and

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.960
<v Speaker 0>it goes pulsedly big, but, anyway, that's for

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.974
<v Speaker 0>another day. Yeah. We're doing things a little

00:02:39.974 --> 00:02:41.575
<v Speaker 0>bit differently. I'm John Beck's

00:02:41.814 --> 00:02:43.415
<v Speaker 0>friend and former colleague,

00:02:43.655 --> 00:02:44.775
<v Speaker 0>Jeremy Tanner.

00:02:44.775 --> 00:02:45.895
<v Speaker 0>Hey. How's it going?

00:02:47.095 --> 00:02:49.575

<v Speaker 0>me today. It's nice that we get to

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.650
<v Speaker 0>do something together. You know, full disclosure, Jeremy

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.569
<v Speaker 0>and I worked together at Equinix. So we

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.730
<v Speaker 0>have done plenty of streams together. We met

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.890
<v Speaker 0>up recently in Austin, which was awesome.

00:03:05.645 --> 00:03:07.325
<v Speaker 0>But I was in

00:03:07.245 --> 00:03:09.405
<v Speaker 0>CD con. So nice

00:03:09.644 --> 00:03:10.525
<v Speaker 0>to see you again.

00:03:11.565 --> 00:03:12.845
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Absolutely.

00:03:12.845 --> 00:03:13.565
<v Speaker 1>I am

00:03:13.885 --> 00:03:15.885
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready to hear more about about

00:03:16.125 --> 00:03:18.045
<v Speaker 1>BGP and BGPN

00:03:18.045 --> 00:03:21.030
<v Speaker 1>and Equinix Medal. I got up Well, I

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 1>was gonna say got some coffee, but first,

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.550
<v Speaker 1>I went and looked and I was like,

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.310
<v Speaker 1>do the thing that everyone needs to do,

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.950
<v Speaker 1>which is

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.150
<v Speaker 1>follow Rawkode Academy on LinkedIn. All of the

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.950
<v Speaker 1>socials.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.190
<v Speaker 1>All of the socials. Like, that's where the

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.910
<v Speaker 1>stream needs to go.

00:03:34.644 --> 00:03:36.565
<v Speaker 0>But, you know, for so long And then

00:03:36.565 --> 00:03:37.925
<v Speaker 1>coffee. Yeah. Yeah.

00:03:38.325 --> 00:03:40.565
<v Speaker 0>For so long, I've always just streamed to

00:03:40.565 --> 00:03:41.285
<v Speaker 0>YouTube.

00:03:42.485 --> 00:03:44.805
<v Speaker 0>But I think for course material, I wanna

00:03:44.805 --> 00:03:47.125
<v Speaker 0>push it a bit broader and wider,

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.450
<v Speaker 0>especially as what I'm saying is I'm having

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.049
<v Speaker 0>to update some of the older videos, and

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:52.569
<v Speaker 0>YouTube really doesn't like it when you have

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.090
<v Speaker 0>to do that. We're gonna just digress though

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.370
<v Speaker 0>for the first five minutes.

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:57.370
<v Speaker 0>So what I wanna do is just, you

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.209
<v Speaker 0>know, livestream it to multiple places. We're out

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:00.810
<v Speaker 0>on LinkedIn. We're out on Twitter. We're out

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:01.610
<v Speaker 0>on YouTube.

00:04:02.635 --> 00:04:04.555
<v Speaker 0>And then what we'll do is I'm gonna

00:04:04.555 --> 00:04:06.155
<v Speaker 0>edit this back. I'm gonna stick it on

00:04:06.155 --> 00:04:07.435
<v Speaker 0>Vimeo, and I'm gonna make it a web

00:04:07.515 --> 00:04:09.834
<v Speaker 0>available on the new Rawkode Academy website, which

00:04:09.834 --> 00:04:12.474
<v Speaker 0>will be launching next week. So trying to

00:04:12.474 --> 00:04:13.915
<v Speaker 0>do things a little bit differently as I've

00:04:13.915 --> 00:04:15.275
<v Speaker 0>done for the last eighteen months and just

00:04:15.275 --> 00:04:16.074
<v Speaker 0>experiment. And

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.410
<v Speaker 0>yeah, this is the first course I'm gonna

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.850
<v Speaker 0>do it with, but it should be good.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.890
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Perfect. Back on topic. For anyone who

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.090
<v Speaker 0>is not familiar

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.970
<v Speaker 0>with you, can you just give us the

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.130
<v Speaker 0>TLDR of who is Jeremy Tanner?

00:04:30.485 --> 00:04:31.365
<v Speaker 1>Excellent.

00:04:31.845 --> 00:04:34.245
<v Speaker 1>I like motorcycles and mountains, and I have

00:04:34.245 --> 00:04:36.325
<v Speaker 1>two small copies of myself, but you're probably

00:04:36.325 --> 00:04:37.445
<v Speaker 1>really looking for,

00:04:38.165 --> 00:04:40.405
<v Speaker 1>have been helping people understand bare metal and

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:44.230
<v Speaker 1>bare metal accessories at Equinix Metal. Inside Equinix,

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.270
<v Speaker 1>the world's digital infrastructure company, and now,

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.670
<v Speaker 1>based in Austin, Texas.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.710
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, certainly open to questions,

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.870
<v Speaker 1>meeting new friends, and and today hearing about

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:55.750
<v Speaker 1>BGP.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.565
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I mean, I hope you're prepared to

00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:00.765
<v Speaker 0>slide because I haven't.

00:05:01.645 --> 00:05:02.445
<v Speaker 0>Uh-oh.

00:05:03.645 --> 00:05:05.885
<v Speaker 0>Well, here's my first favorite feature of LinkedIn

00:05:05.885 --> 00:05:06.685
<v Speaker 0>streaming.

00:05:07.245 --> 00:05:10.045
<v Speaker 0>LinkedIn user says hello there. Hello, LinkedIn user.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.419
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming we don't get that name on

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:14.300
<v Speaker 0>the API,

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:17.100
<v Speaker 0>but we do have the regulars. We have

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.380
<v Speaker 0>no hey, no.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.900
<v Speaker 0>Russell.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.820
<v Speaker 0>Hey, Russell.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.180
<v Speaker 0>Another LinkedIn user saying LinkedIn is slow on

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.100
<v Speaker 0>the uptake. Well, yeah, they don't have username.

00:05:27.755 --> 00:05:29.675
<v Speaker 0>So I guess that'll come in the future.

00:05:30.715 --> 00:05:31.995
<v Speaker 1>That's a premium feature.

00:05:33.755 --> 00:05:34.715
<v Speaker 0>Stefan,

00:05:34.715 --> 00:05:35.435
<v Speaker 0>human.

00:05:36.235 --> 00:05:38.235
<v Speaker 0>Hello to both. It's all very kind.

00:05:39.915 --> 00:05:43.389
<v Speaker 0>A good morning from Steve. Hey, Steve. Alright.

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:47.150
<v Speaker 0>So people must be wondering. The LinkedIn user

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.789
<v Speaker 0>is Chris. Well, yes. LinkedIn users, if you

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:51.310
<v Speaker 0>are watching, feel free to stick your name

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.909
<v Speaker 0>and a colon at the start of every

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:55.629
<v Speaker 0>message, which is pretend that that's gonna work

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:56.190
<v Speaker 0>for today.

00:05:58.095 --> 00:05:59.615
<v Speaker 0>Know there's too many comment. I'm okay. I'm

00:05:59.615 --> 00:06:01.055
<v Speaker 0>only gonna show two more comments. We're we're

00:06:01.055 --> 00:06:03.855
<v Speaker 0>gonna stop BGP now. Please tell us about

00:06:03.855 --> 00:06:05.775
<v Speaker 0>more cycles. Yeah. We will be getting another

00:06:05.775 --> 00:06:07.455
<v Speaker 0>stream for that. I I reckon Jeremy could

00:06:07.455 --> 00:06:08.975
<v Speaker 0>go on for a while. Cool.

00:06:10.335 --> 00:06:12.760
<v Speaker 0>Alright. How does this course work? Well, much

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.440
<v Speaker 0>like the other two courses, if you go

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.080
<v Speaker 0>to the Rawkode Academy, Github page at github.com/rockwoodacademy,

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.320
<v Speaker 0>there is a courses page.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.000
<v Speaker 0>As you'll see, we have our influx DB,

00:06:25.155 --> 00:06:27.555
<v Speaker 0>our Telco course, and our global reach with

00:06:27.555 --> 00:06:28.355
<v Speaker 0>BGP.

00:06:28.995 --> 00:06:31.395
<v Speaker 0>Now, of course, we're going to be spinning

00:06:31.395 --> 00:06:33.875
<v Speaker 0>up some bare metal for this course so

00:06:33.875 --> 00:06:35.955
<v Speaker 0>that we can actually use BGP and route

00:06:35.955 --> 00:06:38.115
<v Speaker 0>traffic to it. So this is not like

00:06:38.435 --> 00:06:40.540
<v Speaker 0>the other courses where

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.860
<v Speaker 0>you could just run a container with the

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.220
<v Speaker 0>software. Unfortunately,

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.340
<v Speaker 0>BGP requires hardware and other stuff, but it

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.460
<v Speaker 0>is invaluable

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.660
<v Speaker 0>to learn. So we have with Equinix metal

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.020
<v Speaker 0>a code

00:06:53.435 --> 00:06:54.235
<v Speaker 0>here

00:06:54.315 --> 00:06:55.435
<v Speaker 0>of Rawkode,

00:06:55.675 --> 00:06:57.435
<v Speaker 0>really difficult to remember.

00:06:57.995 --> 00:06:59.914
<v Speaker 0>But if you go to the Equinix metal

00:06:59.914 --> 00:07:01.595
<v Speaker 0>website by clicking the link,

00:07:02.395 --> 00:07:04.395
<v Speaker 0>you can click get started

00:07:06.395 --> 00:07:06.875
<v Speaker 0>twice.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.020
<v Speaker 0>And there's a coupon code thing here. Let

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.220
<v Speaker 0>me make that bigger.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.060
<v Speaker 0>It's like Rawkode in that box, fill in

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.060
<v Speaker 0>the rest of your details. No credit card

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.700
<v Speaker 0>is required, and you'll get $200.

00:07:20.685 --> 00:07:23.325
<v Speaker 0>I just clicked my browser. Oh, it's alright.

00:07:24.525 --> 00:07:25.885
<v Speaker 0>You get $200

00:07:25.885 --> 00:07:28.845
<v Speaker 0>of credit. So that $200 is going to

00:07:28.845 --> 00:07:29.805
<v Speaker 0>do you well.

00:07:31.245 --> 00:07:32.925
<v Speaker 0>I'm just gonna go to the console now.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.490
<v Speaker 0>We'll get you $200 of credit. I think

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:38.370
<v Speaker 0>you can get

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:41.010
<v Speaker 0>four hundred hours of compute for that. I

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.010
<v Speaker 0>think the c three smalls are about 50¢

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.169
<v Speaker 0>an hour. Jeremy can correct me if he

00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:45.410
<v Speaker 0>wishes.

00:07:46.085 --> 00:07:47.764
<v Speaker 0>So, yeah, four hundred hours for you to

00:07:47.764 --> 00:07:48.725
<v Speaker 0>experiment with.

00:07:49.925 --> 00:07:52.645
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Most recently variable depending on where you

00:07:52.645 --> 00:07:54.965
<v Speaker 1>are, more in some places, less in others,

00:07:54.965 --> 00:07:57.764
<v Speaker 1>but more for larger machines, less for smaller,

00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:59.010
<v Speaker 1>but

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:01.570
<v Speaker 1>certainly in that ballpark.

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:02.850
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:07.410
<v Speaker 0>Can't believe I closed that window.

00:08:10.995 --> 00:08:12.835
<v Speaker 0>See, I I was saying just before we

00:08:12.835 --> 00:08:14.755
<v Speaker 0>went live, I I I was considering a

00:08:14.755 --> 00:08:16.355
<v Speaker 0>3PM coffee. I feel like I made the

00:08:16.355 --> 00:08:18.915
<v Speaker 0>wrong decision by not having that coffee. Well,

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:20.035
<v Speaker 0>we're gonna move on.

00:08:21.475 --> 00:08:23.955
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So step one well, step one is

00:08:23.955 --> 00:08:25.750
<v Speaker 0>sign up. Use the coupon. Make sure you

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:27.990
<v Speaker 0>get those credits. And now today, we're gonna

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:29.830
<v Speaker 0>do the first two parts of this course.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:31.270
<v Speaker 0>So we're gonna do a bit of a

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.110
<v Speaker 0>conversation between Jeremy and I where we talk

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:34.870
<v Speaker 0>about what is BGP,

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:37.030
<v Speaker 0>how the written works, all the stuff that

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:38.630
<v Speaker 0>you kinda need to know before you start

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:39.190
<v Speaker 0>deploying it.

00:08:40.165 --> 00:08:42.085
<v Speaker 0>And then in the latter part of the

00:08:42.085 --> 00:08:45.365
<v Speaker 0>stream, we'll actually do our first BGP deployment.

00:08:45.365 --> 00:08:47.445
<v Speaker 0>So we will deploy multiple servers in multiple

00:08:47.445 --> 00:08:48.165
<v Speaker 0>regions.

00:08:48.645 --> 00:08:50.165
<v Speaker 0>And what we're gonna show you is how

00:08:50.165 --> 00:08:52.485
<v Speaker 0>the routing works, the latency is kept low,

00:08:52.485 --> 00:08:54.325
<v Speaker 0>and this is how you scale your application

00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:54.805
<v Speaker 0>globally

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.089
<v Speaker 0>or to use that wonderful word of the

00:08:57.089 --> 00:08:58.690
<v Speaker 0>moment edge

00:08:58.690 --> 00:08:59.970
<v Speaker 0>or at least as close to the edge

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.089
<v Speaker 0>as we're gonna get.

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:04.850
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Introduction to BGP.

00:09:06.529 --> 00:09:08.769
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Just absolute cop out here. Right? Just

00:09:08.769 --> 00:09:10.529
<v Speaker 0>stick in the Wikipedia definition

00:09:10.855 --> 00:09:13.095
<v Speaker 0>and then just ask people to read it.

00:09:14.375 --> 00:09:16.935
<v Speaker 0>I actually read the Wikipedia definition. I was

00:09:16.935 --> 00:09:18.775
<v Speaker 0>like, that is super complicated.

00:09:18.775 --> 00:09:21.495
<v Speaker 0>Like, does that really tell people what BGP

00:09:21.495 --> 00:09:24.055
<v Speaker 0>is? Is that for people that already know

00:09:24.055 --> 00:09:25.495
<v Speaker 0>BGP, but what primer?

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:28.190
<v Speaker 0>Like, for people that don't know BGP,

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.910
<v Speaker 0>it's just it really I I don't think

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.750
<v Speaker 0>it's that great. However, what I did know,

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.990
<v Speaker 0>here's a cool trick. Are you aware of

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.070
<v Speaker 0>Wikipedia Simple? I assume you are.

00:09:38.644 --> 00:09:40.725
<v Speaker 1>No. No. I've not run across it. Alright.

00:09:40.725 --> 00:09:42.404
<v Speaker 0>So you can do Wikipedia.

00:09:42.404 --> 00:09:44.644
<v Speaker 0>Let's just go to the BGP page. Right?

00:09:45.685 --> 00:09:47.845
<v Speaker 0>And sometimes you just get all this nonsense

00:09:47.845 --> 00:09:50.644
<v Speaker 0>and you're like, border gateway protocols, the standardized

00:09:50.644 --> 00:09:52.884
<v Speaker 0>exterior gateway protocol to send to exchange written

00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:55.320
<v Speaker 0>blah blah blah blah. Right? Doesn't always help

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.920
<v Speaker 0>you. Right? Especially when you get into more

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.240
<v Speaker 0>some of the more, like, complicated mathematical or

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.200
<v Speaker 0>physics topic,

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.920
<v Speaker 0>which I randomly do because I just get

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.240
<v Speaker 0>too curious. But you can swap out the

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:05.560
<v Speaker 0>language,

00:10:06.084 --> 00:10:07.125
<v Speaker 0>e n,

00:10:07.845 --> 00:10:08.725
<v Speaker 0>for simple.

00:10:09.605 --> 00:10:11.845
<v Speaker 0>And usually, it's not great in this case,

00:10:11.845 --> 00:10:12.885
<v Speaker 0>but usually,

00:10:12.885 --> 00:10:15.765
<v Speaker 0>you get a very simplified definition of the

00:10:15.765 --> 00:10:17.445
<v Speaker 0>thing that you're looking at. That's a cool

00:10:17.445 --> 00:10:17.925
<v Speaker 0>wee trick.

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:21.570
<v Speaker 0>There's also a Scots language one, but I

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:23.730
<v Speaker 0>doubt there's a Scots language for

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:24.770
<v Speaker 0>BGP.

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:29.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh, does it have to be localized into

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:29.890
<v Speaker 1>simple?

00:10:31.415 --> 00:10:33.254
<v Speaker 0>I don't know what I did there. Is

00:10:33.254 --> 00:10:35.334
<v Speaker 0>that just simple to okay. Oh, yeah. Hold

00:10:35.334 --> 00:10:35.815
<v Speaker 0>on.

00:10:36.615 --> 00:10:39.095
<v Speaker 0>I replaced too much. So simple counts simple

00:10:39.095 --> 00:10:41.654
<v Speaker 1>counts as a language Yeah. And just like

00:10:41.654 --> 00:10:45.230
<v Speaker 1>French, Italian, or Scots. Okay. Well, apparently, Scots

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:47.390
<v Speaker 0>doesn't work in. But there is a Scots

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:48.030
<v Speaker 0>version.

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:49.150
<v Speaker 0>There.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:52.750
<v Speaker 0>Small digression again. I suspect that's why I

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.430
<v Speaker 0>don't have I'm not joined by people. It's

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:55.870
<v Speaker 0>too easy for us to go down another

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:56.110
<v Speaker 0>path.

00:10:57.235 --> 00:10:59.235
<v Speaker 0>But a comment there from Pavan, today I

00:10:59.235 --> 00:11:01.714
<v Speaker 0>learned Wikipedia is simple. Yeah. It's a cool

00:11:01.714 --> 00:11:04.595
<v Speaker 0>trick, especially for those more complicated things. Glad

00:11:04.595 --> 00:11:05.315
<v Speaker 0>I could help.

00:11:06.035 --> 00:11:08.435
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So rather than I was reading in

00:11:08.435 --> 00:11:10.915
<v Speaker 0>verbatim that Wikipedia description, people can read it

00:11:10.915 --> 00:11:12.860
<v Speaker 0>if they want. I figured you and I

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.100
<v Speaker 0>could just talk about what problem does BGP

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.340
<v Speaker 0>actually solve. Like, people are here because they

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.620
<v Speaker 0>wanna learn the technology,

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.300
<v Speaker 0>but they probably wanna learn it because they

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.740
<v Speaker 0>have a problem to solve. And I figured

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.100
<v Speaker 0>we could just kind of roughly

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.745
<v Speaker 0>explain that. And what I've done in this

00:11:26.745 --> 00:11:29.225
<v Speaker 0>README document is try

00:11:29.625 --> 00:11:31.465
<v Speaker 0>to in a simple fashion,

00:11:32.105 --> 00:11:34.425
<v Speaker 0>describe what happens when you request a website

00:11:34.425 --> 00:11:36.745
<v Speaker 0>on a browser. So maybe we can just

00:11:36.745 --> 00:11:38.105
<v Speaker 0>kinda go over this so we can add

00:11:38.105 --> 00:11:40.345
<v Speaker 0>extra flavor details to better on how we

00:11:40.345 --> 00:11:42.000
<v Speaker 0>feel. Good to go?

00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:43.360
<v Speaker 0>Sure.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.200
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.279
<v Speaker 0>So what I've said here is let's consider

00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:49.120
<v Speaker 0>what happens when a request for a website

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.560
<v Speaker 0>is made from your machine.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.639
<v Speaker 0>This is high level. I know that people

00:11:52.639 --> 00:11:55.759
<v Speaker 0>get asked this and, like, interview questions, and

00:11:56.035 --> 00:11:57.715
<v Speaker 0>people have failed it because they didn't talk

00:11:57.715 --> 00:12:01.075
<v Speaker 0>about electrons and electricity and all that stuff.

00:12:01.075 --> 00:12:02.915
<v Speaker 0>I guess interview people, they take it too

00:12:02.915 --> 00:12:04.435
<v Speaker 0>far. I just said you need to do

00:12:04.435 --> 00:12:06.275
<v Speaker 0>it in three steps. I probably failed the

00:12:06.275 --> 00:12:09.670
<v Speaker 0>Amazon interview or whoever asked this. But first,

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.829
<v Speaker 0>we got a DNS request. So when we

00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:14.630
<v Speaker 0>type in console.equinox.com,

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:16.149
<v Speaker 0>Google Com, whatever,

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:17.350
<v Speaker 0>those

00:12:17.589 --> 00:12:20.709
<v Speaker 0>words really mean nothing to the Internet. What

00:12:20.709 --> 00:12:22.470
<v Speaker 0>we need to do is the DNS lookup

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:24.230
<v Speaker 0>to get some sort of IP address, which

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:26.445
<v Speaker 0>is how all the magic of Internet work.

00:12:27.805 --> 00:12:29.165
<v Speaker 0>Our browser

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:32.445
<v Speaker 0>will then send an HTTP request to the

00:12:32.445 --> 00:12:33.405
<v Speaker 0>IP address,

00:12:34.765 --> 00:12:36.285
<v Speaker 0>and it uses a host header. I don't

00:12:36.285 --> 00:12:37.485
<v Speaker 0>know why I included that detail.

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:40.670
<v Speaker 0>I mean, it's correct, but, you know, probably

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.750
<v Speaker 0>not pertinent to this conversation.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:43.950
<v Speaker 0>However,

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.350
<v Speaker 0>that server will eventually respond back with some

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:48.830
<v Speaker 0>HTML or browser renders it, and then you're

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:49.390
<v Speaker 0>happy.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.910
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Jeremy, how does the Internet work?

00:12:55.715 --> 00:12:58.035
<v Speaker 1>So the the first thing I would like

00:12:58.355 --> 00:13:00.755
<v Speaker 1>so the IP given by the DNS

00:13:01.635 --> 00:13:04.515
<v Speaker 1>the IP address given by the DNS system,

00:13:04.515 --> 00:13:06.435
<v Speaker 1>first of all, can be one of multiple

00:13:06.435 --> 00:13:08.115
<v Speaker 1>IP addresses, but you can't

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:12.570
<v Speaker 1>which one is given isn't determined by on

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:14.570
<v Speaker 1>any sort of basis. It can be, it

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:17.210
<v Speaker 1>can be either at random or semi random,

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:19.850
<v Speaker 1>but you're not, I don't think you're segmenting

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:21.930
<v Speaker 1>by, by anything there.

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:23.610
<v Speaker 1>Additionally,

00:13:24.404 --> 00:13:26.565
<v Speaker 1>I suppose it's important to say that you

00:13:26.565 --> 00:13:28.165
<v Speaker 1>need to be able to reach your

00:13:29.204 --> 00:13:30.725
<v Speaker 1>your DNS server,

00:13:31.285 --> 00:13:33.045
<v Speaker 1>and your DNS server

00:13:33.125 --> 00:13:35.605
<v Speaker 1>is in your settings as an IP address.

00:13:35.605 --> 00:13:38.884
<v Speaker 1>So how do you make the DNS request

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.500
<v Speaker 1>to the DNS server

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.660
<v Speaker 1>at the DNS' IP address?

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.580
<v Speaker 0>Well, things just got made up very quickly.

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:49.780
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I think, actually,

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.660
<v Speaker 0>it before we're this is actually part

00:13:52.985 --> 00:13:55.785
<v Speaker 0>three of the courses where we're gonna implement

00:13:55.785 --> 00:13:59.225
<v Speaker 0>our our own globally distributed kind of DNS

00:13:59.225 --> 00:14:00.665
<v Speaker 0>lookup. We won't go into that in too

00:14:00.665 --> 00:14:02.585
<v Speaker 0>much detail. But you're right. Your DNS server

00:14:02.585 --> 00:14:03.945
<v Speaker 0>has an IP address, and we have to

00:14:03.945 --> 00:14:05.865
<v Speaker 0>route that and answer that as quickly as

00:14:05.865 --> 00:14:07.465
<v Speaker 0>possible and keep our latency low. So it's

00:14:07.465 --> 00:14:08.905
<v Speaker 0>a really good use case for BGP.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.560
<v Speaker 0>Alright. What waffles I have next? That's me.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.880
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. There's a lot of DNS servers.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.280
<v Speaker 0>Your ISP is gonna bunch have a couple.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.800
<v Speaker 0>It's all distributed. It's all cached, all this

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:21.280
<v Speaker 0>other stuff.

00:14:23.225 --> 00:14:25.545
<v Speaker 0>And then I include some latency figures.

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:26.585
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:14:27.465 --> 00:14:29.385
<v Speaker 0>These figures I got from

00:14:30.105 --> 00:14:31.385
<v Speaker 0>wonder network,

00:14:32.105 --> 00:14:33.865
<v Speaker 0>which is a really cool website I wasn't

00:14:33.865 --> 00:14:34.585
<v Speaker 0>familiar with,

00:14:36.129 --> 00:14:38.529
<v Speaker 0>But you can actually add all your own

00:14:39.329 --> 00:14:41.170
<v Speaker 0>cities, which I thought was nice.

00:14:42.769 --> 00:14:44.129
<v Speaker 0>You're

00:14:44.129 --> 00:14:45.410
<v Speaker 0>in Austin.

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:48.290
<v Speaker 0>Yep. I'm in Glasgow.

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:49.810
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if there'll be a Glasgow.

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:50.850
<v Speaker 0>I guess we'll do London.

00:14:53.135 --> 00:14:55.375
<v Speaker 0>And there we can drop Barcelona.

00:15:00.654 --> 00:15:01.935
<v Speaker 0>Don't know why I'm going through all this

00:15:01.935 --> 00:15:03.935
<v Speaker 0>effort just to show our ping times, but

00:15:03.935 --> 00:15:04.255
<v Speaker 0>you know.

00:15:08.519 --> 00:15:09.560
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

00:15:10.519 --> 00:15:12.760
<v Speaker 0>So not bad considering,

00:15:12.839 --> 00:15:15.079
<v Speaker 0>you know, our connections are governed by the

00:15:15.079 --> 00:15:16.600
<v Speaker 0>laws of physics and the speed of light,

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.765
<v Speaker 0>a connection latency between our two cities is

00:15:19.765 --> 00:15:21.925
<v Speaker 0>only a hundred and eighteen milliseconds.

00:15:22.485 --> 00:15:23.365
<v Speaker 0>Very good.

00:15:23.685 --> 00:15:25.765
<v Speaker 1>Make can make that error so slightly larger?

00:15:25.765 --> 00:15:26.965
<v Speaker 1>Know. The

00:15:28.485 --> 00:15:30.085
<v Speaker 1>monitor is small. I'm not sure what sort

00:15:30.085 --> 00:15:32.700
<v Speaker 1>of sort of death star readout there is

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.140
<v Speaker 1>in a Oh, you can right click on

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.460
<v Speaker 0>it and control and then full screen it

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.820
<v Speaker 0>if you want. I should have touched that

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:39.420
<v Speaker 0>before we went live. But yeah.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.260
<v Speaker 0>So I didn't easy mode. That's good. So

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:44.380
<v Speaker 0>I sent this website

00:15:44.765 --> 00:15:46.445
<v Speaker 0>just while I was putting stuff together for

00:15:46.445 --> 00:15:48.445
<v Speaker 0>this course. And it's a really good way

00:15:48.445 --> 00:15:50.445
<v Speaker 0>to understand the latency between you and your

00:15:50.445 --> 00:15:51.165
<v Speaker 0>customers.

00:15:51.325 --> 00:15:53.805
<v Speaker 0>And let's talk about latency. Latency is just

00:15:54.365 --> 00:15:55.645
<v Speaker 0>the

00:15:56.445 --> 00:15:58.285
<v Speaker 0>amount of time that is required for all

00:15:58.285 --> 00:15:59.245
<v Speaker 0>requests

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.199
<v Speaker 0>to happen. So while the latency of a

00:16:02.199 --> 00:16:04.680
<v Speaker 0>hundred and eighteen milliseconds seems quite small,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.120
<v Speaker 0>if your web page is making tens, hundreds,

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.480
<v Speaker 0>thousands, tens of thousands of connections to resources,

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.680
<v Speaker 0>at least when the connection has to be

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.160
<v Speaker 0>opened, etcetera,

00:16:14.055 --> 00:16:15.895
<v Speaker 0>It can add up really, really quickly,

00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:18.375
<v Speaker 0>which is why, you know, if you Google

00:16:18.375 --> 00:16:20.695
<v Speaker 0>for why does Australia have slow Internet,

00:16:21.095 --> 00:16:23.895
<v Speaker 0>it's because all the products that they're using

00:16:23.895 --> 00:16:27.415
<v Speaker 0>are in San Francisco and Europe, etcetera. So,

00:16:27.415 --> 00:16:29.510
<v Speaker 0>you know, maybe the I'm sure there are

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:32.070
<v Speaker 0>lots of Australian data centers, but we all

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:34.550
<v Speaker 0>use products from American companies and and European

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.270
<v Speaker 0>companies as well. So they notoriously

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:39.510
<v Speaker 0>have quite bad speeds with some of our

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:39.830
<v Speaker 0>services,

00:16:40.355 --> 00:16:42.435
<v Speaker 0>which is why we need to decrease that

00:16:42.435 --> 00:16:43.315
<v Speaker 0>latency.

00:16:44.194 --> 00:16:46.595
<v Speaker 0>You can see London to New York is

00:16:46.595 --> 00:16:47.714
<v Speaker 0>only 70.

00:16:48.115 --> 00:16:50.435
<v Speaker 0>LA and Austin are around that mark. Tokyo

00:16:50.435 --> 00:16:52.115
<v Speaker 0>and then Sydney. So it just keeps growing

00:16:52.115 --> 00:16:54.274
<v Speaker 0>again, but it is governed by the law.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.120
<v Speaker 1>Is that best case or worst case?

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.960
<v Speaker 1>So so the so a lot of those

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.760
<v Speaker 1>were maybe, like, IBX to IBX or data

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.679
<v Speaker 1>center to data center more so than

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.115
<v Speaker 1>you're going to probably have more hops in

00:17:12.115 --> 00:17:14.115
<v Speaker 1>there depending on if you're

00:17:14.435 --> 00:17:16.835
<v Speaker 1>resident on a residential Internet plan or your

00:17:16.835 --> 00:17:19.315
<v Speaker 1>business or whatever. It's unlikely that you're right

00:17:19.315 --> 00:17:21.875
<v Speaker 1>in the data center where, where those pages

00:17:22.515 --> 00:17:24.859
<v Speaker 1>or services are hosted. Yeah. We've not even

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:25.979
<v Speaker 0>talked about hops.

00:17:26.059 --> 00:17:27.419
<v Speaker 0>You know, when we do some trace routes

00:17:27.419 --> 00:17:30.220
<v Speaker 0>later, we can definitely break that down. But

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:31.739
<v Speaker 0>to answer your question,

00:17:33.259 --> 00:17:36.539
<v Speaker 0>it looks like this website does 30 pings

00:17:36.539 --> 00:17:37.899
<v Speaker 0>to the destination.

00:17:37.899 --> 00:17:39.100
<v Speaker 0>It displays the average,

00:17:41.115 --> 00:17:43.355
<v Speaker 0>and then it's got some extra scores for

00:17:43.355 --> 00:17:46.715
<v Speaker 0>lowest average ping, etcetera. So the details are

00:17:46.715 --> 00:17:47.195
<v Speaker 0>there

00:17:47.595 --> 00:17:49.915
<v Speaker 0>if you really, really wanna get into it.

00:17:51.035 --> 00:17:51.915
<v Speaker 0>What

00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:54.590
<v Speaker 0>this means that I think, you know, I

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:55.870
<v Speaker 0>think what I'm trying to highlight I mean,

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:57.070
<v Speaker 0>I wrote the damn doc. I should know

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:59.790
<v Speaker 0>what I'm highlighting. But is that if you

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:02.990
<v Speaker 0>want if you're building a product that is

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.710
<v Speaker 0>global scale and that means customers and and

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:07.710
<v Speaker 0>and users of your service, then you need

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.385
<v Speaker 0>to improve the performance of people and the

00:18:10.385 --> 00:18:12.065
<v Speaker 0>farthest parts from your servers.

00:18:12.544 --> 00:18:14.705
<v Speaker 0>And that just means deploying to more locations,

00:18:15.105 --> 00:18:17.105
<v Speaker 0>but not just deploying to more locations is

00:18:17.105 --> 00:18:18.784
<v Speaker 0>that you then have to be able to

00:18:18.784 --> 00:18:20.705
<v Speaker 0>route the traffic to those locations when the

00:18:20.705 --> 00:18:22.830
<v Speaker 0>customers are in those locations. Like, you don't

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:24.430
<v Speaker 0>wanna go to a central location and then

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:26.110
<v Speaker 0>redirect them, which

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:27.950
<v Speaker 0>we used to see a lot

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:31.470
<v Speaker 0>in the twenty tens, early '20 tens is

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:33.710
<v Speaker 0>that you would go to not gonna say

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:35.549
<v Speaker 0>Google. I don't think they ever did this,

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:37.275
<v Speaker 0>you know, Yahoo or something. You go to

00:18:37.275 --> 00:18:41.275
<v Speaker 0>Yahoo.com and then you're redirected to eu.Yahoo.co.uk

00:18:41.275 --> 00:18:43.275
<v Speaker 0>or whatever like that. And that was all

00:18:43.275 --> 00:18:44.955
<v Speaker 0>just handled that way. So that was a

00:18:44.955 --> 00:18:47.355
<v Speaker 0>simple way of doing it. BGP is is

00:18:47.355 --> 00:18:48.635
<v Speaker 0>much nicer solution.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:51.779
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:52.659
<v Speaker 0>So

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:56.340
<v Speaker 0>yeah. Well, that's why we have CDNs. Now

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.659
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming anyone watching this course is probably

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.740
<v Speaker 0>familiar with a CDN.

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.335
<v Speaker 0>The idea being that, you know, we host

00:19:03.335 --> 00:19:06.055
<v Speaker 0>static websites as an example on s three

00:19:06.055 --> 00:19:06.695
<v Speaker 0>bucket

00:19:07.255 --> 00:19:09.735
<v Speaker 0>or even just NGINX servers, but then we

00:19:09.735 --> 00:19:12.455
<v Speaker 0>stick something in front of it, like Cloudflare,

00:19:12.455 --> 00:19:13.815
<v Speaker 0>CloudFront, Fastly.

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:15.910
<v Speaker 0>There are others.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:18.630
<v Speaker 0>They cache all of those stuff. Those have

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:22.230
<v Speaker 0>their proxies running in many, many locations around

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.870
<v Speaker 0>the world.

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:23.990
<v Speaker 0>And

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:27.590
<v Speaker 0>your customers help them instead of your centralized

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:29.110
<v Speaker 0>server and proven their performance.

00:19:30.265 --> 00:19:33.784
<v Speaker 0>And how these CDNs work is all BGP.

00:19:34.985 --> 00:19:36.024
<v Speaker 0>Go figure.

00:19:36.424 --> 00:19:38.265
<v Speaker 0>The third part no. The fourth part of

00:19:38.265 --> 00:19:40.345
<v Speaker 0>this course is we will be implementing and

00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:41.625
<v Speaker 0>building our own CDN.

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:45.190
<v Speaker 0>So after today, we'll do our own DNS

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:47.430
<v Speaker 0>servers with BGP. We'll build our own CDN

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:48.470
<v Speaker 0>with BGP.

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:50.150
<v Speaker 0>And the last part of this course will

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:52.870
<v Speaker 0>be building our own edge functions,

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:54.550
<v Speaker 0>so your own edge Lambda

00:19:54.965 --> 00:19:56.085
<v Speaker 0>product

00:19:56.085 --> 00:19:58.005
<v Speaker 0>using BGP as well.

00:19:59.525 --> 00:20:00.804
<v Speaker 0>Anything you wanna add?

00:20:02.565 --> 00:20:03.925
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so. The

00:20:05.285 --> 00:20:08.485
<v Speaker 1>yep. CDN's good. CDN's closer to CDN's

00:20:08.485 --> 00:20:09.205
<v Speaker 1>closer to user.

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:10.660
<v Speaker 1>And,

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.940
<v Speaker 1>yes, I mean, I ran into this when,

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.020
<v Speaker 1>I think we ran into each other previously

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:16.660
<v Speaker 1>in,

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:20.340
<v Speaker 1>in Spain during conference time, and

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.984
<v Speaker 1>I was having really having

00:20:23.385 --> 00:20:25.465
<v Speaker 1>a really slow time because I was using

00:20:25.465 --> 00:20:27.784
<v Speaker 1>the VPN that's in California, which is not

00:20:27.784 --> 00:20:29.865
<v Speaker 1>close to which is not close to Spain

00:20:29.865 --> 00:20:32.505
<v Speaker 1>at all. And so if I I switched

00:20:32.505 --> 00:20:34.984
<v Speaker 1>it for the week to to Madrid, all

00:20:35.385 --> 00:20:35.945
<v Speaker 1>good again.

00:20:37.679 --> 00:20:38.399
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.120
<v Speaker 0>Alright. The last part of this document before

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.600
<v Speaker 0>we actually do something interesting

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.280
<v Speaker 0>with this is just to kinda talk about

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.039
<v Speaker 0>how BGP work. So

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.440
<v Speaker 0>when we want to send a request to

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.400
<v Speaker 0>an IP address,

00:20:53.735 --> 00:20:54.455
<v Speaker 0>we

00:20:54.774 --> 00:20:57.735
<v Speaker 0>the Internet, the mystical Internet, has to route

00:20:57.735 --> 00:20:59.094
<v Speaker 0>that traffic for you.

00:20:59.575 --> 00:21:01.975
<v Speaker 0>What typically happens is your browser makes a

00:21:01.975 --> 00:21:03.894
<v Speaker 0>request to your ISP.

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:07.250
<v Speaker 0>I was in the ISP. There's likely an

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:10.049
<v Speaker 0>autonomous system. Autonomous systems

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:11.090
<v Speaker 0>are

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:12.690
<v Speaker 0>essentially

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:13.410
<v Speaker 0>that

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:16.290
<v Speaker 0>know how to route traffic within their own

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:18.610
<v Speaker 0>network, but they do this based on prefixes.

00:21:19.605 --> 00:21:20.405
<v Speaker 0>So

00:21:20.405 --> 00:21:22.805
<v Speaker 0>we got an example here as this router

00:21:22.805 --> 00:21:25.125
<v Speaker 0>or autonomous system will say, hey. I know

00:21:25.125 --> 00:21:28.485
<v Speaker 0>all of these prefixes, 123Dot0Slash24,

00:21:29.285 --> 00:21:31.125
<v Speaker 0>and it keeps the traffic within the autonomous

00:21:31.125 --> 00:21:31.365
<v Speaker 0>system.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.669
<v Speaker 0>If there is a prefix that it doesn't

00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:35.830
<v Speaker 0>understand, it's going to reach out to its

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:38.710
<v Speaker 0>peers and say, do you know this prefix?

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:41.029
<v Speaker 0>And when those peers come back and say,

00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:43.350
<v Speaker 0>oh, yeah. I I'm responsible for this prefix

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:44.710
<v Speaker 0>that will rip the traffic to there, or

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:46.070
<v Speaker 0>it may say, oh, I know someone else

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:47.945
<v Speaker 0>is responsible for this prefix. And it starts

00:21:47.945 --> 00:21:50.185
<v Speaker 0>to route the traffic through all of these

00:21:50.185 --> 00:21:51.544
<v Speaker 0>autonomous system

00:21:51.865 --> 00:21:53.225
<v Speaker 0>until eventually

00:21:53.385 --> 00:21:55.865
<v Speaker 0>you get to the server.

00:21:56.265 --> 00:21:58.665
<v Speaker 0>And what you want is a company which

00:21:58.665 --> 00:22:01.280
<v Speaker 0>has a very intelligent backbone with a good

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.680
<v Speaker 0>number of peers where those prefixes could be

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.560
<v Speaker 0>resolved and as many not as many. And

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.120
<v Speaker 0>as less or little hops

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.320
<v Speaker 0>as possible

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.400
<v Speaker 0>because the less hops that you do, the

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.560
<v Speaker 0>faster or the less the latency will be.

00:22:16.355 --> 00:22:19.315
<v Speaker 0>And that's where Equinix comes in. Equinix has

00:22:19.794 --> 00:22:22.514
<v Speaker 0>one of probably the most substantial

00:22:22.515 --> 00:22:25.794
<v Speaker 0>Internet backbone in the world. I I can't

00:22:25.794 --> 00:22:26.914
<v Speaker 0>think of another.

00:22:27.154 --> 00:22:27.395
<v Speaker 0>So

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:30.789
<v Speaker 0>and that's because Equinix works with Google,

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:31.669
<v Speaker 0>Amazon,

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:34.629
<v Speaker 0>Cloudflare, all these other people too, I believe.

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:36.149
<v Speaker 0>Don't quote me on that.

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:38.950
<v Speaker 0>You can quote Jeremy on that if he

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:39.590
<v Speaker 0>agrees, but not

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:42.470
<v Speaker 1>I was gonna say, I'm not sure there's

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:45.145
<v Speaker 1>anybody that we don't, but partner

00:22:45.145 --> 00:22:48.345
<v Speaker 1>partner team is standing by. Yeah. Equinix is

00:22:48.345 --> 00:22:49.785
<v Speaker 0>the Internet. So

00:22:50.025 --> 00:22:51.785
<v Speaker 0>they have a good network for this.

00:22:52.185 --> 00:22:54.345
<v Speaker 0>So what we're gonna do today is set

00:22:54.345 --> 00:22:56.025
<v Speaker 0>up a global IP, which just means it's

00:22:56.025 --> 00:22:58.220
<v Speaker 0>an IP address that Equinix will broadcast to

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:00.540
<v Speaker 0>us within all the autonomous systems that they

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.540
<v Speaker 0>own and peer with, and we should be

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:04.220
<v Speaker 0>able to see some traffic. Now I know

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:05.580
<v Speaker 0>this is a lot of words,

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:09.180
<v Speaker 0>and I decided to do some diagrams to

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.540
<v Speaker 0>try and show how this works.

00:23:12.025 --> 00:23:14.105
<v Speaker 0>Now what this diagram assumes is that your

00:23:14.105 --> 00:23:17.544
<v Speaker 0>application has a EU server, a US server,

00:23:17.625 --> 00:23:19.304
<v Speaker 0>and an Australian server.

00:23:19.705 --> 00:23:22.025
<v Speaker 0>And what happens is our clients make requests

00:23:22.025 --> 00:23:23.545
<v Speaker 0>in The UK and Germany

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:26.780
<v Speaker 0>to their ISP.

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:27.900
<v Speaker 0>Their ISP

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.300
<v Speaker 0>either has their own autonomous system or peers

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.300
<v Speaker 0>with other autonomous systems that are already within

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:33.179
<v Speaker 0>the EU

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:34.700
<v Speaker 0>because

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:38.060
<v Speaker 0>our infrastructure providers such as Equinix Medal

00:23:38.565 --> 00:23:39.845
<v Speaker 0>is advertising

00:23:39.845 --> 00:23:41.044
<v Speaker 0>our prefix

00:23:41.365 --> 00:23:44.004
<v Speaker 0>to these autonomous systems, we get directed

00:23:44.645 --> 00:23:46.565
<v Speaker 0>we get routed directly

00:23:46.565 --> 00:23:48.004
<v Speaker 0>to the EU server.

00:23:48.325 --> 00:23:51.049
<v Speaker 0>And the same works within The US. You

00:23:51.049 --> 00:23:53.370
<v Speaker 0>can have customers within New York and Los

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:56.009
<v Speaker 0>Angeles who go through their own ISP.

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:58.490
<v Speaker 0>It's likely there's a ton of systems in

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:00.090
<v Speaker 0>New York and Los Angeles,

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:01.450
<v Speaker 0>and they can all route to the same

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:03.370
<v Speaker 0>US server or maybe you're going

00:24:03.755 --> 00:24:05.835
<v Speaker 0>full hawk here and you have servers on

00:24:05.835 --> 00:24:07.115
<v Speaker 0>the East Coast and the West Coast, and

00:24:07.115 --> 00:24:08.955
<v Speaker 0>those will be routed appropriately as well.

00:24:09.355 --> 00:24:11.675
<v Speaker 0>And then the same happens for Australia.

00:24:11.915 --> 00:24:14.075
<v Speaker 0>Which is one extra example here is that,

00:24:14.075 --> 00:24:15.195
<v Speaker 0>you know, Japan,

00:24:15.355 --> 00:24:17.195
<v Speaker 0>there may not be you may not run

00:24:17.195 --> 00:24:20.630
<v Speaker 0>any infrastructure in the Japan or China or

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:22.950
<v Speaker 0>everything like that, but we still want to

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:25.110
<v Speaker 0>see as few hops as possible to get

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:27.190
<v Speaker 0>it across for that Australian server.

00:24:28.309 --> 00:24:30.309
<v Speaker 0>Those diagrams make sense? You happy with that?

00:24:31.955 --> 00:24:33.475
<v Speaker 1>I think so. The

00:24:33.715 --> 00:24:34.675
<v Speaker 1>and the

00:24:35.315 --> 00:24:37.955
<v Speaker 1>the IP address will be the same IP

00:24:37.955 --> 00:24:40.835
<v Speaker 1>for all of like, there's one IP that's

00:24:40.835 --> 00:24:43.635
<v Speaker 1>then being announced from each announced

00:24:43.635 --> 00:24:44.515
<v Speaker 1>from each place.

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Right. Is the same Yeah. Yeah. I should

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:49.690
<v Speaker 0>have I should have asked for the diagram.

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:51.690
<v Speaker 0>All clients, we can request for

00:24:51.929 --> 00:24:53.770
<v Speaker 0>eight dot eight dot eight dot eight or

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:55.929
<v Speaker 0>one two three four or whatever.

00:24:56.169 --> 00:24:58.010
<v Speaker 0>But, yeah, you're right. All these clients are

00:24:58.010 --> 00:24:58.809
<v Speaker 0>using the same

00:24:59.505 --> 00:25:02.465
<v Speaker 0>IP address to reach different servers around the

00:25:02.465 --> 00:25:03.024
<v Speaker 0>world.

00:25:03.265 --> 00:25:04.145
<v Speaker 0>Excuse me.

00:25:04.865 --> 00:25:06.945
<v Speaker 0>Which is what makes BGP so cool. You

00:25:06.945 --> 00:25:09.024
<v Speaker 0>don't have to have overly complicated

00:25:09.825 --> 00:25:12.559
<v Speaker 0>DNS setups. You don't need to have well,

00:25:12.559 --> 00:25:13.840
<v Speaker 0>in fact, yeah, it would just be DNS

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.360
<v Speaker 0>that you've done this any other way,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.080
<v Speaker 0>but that can be rather complex.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.920
<v Speaker 0>Multiplexing,

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.800
<v Speaker 0>multicasting, your BGP are a very clean way

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:23.360
<v Speaker 0>to do that.

00:25:24.975 --> 00:25:28.014
<v Speaker 0>Alright. And and that's what's called Anycast?

00:25:29.375 --> 00:25:30.495
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:25:30.495 --> 00:25:32.895
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Anycast BGP. I I said multiplex, didn't

00:25:32.895 --> 00:25:34.815
<v Speaker 0>I? Anycast BGP. There we go.

00:25:36.655 --> 00:25:40.335
<v Speaker 1>How does that go wrong? What happens if

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:40.669
<v Speaker 1>so

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:43.870
<v Speaker 1>is the

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:46.270
<v Speaker 1>are each of the servers themselves,

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:49.790
<v Speaker 1>announcing the route to get to them, or

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:52.990
<v Speaker 1>is that something that happens at the provider?

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:53.550
<v Speaker 1>Or

00:25:55.095 --> 00:25:56.695
<v Speaker 1>what happens when one of the servers turns

00:25:56.695 --> 00:25:57.255
<v Speaker 1>off?

00:25:59.575 --> 00:26:01.255
<v Speaker 0>Well, I mean, we can speak from

00:26:02.055 --> 00:26:04.615
<v Speaker 0>the Equinix metal perspective, and as we're gonna

00:26:04.615 --> 00:26:07.510
<v Speaker 0>show how that works here. So

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:08.549
<v Speaker 1>Oh.

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:10.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh, we we we probably should head to

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:12.149
<v Speaker 1>the lab, but okay.

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:15.429
<v Speaker 0>Well, you know,

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:17.990
<v Speaker 0>it's not anybody can just start

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:22.394
<v Speaker 0>announcing or advertising BGP routes. Right? You

00:26:22.475 --> 00:26:24.635
<v Speaker 0>can run your own autonomous system for sure.

00:26:24.635 --> 00:26:26.394
<v Speaker 0>But if nobody peers with you,

00:26:27.355 --> 00:26:28.234
<v Speaker 0>those routes

00:26:28.554 --> 00:26:30.154
<v Speaker 0>don't reach the global network.

00:26:30.635 --> 00:26:33.274
<v Speaker 0>This is where Equinix come in. Equinix have

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:35.460
<v Speaker 0>probably one of the best peer networks in

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:37.140
<v Speaker 0>the world, which means if you're able to

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:40.020
<v Speaker 0>advertise your IP address to them, it's gonna

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.100
<v Speaker 0>go to hopefully most of the autonomous systems

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.940
<v Speaker 0>on the Internet and give you that

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:47.235
<v Speaker 0>quick, fast, low hop routing that you really

00:26:47.235 --> 00:26:47.715
<v Speaker 0>want.

00:26:49.155 --> 00:26:51.235
<v Speaker 0>But we do see a lot of BGP

00:26:51.235 --> 00:26:52.835
<v Speaker 0>attacks on the Internet as well. I don't

00:26:52.835 --> 00:26:53.875
<v Speaker 0>know if that's where you were going with

00:26:53.875 --> 00:26:56.755
<v Speaker 0>your question, but, you know, people autonomous systems

00:26:56.755 --> 00:26:57.395
<v Speaker 0>could

00:26:57.649 --> 00:27:00.130
<v Speaker 0>and there's a prefix that they don't actually

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:01.409
<v Speaker 0>or can't actually

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:03.489
<v Speaker 0>and this is usually

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:06.049
<v Speaker 0>when you see has to go down. It's

00:27:06.049 --> 00:27:07.090
<v Speaker 0>usually misconfiguration

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:09.169
<v Speaker 0>for BGP. Right? Like,

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:11.490
<v Speaker 0>every time a CDN network like Fastly

00:27:11.835 --> 00:27:14.474
<v Speaker 0>or Cloudflare go down, it's

00:27:14.475 --> 00:27:15.195
<v Speaker 0>either,

00:27:15.595 --> 00:27:18.075
<v Speaker 0>yeah, a typo on their BGP prefix and

00:27:18.075 --> 00:27:20.315
<v Speaker 0>the traffic is routed to the to nowhere.

00:27:22.075 --> 00:27:24.235
<v Speaker 0>But with Equinix and Equinix metal,

00:27:24.769 --> 00:27:27.730
<v Speaker 0>they're tighter controls. They're passwords on the BGP

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:30.769
<v Speaker 0>servers. You can only broadcast global IPs.

00:27:30.929 --> 00:27:32.609
<v Speaker 0>I think we just show how it works,

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:34.370
<v Speaker 0>and then hopefully that makes more sense because

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:35.889
<v Speaker 0>I'm just gonna start waffling otherwise.

00:27:37.144 --> 00:27:38.024
<v Speaker 1>Nope. That's

00:27:39.705 --> 00:27:42.024
<v Speaker 1>that'll work. Alright. So we're gonna move on

00:27:42.024 --> 00:27:43.144
<v Speaker 0>to part two.

00:27:44.825 --> 00:27:47.304
<v Speaker 0>We're gonna deploy our first servers.

00:27:48.504 --> 00:27:50.024
<v Speaker 0>So we're just gonna keep this nice and

00:27:50.024 --> 00:27:50.745
<v Speaker 0>simple for today.

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:54.670
<v Speaker 0>Deploy two NGINX servers in two different metros

00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:57.710
<v Speaker 0>within the Equinix metal network and configure our

00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:59.710
<v Speaker 0>BGP. If you get stuck, there's a video.

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:01.790
<v Speaker 0>Hey. That's this video, which you're probably watching

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:03.150
<v Speaker 0>right now. So

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:05.950
<v Speaker 0>remember to use the code Rawkode for your

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:08.965
<v Speaker 0>credit and start by browsing to the Equinix

00:28:08.965 --> 00:28:10.005
<v Speaker 0>middle console

00:28:10.245 --> 00:28:13.684
<v Speaker 0>and requesting our first global IP.

00:28:14.085 --> 00:28:15.924
<v Speaker 0>So we can do that now.

00:28:16.885 --> 00:28:18.485
<v Speaker 0>But from your project,

00:28:18.565 --> 00:28:19.925
<v Speaker 0>we go to IPs

00:28:19.925 --> 00:28:20.965
<v Speaker 0>and IPs,

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:22.950
<v Speaker 0>request,

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:25.510
<v Speaker 0>and you have two options. You've got your

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:26.710
<v Speaker 0>public IPv4

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:28.710
<v Speaker 0>or the global IPv4.

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:30.790
<v Speaker 0>So it is a bit more expensive, but

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:32.950
<v Speaker 0>it's totally worth it if you wanna keep

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:34.230
<v Speaker 0>that latency down

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:37.225
<v Speaker 0>all around the world, You can select how

00:28:37.225 --> 00:28:39.145
<v Speaker 0>many you need. For today, we just need

00:28:39.145 --> 00:28:39.705
<v Speaker 0>one.

00:28:40.825 --> 00:28:43.705
<v Speaker 0>I'll just put course as a tag

00:28:45.385 --> 00:28:48.505
<v Speaker 0>and we'll submit our request.

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:51.350
<v Speaker 0>If those buttons are not Yeah. I

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:53.269
<v Speaker 0>I didn't go.

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:55.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. No. I suppose that stands to highlight

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:58.230
<v Speaker 1>definite in in this interface anywhere on the

00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:00.869
<v Speaker 1>global being on the right side there. Otherwise,

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:05.015
<v Speaker 1>BGP, you can use locally to inside your

00:29:05.255 --> 00:29:08.695
<v Speaker 1>inside a single metro or location to swap

00:29:08.695 --> 00:29:11.174
<v Speaker 1>IPs around machines. But if you're looking to

00:29:11.735 --> 00:29:13.174
<v Speaker 1>be routable from

00:29:13.255 --> 00:29:14.135
<v Speaker 1>outside,

00:29:14.135 --> 00:29:14.534
<v Speaker 1>then

00:29:15.895 --> 00:29:17.255
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Gotta go global.

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.179
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's refresh this page.

00:29:21.139 --> 00:29:23.219
<v Speaker 0>And I now have my global IP address.

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:25.059
<v Speaker 0>Now if any of those options are not

00:29:25.059 --> 00:29:27.220
<v Speaker 0>there, what you need to do is go

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:28.259
<v Speaker 0>to BGP

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:30.980
<v Speaker 0>and there's a button to enable it here.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:32.100
<v Speaker 0>I already have it enabled.

00:29:32.924 --> 00:29:34.445
<v Speaker 0>But if you don't see the global option,

00:29:34.445 --> 00:29:35.965
<v Speaker 0>you have to come here and turn it

00:29:35.965 --> 00:29:36.604
<v Speaker 0>on.

00:29:38.684 --> 00:29:41.244
<v Speaker 0>Next, we're gonna spin up to servers.

00:29:43.005 --> 00:29:44.764
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to use on demand servers.

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.320
<v Speaker 0>You know, if you're just playing around, just

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.800
<v Speaker 0>pick the smallest instance available within the metro.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.080
<v Speaker 0>You don't need anything

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:55.000
<v Speaker 0>demanding or powerful for this. And just make

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.600
<v Speaker 0>sure you deploy Ubuntu

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.680
<v Speaker 0>because all the commands below

00:29:59.095 --> 00:30:02.054
<v Speaker 0>are for Ubuntu or Debian machine.

00:30:03.654 --> 00:30:05.414
<v Speaker 0>All right. So let's do

00:30:05.975 --> 00:30:08.134
<v Speaker 0>I'll do Amsterdam.

00:30:09.975 --> 00:30:11.174
<v Speaker 0>Ubuntu

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:12.899
<v Speaker 0>and

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:13.779
<v Speaker 0>go.

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:18.100
<v Speaker 0>Got a a favorite region in The US

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:19.619
<v Speaker 0>you would like me to deploy to?

00:30:21.299 --> 00:30:23.539
<v Speaker 1>I think the closest is gonna be Dallas.

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.380
<v Speaker 0>Dallas. We can do Dallas.

00:30:26.665 --> 00:30:28.905
<v Speaker 0>And they've also got c three small

00:30:30.265 --> 00:30:30.905
<v Speaker 0>and

00:30:32.505 --> 00:30:33.145
<v Speaker 0>go.

00:30:34.825 --> 00:30:36.345
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Those will take

00:30:38.345 --> 00:30:40.520
<v Speaker 0>two to three minutes. Oh, go back to

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:42.440
<v Speaker 0>server page. There we go. Yep. Those will

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.600
<v Speaker 0>take two to three minutes. So we'll

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.000
<v Speaker 0>maybe I should have done that at the

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.919
<v Speaker 0>start and then went back to the introduction.

00:30:49.399 --> 00:30:50.279
<v Speaker 0>That's all good.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.159
<v Speaker 0>So once those come up, we're gonna SSH

00:30:53.159 --> 00:30:54.919
<v Speaker 0>onto them. We're gonna run a few commands.

00:30:55.345 --> 00:30:57.825
<v Speaker 0>Our goal is we are going to run

00:30:57.825 --> 00:31:01.585
<v Speaker 0>NGINX on Dallas machine and the Amsterdam machine,

00:31:01.585 --> 00:31:04.545
<v Speaker 0>and we'll run curl request

00:31:05.025 --> 00:31:05.905
<v Speaker 0>locally,

00:31:05.905 --> 00:31:07.185
<v Speaker 0>which should give us

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.880
<v Speaker 0>some simple stats about how long the command

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.799
<v Speaker 0>took to open the connection, get the first

00:31:12.799 --> 00:31:13.839
<v Speaker 0>pay, etcetera.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.320
<v Speaker 0>We'll also run a trace route so you

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.880
<v Speaker 0>can actually see the hops that the request

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.960
<v Speaker 0>for my machine takes to get to the

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:21.279
<v Speaker 0>server.

00:31:22.534 --> 00:31:24.854
<v Speaker 0>What we what we would expect to see

00:31:25.495 --> 00:31:28.615
<v Speaker 0>is that I hit the Amsterdam server. We

00:31:28.615 --> 00:31:30.534
<v Speaker 0>can modify the HTML just so that prints

00:31:30.534 --> 00:31:34.374
<v Speaker 0>out, hi. I'm Amsterdam and hi. I'm Dallas.

00:31:34.615 --> 00:31:37.070
<v Speaker 0>But we should see that always hit the

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:38.590
<v Speaker 0>Amsterdam server.

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:41.789
<v Speaker 0>After that, we'll use

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:43.710
<v Speaker 0>or, I mean, we could curl from the

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:45.630
<v Speaker 0>Dallas machine, but I guess that's not gonna

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:47.710
<v Speaker 0>be very interesting from a written perspective. But

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:50.510
<v Speaker 0>there's a website listed here too

00:31:51.855 --> 00:31:54.415
<v Speaker 0>after we get past all this stuff called

00:31:54.415 --> 00:31:56.655
<v Speaker 0>loco ping. I have a computer. I'm in

00:31:56.655 --> 00:31:58.975
<v Speaker 1>Texas. I'll give it a look. Yeah. Yeah.

00:31:58.975 --> 00:32:00.175
<v Speaker 0>We can do it from your machine too

00:32:00.175 --> 00:32:01.535
<v Speaker 0>if you're happy to share your screen, but

00:32:01.535 --> 00:32:02.894
<v Speaker 0>I I didn't want to assume.

00:32:03.775 --> 00:32:05.890
<v Speaker 0>We can also use local ping, which will

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:06.530
<v Speaker 0>show

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:09.090
<v Speaker 0>gives us a web interface to trace route

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:10.930
<v Speaker 0>as well. And I think we can select

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:12.770
<v Speaker 0>the location that it runs from. So, hopefully,

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:14.450
<v Speaker 0>we'd be able to experiment and see where

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:14.610
<v Speaker 0>that

00:32:16.895 --> 00:32:19.455
<v Speaker 0>alright. The way that we're configuring BGP today

00:32:19.455 --> 00:32:21.614
<v Speaker 0>is through a piece of software called BERT.

00:32:23.054 --> 00:32:24.735
<v Speaker 0>This just does does

00:32:24.895 --> 00:32:27.615
<v Speaker 0>this handles the BGP advertising

00:32:27.615 --> 00:32:29.294
<v Speaker 0>from each of our machines to the top

00:32:29.294 --> 00:32:31.135
<v Speaker 0>of rack switches within Equinix metal.

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:34.080
<v Speaker 0>Those can then publish it to the Equinix

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.400
<v Speaker 0>network, and then all the written happens and

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.800
<v Speaker 0>get spread to the Equinix peers. We should

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:40.800
<v Speaker 0>see this happen really, really quickly.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.240
<v Speaker 0>What also may be cool to do because

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:46.825
<v Speaker 0>I'm trying to go to off script in

00:32:46.825 --> 00:32:47.945
<v Speaker 0>our demo today,

00:32:48.664 --> 00:32:50.024
<v Speaker 0>is we should be able to shut down

00:32:50.024 --> 00:32:52.024
<v Speaker 0>BERT on one of the machines.

00:32:52.424 --> 00:32:53.945
<v Speaker 0>And within a minute,

00:32:54.105 --> 00:32:55.384
<v Speaker 0>probably quicker,

00:32:55.705 --> 00:32:58.105
<v Speaker 0>we'll actually see that our prefix will no

00:32:58.105 --> 00:32:59.784
<v Speaker 0>longer be advertised within that region,

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:02.690
<v Speaker 0>and then it will shut down Amsterdam. And

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:04.609
<v Speaker 0>what should happen is I get redirected

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:07.169
<v Speaker 0>to Dallas. So we'll see the latency increase,

00:33:07.169 --> 00:33:10.129
<v Speaker 0>but I'm not losing access to the service.

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:12.450
<v Speaker 0>So kinda That's where I was going.

00:33:13.455 --> 00:33:14.254
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:33:15.535 --> 00:33:17.054
<v Speaker 0>Cool. I didn't pick up on that, but

00:33:17.054 --> 00:33:18.575
<v Speaker 0>there we go. I'm glad we got there.

00:33:18.655 --> 00:33:20.255
<v Speaker 0>I'm glad I got there in the end.

00:33:20.255 --> 00:33:22.255
<v Speaker 0>You just need to you'd give me more

00:33:22.255 --> 00:33:23.695
<v Speaker 0>heads. That's all.

00:33:24.095 --> 00:33:25.695
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Like I said, I never had that

00:33:25.695 --> 00:33:26.575
<v Speaker 0>03:00 coffee.

00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:30.049
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Let's let's go see where we are

00:33:30.049 --> 00:33:31.330
<v Speaker 0>with these machines.

00:33:33.809 --> 00:33:35.570
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We've got one. So we can start

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:36.770
<v Speaker 0>with Amsterdam

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:37.410
<v Speaker 0>First.

00:33:43.155 --> 00:33:44.035
<v Speaker 0>We're

00:33:44.035 --> 00:33:46.115
<v Speaker 0>hopefully gonna be able to SSH on,

00:33:46.915 --> 00:33:48.595
<v Speaker 0>click the button on my watch.

00:33:49.235 --> 00:33:49.555
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:55.710
<v Speaker 0>Probably just do these at the same time.

00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:58.029
<v Speaker 0>We don't really need to configure both, right?

00:33:58.029 --> 00:33:59.470
<v Speaker 0>Let's see if they have an IP address

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:00.029
<v Speaker 0>yet.

00:34:00.909 --> 00:34:01.629
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:34:02.909 --> 00:34:05.549
<v Speaker 0>All right. Won't be able to SSH just

00:34:05.549 --> 00:34:06.350
<v Speaker 0>yet, I don't think.

00:34:08.455 --> 00:34:10.375
<v Speaker 0>But I yeah. I'll wait till I'm on

00:34:10.375 --> 00:34:12.054
<v Speaker 0>it and then I can broadcast my input

00:34:12.054 --> 00:34:14.135
<v Speaker 0>to both. Nobody wants to see me input

00:34:14.135 --> 00:34:15.415
<v Speaker 0>and solve these things twice.

00:34:21.299 --> 00:34:23.139
<v Speaker 0>Let's see. How far are we?

00:34:25.539 --> 00:34:26.819
<v Speaker 0>It could be another minute.

00:34:31.554 --> 00:34:33.235
<v Speaker 0>Okay. We'll just start. I will do it

00:34:33.235 --> 00:34:33.795
<v Speaker 0>twice.

00:34:34.995 --> 00:34:36.594
<v Speaker 0>Maybe the first couple of Oh, that'll allow

00:34:36.594 --> 00:34:37.795
<v Speaker 1>you to that'll

00:34:37.795 --> 00:34:39.395
<v Speaker 1>allow you to make the do a quick

00:34:39.395 --> 00:34:40.114
<v Speaker 1>twiddle of a

00:34:41.074 --> 00:34:42.995
<v Speaker 1>so you don't have to change both of

00:34:42.995 --> 00:34:43.555
<v Speaker 1>the

00:34:43.875 --> 00:34:46.035
<v Speaker 1>NGINX hello pages. You'd only have to change

00:34:46.035 --> 00:34:46.594
<v Speaker 1>one of them.

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Because if the other one was the default,

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:50.190
<v Speaker 1>then you'd know.

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:52.030
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Sure.

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:53.470
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:54.670
<v Speaker 0>So

00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:55.950
<v Speaker 0>at update

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:58.590
<v Speaker 0>and then after install BERT and NGINX, we're

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:01.470
<v Speaker 0>going to install one more package. Equinix metal

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:03.695
<v Speaker 0>make this really, really easy for us. I

00:35:03.695 --> 00:35:05.215
<v Speaker 0>don't know why I've not got the link.

00:35:05.535 --> 00:35:06.975
<v Speaker 0>I'll need to add that. I'll edit that

00:35:06.975 --> 00:35:07.615
<v Speaker 0>after.

00:35:07.935 --> 00:35:09.535
<v Speaker 0>So the network help us or an open

00:35:09.535 --> 00:35:11.695
<v Speaker 0>source repository on the Equinix GitHub

00:35:11.855 --> 00:35:14.095
<v Speaker 0>just in Python scripts that configure BERT for

00:35:14.095 --> 00:35:16.015
<v Speaker 0>you using the metadata service.

00:35:16.255 --> 00:35:17.980
<v Speaker 0>So you don't even really need to hand

00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:19.900
<v Speaker 0>draw your own BERT config, which is pretty

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:20.540
<v Speaker 0>nice.

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:24.700
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Last try before I broadcast my input.

00:35:25.019 --> 00:35:25.980
<v Speaker 0>Oh, alright.

00:35:30.155 --> 00:35:32.555
<v Speaker 0>Okay. I can zoom in or I can

00:35:32.555 --> 00:35:33.915
<v Speaker 0>change my text size.

00:35:38.155 --> 00:35:39.435
<v Speaker 0>We're on this profile.

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:47.529
<v Speaker 0>We'll do app install nginx

00:35:47.529 --> 00:35:48.570
<v Speaker 0>for

00:35:49.049 --> 00:35:51.049
<v Speaker 0>that oh, no. I have to clone the

00:35:51.049 --> 00:35:53.210
<v Speaker 0>network helpers, but I do need Python.

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:53.930
<v Speaker 0>So

00:35:54.765 --> 00:35:56.684
<v Speaker 0>I'll grab these two back. Yeah. You have

00:35:56.684 --> 00:35:58.125
<v Speaker 1>the you have the link down there in

00:35:58.125 --> 00:36:01.244
<v Speaker 1>configuring a in the configuring bird section.

00:36:02.924 --> 00:36:04.925
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's just do Python three.

00:36:06.204 --> 00:36:06.924
<v Speaker 0>Much better.

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:16.690
<v Speaker 0>The Dallas box is taking a wee bit

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:17.329
<v Speaker 0>extra time.

00:36:21.925 --> 00:36:22.565
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:36:23.365 --> 00:36:24.885
<v Speaker 0>Now we can jump over here

00:36:25.125 --> 00:36:27.045
<v Speaker 0>and run this. I'll run through these commands

00:36:27.045 --> 00:36:28.885
<v Speaker 0>in a second. Let's just rate the file

00:36:28.885 --> 00:36:29.365
<v Speaker 0>first.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.480
<v Speaker 0>And then we'll open this up because we

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.560
<v Speaker 0>need to do a small copy or a

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:38.840
<v Speaker 0>small substitution.

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.040
<v Speaker 0>So what you have to do with BGP

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.520
<v Speaker 0>addresses is bind them to the look back

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.160
<v Speaker 0>device on your Linux machine. We have to

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.335
<v Speaker 0>paste in our address here, which we're gonna

00:36:49.335 --> 00:36:51.575
<v Speaker 0>get from the Equinix page.

00:36:55.494 --> 00:36:57.015
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's do that there.

00:36:57.494 --> 00:36:59.494
<v Speaker 0>So we go to our IP address and

00:36:59.494 --> 00:37:01.015
<v Speaker 0>we copy our global one.

00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:03.290
<v Speaker 0>And

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:08.090
<v Speaker 0>we drop it in. The netmask is there

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:10.330
<v Speaker 0>and we save. And we should be able

00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:10.970
<v Speaker 0>to just run

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:12.650
<v Speaker 0>Come

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:13.130
<v Speaker 0>on, David.

00:37:17.085 --> 00:37:18.525
<v Speaker 0>What I get wrong there?

00:37:20.445 --> 00:37:21.805
<v Speaker 0>That's my guide.

00:37:23.405 --> 00:37:24.365
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:37:29.005 --> 00:37:30.045
<v Speaker 0>IP ADR.

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:35.619
<v Speaker 0>We have our BGP address. Now you can

00:37:35.619 --> 00:37:36.740
<v Speaker 0>just ignore the

00:37:37.539 --> 00:37:40.339
<v Speaker 0>the warning errors here. Those are

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:42.260
<v Speaker 0>collateral damage.

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.660
<v Speaker 0>But we do have this, which I think

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:45.140
<v Speaker 0>is correct.

00:37:46.235 --> 00:37:47.755
<v Speaker 0>But next,

00:37:49.515 --> 00:37:51.595
<v Speaker 0>we are gonna use the metadata service to

00:37:51.595 --> 00:37:53.915
<v Speaker 0>pull down some peer information.

00:37:54.875 --> 00:37:56.235
<v Speaker 0>I'm just gonna copy this.

00:37:59.120 --> 00:37:59.840
<v Speaker 0>So

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.160
<v Speaker 0>in fact, let's just show how this works.

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.200
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So when you're on Equinix metal devices,

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.560
<v Speaker 0>you can hit this endpoint.

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:10.400
<v Speaker 0>Can't type.

00:38:14.555 --> 00:38:15.515
<v Speaker 0>Did

00:38:19.755 --> 00:38:21.115
<v Speaker 0>I spell something wrong? Oh, yeah.

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:26.910
<v Speaker 0>And you get this big massive JSON blob.

00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:29.150
<v Speaker 0>Pivot through I don't have JQ.

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:36.990
<v Speaker 0>Pivot through JQ, and you get all this

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:38.670
<v Speaker 0>metadata from the device. This is all your

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:39.470
<v Speaker 0>network information,

00:38:40.385 --> 00:38:43.185
<v Speaker 0>but more importantly, it has our BGP information.

00:38:43.265 --> 00:38:43.825
<v Speaker 0>So

00:38:47.025 --> 00:38:47.825
<v Speaker 0>grep

00:38:47.825 --> 00:38:48.704
<v Speaker 0>for peer.

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:56.700
<v Speaker 0>Why does

00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:58.220
<v Speaker 0>not work?

00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:00.220
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't matter.

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:02.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That's a built in. You there at

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:03.740
<v Speaker 1>the very least.

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:06.860
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming j q maybe spits out the

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:07.980
<v Speaker 0>text as standard.

00:39:09.285 --> 00:39:11.525
<v Speaker 0>No. It doesn't. It was standard though. Yeah.

00:39:11.525 --> 00:39:13.125
<v Speaker 0>I don't know. I think it should be

00:39:13.125 --> 00:39:14.085
<v Speaker 1>it should be pretty

00:39:14.645 --> 00:39:16.805
<v Speaker 0>maybe it be printed. But There's no clear

00:39:16.805 --> 00:39:17.925
<v Speaker 0>information here.

00:39:20.964 --> 00:39:22.085
<v Speaker 0>So we've missed a step.

00:39:24.119 --> 00:39:25.960
<v Speaker 0>Let's make sure BGP is enabled on our

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:26.359
<v Speaker 0>device.

00:39:35.525 --> 00:39:36.405
<v Speaker 0>Disabled.

00:39:37.765 --> 00:39:38.725
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

00:39:43.765 --> 00:39:45.925
<v Speaker 0>So I'll add that to the guide as

00:39:45.925 --> 00:39:48.085
<v Speaker 0>well and I'll enable it on our Dallas

00:39:48.085 --> 00:39:48.485
<v Speaker 0>server.

00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:53.930
<v Speaker 0>Cool. So you have to enable BGP.

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:56.410
<v Speaker 0>And that should be almost instantaneous.

00:39:57.609 --> 00:39:59.530
<v Speaker 0>So yep. There we go. So if we

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:01.849
<v Speaker 0>do the JQ Grep again, you'll see that

00:40:01.849 --> 00:40:06.490
<v Speaker 0>we have a peer autonomous system ID 65530,

00:40:06.675 --> 00:40:08.515
<v Speaker 0>And then our peer IPs are listed as

00:40:08.515 --> 00:40:10.435
<v Speaker 0>an array afterwards. And if we take off

00:40:10.435 --> 00:40:13.155
<v Speaker 0>the grid, it should still be relatively visible.

00:40:17.475 --> 00:40:19.555
<v Speaker 0>Here. There we go. So we've got our

00:40:19.555 --> 00:40:21.395
<v Speaker 0>BGP neighbors configuration now.

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:24.740
<v Speaker 0>You can see all of this stuff.

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.140
<v Speaker 0>So we've got everything that we need. We

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:28.660
<v Speaker 0>also have access to the server now. So

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:29.940
<v Speaker 0>let's get caught up so that I don't

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:31.140
<v Speaker 0>have to type everything twice.

00:40:36.185 --> 00:40:37.065
<v Speaker 0>Update

00:40:38.025 --> 00:40:39.705
<v Speaker 0>install.

00:40:39.865 --> 00:40:40.585
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:40:40.665 --> 00:40:41.625
<v Speaker 0>Get

00:40:41.785 --> 00:40:42.585
<v Speaker 0>type

00:40:43.065 --> 00:40:43.705
<v Speaker 0>three,

00:40:44.425 --> 00:40:45.785
<v Speaker 0>hyphen three,

00:40:45.785 --> 00:40:45.865
<v Speaker 0>put.

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:52.380
<v Speaker 0>And

00:40:58.940 --> 00:40:59.740
<v Speaker 0>the interface.

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:17.950
<v Speaker 0>Mars has a nice tech to use dash

00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:20.350
<v Speaker 0>dash raw with j q. Cool.

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:22.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah.

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:25.950
<v Speaker 0>That'll work.

00:41:28.065 --> 00:41:29.105
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:41:30.625 --> 00:41:32.545
<v Speaker 0>So we need to drop in our BGP

00:41:32.545 --> 00:41:33.585
<v Speaker 0>address again.

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:49.350
<v Speaker 0>All right.

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:51.190
<v Speaker 0>I

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:52.630
<v Speaker 0>think we're in the same place.

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:53.270
<v Speaker 0>So

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:54.950
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna broadcast

00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:56.150
<v Speaker 0>this

00:41:57.635 --> 00:41:58.755
<v Speaker 0>to all.

00:42:02.994 --> 00:42:03.715
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:42:04.595 --> 00:42:06.195
<v Speaker 0>Back to my guide. So what are we

00:42:06.195 --> 00:42:07.155
<v Speaker 0>doing with that metadata?

00:42:13.579 --> 00:42:15.579
<v Speaker 0>I think this command is actually doing much

00:42:15.579 --> 00:42:17.500
<v Speaker 0>reset for showing us stuff. So let's just

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.020
<v Speaker 0>run that. I don't have to queue another

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:19.339
<v Speaker 0>machine.

00:42:27.345 --> 00:42:28.945
<v Speaker 0>The joys. Alright.

00:42:29.265 --> 00:42:31.185
<v Speaker 0>Yes. So this curl is just going to

00:42:31.185 --> 00:42:32.705
<v Speaker 0>j q and pulling out information that we

00:42:32.705 --> 00:42:35.345
<v Speaker 0>need. So we've got IP addresses, autonomous systems,

00:42:35.665 --> 00:42:38.625
<v Speaker 0>and we've got the peer IP addresses. These

00:42:38.625 --> 00:42:39.505
<v Speaker 0>are the things that we need.

00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:43.210
<v Speaker 0>Next we're adding the routes.

00:42:43.849 --> 00:42:47.530
<v Speaker 0>So let's

00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:49.210
<v Speaker 0>just do the curl first.

00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:54.569
<v Speaker 0>So if we paste this, we get a

00:42:54.569 --> 00:42:56.010
<v Speaker 0>gateway

00:42:56.875 --> 00:42:58.714
<v Speaker 0>that we need to route our traffic through.

00:42:58.714 --> 00:43:00.474
<v Speaker 0>And if we run IP route,

00:43:04.154 --> 00:43:06.315
<v Speaker 0>think it's handled for us already on these

00:43:06.315 --> 00:43:08.875
<v Speaker 0>machines. But sometimes what you'll get with

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:11.570
<v Speaker 0>depending on the metro facility, I can't remember

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:14.130
<v Speaker 0>how this works, maybe even the IPX that

00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:16.130
<v Speaker 0>you will have to add that route manually.

00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:18.130
<v Speaker 0>But if you see your gateway list is

00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:20.210
<v Speaker 0>an IP route table, then you're okay.

00:43:21.730 --> 00:43:23.875
<v Speaker 0>So we can skip that step. Next, we

00:43:23.875 --> 00:43:26.275
<v Speaker 0>wanna configure birds. So let's just do this

00:43:26.275 --> 00:43:28.995
<v Speaker 0>couple commands at a time. We're creating a

00:43:28.995 --> 00:43:31.875
<v Speaker 0>directory under opt and cloning our network helper.

00:43:32.355 --> 00:43:34.755
<v Speaker 0>We could see the Internet and install our

00:43:34.755 --> 00:43:35.555
<v Speaker 0>dependencies.

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:38.570
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully, it just work.

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:41.290
<v Speaker 0>We can run a configure script, which is

00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:43.050
<v Speaker 0>also gonna write and show us the failures

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:44.330
<v Speaker 0>in the t command.

00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:46.650
<v Speaker 0>Whole bunch of stuff there that configures our

00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:49.530
<v Speaker 0>BGP neighbors based on that metadata that we

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:51.610
<v Speaker 0>already seen through the curl j two command.

00:43:52.695 --> 00:43:55.175
<v Speaker 0>And next, we can restart

00:43:55.735 --> 00:43:57.735
<v Speaker 0>or start BART in this case.

00:43:58.455 --> 00:44:01.255
<v Speaker 0>If we run a system CTL status,

00:44:02.775 --> 00:44:04.055
<v Speaker 0>we can see that it's running.

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:07.160
<v Speaker 0>And we'll ignore that error, I don't think

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:08.440
<v Speaker 0>that is an issue.

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:12.760
<v Speaker 0>Confirm this works, Bart provides a console where

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:14.840
<v Speaker 0>we can run this command

00:44:18.119 --> 00:44:19.559
<v Speaker 0>and

00:44:21.605 --> 00:44:22.645
<v Speaker 0>looks good.

00:44:22.964 --> 00:44:24.885
<v Speaker 0>We have our address,

00:44:24.885 --> 00:44:26.485
<v Speaker 0>the autonomous system,

00:44:27.685 --> 00:44:29.525
<v Speaker 0>things should be cool.

00:44:30.005 --> 00:44:30.565
<v Speaker 0>Drop it.

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:34.620
<v Speaker 0>All right, testy test time.

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:37.500
<v Speaker 0>Let's modify

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:38.940
<v Speaker 0>var

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:39.900
<v Speaker 0>w.

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:42.220
<v Speaker 0>Is that a thing?

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:44.060
<v Speaker 0>Oh, is on one of them.

00:44:47.085 --> 00:44:49.085
<v Speaker 0>Did I I forget NGINX on the first

00:44:49.085 --> 00:44:50.685
<v Speaker 0>machine? Oh, no. I'm still in BERT.

00:44:51.645 --> 00:44:52.365
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:44:52.685 --> 00:44:53.165
<v Speaker 0>Then

00:44:57.369 --> 00:44:59.290
<v Speaker 0>I need someone to type for me.

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:00.250
<v Speaker 0>HTML.

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:06.170
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no. I don't have it.

00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:07.610
<v Speaker 0>Bar.

00:45:09.369 --> 00:45:10.970
<v Speaker 0>Oh, there we go. Okay.

00:45:11.905 --> 00:45:13.585
<v Speaker 0>Default NGINX page,

00:45:14.785 --> 00:45:17.265
<v Speaker 0>and we'll just change the welcome text.

00:45:18.225 --> 00:45:20.225
<v Speaker 0>We'll stop the broadcast for a moment.

00:45:24.789 --> 00:45:27.109
<v Speaker 0>So this first one is Amsterdam.

00:45:27.269 --> 00:45:29.190
<v Speaker 0>The second one is

00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:30.230
<v Speaker 0>Dallas.

00:45:32.549 --> 00:45:34.549
<v Speaker 0>And then go back to broadcast. Oh, we

00:45:34.549 --> 00:45:36.309
<v Speaker 0>don't need to broadcast now because we're we've

00:45:36.309 --> 00:45:37.109
<v Speaker 0>done all the

00:45:37.695 --> 00:45:39.215
<v Speaker 0>the work as it were.

00:45:40.255 --> 00:45:40.975
<v Speaker 0>And

00:45:42.015 --> 00:45:43.775
<v Speaker 0>in theory, and I'm a bit nervous to

00:45:43.775 --> 00:45:45.055
<v Speaker 0>go running this now,

00:45:45.695 --> 00:45:47.775
<v Speaker 0>this should work. Let me open it in

00:45:47.775 --> 00:45:48.495
<v Speaker 0>the right profile.

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:54.510
<v Speaker 0>We should be able to do a curl

00:45:54.589 --> 00:45:56.990
<v Speaker 0>no. It should be a to our IP

00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:57.390
<v Speaker 0>address.

00:46:04.335 --> 00:46:04.975
<v Speaker 0>Well,

00:46:05.775 --> 00:46:07.535
<v Speaker 1>is it working? No spoilers.

00:46:08.895 --> 00:46:10.175
<v Speaker 1>It is working.

00:46:10.415 --> 00:46:12.494
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I haven't restarted it today. Oh, no.

00:46:12.494 --> 00:46:14.415
<v Speaker 0>I shouldn't have to restart it today. I

00:46:14.815 --> 00:46:17.375
<v Speaker 1>get I get welcome to Dallas welcoming me

00:46:17.375 --> 00:46:20.660
<v Speaker 1>in 14775408.

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:23.300
<v Speaker 0>Hey. Look at that.

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:25.859
<v Speaker 0>So I am continuously

00:46:25.859 --> 00:46:26.820
<v Speaker 0>Amsterdam.

00:46:27.059 --> 00:46:28.740
<v Speaker 0>Wow. We may actually finish this stream on

00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:30.420
<v Speaker 0>time. I was getting a bit nervous there.

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:31.859
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:46:32.099 --> 00:46:34.260
<v Speaker 0>Let's run our trace route to our IP

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:37.245
<v Speaker 0>address. I really need to copy that thing.

00:46:42.765 --> 00:46:44.525
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna copy again now because I'll need

00:46:44.525 --> 00:46:45.165
<v Speaker 0>a few things.

00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:50.630
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Traceroutes can

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:52.950
<v Speaker 0>take a little bit of time, especially as

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:54.070
<v Speaker 0>I go through

00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:55.430
<v Speaker 0>my ISP's

00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:58.630
<v Speaker 0>network, which does not respond to ICMP pings,

00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:59.910
<v Speaker 0>which is what those stars mean.

00:47:00.405 --> 00:47:02.965
<v Speaker 0>It slows down the entire traceroute because it's

00:47:02.965 --> 00:47:04.405
<v Speaker 0>gonna do it three times before it gives

00:47:04.405 --> 00:47:04.965
<v Speaker 0>up.

00:47:05.285 --> 00:47:06.485
<v Speaker 0>And I think it's gonna do that a

00:47:06.485 --> 00:47:07.365
<v Speaker 0>bunch of times.

00:47:07.525 --> 00:47:09.605
<v Speaker 0>Is there a command with traceroute to just

00:47:09.605 --> 00:47:11.685
<v Speaker 0>do one thing and give up? I don't

00:47:11.685 --> 00:47:11.845
<v Speaker 0>know.

00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:15.550
<v Speaker 1>One ping only? I believe so. I I

00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:17.630
<v Speaker 1>can't remember what it is offhand. But

00:47:26.255 --> 00:47:29.135
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'm not oh, yeah. Dash q queries.

00:47:33.375 --> 00:47:35.055
<v Speaker 0>Let's try speeding this up then. I'm about

00:47:35.055 --> 00:47:35.855
<v Speaker 0>one.

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:40.520
<v Speaker 0>And if that does these stars, I'll be

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:42.040
<v Speaker 0>making you unhappy. Let's set us back a

00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:43.000
<v Speaker 0>bit twice sec.

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.855
<v Speaker 0>Good. That'll speed up a little bit until

00:47:50.855 --> 00:47:53.494
<v Speaker 0>we get outside of my very opaque ISP

00:47:53.494 --> 00:47:54.695
<v Speaker 0>five g network.

00:47:56.535 --> 00:47:58.214
<v Speaker 0>Has the Trisher are you doing our Trisher

00:47:58.214 --> 00:47:58.855
<v Speaker 0>too?

00:47:59.815 --> 00:48:00.375
<v Speaker 0>Same.

00:48:00.615 --> 00:48:02.214
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I'm

00:48:02.214 --> 00:48:03.815
<v Speaker 1>getting about getting about eight and a half

00:48:03.815 --> 00:48:04.935
<v Speaker 1>milliseconds over here.

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:10.680
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:48:10.839 --> 00:48:12.280
<v Speaker 0>I mean, that looks like we hit the

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:12.920
<v Speaker 0>network.

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:14.440
<v Speaker 0>So what's it done there?

00:48:20.035 --> 00:48:22.675
<v Speaker 0>I don't know. Alright. 15 hops. You're fight

00:48:22.835 --> 00:48:24.275
<v Speaker 1>can you fire off ping first? I I

00:48:24.275 --> 00:48:26.035
<v Speaker 1>went ping first, which gave me the

00:48:26.435 --> 00:48:27.315
<v Speaker 1>which gave me the

00:48:28.115 --> 00:48:29.955
<v Speaker 1>yeah. So 12 hops over here.

00:48:31.075 --> 00:48:32.995
<v Speaker 0>Cool. So we got our hops. We can

00:48:32.995 --> 00:48:35.630
<v Speaker 0>see the trace route. Actually thought we'd see

00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:36.910
<v Speaker 0>some of the

00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:40.270
<v Speaker 0>normally, when I wrote a trace route, we

00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:42.350
<v Speaker 0>see some of the IPX information. Like, oh,

00:48:42.350 --> 00:48:44.190
<v Speaker 0>you've hit Dallas and you've gone through this

00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:45.150
<v Speaker 0>metro facility.

00:48:46.185 --> 00:48:47.945
<v Speaker 0>But not today, but that's okay.

00:48:48.425 --> 00:48:50.105
<v Speaker 0>But we got nice little ping,

00:48:50.665 --> 00:48:51.785
<v Speaker 0>and it

00:48:52.185 --> 00:48:52.905
<v Speaker 0>works.

00:48:53.225 --> 00:48:53.865
<v Speaker 0>So

00:48:55.465 --> 00:48:57.545
<v Speaker 0>before I go shutting down

00:48:58.185 --> 00:48:59.065
<v Speaker 0>barge

00:48:59.065 --> 00:48:59.865
<v Speaker 0>on

00:48:59.865 --> 00:49:00.825
<v Speaker 0>Amsterdam,

00:49:00.905 --> 00:49:02.905
<v Speaker 0>let's try

00:49:02.109 --> 00:49:03.150
<v Speaker 0>locaping

00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:06.910
<v Speaker 0>and see what this gives us.

00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:12.670
<v Speaker 0>Cool. So we can drop in our IP

00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:15.070
<v Speaker 0>address and let's hit this from

00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:17.285
<v Speaker 0>somewhere that might be yeah. I don't know

00:49:17.285 --> 00:49:19.365
<v Speaker 0>where Singapore or Hong Kong will route to.

00:49:22.565 --> 00:49:25.525
<v Speaker 0>Oh, this isn't gonna show us the HTML.

00:49:25.525 --> 00:49:26.885
<v Speaker 0>So who knows?

00:49:27.765 --> 00:49:28.885
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no. We we can see.

00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:31.590
<v Speaker 0>It gives us country information.

00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:37.670
<v Speaker 0>Is it finished?

00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:40.710
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, went to Dallas. There we go.

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:43.030
<v Speaker 0>Although it's in New York, but I assume

00:49:44.085 --> 00:49:44.965
<v Speaker 0>Dallas.

00:49:45.045 --> 00:49:45.765
<v Speaker 0>All right.

00:49:46.805 --> 00:49:49.765
<v Speaker 0>Let's try that again from France.

00:49:49.925 --> 00:49:51.125
<v Speaker 0>See if it's different.

00:49:52.325 --> 00:49:53.845
<v Speaker 0>Oh, it's doing it from both. Oh, that's

00:49:53.845 --> 00:49:54.085
<v Speaker 0>cool.

00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:00.810
<v Speaker 0>Well, we hit Dallas again over here.

00:50:02.890 --> 00:50:04.089
<v Speaker 0>It looks like the one on the right

00:50:04.089 --> 00:50:04.809
<v Speaker 0>is finished.

00:50:17.065 --> 00:50:19.385
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's enable a few more. Screw it.

00:50:19.385 --> 00:50:20.185
<v Speaker 0>Spain,

00:50:20.265 --> 00:50:21.145
<v Speaker 0>Italy,

00:50:21.305 --> 00:50:22.265
<v Speaker 0>Netherlands,

00:50:22.265 --> 00:50:23.145
<v Speaker 0>USA.

00:50:23.865 --> 00:50:24.184
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:31.910
<v Speaker 0>Right. So Dallas at Dallas really quickly. Amsterdam

00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:34.710
<v Speaker 0>is in America.

00:50:36.070 --> 00:50:36.790
<v Speaker 0>Interesting.

00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:41.190
<v Speaker 0>Oh, they're all going there. Oh, no. Except

00:50:41.830 --> 00:50:42.790
<v Speaker 0>Milan went to.

00:50:44.645 --> 00:50:45.285
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:50:45.445 --> 00:50:47.605
<v Speaker 0>Maybe that website works. I'm not sure.

00:50:48.325 --> 00:50:49.845
<v Speaker 0>Let's do another test.

00:50:50.085 --> 00:50:51.765
<v Speaker 0>Let's shut down bird.

00:50:56.589 --> 00:50:57.950
<v Speaker 0>Stop.

00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:00.750
<v Speaker 0>Let's shut down NGINX too.

00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:04.350
<v Speaker 0>But we should have nothing

00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:06.670
<v Speaker 0>run-in here.

00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:08.990
<v Speaker 0>And if we do a curl,

00:51:12.815 --> 00:51:14.095
<v Speaker 0>I have Dallas.

00:51:16.734 --> 00:51:18.255
<v Speaker 0>I was just making more things go Yeah.

00:51:24.974 --> 00:51:25.214
<v Speaker 1>The

00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:27.390
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to I was trying to

00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:29.070
<v Speaker 1>figure out exactly what would happen,

00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:30.990
<v Speaker 1>then if it would immediately,

00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:33.950
<v Speaker 1>fail over and send you to the, the

00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:36.589
<v Speaker 1>correct one or if any, any additional intervention

00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:37.390
<v Speaker 1>would be required.

00:51:39.015 --> 00:51:41.815
<v Speaker 0>No. No intervention should be required because when

00:51:41.815 --> 00:51:43.335
<v Speaker 0>Bart stops advertising,

00:51:43.415 --> 00:51:45.255
<v Speaker 0>the autonomous system in that region will just

00:51:45.255 --> 00:51:46.375
<v Speaker 0>drop the prefix.

00:51:46.855 --> 00:51:49.494
<v Speaker 0>It's really quick. I remember Dan doing some

00:51:49.494 --> 00:51:52.055
<v Speaker 0>tests with his open source project

00:51:53.095 --> 00:51:53.974
<v Speaker 0>Oh. KubePit.

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:56.240
<v Speaker 0>Oh. I think he said he got it

00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:57.920
<v Speaker 0>he said it was, like, three seconds for

00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:59.840
<v Speaker 0>the failover and the prefix to be dropped.

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:01.600
<v Speaker 0>So it's it's super fast.

00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:03.760
<v Speaker 0>And the fact that I could just curl

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:06.240
<v Speaker 0>and even though it's a bit longer

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:07.200
<v Speaker 0>to Dallas,

00:52:08.555 --> 00:52:10.155
<v Speaker 0>you know, we're seeing the hundred and thirty

00:52:10.155 --> 00:52:12.955
<v Speaker 0>two milliseconds ping instead of the thirty milliseconds

00:52:12.955 --> 00:52:15.195
<v Speaker 0>ping. At least I'm still getting a service.

00:52:15.195 --> 00:52:15.835
<v Speaker 0>So

00:52:16.315 --> 00:52:19.035
<v Speaker 0>what we're seeing is BGP is great for

00:52:19.035 --> 00:52:20.555
<v Speaker 0>globally written traffic

00:52:21.339 --> 00:52:23.099
<v Speaker 0>to your customers, at least to a data

00:52:23.099 --> 00:52:24.780
<v Speaker 0>center or server as close to your customers

00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:25.740
<v Speaker 0>as possible.

00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:27.980
<v Speaker 0>But as a happy side effect of this,

00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:30.140
<v Speaker 0>should you happen to lose any of those

00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:31.180
<v Speaker 0>advertisements,

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:33.900
<v Speaker 0>the global network can reroute you to somewhere

00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:34.140
<v Speaker 0>else.

00:52:35.085 --> 00:52:36.845
<v Speaker 0>Maybe a good experiment for this if we

00:52:36.845 --> 00:52:38.525
<v Speaker 0>ever do a rerecord of the first part

00:52:38.525 --> 00:52:40.285
<v Speaker 0>would be to do three or four servers

00:52:40.285 --> 00:52:42.125
<v Speaker 0>and shut them down strategically

00:52:42.125 --> 00:52:44.125
<v Speaker 0>to see where I'm gonna be routed through.

00:52:44.125 --> 00:52:46.845
<v Speaker 0>But I think for today, this is a

00:52:46.845 --> 00:52:47.805
<v Speaker 0>success.

00:52:48.365 --> 00:52:48.605
<v Speaker 0>So

00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:51.730
<v Speaker 0>we'll jump back. It should go like, it

00:52:51.730 --> 00:52:53.890
<v Speaker 1>should continuously go from wherever you are to

00:52:53.890 --> 00:52:57.329
<v Speaker 1>next fastest or fewest or fewest tops. But,

00:52:57.329 --> 00:52:58.690
<v Speaker 1>yeah, it'll be a

00:52:59.089 --> 00:53:00.930
<v Speaker 1>yeah. It'll be a you know, fun experiment.

00:53:01.089 --> 00:53:03.089
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. If I can't be routed to Amsterdam,

00:53:03.089 --> 00:53:05.335
<v Speaker 0>I would like they route me to Germany

00:53:05.335 --> 00:53:06.615
<v Speaker 0>if I had one there.

00:53:07.015 --> 00:53:08.615
<v Speaker 0>If there was nothing in Germany, maybe it

00:53:08.615 --> 00:53:10.695
<v Speaker 0>would go to the next yeah. The the

00:53:10.695 --> 00:53:12.935
<v Speaker 0>the network handles this for you, especially this

00:53:12.935 --> 00:53:14.375
<v Speaker 0>is why it's important to be in a

00:53:14.375 --> 00:53:17.095
<v Speaker 0>network like Equinix where they have these peers.

00:53:17.095 --> 00:53:18.055
<v Speaker 0>They have the backbone,

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.640
<v Speaker 0>and the intelligent written should be there for

00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:21.200
<v Speaker 0>you.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.480
<v Speaker 0>I hope people find us useful.
