00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.570
<v Speaker 0>Hello. Welcome to Rawkode Live.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.770
<v Speaker 0>Today is part one of three of a

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.530
<v Speaker 0>clustered KubeCon special.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.690
<v Speaker 0>We're mixing things up a little bit today

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.530
<v Speaker 0>and doing it slightly differently

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.050
<v Speaker 0>than we have done in the past. I

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.490
<v Speaker 0>hope you all enjoy the new format.

00:01:10.105 --> 00:01:11.705
<v Speaker 0>Feel free to leave comments as we go,

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:12.825
<v Speaker 0>but do our best to get them on

00:01:12.825 --> 00:01:14.985
<v Speaker 0>the screen and so forth. Now before we

00:01:14.985 --> 00:01:16.985
<v Speaker 0>get started, there's a little bit of housekeeping.

00:01:17.625 --> 00:01:19.625
<v Speaker 0>First, please subscribe to the YouTube if you

00:01:19.625 --> 00:01:21.705
<v Speaker 0>haven't already. Also remember to click the bell.

00:01:21.705 --> 00:01:23.625
<v Speaker 0>That way you'll get notifications whenever I go

00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:24.985
<v Speaker 0>live covering clustered

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.190
<v Speaker 0>or any of the other cloud native technologies

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.870
<v Speaker 0>out there that we'll be doing learning materials

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:29.430
<v Speaker 0>on.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.830
<v Speaker 0>If you're not watching live or even if

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.190
<v Speaker 0>you are, but you just like to chat,

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.750
<v Speaker 0>join us in the Discord at Rawkode.chat.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.670
<v Speaker 0>There's now almost 300 of us in there

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.470
<v Speaker 0>talking cloud native Kubernetes and everything in between.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.025
<v Speaker 0>So come and say hello.

00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:45.065
<v Speaker 0>And lastly, I wanna thank my employer, Equinix

00:01:45.065 --> 00:01:47.385
<v Speaker 0>Metal. They allow me to do this on

00:01:47.385 --> 00:01:49.784
<v Speaker 0>their time, which is great. They provide the

00:01:49.784 --> 00:01:52.025
<v Speaker 0>resources for me to use for all of

00:01:52.025 --> 00:01:54.104
<v Speaker 0>these many, many clusters also. So thank you

00:01:54.104 --> 00:01:56.330
<v Speaker 0>very much Equinix Metal. You can check it

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.090
<v Speaker 0>out with the code Rawkode.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.250
<v Speaker 0>This will get you $200 That's up to

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.970
<v Speaker 0>four hundred hours of bare metal compute. Check

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.410
<v Speaker 0>it out, have some fun and let me

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.450
<v Speaker 0>know how you get on.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.650
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Like I said, today we are mixing

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.004
<v Speaker 0>things up a little bit. This is not

00:02:11.004 --> 00:02:13.004
<v Speaker 0>breakers well, it is breakers versus fixers, but

00:02:13.004 --> 00:02:15.245
<v Speaker 0>a slightly different format. I am joined by

00:02:15.485 --> 00:02:18.845
<v Speaker 0>Walid and Noel. We have all brought a

00:02:18.845 --> 00:02:20.765
<v Speaker 0>broken cluster with us today, and we're gonna

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:23.209
<v Speaker 0>pair up and fix where the breaker laughs

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.890
<v Speaker 0>at us along the way. If we need

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.969
<v Speaker 0>any help, I'm sure we'll all be helpy.

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.209
<v Speaker 0>We'll all be happy to throw in some

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.090
<v Speaker 0>advice as well. So first, hey, Noel. Hey,

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.290
<v Speaker 0>Walid. How are you both?

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.730
<v Speaker 1>Hi. Hey, good. How are you? I know.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.305
<v Speaker 0>I just said like hello to you both,

00:02:38.305 --> 00:02:39.505
<v Speaker 0>and then, like, give you the opportunity to

00:02:39.505 --> 00:02:40.865
<v Speaker 0>fight each other to say hello back. So

00:02:41.105 --> 00:02:42.545
<v Speaker 0>no. Why don't you say hello and tell

00:02:42.545 --> 00:02:43.905
<v Speaker 0>us a little bit about you first?

00:02:45.505 --> 00:02:46.225
<v Speaker 2>Yep.

00:02:46.385 --> 00:02:49.665
<v Speaker 2>CubeCon week, so deprived of sleep. That's our

00:02:49.665 --> 00:02:50.785
<v Speaker 2>only downside,

00:02:51.105 --> 00:02:53.105
<v Speaker 2>and otherwise, I'm doing good

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.870
<v Speaker 2>and, like, catching up all the talks and

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.470
<v Speaker 2>being in the hallway section.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Definitely. A really packed week. So much

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.550
<v Speaker 0>going on just now. So hopefully, this gives

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.310
<v Speaker 0>you a little bit of a a break

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.590
<v Speaker 0>from all the talks and a little bit

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.709
<v Speaker 0>of fun in between.

00:03:08.145 --> 00:03:10.225
<v Speaker 0>Walid, say hello and let us know who

00:03:10.225 --> 00:03:10.945
<v Speaker 0>you are, please.

00:03:11.505 --> 00:03:12.705
<v Speaker 1>Hey, everybody.

00:03:12.865 --> 00:03:14.465
<v Speaker 1>I'm Walid,

00:03:14.865 --> 00:03:17.425
<v Speaker 1>the cloud native janitor. I'm still early in

00:03:17.425 --> 00:03:19.825
<v Speaker 1>my journey to cloud native,

00:03:19.985 --> 00:03:22.305
<v Speaker 1>watching David videos as I am,

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:23.629
<v Speaker 1>and he's

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 1>and hoping to learn something today.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:28.670
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:29.550
<v Speaker 0>Well,

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:30.670
<v Speaker 0>we have

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.110
<v Speaker 0>three clusters.

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.270
<v Speaker 0>We we've each broken one.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.070
<v Speaker 0>And we're gonna start with cluster 19,

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.075
<v Speaker 0>which is Waleed's cluster. So Noel and I

00:03:39.075 --> 00:03:40.595
<v Speaker 0>will be taking point on this and trying

00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:42.355
<v Speaker 0>to debug our way to get this cluster

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:43.635
<v Speaker 0>happy and healthy.

00:03:43.715 --> 00:03:45.155
<v Speaker 0>Walid, we'll let you know if we need

00:03:45.155 --> 00:03:46.035
<v Speaker 0>any advice,

00:03:47.715 --> 00:03:49.635
<v Speaker 0>but I'm sure this is gonna be

00:03:50.515 --> 00:03:51.394
<v Speaker 0>very interesting.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.610
<v Speaker 0>I'm curious to see just how many ways

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.690
<v Speaker 0>we can break clusters. Like, there's one thing

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.770
<v Speaker 0>that continues to amaze me with every episode

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.090
<v Speaker 0>of clustered is that we're always seeing new

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.650
<v Speaker 0>weird ways of breaking the system.

00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:08.145
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Noel. And probably after watching some talks,

00:04:08.145 --> 00:04:10.545
<v Speaker 2>like, over this, you've gone, I probably have

00:04:10.545 --> 00:04:11.425
<v Speaker 2>more ideas.

00:04:11.905 --> 00:04:13.665
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Hopefully, keep going has given us all

00:04:13.665 --> 00:04:14.944
<v Speaker 0>a little bit of advice to try and

00:04:14.944 --> 00:04:15.825
<v Speaker 0>fix these things.

00:04:16.385 --> 00:04:18.360
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna join onto the control plane of

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.520
<v Speaker 0>Wally's cluster. If you can join that session,

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.320
<v Speaker 0>please know.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.120
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. And just type echo hello. Let us

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.800
<v Speaker 0>know that you're there. There's mine.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.920
<v Speaker 0>And I'm sure Wally just made this nice

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.200
<v Speaker 0>and easy for us as well. Right?

00:04:32.275 --> 00:04:33.955
<v Speaker 1>Use cube control. So

00:04:36.115 --> 00:04:38.755
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I didn't even use Carol.

00:04:40.675 --> 00:04:43.795
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's just get our setup working with

00:04:43.795 --> 00:04:46.195
<v Speaker 0>the Kubernetes clusters. We'll just export the cube

00:04:46.195 --> 00:04:46.995
<v Speaker 0>config.

00:04:47.235 --> 00:04:49.290
<v Speaker 0>We'll do alias k. Otherwise, I'm gonna be

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.850
<v Speaker 0>typing on MacMod all day. And then, Noel,

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.210
<v Speaker 0>I will give you the honors of running

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.370
<v Speaker 0>get nodes or get pods whenever you wish.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.770
<v Speaker 2>Oh, I'll just have that auto completion.

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.330
<v Speaker 0>And the completion. I always forget about the

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.970
<v Speaker 0>completion.

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:01.850
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

00:05:06.345 --> 00:05:07.945
<v Speaker 2>Oh, what did I do?

00:05:08.505 --> 00:05:10.265
<v Speaker 2>Oh, it's on the Yes, Lewis.

00:05:11.065 --> 00:05:13.305
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Completion bash. Right? We're learning from you,

00:05:13.305 --> 00:05:13.705
<v Speaker 1>Lewis.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.460
<v Speaker 2>Glad and typing.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.220
<v Speaker 0>That's because you're being watched.

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:30.020
<v Speaker 0>Look at that.

00:05:30.935 --> 00:05:33.414
<v Speaker 0>We have a control plan. Thank you, Vallid.

00:05:33.414 --> 00:05:34.535
<v Speaker 0>We appreciate that.

00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:37.974
<v Speaker 0>It looks like we have one worker node

00:05:37.974 --> 00:05:39.014
<v Speaker 0>offline.

00:05:39.574 --> 00:05:40.615
<v Speaker 0>We just check-in our

00:05:41.895 --> 00:05:44.134
<v Speaker 0>yeah. Go for it. I'm just describe

00:05:44.134 --> 00:05:47.180
<v Speaker 2>it to see if it's like something obvious.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.700
<v Speaker 2>Oh,

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.580
<v Speaker 2>come on.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.820
<v Speaker 0>So we got an access for Ben on

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:56.860
<v Speaker 0>describing

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.740
<v Speaker 0>in node.

00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:00.375
<v Speaker 0>RBAC. Oh, I see Wow.

00:06:01.655 --> 00:06:03.415
<v Speaker 1>I thought this was a CKE

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:04.294
<v Speaker 1>issue.

00:06:07.974 --> 00:06:09.254
<v Speaker 0>All right. So

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.530
<v Speaker 0>I mean, taking down one of our our

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.449
<v Speaker 0>work and all that's obviously a problem. Shall

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:15.970
<v Speaker 0>we check to see if our workload pod

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.970
<v Speaker 0>is also running? Just to see if there's

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.330
<v Speaker 0>more than one issue.

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:23.250
<v Speaker 1>There's Yep. Three issues.

00:06:24.255 --> 00:06:27.215
<v Speaker 0>Three issues. Alright. Let's do a get pods.

00:06:28.255 --> 00:06:30.975
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Our postgres has been terminating for a

00:06:30.975 --> 00:06:33.935
<v Speaker 0>rather long time. I suspect that probably because

00:06:34.095 --> 00:06:36.895
<v Speaker 2>the node. Yep. That's not ready probably.

00:06:36.975 --> 00:06:38.414
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's what I'm thinking too.

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:40.410
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Okay.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:41.690
<v Speaker 2>Yep.

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:43.450
<v Speaker 2>That's what you think. And not yep.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.050
<v Speaker 0>What's it like just sitting there and getting

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.410
<v Speaker 0>to watch a sweat a little while you

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.410
<v Speaker 0>do? Is it good on that side of

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.050
<v Speaker 0>the fence?

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:52.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,

00:06:53.865 --> 00:06:55.785
<v Speaker 1>you laugh last, no? Anyway.

00:06:57.065 --> 00:06:58.905
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So I've opened

00:06:59.545 --> 00:07:03.145
<v Speaker 0>a shell on the broken worker, if you

00:07:03.145 --> 00:07:04.025
<v Speaker 0>wanna join that.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.050
<v Speaker 0>And we'll we'll start debugging.

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:09.810
<v Speaker 0>Just give me an echo or something when

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:10.450
<v Speaker 0>you're there.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.370
<v Speaker 0>Did you join, or did you start a

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:16.849
<v Speaker 0>new session?

00:07:19.745 --> 00:07:22.465
<v Speaker 2>I my Firefox is acting weird. I can't

00:07:22.465 --> 00:07:24.145
<v Speaker 2>see the other taps. It's kind of like

00:07:24.865 --> 00:07:25.825
<v Speaker 2>even better.

00:07:27.185 --> 00:07:29.185
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I'll poke around just now while you

00:07:29.185 --> 00:07:31.264
<v Speaker 0>sort that out. So first thing I'm gonna

00:07:31.264 --> 00:07:33.825
<v Speaker 0>look for might have to close and rejoin.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.920
<v Speaker 2>Yep. Give me a minute. Like, I just

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.600
<v Speaker 2>picked in and rejoined. You take your time.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.040
<v Speaker 0>I'm just gonna poke around right now. So

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.400
<v Speaker 0>I'm just checking the

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.000
<v Speaker 0>status of our system d service for the

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.160
<v Speaker 0>kubelet. It appears to be loaded, enabled, but

00:07:50.575 --> 00:07:51.375
<v Speaker 0>dead.

00:07:56.175 --> 00:07:57.135
<v Speaker 0>I wonder,

00:07:57.535 --> 00:07:59.695
<v Speaker 0>I'm just gonna try the completely naive thing

00:07:59.695 --> 00:08:01.215
<v Speaker 0>first but I'm just gonna restart it.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.030
<v Speaker 0>I guess we're pulling up oh, where's my

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:18.150
<v Speaker 1>You're not on the controller blink. You're in

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:18.550
<v Speaker 1>the node.

00:08:19.825 --> 00:08:21.825
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I was just seeing a Your your

00:08:21.825 --> 00:08:23.665
<v Speaker 1>muscle memory is working here.

00:08:25.264 --> 00:08:25.825
<v Speaker 1>So

00:08:26.865 --> 00:08:29.185
<v Speaker 1>this is I saw some I saw some

00:08:29.185 --> 00:08:31.905
<v Speaker 1>folks basically asking that they wanted to watch

00:08:31.905 --> 00:08:33.904
<v Speaker 1>this for doing the CKA,

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.620
<v Speaker 1>and I watched you and and the CTF

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:37.660
<v Speaker 1>saying that

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.140
<v Speaker 1>what brought this ID was the CKN, CKAD

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.380
<v Speaker 1>troubleshooting. So I said, okay. Let's have some

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.980
<v Speaker 1>CKA troubleshooting session.

00:08:47.865 --> 00:08:49.465
<v Speaker 1>So this would be simple.

00:08:51.145 --> 00:08:51.865
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:08:52.265 --> 00:08:53.865
<v Speaker 0>Well, it appears.

00:09:02.029 --> 00:09:03.630
<v Speaker 0>There we go. We have no back.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:04.670
<v Speaker 2>Great.

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:07.310
<v Speaker 1>I always make the mistake that I sometimes

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:08.670
<v Speaker 1>I think complicated,

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:09.150
<v Speaker 1>but

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:11.710
<v Speaker 1>things I

00:09:12.029 --> 00:09:15.774
<v Speaker 1>learned from Lewis from control plane that thinks

00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:17.454
<v Speaker 1>think simple first.

00:09:19.615 --> 00:09:20.415
<v Speaker 0>We have some might.

00:09:23.615 --> 00:09:25.535
<v Speaker 2>We have We do have some errors. Right?

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:29.050
<v Speaker 0>We do. So we I restarted the kubelet.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:30.890
<v Speaker 0>It's now running, which is good. I don't

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:32.170
<v Speaker 0>know why I was p s a u

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:34.410
<v Speaker 0>x and grabbing for API server because I'm

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:37.290
<v Speaker 0>I'm silly. But the kubelet is running, and

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.890
<v Speaker 0>and we do have some errors that we

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:39.930
<v Speaker 0>probably

00:09:41.765 --> 00:09:42.805
<v Speaker 2>Oh. Check.

00:09:46.405 --> 00:09:48.325
<v Speaker 2>That's, I think, fine

00:09:48.725 --> 00:09:50.805
<v Speaker 2>because oh, let's see if the ceiling ports

00:09:50.805 --> 00:09:51.285
<v Speaker 2>are running.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:55.570
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. We'll do that from the control plan,

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:57.970
<v Speaker 0>I guess. So oh, sorry. On you go.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.570
<v Speaker 0>You just take I've

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:00.450
<v Speaker 0>it's all yours.

00:10:07.625 --> 00:10:10.105
<v Speaker 2>It's not cube system. Right? But I'll just

00:10:10.105 --> 00:10:11.785
<v Speaker 2>check just in case.

00:10:12.745 --> 00:10:14.345
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's called CapEx. So

00:10:17.785 --> 00:10:19.464
<v Speaker 1>the first issue was fixed in less than

00:10:19.464 --> 00:10:20.665
<v Speaker 1>ten minutes. That's very good.

00:10:24.029 --> 00:10:26.830
<v Speaker 0>Alright. It looks like we have a

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:29.470
<v Speaker 0>I've got quite a few pending things going

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:30.750
<v Speaker 0>on here. Do you wanna describe one of

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:31.709
<v Speaker 0>those pendings?

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:34.535
<v Speaker 2>Yep. Oh,

00:10:44.535 --> 00:10:44.855
<v Speaker 1>man.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.740
<v Speaker 2>Alright. Can get the pods, but I can't

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:53.860
<v Speaker 2>describe it.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:57.540
<v Speaker 1>Strange. So

00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.460
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we need to Especially the guy

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.340
<v Speaker 1>watching KubeCon.

00:11:03.225 --> 00:11:05.704
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we let's do a

00:11:06.504 --> 00:11:07.625
<v Speaker 0>kube control

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:08.584
<v Speaker 0>off.

00:11:08.665 --> 00:11:09.785
<v Speaker 0>Can I list?

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.080
<v Speaker 1>Yes. So for node, we don't have get

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.040
<v Speaker 2>permissions.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.640
<v Speaker 2>And what so the

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:22.920
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.280
<v Speaker 0>Custer role.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.880
<v Speaker 1>But he have certificates and certificate signing requests.

00:11:28.545 --> 00:11:30.545
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what can you do with these.

00:11:32.065 --> 00:11:34.785
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So you haven't modified the cluster admin

00:11:34.785 --> 00:11:35.505
<v Speaker 0>role.

00:11:36.144 --> 00:11:36.785
<v Speaker 0>Role.

00:11:38.545 --> 00:11:41.345
<v Speaker 1>So Did I or didn't I? You'd well

00:11:41.505 --> 00:11:42.545
<v Speaker 2>I just opened it.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:46.210
<v Speaker 2>No. There is something called, like, a something

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:48.130
<v Speaker 2>I found recently

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:49.330
<v Speaker 2>about this

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:50.930
<v Speaker 2>cluster role aggregation.

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:53.410
<v Speaker 2>Right. Right? The policies can be actually merging

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.170
<v Speaker 2>from a different role, but I don't think

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:57.195
<v Speaker 2>it's happening here. So it's fine. It could

00:11:57.195 --> 00:11:58.235
<v Speaker 0>be an aggregation.

00:11:59.275 --> 00:12:01.275
<v Speaker 1>Could be. It couldn't.

00:12:03.035 --> 00:12:04.875
<v Speaker 0>I don't think I'm enjoying having a breaker

00:12:04.875 --> 00:12:05.595
<v Speaker 0>on the stream now.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:09.530
<v Speaker 2>This is fun. Yep.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:11.850
<v Speaker 1>I want to give a shout out to

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:14.650
<v Speaker 2>Mark and his RR back session.

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.730
<v Speaker 1>It was very helpful and

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:17.930
<v Speaker 1>very

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.625
<v Speaker 2>Oh, I missed it. Yeah. Never saw that

00:12:21.625 --> 00:12:23.705
<v Speaker 0>one. No. No. I'm really disappointed with myself,

00:12:23.705 --> 00:12:26.265
<v Speaker 0>man. Alright. Okay. So we

00:12:27.065 --> 00:12:29.065
<v Speaker 0>looked at the cluster admin rule, which I

00:12:29.065 --> 00:12:31.305
<v Speaker 0>believe is the one given to us by

00:12:31.705 --> 00:12:32.265
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes.

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:34.730
<v Speaker 0>So now we're gonna have to either take

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:36.730
<v Speaker 0>a look at the system aggregates.

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:40.250
<v Speaker 0>And there's no way to get modified times

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:41.930
<v Speaker 0>on any of these unless

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:45.610
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you can actually. If you scroll back.

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:47.515
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. In the YAML. Yeah.

00:12:48.235 --> 00:12:49.435
<v Speaker 0>I was gonna get the YAML of all

00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:51.515
<v Speaker 0>of them and just kind of grep for

00:12:51.515 --> 00:12:52.235
<v Speaker 1>Oh,

00:12:52.555 --> 00:12:54.875
<v Speaker 1>what? Maybe not in cluster or maybe.

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:00.850
<v Speaker 0>That was super helpful.

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:02.130
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:05.490
<v Speaker 0>So Let's get only one. Yep.

00:13:07.089 --> 00:13:07.730
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:10.450
<v Speaker 0>Let's confirm something. I'll I'll like to do

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:11.970
<v Speaker 0>some type of note, and I'll just kind

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:14.405
<v Speaker 0>of get some so it could be a

00:13:14.405 --> 00:13:16.485
<v Speaker 0>cluster role, but we haven't actually tested to

00:13:16.485 --> 00:13:18.085
<v Speaker 0>see if the describe

00:13:19.525 --> 00:13:22.245
<v Speaker 0>was all namespaces or not. We tried Selium

00:13:22.245 --> 00:13:23.925
<v Speaker 0>and cube system. Do you want did we

00:13:23.925 --> 00:13:24.885
<v Speaker 0>try default as well?

00:13:25.779 --> 00:13:27.860
<v Speaker 0>I think we did. We tried to describe

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:28.740
<v Speaker 0>Postgres.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.300
<v Speaker 0>Maybe. So you are on the right track,

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.700
<v Speaker 1>by the way. So

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.580
<v Speaker 2>if I do this,

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.860
<v Speaker 2>it shows up

00:13:38.265 --> 00:13:39.865
<v Speaker 2>and describe.

00:13:39.865 --> 00:13:41.465
<v Speaker 2>I don't care which board.

00:13:42.425 --> 00:13:44.985
<v Speaker 2>So this is happening at a cluster level.

00:13:44.985 --> 00:13:47.385
<v Speaker 2>So it's like app app yeah. So it's

00:13:47.385 --> 00:13:49.705
<v Speaker 2>all applicable across the namespace, everything.

00:13:50.745 --> 00:13:51.785
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.240
<v Speaker 2>And when we did the role, cluster role.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.920
<v Speaker 2>Right? Let me just look at it again

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.320
<v Speaker 2>just to confirm we didn't miss anything.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.080
<v Speaker 0>I mean, all I see are scars.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.960
<v Speaker 2>This doesn't have the last applied configuration and

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.964
<v Speaker 2>rotation. I think that might be, like, for

00:14:07.964 --> 00:14:09.884
<v Speaker 2>cluster roles. It would actually tell us, like,

00:14:09.884 --> 00:14:11.565
<v Speaker 2>when it was modified at least.

00:14:12.524 --> 00:14:14.685
<v Speaker 1>I haven't played with that one. Alright.

00:14:16.365 --> 00:14:18.445
<v Speaker 0>So let's take a look at

00:14:19.005 --> 00:14:20.764
<v Speaker 0>do we see edits in the event log?

00:14:20.764 --> 00:14:22.524
<v Speaker 0>Do wanna try kubectl get events?

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:34.530
<v Speaker 0>Sneaky.

00:14:41.425 --> 00:14:44.225
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's go through the system rules and

00:14:44.225 --> 00:14:46.465
<v Speaker 0>actually work out what we have access to.

00:14:46.465 --> 00:14:48.625
<v Speaker 0>So I think we should start by taking

00:14:48.625 --> 00:14:51.505
<v Speaker 0>a look at first admin, and then we'll

00:14:51.505 --> 00:14:52.225
<v Speaker 0>do the aggregation.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.120
<v Speaker 2>Yep. So we did it. Look at we

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.960
<v Speaker 2>did look at the admin. Right? So let's

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.800
<v Speaker 0>But we looked at cluster admin, but not

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:00.840
<v Speaker 0>just admin.

00:15:01.399 --> 00:15:02.200
<v Speaker 1>Remember,

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.920
<v Speaker 1>I was inspired by capture the flag and

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.000
<v Speaker 1>by Mark session.

00:15:10.025 --> 00:15:11.545
<v Speaker 0>I wish I had seen Mark's our back

00:15:11.545 --> 00:15:12.745
<v Speaker 0>session, but I didn't.

00:15:14.505 --> 00:15:15.305
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:15:15.865 --> 00:15:17.785
<v Speaker 0>So let's do edit cluster rule. Oh,

00:15:18.585 --> 00:15:20.185
<v Speaker 0>no. Off you go. Sorry. Just a minute.

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:23.790
<v Speaker 2>I just want to confirm if this is

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.870
<v Speaker 2>actually, like, the cluster admin itself.

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:29.710
<v Speaker 1>And something Rory said on his session with

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:30.270
<v Speaker 1>you, David.

00:15:38.385 --> 00:15:40.385
<v Speaker 2>Okay. This was not modified.

00:15:42.385 --> 00:15:44.065
<v Speaker 1>Let me give you a hint.

00:15:44.305 --> 00:15:46.705
<v Speaker 1>How about cluster role binding? Maybe they would

00:15:47.825 --> 00:15:48.625
<v Speaker 1>Ah.

00:15:48.945 --> 00:15:50.545
<v Speaker 1>Let you let you come closer.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.640
<v Speaker 0>Hello. It's on the same issue, mate. I

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.320
<v Speaker 0>wish I could remember the CTF. It feels

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.920
<v Speaker 0>like a it feels like a month ago.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.120
<v Speaker 2>Ah, so in the cluster on binding, we

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.440
<v Speaker 2>might be given a different service account.

00:16:04.465 --> 00:16:06.065
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we should probably take a look

00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:09.185
<v Speaker 0>at the customer admin binding and see if

00:16:09.185 --> 00:16:11.905
<v Speaker 0>the roles are sent through. On the

00:16:12.865 --> 00:16:15.185
<v Speaker 1>on this now? This one here.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm still looking through. There's a 50 layer.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:19.680
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.160
<v Speaker 2>Kubernetes.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.120
<v Speaker 2>Let's not delete it. So let's see, actually.

00:16:29.235 --> 00:16:31.395
<v Speaker 1>No. Don't delete anything. Yep.

00:16:33.555 --> 00:16:36.435
<v Speaker 0>I I I like delete sledgehammer approach. So

00:16:36.915 --> 00:16:39.075
<v Speaker 1>Check first before deleting.

00:16:40.435 --> 00:16:42.755
<v Speaker 2>Yep. So for the Kubernetes admin user,

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:45.470
<v Speaker 2>add cluster sys admin.

00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:48.029
<v Speaker 0>Oh, let's describe cluster oh, we can't describe.

00:16:48.029 --> 00:16:50.350
<v Speaker 0>Let's edit cluster sys admin or get all

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:51.070
<v Speaker 0>YAML.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:53.470
<v Speaker 2>Yep. In fact, we don't need to scrape.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:55.070
<v Speaker 0>Could just be doing get all YAML and

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:57.709
<v Speaker 0>everything probably to get around the the scrape.

00:16:58.625 --> 00:16:59.185
<v Speaker 2>What

00:16:59.665 --> 00:17:01.825
<v Speaker 2>is it called? Cluster sys admin. Cluster sys

00:17:01.825 --> 00:17:02.545
<v Speaker 0>admin.

00:17:06.385 --> 00:17:09.184
<v Speaker 0>There we go. See? Yep. So it's, like,

00:17:09.184 --> 00:17:10.704
<v Speaker 2>limited. So we just need to update the

00:17:10.704 --> 00:17:12.950
<v Speaker 2>role binding to just use a system

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:15.750
<v Speaker 2>sorry. Cluster admin. I think we can just

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:17.750
<v Speaker 0>delete the role binding, and we should be

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:19.349
<v Speaker 1>No. No. Don't delete the role binding. If

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:20.790
<v Speaker 1>you delete the role binding, you'll miss the

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.549
<v Speaker 1>hints. There are hints somewhere here.

00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:24.630
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you've you've taken this on a journey,

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:27.190
<v Speaker 0>are you? Okay. There is a flag

00:17:28.195 --> 00:17:30.035
<v Speaker 1>as Lewis said. Oh.

00:17:30.595 --> 00:17:31.955
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's take a look at that rule

00:17:31.955 --> 00:17:32.915
<v Speaker 0>binding again.

00:17:34.515 --> 00:17:36.515
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not the rule binding, but it starts

00:17:37.475 --> 00:17:38.275
<v Speaker 1>okay.

00:17:38.435 --> 00:17:40.595
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Look. There's an original fail. No. I

00:17:40.595 --> 00:17:42.670
<v Speaker 2>was just thinking so if we just Do

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:44.190
<v Speaker 0>you see the annotation? No?

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:46.110
<v Speaker 2>Ah.

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:48.029
<v Speaker 2>Come on.

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:50.510
<v Speaker 0>So it looks like

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:53.309
<v Speaker 0>it's in slash e t c slash Kubernetes.

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:55.390
<v Speaker 0>Think

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:57.630
<v Speaker 0>slash e t c slash Kubernetes.

00:17:58.725 --> 00:18:00.725
<v Speaker 2>Ordinary file slash honk?

00:18:01.125 --> 00:18:03.445
<v Speaker 2>Okay. I don't think there's a honk in

00:18:03.445 --> 00:18:05.205
<v Speaker 2>there, but it might be somewhere else.

00:18:05.605 --> 00:18:06.884
<v Speaker 1>Dot honk.

00:18:08.245 --> 00:18:09.925
<v Speaker 1>L s slash dot honk.

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.020
<v Speaker 0>And a honk too.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.420
<v Speaker 1>Don't look at the honk too yet.

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:23.300
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So you have created a new user

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.540
<v Speaker 0>with rule binding and swapped out Yeah. I

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:26.740
<v Speaker 1>created the new rules there,

00:18:27.615 --> 00:18:29.295
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't give him the group. Yeah.

00:18:29.295 --> 00:18:30.414
<v Speaker 2>So Yes.

00:18:31.935 --> 00:18:33.295
<v Speaker 2>But the file times

00:18:33.535 --> 00:18:36.335
<v Speaker 2>but wait. Didn't we export it to default

00:18:36.335 --> 00:18:36.894
<v Speaker 2>one?

00:18:37.295 --> 00:18:39.135
<v Speaker 2>And the file doesn't seem to be

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:41.849
<v Speaker 0>You you modify this the

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:43.769
<v Speaker 0>this timestamp on it. I yeah. I don't

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:44.330
<v Speaker 2>yep.

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:49.289
<v Speaker 2>Never mind. I just want to confirm it's

00:18:49.289 --> 00:18:52.570
<v Speaker 2>actually saying Kubernetes admin. Yep. Anyway, so what

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:54.250
<v Speaker 2>I will do is give better

00:18:55.055 --> 00:18:59.215
<v Speaker 2>dash q config.admin.conf.

00:19:00.335 --> 00:19:00.975
<v Speaker 2>It's Good.

00:19:02.095 --> 00:19:04.015
<v Speaker 0>Lewis, you'll be on the Caesar's stream soon.

00:19:04.015 --> 00:19:04.575
<v Speaker 0>So

00:19:05.215 --> 00:19:08.335
<v Speaker 0>So we could just switch to the default.

00:19:09.055 --> 00:19:10.960
<v Speaker 1>I I had a challenge because, basically, the

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.919
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes administrator is part of system masters.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:15.440
<v Speaker 1>And

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:16.720
<v Speaker 1>you cannot

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.080
<v Speaker 1>basically redefine the roles for sys for Kubernetes

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.880
<v Speaker 1>administrator because system master is in the code.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:23.680
<v Speaker 1>You cannot change it.

00:19:24.815 --> 00:19:26.174
<v Speaker 1>So I have to

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:28.174
<v Speaker 1>basically

00:19:31.695 --> 00:19:32.735
<v Speaker 1>override it.

00:19:34.975 --> 00:19:36.014
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:19:37.775 --> 00:19:40.860
<v Speaker 2>So now we should be to able to

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:41.899
<v Speaker 2>cube cuddle,

00:19:42.139 --> 00:19:42.859
<v Speaker 2>describe

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.579
<v Speaker 2>no. I just get the note because

00:19:45.899 --> 00:19:48.779
<v Speaker 2>we don't did we fix that? Oh oh,

00:19:48.779 --> 00:19:50.619
<v Speaker 2>that was fixed. Why does that wait?

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.620
<v Speaker 1>One issue per ten minutes. That's great.

00:19:54.035 --> 00:19:56.674
<v Speaker 2>Yep. Q cuddle minus and cilium.

00:19:56.995 --> 00:19:58.034
<v Speaker 2>Get pods.

00:19:58.355 --> 00:20:00.115
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So we still need to describe these

00:20:00.115 --> 00:20:02.034
<v Speaker 0>and work out why they're pending. Yeah.

00:20:04.275 --> 00:20:05.475
<v Speaker 1>Hi, Philip. Hi.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:12.510
<v Speaker 2>Come on. I suspect we really wanna look

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:13.789
<v Speaker 0>at honk too soon.

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:17.389
<v Speaker 1>No. Don't, please. I

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:20.029
<v Speaker 1>don't know it is in honk too, actually.

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:23.230
<v Speaker 2>It's it's not yet even scheduled.

00:20:25.205 --> 00:20:26.965
<v Speaker 0>I'm sorry. I was too busy. It was

00:20:26.965 --> 00:20:27.845
<v Speaker 2>in last Right?

00:20:29.925 --> 00:20:31.925
<v Speaker 2>It didn't even get scheduled. It's still, like,

00:20:31.925 --> 00:20:33.365
<v Speaker 2>in a pending stage, like, there are no

00:20:33.365 --> 00:20:34.485
<v Speaker 2>events or anything.

00:20:34.965 --> 00:20:37.765
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So it's not been scheduled. Yeah. You're

00:20:37.765 --> 00:20:40.220
<v Speaker 0>right. So the scheduler may be done. Wanna

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:42.299
<v Speaker 0>check for a scheduler in cube system?

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:43.820
<v Speaker 2>Yep.

00:20:53.375 --> 00:20:55.774
<v Speaker 2>Gosh. Oh, look. It's not there. Okay. One

00:20:55.774 --> 00:20:56.015
<v Speaker 2>of the

00:20:57.615 --> 00:20:59.375
<v Speaker 2>oh, we don't have a schedule there. Yeah.

00:20:59.375 --> 00:21:01.294
<v Speaker 0>Let's go check the static manifest.

00:21:02.575 --> 00:21:03.934
<v Speaker 2>Let's see. Kubernetes

00:21:04.095 --> 00:21:05.215
<v Speaker 2>manifest.

00:21:05.215 --> 00:21:06.414
<v Speaker 2>And let's get it. Oh,

00:21:07.679 --> 00:21:08.559
<v Speaker 2>come on.

00:21:10.799 --> 00:21:11.759
<v Speaker 2>We

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.080
<v Speaker 2>do have a group contributor, but it's not

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:14.399
<v Speaker 2>running.

00:21:21.085 --> 00:21:23.885
<v Speaker 2>It's probably the mount okay. Let's look at

00:21:23.885 --> 00:21:25.485
<v Speaker 2>c r I cuddle just to make sure,

00:21:25.485 --> 00:21:27.645
<v Speaker 2>like, it's probably c r I cuddle dash

00:21:27.645 --> 00:21:28.284
<v Speaker 2>dash

00:21:29.645 --> 00:21:30.845
<v Speaker 2>runtime

00:21:30.845 --> 00:21:31.725
<v Speaker 2>endpoint.

00:21:31.725 --> 00:21:33.725
<v Speaker 1>It's working. It's working. C r I cuddle.

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:36.210
<v Speaker 1>It I fixed it for you. So you

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:37.490
<v Speaker 2>have I am very nice So

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:44.210
<v Speaker 2>the cube scheduler is not running, so we

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:45.809
<v Speaker 2>can actually lock.

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:47.810
<v Speaker 0>There's two. There's one running and one exit

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:48.050
<v Speaker 0>it.

00:21:49.325 --> 00:21:50.284
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:21:50.285 --> 00:21:51.165
<v Speaker 2>So let's

00:21:51.725 --> 00:21:53.965
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't register itself. So

00:21:55.405 --> 00:21:57.645
<v Speaker 0>Well, it's not showing up. I hate these

00:21:57.645 --> 00:22:00.205
<v Speaker 2>silly things on Linux, like, not able to,

00:22:00.205 --> 00:22:00.925
<v Speaker 2>like, copy paste.

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:03.890
<v Speaker 0>Just go to varlog containers.

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:05.090
<v Speaker 2>Yep. It's Rback.

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh,

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:08.850
<v Speaker 1>Rback again.

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:11.970
<v Speaker 1>Mark session must be very good.

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:15.650
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's pop open the cube scheduler

00:22:15.945 --> 00:22:17.624
<v Speaker 0>and check the service account.

00:22:19.384 --> 00:22:23.544
<v Speaker 2>Oh, come on. Stop. Yep. Okay. Cube scheduler.

00:22:26.985 --> 00:22:29.945
<v Speaker 1>Yes. Does it has a service account associated

00:22:29.945 --> 00:22:30.664
<v Speaker 2>with that?

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.920
<v Speaker 2>No. It doesn't. But it uses a volume

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:35.800
<v Speaker 2>on. So

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.120
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. The schedule.com.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.200
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's go check that file.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.600
<v Speaker 2>Authentication. Yep. That's the authentication file it uses.

00:22:46.435 --> 00:22:48.115
<v Speaker 2>Yep. Now those two have the same file.

00:22:48.115 --> 00:22:50.675
<v Speaker 2>So Etsy, Kubernetes, should do that account. B

00:22:50.675 --> 00:22:52.755
<v Speaker 2>Etsy. You're smashing this now. I've got faith

00:22:52.755 --> 00:22:53.395
<v Speaker 0>in you.

00:22:54.835 --> 00:22:56.434
<v Speaker 2>Should do that account.

00:22:57.075 --> 00:22:58.835
<v Speaker 2>I have I am successful. I see you

00:22:58.835 --> 00:22:58.995
<v Speaker 2>guys.

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:02.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh, so this must be, like, a similar

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:03.470
<v Speaker 2>one.

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:07.150
<v Speaker 2>So they're all binding for a system cube

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:08.269
<v Speaker 2>scheduler

00:23:09.309 --> 00:23:12.429
<v Speaker 2>with the different one probably. So you'll check

00:23:12.429 --> 00:23:12.909
<v Speaker 2>other

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:14.830
<v Speaker 2>cat. No. No. No. This is fine.

00:23:16.955 --> 00:23:17.595
<v Speaker 2>Ah,

00:23:18.235 --> 00:23:20.075
<v Speaker 2>okay. I wanted to change it, but that's

00:23:20.235 --> 00:23:21.434
<v Speaker 1>this one is fine.

00:23:23.595 --> 00:23:25.515
<v Speaker 1>But it has some hints also.

00:23:25.675 --> 00:23:27.195
<v Speaker 1>Not my hints. Yeah.

00:23:29.355 --> 00:23:30.955
<v Speaker 1>Certificate of RT.

00:23:31.035 --> 00:23:33.500
<v Speaker 1>Let's Yeah.

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.900
<v Speaker 2>Is the cluster name correct? I just want

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:41.100
<v Speaker 2>to confirm. Yep.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.019
<v Speaker 0>It looks for it. Yeah. But

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:45.180
<v Speaker 1>what was the error message again?

00:23:46.115 --> 00:23:47.475
<v Speaker 0>I don't know. We don't pay attention to

00:23:47.475 --> 00:23:48.035
<v Speaker 0>it.

00:23:49.235 --> 00:23:52.115
<v Speaker 2>That was, like, too long. So I can't

00:23:52.115 --> 00:23:54.115
<v Speaker 2>do that. That sense. I don't know. Does

00:23:54.115 --> 00:23:54.515
<v Speaker 2>that work?

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:02.450
<v Speaker 2>Actually, we could just oh, man. This is

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:03.250
<v Speaker 2>like so

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:06.450
<v Speaker 2>it says

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:08.770
<v Speaker 2>fail to watch. So the watch permission is

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:09.570
<v Speaker 2>mostly missing.

00:24:10.735 --> 00:24:11.854
<v Speaker 0>Oh, there we go.

00:24:13.375 --> 00:24:15.054
<v Speaker 1>And what else it says?

00:24:15.294 --> 00:24:18.095
<v Speaker 0>It is telling us that the cluster role

00:24:18.095 --> 00:24:20.414
<v Speaker 0>system keep scheduler is not found.

00:24:21.135 --> 00:24:21.775
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:25.780
<v Speaker 2>So we should look at a cluster. Right?

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.220
<v Speaker 0>So let's look at the custom. I pay

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:28.419
<v Speaker 0>his renamed

00:24:28.419 --> 00:24:30.259
<v Speaker 0>error. So this is

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:31.620
<v Speaker 1>remake,

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:32.340
<v Speaker 1>by the way.

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:34.419
<v Speaker 1>If you remember,

00:24:35.755 --> 00:24:37.754
<v Speaker 1>I don't know which cluster was it.

00:24:38.395 --> 00:24:40.635
<v Speaker 1>But Phil did the same thing, but you

00:24:40.635 --> 00:24:41.994
<v Speaker 1>fixed it by mistake.

00:24:46.554 --> 00:24:48.554
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted to see why it was

00:24:48.554 --> 00:24:49.515
<v Speaker 1>fixed by mistake.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.400
<v Speaker 1>So if you edit the Kube API server

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:53.960
<v Speaker 1>and

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.240
<v Speaker 1>add our back and remove it again or

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:57.799
<v Speaker 1>something,

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:01.240
<v Speaker 1>there are certain roles gets recreated.

00:25:02.495 --> 00:25:05.135
<v Speaker 2>Yep. Because those are, like, admin things. Right?

00:25:05.535 --> 00:25:07.535
<v Speaker 1>Yes. The because they are built in.

00:25:08.015 --> 00:25:10.174
<v Speaker 1>So I deleted the role,

00:25:10.815 --> 00:25:11.615
<v Speaker 1>and it's in

00:25:12.495 --> 00:25:14.575
<v Speaker 1>oh, man. It it did it get created

00:25:14.575 --> 00:25:16.815
<v Speaker 1>again? No. No. That's the volume scheduler. Yeah.

00:25:16.815 --> 00:25:18.980
<v Speaker 1>You're So the the so the role is

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:20.980
<v Speaker 1>in the hunk hunk two folder.

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.500
<v Speaker 2>Yep. I guess I mean but another way

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.580
<v Speaker 1>to redo it is just edit the Kube

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:27.700
<v Speaker 1>API server.

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:30.100
<v Speaker 0>Alec loses the base. Make the same mistake

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:31.620
<v Speaker 0>twice. And just let it complete.

00:25:32.284 --> 00:25:33.244
<v Speaker 2>Right? Thanks

00:25:36.365 --> 00:25:39.404
<v Speaker 2>for saving the manifest. Yeah. We appreciate that.

00:25:41.325 --> 00:25:43.164
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Let's just apply that then. I can

00:25:43.164 --> 00:25:44.765
<v Speaker 2>just do you gotta

00:25:45.409 --> 00:25:46.369
<v Speaker 2>apply that.

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:49.169
<v Speaker 0>Just I think that's useful to share and

00:25:49.169 --> 00:25:50.610
<v Speaker 0>make sure we we get that across to

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:52.610
<v Speaker 0>everyone watching. What you're saying is if we

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:55.090
<v Speaker 0>delete any of the core

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:58.690
<v Speaker 0>cluster rules, if you remove authorization from the

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:00.585
<v Speaker 0>API server and add it back, it will

00:26:00.585 --> 00:26:02.585
<v Speaker 0>recreate all of those rules.

00:26:02.985 --> 00:26:04.745
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Why don't you try it?

00:26:05.385 --> 00:26:07.065
<v Speaker 0>Can we just restart the API server, or

00:26:07.065 --> 00:26:08.904
<v Speaker 0>do we actually need to disable authentic

00:26:09.065 --> 00:26:11.304
<v Speaker 0>authorization? It will restart. The moment you change

00:26:11.304 --> 00:26:12.665
<v Speaker 1>something, it will restart anyway.

00:26:14.519 --> 00:26:16.679
<v Speaker 2>I see Kubernetes manifest,

00:26:16.679 --> 00:26:18.519
<v Speaker 2>and I just need to touch it. Right?

00:26:19.159 --> 00:26:21.479
<v Speaker 1>No. No. You need to edit

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:22.440
<v Speaker 1>it.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.519
<v Speaker 0>Let's try touching it and see if it

00:26:24.519 --> 00:26:26.120
<v Speaker 0>does it. I'm curious if just a restart

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.195
<v Speaker 0>would do Yes. Okay. Yeah. Then we can

00:26:28.195 --> 00:26:29.234
<v Speaker 1>try that. Yes.

00:26:29.715 --> 00:26:30.834
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead, Noel.

00:26:31.875 --> 00:26:33.474
<v Speaker 2>That cube.

00:26:34.115 --> 00:26:35.955
<v Speaker 2>It's sure. Right? Yes.

00:26:36.195 --> 00:26:37.394
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Rep.

00:26:38.514 --> 00:26:39.715
<v Speaker 2>I just API.

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:43.909
<v Speaker 2>It's not. Not restarted yet. Give us a

00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:45.510
<v Speaker 0>second. It does it does take a click.

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:47.830
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's like sometimes it takes a while.

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:49.750
<v Speaker 2>That's what I've seen when I was breaking

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:50.309
<v Speaker 2>clusters.

00:26:54.544 --> 00:26:56.145
<v Speaker 0>Would have killed my just named it by

00:26:56.145 --> 00:26:56.624
<v Speaker 0>now.

00:26:57.105 --> 00:26:59.745
<v Speaker 2>The bad point I think the recreation was

00:26:59.904 --> 00:27:02.145
<v Speaker 2>actually, we had a question about the same

00:27:02.145 --> 00:27:04.465
<v Speaker 2>thing in the chat, our Discord chat. Like,

00:27:04.465 --> 00:27:06.784
<v Speaker 2>someone lost the cluster admin role or something

00:27:06.784 --> 00:27:07.960
<v Speaker 2>in a case

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.360
<v Speaker 2>cluster. They just restarted it, and it just

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:11.159
<v Speaker 2>came back.

00:27:12.519 --> 00:27:14.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Let's do Oh, it's a static manifest,

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.799
<v Speaker 0>so I'll just kill it.

00:27:17.399 --> 00:27:19.525
<v Speaker 0>Last time I called this thing, got bad

00:27:19.525 --> 00:27:20.485
<v Speaker 0>stuff happened.

00:27:20.885 --> 00:27:22.165
<v Speaker 2>Let's not kill it. We could just do

00:27:22.165 --> 00:27:25.125
<v Speaker 2>CRC till, like, delete the board. Simple.

00:27:29.205 --> 00:27:30.884
<v Speaker 2>Let's just yeah.

00:27:31.525 --> 00:27:34.100
<v Speaker 2>Add an You touch it. Correct? We tried

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:36.260
<v Speaker 0>that. It doesn't we try to do anything.

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.540
<v Speaker 0>So we'll add a label. It should, at

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.420
<v Speaker 2>least. There we go. Oh, there we go.

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:47.155
<v Speaker 1>I think you broke your own cluster now.

00:27:47.235 --> 00:27:48.115
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:27:48.275 --> 00:27:50.195
<v Speaker 0>There we go. No. We

00:27:53.315 --> 00:27:55.235
<v Speaker 2>shit. No. This would take a little bit

00:27:55.235 --> 00:27:55.875
<v Speaker 2>of time.

00:27:57.235 --> 00:27:57.635
<v Speaker 0>We go.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.159
<v Speaker 2>Nope. It came back up. Right? It takes

00:28:00.159 --> 00:28:01.359
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of time.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.679
<v Speaker 2>The watch is faster,

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:04.399
<v Speaker 2>but,

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.519
<v Speaker 2>it's here.

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.760
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So that's really cool to know. By

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.880
<v Speaker 0>restarting the API server, any core RBAC stuff

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.279
<v Speaker 0>will be fixed for you. That's awesome. I

00:28:13.279 --> 00:28:13.600
<v Speaker 0>like that.

00:28:14.475 --> 00:28:16.875
<v Speaker 1>And that was the unintentional

00:28:16.875 --> 00:28:18.875
<v Speaker 1>fix you did with Phil, I mean.

00:28:20.235 --> 00:28:22.395
<v Speaker 0>I'll take as many unintentional fixes as I

00:28:22.395 --> 00:28:25.035
<v Speaker 2>can. Wonder if it has any security implications.

00:28:25.035 --> 00:28:27.275
<v Speaker 2>Right? I don't know where the default roles

00:28:27.275 --> 00:28:29.930
<v Speaker 2>are stored. If we could actually, like, manipulate

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:32.410
<v Speaker 2>that, it means, like, if someone restart, like,

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:34.650
<v Speaker 2>a malicious something could come up. Right?

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:37.770
<v Speaker 1>Yes. Now if you check, most likely, every

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:39.370
<v Speaker 1>vending item

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:40.570
<v Speaker 1>is running now.

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:42.410
<v Speaker 0>Yep. Looks good.

00:28:43.035 --> 00:28:45.195
<v Speaker 2>Fixed it. Yep. Easy. Could you check the

00:28:45.195 --> 00:28:45.835
<v Speaker 2>Selium?

00:28:47.115 --> 00:28:48.555
<v Speaker 1>One thing I didn't understand

00:28:48.795 --> 00:28:50.715
<v Speaker 1>I mean, I killed all Selium, but they

00:28:50.715 --> 00:28:51.595
<v Speaker 1>still have

00:28:51.915 --> 00:28:54.235
<v Speaker 1>the network as the nodes as ready.

00:28:54.475 --> 00:28:56.715
<v Speaker 1>With other network plug ins, you will not

00:28:56.715 --> 00:28:57.675
<v Speaker 1>see network ready.

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:01.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. CRM is probably doing

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:03.330
<v Speaker 2>more I don't know. Is it running in

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:05.170
<v Speaker 2>IP tables mode or, like, without the Q

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:05.730
<v Speaker 2>proxy?

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:10.450
<v Speaker 1>It is no. The Q proxy is saying

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:11.330
<v Speaker 1>IBVFS.

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:13.650
<v Speaker 1>I can I think I checked that? Yes.

00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:14.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh, okay.

00:29:14.855 --> 00:29:16.455
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I think it's probably So you think

00:29:16.455 --> 00:29:18.135
<v Speaker 1>it's basically works. Right?

00:29:18.775 --> 00:29:19.415
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:29:19.895 --> 00:29:20.615
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:29:20.695 --> 00:29:23.095
<v Speaker 0>Walid, have we fixed everything on this cluster?

00:29:24.135 --> 00:29:26.215
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. Everything is done. So, basically, it

00:29:26.215 --> 00:29:29.415
<v Speaker 1>was two issues. Our back end assemble cubelet

00:29:29.415 --> 00:29:29.895
<v Speaker 1>was down.

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Awesome. Well,

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:34.590
<v Speaker 0>thank you for that. I don't have good

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:35.309
<v Speaker 2>learning.

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:37.630
<v Speaker 0>I always fear the

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:41.150
<v Speaker 0>RBAC stuff, but it was we learned a

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:42.430
<v Speaker 0>lot in that one. I really appreciate that.

00:29:43.085 --> 00:29:45.965
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's get let's jump into nulls. Well,

00:29:45.965 --> 00:29:48.445
<v Speaker 0>each of you can get that session up

00:29:48.685 --> 00:29:50.845
<v Speaker 0>and echo something else. It's terminal.

00:29:51.405 --> 00:29:52.045
<v Speaker 0>No. No.

00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:59.509
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So active sessions.

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:01.350
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's see. Got a couple of Join

00:30:01.429 --> 00:30:02.230
<v Speaker 1>session.

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:05.350
<v Speaker 0>Magna wants to see Andy lose their cluster.

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:07.590
<v Speaker 0>We are gonna make that happen. Don't worry.

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:10.309
<v Speaker 0>And Mahmoud says, hey. What's up, Alit?

00:30:11.365 --> 00:30:12.484
<v Speaker 0>Hey, Mahmoud.

00:30:13.365 --> 00:30:14.644
<v Speaker 1>GitHub ing, man.

00:30:15.205 --> 00:30:17.285
<v Speaker 1>That's

00:30:17.285 --> 00:30:19.445
<v Speaker 1>what happens when you don't have GitHub. Alright.

00:30:20.725 --> 00:30:23.285
<v Speaker 0>Let's get the basics set up. I really

00:30:23.285 --> 00:30:25.205
<v Speaker 0>should just bake this into the provisioning steps.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:29.540
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, it will give you the honors

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:31.140
<v Speaker 0>of the get nodes, get pods, whatever you

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:31.779
<v Speaker 0>fancy.

00:30:32.179 --> 00:30:33.139
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:34.419
<v Speaker 1>Complete.

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:35.940
<v Speaker 0>Oh, the completion.

00:30:37.299 --> 00:30:38.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:39.140
<v Speaker 2>We need the

00:30:43.125 --> 00:30:45.684
<v Speaker 2>I still don't understand how batch completion works.

00:30:45.684 --> 00:30:47.284
<v Speaker 2>It's a mistake. Oh, he didn't do it.

00:30:47.284 --> 00:30:49.524
<v Speaker 1>Just a second. Yeah. I thought he did.

00:30:49.764 --> 00:30:51.445
<v Speaker 0>No. I just did the a cube config

00:30:51.445 --> 00:30:52.804
<v Speaker 0>export and a key alias.

00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.440
<v Speaker 0>I don't think that worked.

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:06.519
<v Speaker 1>I didn't?

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:09.955
<v Speaker 0>It says dash command not found. I'm assuming

00:31:09.955 --> 00:31:12.514
<v Speaker 0>no has messed with our kubectl binary.

00:31:15.875 --> 00:31:16.914
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. He is. Oh.

00:31:20.674 --> 00:31:22.959
<v Speaker 0>Oh, we haven't broke Okay. No.

00:31:23.279 --> 00:31:25.279
<v Speaker 0>We have a broken control plane. So that

00:31:25.279 --> 00:31:27.519
<v Speaker 0>means the completion doesn't work? Really?

00:31:28.639 --> 00:31:30.559
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Because it Maybe?

00:31:32.159 --> 00:31:32.879
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.599
<v Speaker 1>It needs to talk to something, isn't it?

00:31:35.759 --> 00:31:38.000
<v Speaker 0>Just gotta check something before we

00:31:39.945 --> 00:31:40.745
<v Speaker 0>take.

00:31:41.865 --> 00:31:43.305
<v Speaker 1>Thank you, Noah. Not that I don't trust

00:31:43.305 --> 00:31:43.784
<v Speaker 0>you,

00:31:52.185 --> 00:31:53.225
<v Speaker 1>Honk, man.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:56.360
<v Speaker 0>How many counts? We're going to rec roll

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.919
<v Speaker 0>us on cluster. That is harsh.

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:01.240
<v Speaker 1>That's it.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.200
<v Speaker 0>So this is looking for a count equals

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:04.600
<v Speaker 0>three.

00:32:08.435 --> 00:32:09.154
<v Speaker 2>Yep.

00:32:14.995 --> 00:32:16.995
<v Speaker 2>You might want to, like, close the session

00:32:16.995 --> 00:32:18.115
<v Speaker 2>and rejoin.

00:32:18.195 --> 00:32:20.195
<v Speaker 2>It messes a little bit with the terminal.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.960
<v Speaker 1>So I think the session today is called

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.000
<v Speaker 1>don't trust.

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:27.680
<v Speaker 1>Or whoever gives you anything, command configuration file,

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.320
<v Speaker 1>don't trust it. Double check. Exactly.

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:34.160
<v Speaker 2>Yep. Exactly. Because I knew that the completion

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.600
<v Speaker 0>command doesn't require

00:32:36.255 --> 00:32:37.294
<v Speaker 0>a working

00:32:37.535 --> 00:32:38.335
<v Speaker 0>server.

00:32:39.215 --> 00:32:39.775
<v Speaker 0>So

00:32:40.015 --> 00:32:42.895
<v Speaker 2>And that's why the completion didn't work. Yeah.

00:32:42.895 --> 00:32:44.255
<v Speaker 1>So we need to download.

00:32:45.215 --> 00:32:46.975
<v Speaker 1>Or you have You don't need to download.

00:32:46.975 --> 00:32:49.215
<v Speaker 2>If you play I played nice. If you

00:32:49.215 --> 00:32:50.735
<v Speaker 2>look in there, you'll find it maybe.

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:52.539
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:55.099
<v Speaker 1>Can we look at the script again?

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:56.779
<v Speaker 0>If there was nothing in the script, it

00:32:56.779 --> 00:32:58.299
<v Speaker 0>tells where it was, and then I deleted

00:32:58.299 --> 00:32:58.859
<v Speaker 0>it.

00:32:59.179 --> 00:33:01.899
<v Speaker 2>No. It doesn't. But just grab for some

00:33:01.899 --> 00:33:02.940
<v Speaker 2>similar keywords.

00:33:11.345 --> 00:33:12.465
<v Speaker 2>Not cube,

00:33:12.865 --> 00:33:14.864
<v Speaker 2>maybe cuddle. Just cuddle.

00:33:15.265 --> 00:33:16.225
<v Speaker 1>Maybe honk.

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:18.090
<v Speaker 0>Honk CTL.

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:20.890
<v Speaker 1>Honk CTL. Yeah. It's a nice CTL, by

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:21.529
<v Speaker 1>the way.

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:27.450
<v Speaker 0>Okay. That's better. Or list list them by

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:28.090
<v Speaker 1>time.

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:30.890
<v Speaker 0>We have a working cube control now.

00:33:31.975 --> 00:33:34.135
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Good. Yep. That's fixed. So the first

00:33:34.135 --> 00:33:36.534
<v Speaker 2>issue is fixed. It looks like I lost

00:33:36.534 --> 00:33:37.575
<v Speaker 1>my connection.

00:33:38.615 --> 00:33:40.135
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. You'll have to join the other

00:33:40.135 --> 00:33:42.375
<v Speaker 0>session because no work loaders.

00:33:48.029 --> 00:33:50.429
<v Speaker 2>Oh, the Yeah. It's outside.

00:33:50.909 --> 00:33:53.229
<v Speaker 0>I always do that. Oh. Okay.

00:33:54.429 --> 00:33:55.149
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:33:59.309 --> 00:34:00.990
<v Speaker 0>Why don't you go, Ravi? Go Go ahead.

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:02.190
<v Speaker 1>No. No. Thanks.

00:34:03.914 --> 00:34:05.034
<v Speaker 1>You got

00:34:06.394 --> 00:34:08.155
<v Speaker 1>the completion.

00:34:08.315 --> 00:34:09.195
<v Speaker 0>Thanks,

00:34:09.195 --> 00:34:09.835
<v Speaker 0>chat.

00:34:13.034 --> 00:34:14.875
<v Speaker 0>We got no laughing. So

00:34:15.994 --> 00:34:17.594
<v Speaker 1>we fixed the first issue or not? No?

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.719
<v Speaker 2>Complete. First issue is fixed.

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.480
<v Speaker 1>How many issues we have?

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.719
<v Speaker 2>Probably three or four.

00:34:27.119 --> 00:34:28.159
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really count.

00:34:31.265 --> 00:34:32.305
<v Speaker 2>So, basically,

00:34:32.785 --> 00:34:35.825
<v Speaker 2>like, when you said, like, before, right, we

00:34:35.825 --> 00:34:37.585
<v Speaker 2>canceled the session. So that time, I actually

00:34:37.585 --> 00:34:39.105
<v Speaker 2>got time to play with it. So I

00:34:39.105 --> 00:34:40.705
<v Speaker 2>just had, like, a script ready and, like,

00:34:40.705 --> 00:34:42.785
<v Speaker 2>did some breakage. I never touched it again.

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:47.280
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:48.480
<v Speaker 0>So that

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:50.400
<v Speaker 0>already looked wrong. Yep.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.199
<v Speaker 0>It's trying to connect the local host 8080.

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:54.719
<v Speaker 0>So I think he's I think Noel has

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:57.595
<v Speaker 0>modified our I didn't think No. I didn't

00:34:57.595 --> 00:34:59.115
<v Speaker 2>touch it. No. No. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. You're

00:34:59.115 --> 00:34:59.595
<v Speaker 2>not

00:35:03.675 --> 00:35:05.195
<v Speaker 0>exporting it. Got it.

00:35:05.755 --> 00:35:06.075
<v Speaker 2>Yep.

00:35:14.839 --> 00:35:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Cool.

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.160
<v Speaker 0>Lewis, master rec role.

00:35:23.675 --> 00:35:24.555
<v Speaker 0>Pardon me.

00:35:29.275 --> 00:35:30.635
<v Speaker 0>What do we have?

00:35:31.835 --> 00:35:33.595
<v Speaker 1>So we have one more. I don't like

00:35:33.755 --> 00:35:34.155
<v Speaker 2>by

00:35:34.795 --> 00:35:37.420
<v Speaker 2>product of my speech. I didn't touch Yeah.

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.820
<v Speaker 2>Any of that group thing. So it might

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:41.660
<v Speaker 2>be a byproduct of the other breakages I

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:43.180
<v Speaker 2>did. So could be.

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:45.100
<v Speaker 2>I didn't touch it. That's

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:48.540
<v Speaker 0>Well, it looks like clustered and postgres are

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:50.744
<v Speaker 0>both running on the default namespace. So I

00:35:50.744 --> 00:35:52.744
<v Speaker 0>guess we should just be upgrading clustered to

00:35:52.744 --> 00:35:54.744
<v Speaker 0>see if we can get the new version.

00:35:55.464 --> 00:35:57.865
<v Speaker 1>But let's look at this why it's not

00:35:57.865 --> 00:35:58.585
<v Speaker 1>starting.

00:35:59.785 --> 00:36:00.025
<v Speaker 2>Let

00:36:00.585 --> 00:36:02.585
<v Speaker 2>I let's not waste time on talking about

00:36:02.585 --> 00:36:04.345
<v Speaker 2>that. I don't think Node touched that. Yeah.

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:07.100
<v Speaker 2>Okay. Yeah. I didn't touch it. So yep.

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:07.740
<v Speaker 2>So

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:10.300
<v Speaker 2>let's follow the usual things that we usually

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:10.860
<v Speaker 2>do.

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:17.820
<v Speaker 0>We're gonna roll it restart first. It's just

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:19.980
<v Speaker 0>called clustered deployment clustered.

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:20.380
<v Speaker 2>Yep.

00:36:23.155 --> 00:36:25.075
<v Speaker 0>And if that works, we should just be

00:36:25.075 --> 00:36:26.275
<v Speaker 0>able to upgrade it.

00:36:31.315 --> 00:36:32.355
<v Speaker 0>It looks like a timeout.

00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:38.250
<v Speaker 2>Just wait a minute.

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:42.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. I wait wait for my time

00:36:42.010 --> 00:36:44.810
<v Speaker 1>out because they can provide actually

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:45.930
<v Speaker 1>meaningful message.

00:36:46.765 --> 00:36:48.045
<v Speaker 1>Failed to batch.

00:36:48.205 --> 00:36:51.325
<v Speaker 1>Cluster is forbidden. Not yet ready to handle

00:36:51.325 --> 00:36:53.645
<v Speaker 1>request. That's nice. That's new to me.

00:36:54.765 --> 00:36:56.445
<v Speaker 2>So this is a very nice thing I

00:36:56.445 --> 00:36:58.925
<v Speaker 2>found out. Yeah. It's nice. Like it.

00:37:00.925 --> 00:37:01.405
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:02.980
<v Speaker 1>So

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:04.500
<v Speaker 2>And just to be

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:05.940
<v Speaker 2>what?

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.340
<v Speaker 2>Nice. I didn't touch our back.

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:10.420
<v Speaker 2>Sorry?

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:12.100
<v Speaker 2>Just

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:13.620
<v Speaker 2>to be nice, I'm giving you a hint.

00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:14.980
<v Speaker 2>I didn't touch our back.

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:16.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah.

00:37:16.635 --> 00:37:18.315
<v Speaker 1>I know you are a nice guy, Noel.

00:37:18.315 --> 00:37:19.595
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:37:22.075 --> 00:37:24.155
<v Speaker 1>So what's the problem here?

00:37:25.435 --> 00:37:27.195
<v Speaker 1>Let's get once again.

00:37:27.515 --> 00:37:28.235
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:37:28.875 --> 00:37:32.250
<v Speaker 1>And okay. Let's see. So could this be

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:33.530
<v Speaker 1>an admission control?

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:39.210
<v Speaker 0>Mean, the failed if it was an admission

00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:40.170
<v Speaker 0>controller, maybe.

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:45.610
<v Speaker 0>Let let's check for mutating webhooks and validating

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:48.095
<v Speaker 0>webhooks, I guess. Okay. Get

00:37:50.494 --> 00:37:52.975
<v Speaker 0>Mutating webhook configurations and

00:37:53.615 --> 00:37:54.095
<v Speaker 0>yeah.

00:37:55.775 --> 00:37:57.935
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. The auto oh, yeah. K. Yeah. Queue

00:37:57.935 --> 00:37:58.575
<v Speaker 2>catalog.

00:38:00.095 --> 00:38:01.615
<v Speaker 1>Why is it not completion? No. It's called

00:38:01.615 --> 00:38:02.175
<v Speaker 2>mutating.

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:05.030
<v Speaker 0>Well, the style is getting unmuting, and I

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:08.230
<v Speaker 0>probably broke the completion because I'm a terrible

00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:09.270
<v Speaker 0>programmer.

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:14.550
<v Speaker 1>That's okay, though. Wow.

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:15.670
<v Speaker 2>That's strange.

00:38:18.734 --> 00:38:21.214
<v Speaker 2>Everything mutating that code configuration if you want

00:38:21.214 --> 00:38:24.414
<v Speaker 2>to, like, type custom session? Okay. Oh, sorry.

00:38:24.335 --> 00:38:25.935
<v Speaker 0>Can type it. Mutating

00:38:26.255 --> 00:38:28.015
<v Speaker 0>that code configuration.

00:38:28.575 --> 00:38:29.375
<v Speaker 2>Get.

00:38:29.934 --> 00:38:30.734
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:38:32.255 --> 00:38:34.330
<v Speaker 0>There we go. We got a honk.

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:38.570
<v Speaker 1>Can we edit it? See what what did

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:39.610
<v Speaker 1>he do inside?

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:41.930
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I I think oh, sorry. I'll take

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:42.570
<v Speaker 0>it too, Balit.

00:38:51.785 --> 00:38:54.185
<v Speaker 1>Oops. I forgot I'm not in there. Resent

00:38:54.185 --> 00:38:55.705
<v Speaker 2>them. Bad. I don't know why the auto

00:38:55.705 --> 00:38:57.225
<v Speaker 2>completion is not working,

00:38:57.705 --> 00:38:59.225
<v Speaker 2>but, yeah, it's, like,

00:38:59.865 --> 00:39:02.265
<v Speaker 2>tricky to work with all the extra CRDs

00:39:02.265 --> 00:39:05.130
<v Speaker 2>if auto completion is not working. Prior, they've

00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:06.970
<v Speaker 0>been all swapped out bash for dash. That's

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:07.690
<v Speaker 0>what it is.

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:10.730
<v Speaker 2>I know. I didn't do a go that

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:11.770
<v Speaker 2>route. Okay.

00:39:18.045 --> 00:39:20.525
<v Speaker 0>Let's see the Let me see and see

00:39:20.525 --> 00:39:21.485
<v Speaker 1>from the

00:39:22.125 --> 00:39:25.405
<v Speaker 1>rules. Create update. Oh, you're running it on

00:39:25.405 --> 00:39:27.244
<v Speaker 0>your own server. Sneaky.

00:39:27.484 --> 00:39:28.205
<v Speaker 2>Yep.

00:39:28.365 --> 00:39:28.605
<v Speaker 2>I

00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:32.190
<v Speaker 0>mean, I think it's safe just to change

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:34.030
<v Speaker 0>the failure policy on that to

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:37.070
<v Speaker 1>Avail allow? What what is it? I don't

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:38.590
<v Speaker 1>see. Fail or

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:40.270
<v Speaker 0>ignore?

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:42.990
<v Speaker 2>Ignore. I I I think ignore.

00:39:44.565 --> 00:39:46.005
<v Speaker 0>Or we could just delete the web hook.

00:39:46.005 --> 00:39:47.285
<v Speaker 0>I'm not fussy either way.

00:39:47.845 --> 00:39:48.485
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:39:49.925 --> 00:39:51.925
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Let's just let's You might want to

00:39:51.925 --> 00:39:54.085
<v Speaker 2>rethink that. What? Why?

00:39:54.405 --> 00:39:55.845
<v Speaker 0>Is it if you got finalized or done

00:39:55.845 --> 00:39:56.085
<v Speaker 0>stuff?

00:39:57.970 --> 00:39:58.770
<v Speaker 2>No.

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:00.130
<v Speaker 2>But it's something

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:03.410
<v Speaker 2>yep. Alright. Hold on. Let's just It doesn't

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:05.170
<v Speaker 0>look rotating. Webhook

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:07.170
<v Speaker 0>configuration. Yeah. Let's look at the documentation.

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:09.570
<v Speaker 0>It's fail or ignore, I think. But It's

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:12.610
<v Speaker 1>enabled here. Match labels, honk enabled. So

00:40:14.265 --> 00:40:15.625
<v Speaker 1>name selector.

00:40:17.944 --> 00:40:20.825
<v Speaker 1>Feature policy failed. So, basically Yeah.

00:40:21.224 --> 00:40:23.385
<v Speaker 0>Ignore. Here we go. Oh, ignore. Let's make

00:40:23.385 --> 00:40:24.184
<v Speaker 2>it ignored. Yep.

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:31.530
<v Speaker 2>Okay. And

00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:34.250
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. If we just save that. It again.

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:36.250
<v Speaker 0>We should be able to

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:38.650
<v Speaker 0>do that rollout command. Yeah.

00:40:42.135 --> 00:40:43.335
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.

00:40:43.815 --> 00:40:46.694
<v Speaker 1>So basically, he's changing any deployment that we

00:40:46.694 --> 00:40:47.494
<v Speaker 1>recreate

00:40:47.575 --> 00:40:50.214
<v Speaker 1>or and he's doing it for deployments. Yep.

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:53.020
<v Speaker 0>Well, I think we still got something else

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:54.540
<v Speaker 0>to find because this is taking too long

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:55.660
<v Speaker 0>for Woah.

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:59.260
<v Speaker 2>Yep. Why? This is I found this by

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:00.060
<v Speaker 2>accident.

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:03.819
<v Speaker 1>It does, like deployment in our cluster is

00:41:03.819 --> 00:41:05.819
<v Speaker 1>forbidden. Not yet ready to handle request.

00:41:08.915 --> 00:41:09.715
<v Speaker 2>Maybe

00:41:10.435 --> 00:41:12.595
<v Speaker 2>okay. Think it might take some time. Or

00:41:12.595 --> 00:41:13.235
<v Speaker 2>two before

00:41:14.275 --> 00:41:17.235
<v Speaker 2>no. It doesn't. It's something's not yet.

00:41:17.475 --> 00:41:19.475
<v Speaker 2>I'll give a hint. I'll wait for a

00:41:19.475 --> 00:41:20.755
<v Speaker 2>minute, and then I'll give a hint.

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:25.740
<v Speaker 2>No. Those are validating.

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:28.700
<v Speaker 1>Actually,

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:30.060
<v Speaker 1>I just want to check.

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay. A cube control,

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:35.180
<v Speaker 1>get events,

00:41:37.465 --> 00:41:40.345
<v Speaker 1>get events minus a, and all namespaces. No

00:41:40.345 --> 00:41:42.585
<v Speaker 1>resources found because it's over an hour, I

00:41:42.585 --> 00:41:43.065
<v Speaker 1>guess.

00:41:43.625 --> 00:41:45.385
<v Speaker 0>Can we go check out the

00:41:45.545 --> 00:41:47.785
<v Speaker 0>static manifest for the API server to see

00:41:47.785 --> 00:41:50.345
<v Speaker 0>if there's any other static admission controllers?

00:41:51.385 --> 00:41:51.785
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:53.760
<v Speaker 2>Checkpoint.

00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:59.360
<v Speaker 1>Check the time. By the way, he didn't

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:00.560
<v Speaker 1>check the time there.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.240
<v Speaker 1>But I think maybe he will do the

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.840
<v Speaker 1>same thing. He will touch them with the

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:04.480
<v Speaker 1>old time.

00:42:05.965 --> 00:42:07.565
<v Speaker 0>I think that's gonna be a common name

00:42:07.565 --> 00:42:09.005
<v Speaker 2>in all customers. Maybe.

00:42:10.765 --> 00:42:12.765
<v Speaker 1>Most likely. I know you know him.

00:42:14.525 --> 00:42:15.245
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:42:16.285 --> 00:42:17.565
<v Speaker 1>So we have our back. And

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:20.090
<v Speaker 0>Search for admission.

00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:22.330
<v Speaker 0>Oh, there we go. Admission. And Oh, yeah.

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:23.690
<v Speaker 0>It's just normal, though.

00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:26.810
<v Speaker 2>Or is it?

00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:29.290
<v Speaker 0>Mutation admission web mode.

00:42:34.935 --> 00:42:36.215
<v Speaker 1>Okay. What else?

00:42:41.175 --> 00:42:43.495
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So I have mode restrictions,

00:42:43.495 --> 00:42:46.215
<v Speaker 1>indicating admission work and validation work, which is

00:42:46.215 --> 00:42:47.849
<v Speaker 1>okay. Oh, I think those are on by

00:42:47.849 --> 00:42:49.210
<v Speaker 0>default. Thought you would think they need to

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:49.849
<v Speaker 0>list it.

00:42:51.289 --> 00:42:54.010
<v Speaker 2>I just called yep. Just read through it

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:55.930
<v Speaker 2>and see if you find anything. There we

00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:56.650
<v Speaker 0>go. Run

00:42:57.210 --> 00:43:00.010
<v Speaker 1>time config. What's the run time config? Admins,

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:01.049
<v Speaker 1>mission registration.

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.380
<v Speaker 2>Okay. Man, you're thinking there. I think we

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:20.420
<v Speaker 0>can call it now.

00:43:21.619 --> 00:43:23.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Yep. So if you either make it

00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:25.300
<v Speaker 2>true or delete it,

00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:27.860
<v Speaker 2>the mutating repo could start working.

00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:28.980
<v Speaker 0>It's okay.

00:43:29.694 --> 00:43:31.535
<v Speaker 1>They do this for the beta ones and

00:43:31.535 --> 00:43:32.975
<v Speaker 1>the alpha ones. Yeah.

00:43:33.615 --> 00:43:35.855
<v Speaker 1>And Yep. API server.

00:43:38.255 --> 00:43:39.535
<v Speaker 1>It didn't do Yeah. It will take a

00:43:39.535 --> 00:43:40.175
<v Speaker 2>minute.

00:43:41.855 --> 00:43:42.974
<v Speaker 1>It will take a bit. Yeah?

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:46.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. It will take, like, around ten, twenty

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:48.540
<v Speaker 2>seconds. Yep. It's back. Okay.

00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:52.860
<v Speaker 1>Let's try again. There we go. Okay.

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:54.860
<v Speaker 1>Thank you. No.

00:43:56.625 --> 00:43:57.425
<v Speaker 1>Get

00:43:59.345 --> 00:44:01.345
<v Speaker 1>bots minus eight.

00:44:01.505 --> 00:44:03.025
<v Speaker 1>Oh, no. I don't need to.

00:44:03.905 --> 00:44:06.305
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So it's running. The bot screen is

00:44:06.305 --> 00:44:07.665
<v Speaker 1>running. You want to do your

00:44:08.305 --> 00:44:08.705
<v Speaker 2>You

00:44:10.109 --> 00:44:13.230
<v Speaker 2>actually missed by restarting, you actually missed one

00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:15.390
<v Speaker 2>thing I put it in there, but it's

00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:15.950
<v Speaker 2>fine.

00:44:17.069 --> 00:44:18.829
<v Speaker 0>Well, we have an error image pool, so

00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:19.790
<v Speaker 0>it's not vain.

00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:21.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh, okay.

00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:23.069
<v Speaker 1>View control.

00:44:23.955 --> 00:44:24.835
<v Speaker 1>Describe.

00:44:28.195 --> 00:44:28.835
<v Speaker 1>What?

00:44:31.635 --> 00:44:33.875
<v Speaker 1>So how do I do this copy?

00:44:34.195 --> 00:44:37.075
<v Speaker 1>Or it should be clustered six seven.

00:44:37.235 --> 00:44:39.650
<v Speaker 2>You could, like, select, select, right click, copy,

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:40.290
<v Speaker 2>paste.

00:44:40.769 --> 00:44:41.730
<v Speaker 1>GSHR,

00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:43.329
<v Speaker 1>Freshbow. Ah. Alright.

00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:47.890
<v Speaker 1>So we need set our those Yeah. I

00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:48.450
<v Speaker 2>we

00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:49.410
<v Speaker 2>started

00:44:51.875 --> 00:44:52.675
<v Speaker 2>No.

00:44:52.835 --> 00:44:53.555
<v Speaker 2>So

00:44:54.275 --> 00:44:56.595
<v Speaker 0>There's too much Rick Astley on this episode.

00:45:00.115 --> 00:45:01.555
<v Speaker 2>Don't know. Lewis gave me a lot of

00:45:01.555 --> 00:45:01.955
<v Speaker 2>Rick Astley.

00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:06.690
<v Speaker 1>He's a bad influence.

00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:09.730
<v Speaker 2>Yep. Bad influence.

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:12.370
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Lewis is saying the next episode of

00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:14.130
<v Speaker 0>Cluster he is involved with will be named

00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:15.410
<v Speaker 0>Untitled Rawkode.

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:18.050
<v Speaker 0>I'm signing up for it. Let's do it.

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:18.850
<v Speaker 1>So so

00:45:19.205 --> 00:45:21.605
<v Speaker 1>we should change this image to what? To

00:45:21.605 --> 00:45:22.645
<v Speaker 0>Rawkode

00:45:22.885 --> 00:45:24.885
<v Speaker 0>clustered colon v two.

00:45:26.005 --> 00:45:28.005
<v Speaker 1>Is it where is it? Here?

00:45:28.805 --> 00:45:31.685
<v Speaker 1>Also in GitHub? Rawk. Yep. Yep. Slash Cluster.

00:45:31.685 --> 00:45:32.405
<v Speaker 1>Rawkode

00:45:32.565 --> 00:45:33.045
<v Speaker 1>Cluster.

00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:35.990
<v Speaker 0>And tag v two.

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Why did it move?

00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:43.590
<v Speaker 2>Yep. It happens.

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:45.830
<v Speaker 2>But then I don't know why Vim does

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:47.430
<v Speaker 2>that. Like, I always have to fix it.

00:45:48.605 --> 00:45:50.845
<v Speaker 0>Two more? Oh, one more. Two more. It's

00:45:50.845 --> 00:45:52.925
<v Speaker 2>not fixed yet. Yeah. The image needs to

00:45:52.925 --> 00:45:55.165
<v Speaker 2>go back. Yeah. One more level back. Vim

00:45:55.165 --> 00:45:57.885
<v Speaker 2>does something funky when you edit it. Yep.

00:45:57.885 --> 00:46:00.444
<v Speaker 0>Delete two more spaces so the hyphen is

00:46:00.444 --> 00:46:02.930
<v Speaker 0>in left the c. Yeah. That's it. Mhmm.

00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:03.730
<v Speaker 2>Yep. Perfect.

00:46:15.175 --> 00:46:17.335
<v Speaker 0>And you'll need to delete the

00:46:19.494 --> 00:46:21.095
<v Speaker 0>oh, I mean yeah. You'll need to delete

00:46:21.095 --> 00:46:22.694
<v Speaker 0>that. Oh, you might need to do a

00:46:22.694 --> 00:46:25.095
<v Speaker 2>port forward on the running one.

00:46:26.295 --> 00:46:27.974
<v Speaker 0>Oh, did you change the current image as

00:46:27.974 --> 00:46:28.135
<v Speaker 0>well?

00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:30.950
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:32.550
<v Speaker 2>I thought forward. The

00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:41.589
<v Speaker 1>postgres one, you mean? The postgres one? No.

00:46:41.589 --> 00:46:42.790
<v Speaker 0>I think The other one that's running.

00:46:44.295 --> 00:46:46.454
<v Speaker 2>Right? The one that's running, just your port

00:46:46.454 --> 00:46:47.575
<v Speaker 2>forward. Yeah. Yeah. It it

00:46:48.055 --> 00:46:48.694
<v Speaker 1>will not

00:46:51.175 --> 00:46:53.095
<v Speaker 2>Then let's come back to the error image

00:46:53.095 --> 00:46:53.735
<v Speaker 2>policy.

00:46:55.734 --> 00:46:57.680
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Let me pull up the terminal. Let's

00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:59.200
<v Speaker 0>do that port forward so we can see

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.680
<v Speaker 0>what what all this dropped on us.

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:04.480
<v Speaker 1>This is three seconds.

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:09.840
<v Speaker 1>I I

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:13.185
<v Speaker 1>oh, just a second. Roll out.

00:47:14.225 --> 00:47:15.905
<v Speaker 1>We need to give it a different version.

00:47:15.905 --> 00:47:17.505
<v Speaker 1>Was it version two before?

00:47:19.825 --> 00:47:22.465
<v Speaker 0>Version one before. Version

00:47:22.465 --> 00:47:24.785
<v Speaker 1>one. Okay. Did you change the portal?

00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:28.150
<v Speaker 2>I had seen support,

00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:30.470
<v Speaker 2>but I did something. Yeah.

00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:33.350
<v Speaker 2>Just wait until it fails.

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:35.030
<v Speaker 2>You might get some idea.

00:47:40.965 --> 00:47:43.605
<v Speaker 2>And Darren from Rancher is giving me this

00:47:43.605 --> 00:47:44.245
<v Speaker 2>idea.

00:47:45.525 --> 00:47:46.405
<v Speaker 1>From when?

00:47:47.045 --> 00:47:47.525
<v Speaker 2>Darren.

00:47:48.485 --> 00:47:49.685
<v Speaker 2>Right? From Rancher.

00:47:49.685 --> 00:47:51.285
<v Speaker 2>So he was doing a deep dive on

00:47:51.285 --> 00:47:53.125
<v Speaker 2>K3S, and I learned about

00:47:53.685 --> 00:47:55.845
<v Speaker 2>that thing, why port forward is not working.

00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:58.970
<v Speaker 2>Yep. Just hold on a bit so it

00:47:58.970 --> 00:48:01.210
<v Speaker 2>actually shows you the error. Don't cancel it

00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:01.770
<v Speaker 2>yet.

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:03.850
<v Speaker 0>Oh, wow.

00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:10.010
<v Speaker 1>So the error here, it says that it's

00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:12.815
<v Speaker 1>the same image as before, but I I

00:48:13.535 --> 00:48:15.855
<v Speaker 1>so we did the rollout. So the rollout

00:48:15.855 --> 00:48:16.575
<v Speaker 1>should take us to

00:48:18.174 --> 00:48:19.935
<v Speaker 2>No. Let's come back to the rollout

00:48:20.414 --> 00:48:22.494
<v Speaker 2>the next thing. Otherwise, we would actually miss

00:48:22.494 --> 00:48:25.775
<v Speaker 2>out a thing I did. So let's fix

00:48:25.775 --> 00:48:27.135
<v Speaker 2>the port forward maybe first.

00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:33.350
<v Speaker 2>I didn't touch the replica sets.

00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:36.470
<v Speaker 1>He didn't touch that. Yep. So assess the

00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:38.630
<v Speaker 0>error we should be seeing? Unable to upgrade

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:40.964
<v Speaker 0>connection? Yep. That's our that should give you

00:48:40.964 --> 00:48:41.925
<v Speaker 2>a hint.

00:48:42.005 --> 00:48:42.885
<v Speaker 0>Should it?

00:48:44.244 --> 00:48:44.965
<v Speaker 2>Yep.

00:48:47.045 --> 00:48:48.885
<v Speaker 1>I can see the error. So how does

00:48:48.885 --> 00:48:50.165
<v Speaker 2>bot forward work?

00:48:51.444 --> 00:48:53.205
<v Speaker 1>Bot forward, it's

00:48:53.365 --> 00:48:54.005
<v Speaker 1>reverse. No?

00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Reverse.

00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:57.630
<v Speaker 2>Yep. So how does it work?

00:48:58.190 --> 00:49:00.190
<v Speaker 0>The the the message we got, I'll I'll

00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:01.870
<v Speaker 0>just paste here so you can see it.

00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:04.510
<v Speaker 0>When I do the port forward to my

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:06.190
<v Speaker 0>local machine is that.

00:49:07.575 --> 00:49:10.615
<v Speaker 1>Bot forward is basically connecting to the directly

00:49:10.615 --> 00:49:12.135
<v Speaker 1>to the IP of the bot.

00:49:12.855 --> 00:49:13.415
<v Speaker 1>So

00:49:13.655 --> 00:49:16.215
<v Speaker 1>it it will not use a service.

00:49:17.175 --> 00:49:19.015
<v Speaker 1>It will connect Like, is doing the bot

00:49:19.015 --> 00:49:19.974
<v Speaker 2>flow, like, from the host?

00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:22.220
<v Speaker 0>It could proxy. Right?

00:49:24.619 --> 00:49:25.340
<v Speaker 2>No?

00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:27.660
<v Speaker 2>Yep. Just look at the error and the

00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:29.980
<v Speaker 2>port number. You might get a hint.

00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:32.700
<v Speaker 0>So 1025O

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:33.660
<v Speaker 0>is the

00:49:34.475 --> 00:49:36.395
<v Speaker 0>read only port number for the API server?

00:49:36.395 --> 00:49:38.795
<v Speaker 1>The cube the q no. For the cubelet.

00:49:38.795 --> 00:49:39.755
<v Speaker 0>For the cubelet.

00:49:40.155 --> 00:49:43.115
<v Speaker 2>So this So how port forward works is,

00:49:43.195 --> 00:49:43.915
<v Speaker 2>basically,

00:49:43.995 --> 00:49:46.950
<v Speaker 2>it actually goes to hit that Qubelet API

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:48.230
<v Speaker 2>on 1250.

00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:49.910
<v Speaker 2>It uses that port number to the port

00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:50.630
<v Speaker 2>forward.

00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:52.390
<v Speaker 2>This is also how

00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:53.430
<v Speaker 2>Kubernetes

00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:55.110
<v Speaker 2>does some kind of help text and stuff.

00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:57.190
<v Speaker 2>So 12 1 0 2 5 0 should

00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.750
<v Speaker 2>be open.

00:49:58.595 --> 00:50:00.755
<v Speaker 2>And is it open? That's a question.

00:50:01.635 --> 00:50:03.234
<v Speaker 0>Well, I'm gonna assume not.

00:50:07.155 --> 00:50:08.835
<v Speaker 1>So you're made on the Cubelet?

00:50:09.474 --> 00:50:10.435
<v Speaker 1>System control.

00:50:10.835 --> 00:50:12.440
<v Speaker 2>Not nothing to do with the Cubelet. It's

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:14.279
<v Speaker 2>just log in the board and Probably IP

00:50:14.279 --> 00:50:16.760
<v Speaker 2>tables or firewall. Stock. Are you playing with

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:18.280
<v Speaker 1>the IP tables and stuff?

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:19.960
<v Speaker 0>Or UFW?

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:21.640
<v Speaker 0>Do you wanna just stop UFW, and then

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:23.079
<v Speaker 0>we can or or we could just check

00:50:23.079 --> 00:50:24.440
<v Speaker 0>IP tables. Yeah.

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:25.640
<v Speaker 2>Yep.

00:50:31.325 --> 00:50:33.165
<v Speaker 2>You're on the wrong host.

00:50:33.805 --> 00:50:35.885
<v Speaker 2>This is a control key. It doesn't matter.

00:50:35.885 --> 00:50:37.965
<v Speaker 1>Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

00:50:39.005 --> 00:50:41.485
<v Speaker 1>Get bots minus. Oh, wait.

00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:44.970
<v Speaker 1>So which host it is? This host,

00:50:45.770 --> 00:50:48.970
<v Speaker 1>which is WorkerRQH4M.

00:50:49.290 --> 00:50:51.610
<v Speaker 0>Okay. There's a session on that device open.

00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:53.770
<v Speaker 0>You can join it. Okay.

00:50:54.555 --> 00:50:56.635
<v Speaker 0>I'll just take your IP tools command.

00:51:00.315 --> 00:51:02.315
<v Speaker 0>Oh, look at that. I've got a drop.

00:51:03.595 --> 00:51:04.075
<v Speaker 2>Yep.

00:51:08.099 --> 00:51:10.020
<v Speaker 2>Should I give hint hint on how to

00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:12.099
<v Speaker 2>delete? Or are you I could just flush

00:51:12.099 --> 00:51:13.619
<v Speaker 0>it, or did you persist it?

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:16.740
<v Speaker 2>No. I didn't process, like, just that entry.

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:18.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. You can just flush it. There we

00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:18.500
<v Speaker 0>go.

00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:21.140
<v Speaker 2>You might need to do it on all

00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:23.325
<v Speaker 2>that work and not Yeah. It's working there.

00:51:23.325 --> 00:51:23.885
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:51:24.125 --> 00:51:26.925
<v Speaker 1>Wanted to stay from host controls.

00:51:29.965 --> 00:51:32.285
<v Speaker 1>Yes. Oh, doesn't it play?

00:51:32.845 --> 00:51:35.725
<v Speaker 2>That's sad. Oh, it's it's it's Firefox.

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:38.220
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Firefox, I don't know why it just

00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:39.340
<v Speaker 0>seems to struggle.

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:49.420
<v Speaker 2>I know you need to operate a new

00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:51.825
<v Speaker 2>port forward. I don't know why it happens.

00:51:51.985 --> 00:51:54.065
<v Speaker 2>Like, if a Firefox gets stuck

00:51:57.665 --> 00:51:58.785
<v Speaker 2>I

00:51:58.785 --> 00:51:59.505
<v Speaker 2>didn't

00:51:59.745 --> 00:52:00.305
<v Speaker 2>oh,

00:52:00.705 --> 00:52:01.665
<v Speaker 2>that's sad.

00:52:02.465 --> 00:52:04.545
<v Speaker 0>Next time another Rectrol, by the way.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.640
<v Speaker 2>Yep. But it was another withdrawal. Scream.

00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:11.520
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we've flushed the IP tables. We

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:13.040
<v Speaker 0>can now do a rollout.

00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:16.000
<v Speaker 0>No. We need to fix this. Why

00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.905
<v Speaker 2>yep. Try describing it again.

00:52:27.825 --> 00:52:29.185
<v Speaker 0>That's the old image.

00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:31.950
<v Speaker 2>Yep.

00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:33.870
<v Speaker 2>So who is changing the image on the

00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:34.430
<v Speaker 2>fly?

00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:38.270
<v Speaker 1>We have the whole CTF team, by the

00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:40.510
<v Speaker 1>way. We have Lewis. We have Andy.

00:52:41.230 --> 00:52:42.750
<v Speaker 1>We have Magnum. Nice.

00:52:46.085 --> 00:52:48.245
<v Speaker 0>So something is changing in the image.

00:52:49.445 --> 00:52:51.605
<v Speaker 0>And it wasn't a mutate and wipe it

00:52:51.605 --> 00:52:53.525
<v Speaker 0>because we deleted all of them. Right?

00:52:54.165 --> 00:52:56.724
<v Speaker 1>But it's it's it's still referring to the

00:52:56.724 --> 00:52:57.285
<v Speaker 1>old system.

00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:02.200
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no. We don't still need log in.

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:02.680
<v Speaker 2>Have Yep.

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:06.360
<v Speaker 2>Yep. Just delete it. It's fine.

00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:11.320
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. We only told it we had allowed

00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:14.040
<v Speaker 0>it to fail. So that was actually doing

00:53:13.535 --> 00:53:15.695
<v Speaker 0>two things. You sneak It was actually valid

00:53:15.695 --> 00:53:16.815
<v Speaker 2>endpoint.

00:53:16.815 --> 00:53:18.975
<v Speaker 2>It was not, like, something yeah. I actually

00:53:18.975 --> 00:53:20.095
<v Speaker 2>wrote a webhook.

00:53:21.135 --> 00:53:22.975
<v Speaker 2>Actually, it's actually very easy to write one.

00:53:22.975 --> 00:53:24.335
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize it was very easy to

00:53:24.335 --> 00:53:26.650
<v Speaker 2>write one. It, like, probably takes, like, fifteen

00:53:26.650 --> 00:53:28.410
<v Speaker 2>to twenty minutes. Like, you can find samples

00:53:28.410 --> 00:53:30.010
<v Speaker 2>and just modify stuff.

00:53:32.650 --> 00:53:34.570
<v Speaker 2>Okay. Now you could probably do the rollout

00:53:34.570 --> 00:53:36.890
<v Speaker 2>restart or edit the deep silence.

00:53:38.410 --> 00:53:39.210
<v Speaker 1>Need to connect.

00:53:43.954 --> 00:53:45.315
<v Speaker 2>K pirate symbol.

00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:55.260
<v Speaker 0>What happened there?

00:53:57.740 --> 00:53:59.180
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I'm trying to get one.

00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:02.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:06.300
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

00:54:12.095 --> 00:54:13.215
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That was

00:54:14.015 --> 00:54:16.335
<v Speaker 0>a brittle combination Strange. Issues there. Although we're

00:54:16.335 --> 00:54:18.335
<v Speaker 0>still getting our image pool error.

00:54:19.615 --> 00:54:20.415
<v Speaker 2>Yep. Why?

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:26.160
<v Speaker 0>We deleted the mutating webhook.

00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:28.880
<v Speaker 2>Yep. This is Now we should have the

00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:30.000
<v Speaker 0>right image. Okay.

00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:32.480
<v Speaker 0>But the problem is

00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:34.240
<v Speaker 1>Not found.

00:54:35.244 --> 00:54:37.005
<v Speaker 1>Faint to resolve reference.

00:54:37.405 --> 00:54:39.645
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So did you play with the container's

00:54:39.645 --> 00:54:40.445
<v Speaker 1>configuration?

00:54:42.365 --> 00:54:43.165
<v Speaker 1>Registry

00:54:43.165 --> 00:54:43.645
<v Speaker 1>is like

00:54:45.244 --> 00:54:46.445
<v Speaker 1>no. You don't have it.

00:54:49.410 --> 00:54:51.250
<v Speaker 2>Go. You're on the right track.

00:54:51.650 --> 00:54:54.210
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So you have maybe web web

00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:56.369
<v Speaker 1>what is it called? Okay.

00:54:58.210 --> 00:55:00.210
<v Speaker 1>Can you get the resources? Let's get the

00:55:00.210 --> 00:55:01.010
<v Speaker 1>resources.

00:55:01.809 --> 00:55:04.290
<v Speaker 2>No. No. Go back. Back. It was right

00:55:04.290 --> 00:55:06.825
<v Speaker 2>on the track, checking the container d stuff.

00:55:07.065 --> 00:55:08.825
<v Speaker 0>Let's pop open that config.

00:55:08.905 --> 00:55:09.385
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:55:18.425 --> 00:55:18.825
<v Speaker 1>Config.

00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:22.440
<v Speaker 1>Because in actually, in cluster, they don't have

00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:23.400
<v Speaker 1>the configuration.

00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:27.640
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Login. Next. So go into that search

00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:28.440
<v Speaker 0>dot d.

00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:35.545
<v Speaker 1>So cc containers,

00:55:35.545 --> 00:55:36.505
<v Speaker 1>search of the

00:55:37.305 --> 00:55:38.585
<v Speaker 1>and s minus m.

00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:49.099
<v Speaker 2>Six. Man, I think with that. Just check

00:55:49.099 --> 00:55:51.180
<v Speaker 2>the search dot d thing. Maybe you'll get

00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:52.460
<v Speaker 2>a hint. Yeah.

00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:01.339
<v Speaker 1>What was it? The search .d?

00:56:02.454 --> 00:56:03.975
<v Speaker 2>Yep. Search.d.

00:56:04.535 --> 00:56:05.735
<v Speaker 1>Just a second.

00:56:08.935 --> 00:56:11.575
<v Speaker 1>Containers d. The search oh, it doesn't exist?

00:56:12.535 --> 00:56:13.735
<v Speaker 2>It does exist.

00:56:14.375 --> 00:56:15.015
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:20.260
<v Speaker 1>And s.

00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:24.100
<v Speaker 1>Not access.

00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:27.700
<v Speaker 0>CT into it?

00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:29.860
<v Speaker 2>Yep. That's CT.

00:56:34.795 --> 00:56:36.315
<v Speaker 1>I am in the right one. I am

00:56:36.315 --> 00:56:37.595
<v Speaker 1>in the control plane.

00:56:38.155 --> 00:56:39.835
<v Speaker 1>But I am on the control plane.

00:56:41.915 --> 00:56:44.075
<v Speaker 2>Yep. So where is CD's getting pulled?

00:56:45.609 --> 00:56:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Sorry?

00:56:47.210 --> 00:56:48.570
<v Speaker 2>Yep. You are right.

00:56:48.890 --> 00:56:50.570
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. If we go through the worker node

00:56:50.570 --> 00:56:52.410
<v Speaker 0>that we had opened earlier, but it there's

00:56:52.410 --> 00:56:54.330
<v Speaker 0>a GHCR override.

00:56:56.490 --> 00:56:59.609
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Let's connect to the other one, the

00:56:59.609 --> 00:57:00.410
<v Speaker 1>worker node.

00:57:02.605 --> 00:57:03.405
<v Speaker 0>Sneaking.

00:57:05.404 --> 00:57:06.204
<v Speaker 2>So if you

00:57:06.845 --> 00:57:09.325
<v Speaker 2>so this came out in continuity version one

00:57:09.325 --> 00:57:11.085
<v Speaker 2>point five point five. So this is a

00:57:11.085 --> 00:57:13.005
<v Speaker 2>new feature in one point five point five

00:57:13.005 --> 00:57:15.410
<v Speaker 2>where you could actually, like, set capabilities for

00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:17.650
<v Speaker 2>a registry. So I had to actually upgrade

00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:19.490
<v Speaker 2>continue to one five five.

00:57:19.650 --> 00:57:21.890
<v Speaker 2>And it was just released two days ago,

00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:24.690
<v Speaker 2>and I was actually using the RC version

00:57:24.690 --> 00:57:25.970
<v Speaker 2>before it. So

00:57:26.535 --> 00:57:29.175
<v Speaker 2>check You're off my Christmas card list though.

00:57:31.174 --> 00:57:32.775
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he was in.

00:57:34.454 --> 00:57:36.775
<v Speaker 2>So if you delete this file, container d

00:57:36.775 --> 00:57:38.454
<v Speaker 2>would pick it on the fly, and the

00:57:38.454 --> 00:57:40.780
<v Speaker 2>image would get pulled. Just delete the file.

00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:42.780
<v Speaker 2>You don't even need to restart continuity.

00:57:44.299 --> 00:57:45.339
<v Speaker 1>I delete the

00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:49.500
<v Speaker 1>okay. I deleted it already. Yeah.

00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:51.500
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna delete the pods, and then,

00:57:52.704 --> 00:57:54.944
<v Speaker 0>hopefully that's the last little surprise Noel has

00:57:54.944 --> 00:57:55.905
<v Speaker 0>left for us.

00:57:57.585 --> 00:57:59.905
<v Speaker 1>Are we done, Noel? Yes.

00:58:01.424 --> 00:58:02.305
<v Speaker 2>Yay.

00:58:02.305 --> 00:58:02.785
<v Speaker 2>It's up.

00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:07.300
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:08.500
<v Speaker 0>Nice one, Noel.

00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:11.380
<v Speaker 0>But still there there too. I don't I

00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:13.300
<v Speaker 0>had no idea about that container d change.

00:58:14.099 --> 00:58:16.339
<v Speaker 2>No. I didn't know that. I think someone

00:58:16.339 --> 00:58:18.260
<v Speaker 2>tweeted about it or something, then I saw

00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:19.940
<v Speaker 2>red with the restarts and found it.

00:58:21.825 --> 00:58:25.105
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Last cluster then. You two are up.

00:58:26.385 --> 00:58:28.465
<v Speaker 0>Ah, I think that was the application is

00:58:28.465 --> 00:58:29.105
<v Speaker 2>working.

00:58:31.825 --> 00:58:34.305
<v Speaker 1>I had another ID based on 01/21,

00:58:35.369 --> 00:58:37.609
<v Speaker 1>and it was a hint from Rory, but

00:58:37.930 --> 00:58:40.089
<v Speaker 1>I didn't I wasn't evil enough to do

00:58:40.089 --> 00:58:40.490
<v Speaker 1>it.

00:58:42.329 --> 00:58:44.410
<v Speaker 2>You might want to check whether this is

00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:45.369
<v Speaker 2>also working.

00:58:45.609 --> 00:58:46.730
<v Speaker 2>The port forward,

00:58:46.970 --> 00:58:48.329
<v Speaker 2>there's one more screen

00:58:49.130 --> 00:58:49.609
<v Speaker 2>is here.

00:58:51.385 --> 00:58:54.025
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So now we connect to another cluster.

00:58:55.145 --> 00:58:56.265
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Hold on. What

00:58:57.145 --> 00:58:58.904
<v Speaker 0>no one wants us to check. I have

00:58:58.904 --> 00:59:01.704
<v Speaker 2>one more little snarky stuff left there, and

00:59:01.704 --> 00:59:02.744
<v Speaker 2>you would be good to go.

00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:08.300
<v Speaker 2>That should be easy to yep.

00:59:17.775 --> 00:59:18.735
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:59:19.935 --> 00:59:22.015
<v Speaker 0>Back on we go. Alright.

00:59:22.655 --> 00:59:25.455
<v Speaker 0>Yep. It's a easy fix. So yeah.

00:59:28.029 --> 00:59:28.430
<v Speaker 2>So

00:59:29.869 --> 00:59:32.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. It's working. I failed to connect.

00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:35.230
<v Speaker 0>I created that. I clicked this.

00:59:35.710 --> 00:59:37.950
<v Speaker 1>Let's check the services and endpoints.

00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:40.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm out of the cluster. Let me connect

00:59:40.415 --> 00:59:42.015
<v Speaker 1>again. This is

00:59:42.815 --> 00:59:43.455
<v Speaker 1>no.

00:59:44.895 --> 00:59:46.095
<v Speaker 1>Join the session.

00:59:50.015 --> 00:59:50.335
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Okay. We have an endpoint.

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:03.240
<v Speaker 2>Maybe check

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:04.760
<v Speaker 2>Call DNS?

01:00:05.325 --> 01:00:07.724
<v Speaker 2>Let's I'll just do a change. It's much

01:00:07.724 --> 01:00:09.005
<v Speaker 2>easier rather than

01:00:09.484 --> 01:00:11.565
<v Speaker 2>letting you go down to the epic call.

01:00:12.685 --> 01:00:15.805
<v Speaker 1>Call DNS, twenty six hours. Yes. He did

01:00:15.805 --> 01:00:16.445
<v Speaker 1>change something.

01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:23.420
<v Speaker 1>Still do it from DNS because we it

01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:24.460
<v Speaker 1>was covered,

01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:25.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:27.740
<v Speaker 1>in breadth and depth.

01:00:33.875 --> 01:00:35.795
<v Speaker 2>I didn't touch this? No. You didn't touch

01:00:35.795 --> 01:00:37.875
<v Speaker 0>that. You just modified the deployment.

01:00:39.954 --> 01:00:40.675
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.

01:00:41.954 --> 01:00:43.795
<v Speaker 1>Most likely the c m and d m.

01:00:44.275 --> 01:00:45.315
<v Speaker 1>Like, creation map.

01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:47.860
<v Speaker 1>DNS rolling update.

01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:50.420
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I'm assuming this dog goose shouldn't be

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:51.860
<v Speaker 0>here. Goose.

01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:55.700
<v Speaker 0>Is that the right path, Nel?

01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:58.740
<v Speaker 2>Yep. That h c call file. That's the

01:00:58.740 --> 01:00:59.140
<v Speaker 2>DNS.

01:01:00.494 --> 01:01:01.295
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:01:01.295 --> 01:01:01.935
<v Speaker 2>Oh,

01:01:02.335 --> 01:01:04.494
<v Speaker 2>it's just Etsy d call file. There's no

01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:05.535
<v Speaker 2>DNS in there.

01:01:08.575 --> 01:01:10.494
<v Speaker 0>Thank you. And if you scroll down, you

01:01:10.494 --> 01:01:12.174
<v Speaker 2>can actually look at the original call like,

01:01:12.174 --> 01:01:13.615
<v Speaker 2>the modified call file.

01:01:14.095 --> 01:01:16.020
<v Speaker 2>Just take the volume bounce. You would get

01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:16.820
<v Speaker 2>an idea.

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:19.460
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Minute, Rawkode.

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:25.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to even delete it. It

01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:27.380
<v Speaker 2>doesn't matter. Yeah. It will update that file.

01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:28.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:29.860
<v Speaker 0>I see what you did. Okay.

01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:32.714
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I just need a few cuddle patch

01:01:32.714 --> 01:01:34.155
<v Speaker 2>and that's it.

01:01:36.154 --> 01:01:38.474
<v Speaker 0>We may have to rotate the accordion f

01:01:38.474 --> 01:01:39.195
<v Speaker 0>parts.

01:01:42.555 --> 01:01:44.555
<v Speaker 2>Oh, it's probably because of the

01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:47.500
<v Speaker 2>you are just delete that hotspot also because

01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:48.940
<v Speaker 2>I think we had we haven't typed on

01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:49.180
<v Speaker 2>the

01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:54.620
<v Speaker 2>yep.

01:01:54.859 --> 01:01:55.980
<v Speaker 2>Call DNS.

01:01:56.619 --> 01:01:58.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. It's the your DNS. It goes to

01:01:58.700 --> 01:01:59.180
<v Speaker 1>the volume.

01:02:03.695 --> 01:02:05.295
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Yeah. That's it, though.

01:02:06.335 --> 01:02:08.815
<v Speaker 1>We go. Turning one.

01:02:10.575 --> 01:02:12.495
<v Speaker 2>I think we probably need to, like, delete

01:02:12.495 --> 01:02:14.310
<v Speaker 2>the port for it to pick up stuff.

01:02:14.310 --> 01:02:16.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how really the DNS starts

01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:17.430
<v Speaker 2>working.

01:02:19.030 --> 01:02:20.390
<v Speaker 0>Tell you what. I'll just delete the whole

01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:21.030
<v Speaker 0>cluster.

01:02:22.310 --> 01:02:22.790
<v Speaker 2>Oh, yeah.

01:02:26.405 --> 01:02:28.244
<v Speaker 0>Crash the I was actually trying to do

01:02:28.244 --> 01:02:28.885
<v Speaker 2>the

01:02:30.645 --> 01:02:32.085
<v Speaker 0>You know what? I'm just going we'll we'll

01:02:32.085 --> 01:02:33.525
<v Speaker 0>just ignore this. Let's move on to the

01:02:33.525 --> 01:02:35.365
<v Speaker 0>last cluster. Yeah. Let's ignore it. At least

01:02:35.365 --> 01:02:37.045
<v Speaker 2>that was the issue. It should have fixed

01:02:37.045 --> 01:02:37.525
<v Speaker 2>it.

01:02:38.244 --> 01:02:40.565
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We have we have time. Correct?

01:02:41.490 --> 01:02:43.090
<v Speaker 0>Yes. We have Yep. You you have twenty

01:02:43.090 --> 01:02:45.010
<v Speaker 0>four minutes to fix my cluster. I've I

01:02:45.010 --> 01:02:47.170
<v Speaker 0>I didn't make it too elaborate because I

01:02:47.170 --> 01:02:48.770
<v Speaker 0>wanted it to be a bonus cluster.

01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:50.290
<v Speaker 0>You know, I wanted to focus all of

01:02:50.290 --> 01:02:52.690
<v Speaker 0>our time on both of yours. So I

01:02:52.690 --> 01:02:54.450
<v Speaker 0>don't think it'll take you too long, but

01:02:54.450 --> 01:02:56.210
<v Speaker 0>if you need any hints, I will I

01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:57.090
<v Speaker 0>will let you know.

01:02:58.105 --> 01:03:00.265
<v Speaker 0>I've opened the session on the control plane.

01:03:00.265 --> 01:03:01.225
<v Speaker 0>You can both

01:03:01.465 --> 01:03:04.105
<v Speaker 0>join, and I'll just sit back and laugh.

01:03:04.105 --> 01:03:05.625
<v Speaker 1>Cluster.

01:03:05.625 --> 01:03:07.545
<v Speaker 2>Yep. David is going to have a lot

01:03:07.545 --> 01:03:09.385
<v Speaker 2>of loss today. This is the first time

01:03:09.385 --> 01:03:11.145
<v Speaker 0>I've broken a cluster session. Excited.

01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:15.660
<v Speaker 0>And it's really hard. All the experience of

01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:16.700
<v Speaker 2>all the bakers.

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:18.300
<v Speaker 0>Yes. I

01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:21.260
<v Speaker 0>I I did respect Vale's wishes, and I

01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:21.980
<v Speaker 0>stopped

01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:25.180
<v Speaker 0>almost entirely to kube control. Almost.

01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:26.140
<v Speaker 2>Cool.

01:03:28.255 --> 01:03:30.415
<v Speaker 2>So my DNS hack. Right? I was actually

01:03:30.415 --> 01:03:32.415
<v Speaker 2>trying to do a DNS hijacking,

01:03:32.415 --> 01:03:34.335
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't seem to work with CDM.

01:03:34.335 --> 01:03:36.495
<v Speaker 2>So I just left out that box. That's

01:03:36.495 --> 01:03:38.175
<v Speaker 2>why I just, like, went with the whole

01:03:38.175 --> 01:03:38.975
<v Speaker 2>DNS thing.

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:49.000
<v Speaker 2>Alright. Let me connect them. Activity.

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:50.040
<v Speaker 2>Activation.

01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:56.920
<v Speaker 1>What happened?

01:03:57.945 --> 01:03:59.785
<v Speaker 2>Oh, you might need to just refresh.

01:03:59.785 --> 01:04:00.745
<v Speaker 2>I did not.

01:04:01.625 --> 01:04:02.345
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.

01:04:03.225 --> 01:04:05.385
<v Speaker 0>It's okay. Deshaun is saying if you wanna

01:04:05.385 --> 01:04:07.145
<v Speaker 0>live on the bleeding edge of container d,

01:04:07.145 --> 01:04:08.745
<v Speaker 0>you can use 155

01:04:08.905 --> 01:04:10.585
<v Speaker 0>1555,

01:04:10.825 --> 01:04:12.105
<v Speaker 0>but you make a cut.

01:04:14.330 --> 01:04:15.450
<v Speaker 1>View control.

01:04:15.690 --> 01:04:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Get notes. Let's see if we have an

01:04:17.530 --> 01:04:18.650
<v Speaker 1>API server.

01:04:19.610 --> 01:04:22.570
<v Speaker 1>Yep. And it is timing. Oh, no. We

01:04:22.570 --> 01:04:22.730
<v Speaker 2>didn't

01:04:24.250 --> 01:04:26.170
<v Speaker 2>oh, no. We didn't export it properly. Right?

01:04:26.964 --> 01:04:29.125
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yes. Only at SQL where it is.

01:04:30.325 --> 01:04:32.325
<v Speaker 1>I did export it, but then you override

01:04:32.325 --> 01:04:32.965
<v Speaker 1>it.

01:04:34.005 --> 01:04:35.685
<v Speaker 2>Oh, I'm sorry. So

01:04:36.005 --> 01:04:37.925
<v Speaker 1>we are clustering ourselves here.

01:04:38.484 --> 01:04:38.885
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

01:04:41.559 --> 01:04:43.000
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

01:04:43.079 --> 01:04:43.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

01:04:44.039 --> 01:04:45.560
<v Speaker 2>But it takes a while.

01:04:46.119 --> 01:04:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I think okay. Now it's cached now.

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:51.960
<v Speaker 2>Now okay. I

01:04:53.319 --> 01:04:54.359
<v Speaker 0>like being on that site.

01:04:56.465 --> 01:04:58.385
<v Speaker 2>At one point, I actually thought of doing

01:04:58.385 --> 01:05:01.185
<v Speaker 2>some network shaping. Takes a while. Then I

01:05:01.185 --> 01:05:02.865
<v Speaker 2>got it. The second one? To get it

01:05:02.865 --> 01:05:03.425
<v Speaker 2>fixed.

01:05:05.585 --> 01:05:08.065
<v Speaker 1>Sorry, Nolan. I was speaking while you're speaking.

01:05:08.625 --> 01:05:10.065
<v Speaker 2>But it does take a while.

01:05:11.790 --> 01:05:12.830
<v Speaker 1>Let

01:05:14.190 --> 01:05:16.990
<v Speaker 1>me remove the cache, and let's see again.

01:05:19.550 --> 01:05:20.350
<v Speaker 1>Oops.

01:05:20.590 --> 01:05:22.110
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to take control, or do

01:05:22.110 --> 01:05:23.070
<v Speaker 1>you want me to take control?

01:05:23.805 --> 01:05:26.444
<v Speaker 1>You you drive. Go ahead. That's fine. Okay.

01:05:26.444 --> 01:05:28.045
<v Speaker 1>I just want to remove the cache and

01:05:28.045 --> 01:05:28.925
<v Speaker 1>see again.

01:05:32.444 --> 01:05:33.085
<v Speaker 2>Oops.

01:05:33.325 --> 01:05:34.444
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead. Go ahead.

01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:37.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay. And try again, but do it with

01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:40.060
<v Speaker 1>verbosity if you can do some verbosity.

01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:43.100
<v Speaker 2>Okay. This is going super fast.

01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:49.020
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going fine because the response

01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:51.135
<v Speaker 2>is pretty fast. It must be, like, some

01:05:51.295 --> 01:05:52.255
<v Speaker 2>I know.

01:05:52.975 --> 01:05:55.215
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So why container is creating?

01:05:58.015 --> 01:05:59.135
<v Speaker 1>Can you describe?

01:06:01.295 --> 01:06:03.295
<v Speaker 2>Know it's like, detect your cuddle get not,

01:06:03.295 --> 01:06:04.335
<v Speaker 2>and, like, panic forever.

01:06:06.270 --> 01:06:08.430
<v Speaker 0>Kevin is asking how evil I can be.

01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:09.870
<v Speaker 0>I haven't been too evil.

01:06:10.830 --> 01:06:12.510
<v Speaker 1>So it is all cube control?

01:06:12.910 --> 01:06:13.630
<v Speaker 0>Almost.

01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Let's check the network policies.

01:06:19.315 --> 01:06:21.395
<v Speaker 2>Oh, the API was

01:06:21.395 --> 01:06:22.275
<v Speaker 2>modified.

01:06:23.635 --> 01:06:25.635
<v Speaker 2>So at least during case, the same steps

01:06:25.635 --> 01:06:27.475
<v Speaker 2>like I did. Yeah. I sent the same

01:06:27.475 --> 01:06:29.075
<v Speaker 0>steps to my birthday, and I'm one in

01:06:29.075 --> 01:06:30.355
<v Speaker 0>the future just just for the.

01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:39.150
<v Speaker 0>Of my test clusters, I actually set the

01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:42.030
<v Speaker 0>time forward. No no restrictions only. That was

01:06:42.030 --> 01:06:42.990
<v Speaker 0>a bad idea.

01:06:45.310 --> 01:06:45.550
<v Speaker 0>Admission.

01:06:48.065 --> 01:06:48.945
<v Speaker 1>And

01:06:49.345 --> 01:06:51.585
<v Speaker 1>it looks fine. Can you go down?

01:06:55.025 --> 01:06:55.905
<v Speaker 1>Lives.

01:06:55.984 --> 01:06:56.705
<v Speaker 1>Lives.

01:06:56.785 --> 01:06:57.664
<v Speaker 1>Just a second.

01:06:59.190 --> 01:07:00.870
<v Speaker 1>It's not lives. Oh.

01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:03.030
<v Speaker 2>I think it's healthy.

01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:04.790
<v Speaker 1>It's health.

01:07:05.109 --> 01:07:05.670
<v Speaker 1>Health.

01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.670
<v Speaker 2>I

01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:10.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. Is this? This is the

01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:11.270
<v Speaker 1>liveness.

01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:13.430
<v Speaker 1>And the other one is ready.

01:07:14.724 --> 01:07:17.125
<v Speaker 1>Ready. Just for rest of the I never

01:07:17.125 --> 01:07:19.285
<v Speaker 0>changed either of those just for the record.

01:07:20.405 --> 01:07:22.165
<v Speaker 0>I didn't change either of those.

01:07:22.565 --> 01:07:24.325
<v Speaker 1>Really? Oh, yeah.

01:07:24.964 --> 01:07:27.445
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Okay. Why is this look at the

01:07:27.445 --> 01:07:27.765
<v Speaker 2>request.

01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:30.790
<v Speaker 2>And 02:50PM,

01:07:30.790 --> 01:07:31.830
<v Speaker 2>that seems

01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:35.670
<v Speaker 2>fine. It's okay. 02:50 is okay. Oh, the

01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:38.070
<v Speaker 2>failure threshold is 24?

01:07:38.869 --> 01:07:40.150
<v Speaker 2>Is that, like, normal?

01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:44.710
<v Speaker 1>So after 24

01:07:43.815 --> 01:07:45.735
<v Speaker 1>failure threshold, we get something.

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:48.295
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I think that's fine. But but it

01:07:48.375 --> 01:07:50.375
<v Speaker 1>the bot restart, we didn't see that.

01:07:54.694 --> 01:07:56.615
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming there is I

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:02.560
<v Speaker 1>okay. Before checking this manifest, let's check if

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.720
<v Speaker 1>there are restarts or something. Yeah.

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:06.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. There is. Oh, yeah.

01:08:11.865 --> 01:08:13.545
<v Speaker 2>House snipled through.

01:08:15.305 --> 01:08:15.865
<v Speaker 2>The

01:08:18.984 --> 01:08:20.425
<v Speaker 2>scene's fine

01:08:21.225 --> 01:08:22.665
<v Speaker 2>for almost everything.

01:08:23.729 --> 01:08:26.050
<v Speaker 1>Let's get our facts correct first. So we

01:08:26.050 --> 01:08:29.090
<v Speaker 1>have a container creating, but it's not creating.

01:08:29.250 --> 01:08:29.889
<v Speaker 1>Okay?

01:08:30.290 --> 01:08:32.290
<v Speaker 1>And I think we have some slowness. Shouldn't

01:08:32.290 --> 01:08:33.090
<v Speaker 2>we worry?

01:08:33.649 --> 01:08:35.729
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. We have a slowness, which we should

01:08:35.890 --> 01:08:37.330
<v Speaker 1>So we need to figure out the slowness,

01:08:37.330 --> 01:08:37.569
<v Speaker 1>I mean.

01:08:38.345 --> 01:08:41.145
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. You you can't describe the project. Right?

01:08:42.104 --> 01:08:43.705
<v Speaker 0>You you don't know why it's not in

01:08:43.705 --> 01:08:44.825
<v Speaker 0>container creating.

01:08:46.185 --> 01:08:46.985
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

01:08:46.985 --> 01:08:47.864
<v Speaker 2>I can do that.

01:08:48.345 --> 01:08:50.425
<v Speaker 2>Just before that, I'll just check whether x

01:08:50.425 --> 01:08:51.785
<v Speaker 2>c d is also fine.

01:08:52.505 --> 01:08:53.785
<v Speaker 2>And hundred m?

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:57.200
<v Speaker 1>We can check from the notes. I think

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.399
<v Speaker 1>it's a little bit low.

01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:00.640
<v Speaker 2>Let me just copy to at least, like

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:03.120
<v Speaker 2>I just matter, I guess.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.720
<v Speaker 2>I'll just create it without any changes,

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:07.280
<v Speaker 2>and

01:09:08.585 --> 01:09:10.104
<v Speaker 2>share this Yarekuddle.

01:09:13.545 --> 01:09:14.665
<v Speaker 2>Run time.

01:09:17.305 --> 01:09:18.425
<v Speaker 2>And point

01:09:18.985 --> 01:09:19.625
<v Speaker 2>units.

01:09:24.270 --> 01:09:25.950
<v Speaker 0>So which problem are you trying to solve

01:09:25.950 --> 01:09:26.830
<v Speaker 0>just now?

01:09:29.070 --> 01:09:30.670
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying. We don't know the

01:09:30.670 --> 01:09:32.430
<v Speaker 1>problem. So the only problem we see is

01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:34.510
<v Speaker 1>the container are still creating.

01:09:36.095 --> 01:09:38.415
<v Speaker 1>And I think there is a slowness also.

01:09:39.375 --> 01:09:41.455
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I'm working. Yeah. I I mean Let's

01:09:41.455 --> 01:09:42.814
<v Speaker 1>look at the slowness first.

01:09:43.854 --> 01:09:46.255
<v Speaker 1>So you have everything running sixteen hours.

01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:50.660
<v Speaker 1>S three.

01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:52.580
<v Speaker 2>Sending update to

01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:55.620
<v Speaker 0>Oh, look. Hi. Our Google namespaces.

01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:57.460
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

01:10:00.455 --> 01:10:02.055
<v Speaker 2>Oh, I had it in my notes to

01:10:02.055 --> 01:10:04.855
<v Speaker 2>actually install XNS controller and do something, but

01:10:04.855 --> 01:10:06.695
<v Speaker 2>then I thought it's, like, too much work.

01:10:07.895 --> 01:10:08.935
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:10:11.415 --> 01:10:13.015
<v Speaker 0>I think you need to decide which problem

01:10:13.015 --> 01:10:14.455
<v Speaker 0>these wanna fix. I think you're both working

01:10:14.455 --> 01:10:15.575
<v Speaker 0>on different problems right now.

01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:18.360
<v Speaker 0>So pick which one you wanna fix first.

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:22.360
<v Speaker 2>So there is a context that line exceeded

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:25.000
<v Speaker 2>that's happening, and it says custom resource definitions

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.160
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy list would be done. I don't think

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.600
<v Speaker 2>this is an issue for now,

01:10:30.205 --> 01:10:33.005
<v Speaker 2>But we probably need to fix the alright.

01:10:33.325 --> 01:10:34.284
<v Speaker 2>Oh, okay.

01:10:34.765 --> 01:10:35.885
<v Speaker 2>He's laughing.

01:10:37.725 --> 01:10:39.565
<v Speaker 0>It's just nice being on the safe at

01:10:39.565 --> 01:10:41.645
<v Speaker 0>all. But but it's admission control. It's denying

01:10:41.645 --> 01:10:42.364
<v Speaker 1>all modification.

01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:48.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh, so it must be that admission control

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:50.440
<v Speaker 2>is typing out, and then, like, it's set

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:52.840
<v Speaker 2>up created policy is set to ignore, and

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:54.680
<v Speaker 2>it's actually typing out. So that's why it's

01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:57.000
<v Speaker 2>taking a little bit there. Can you describe?

01:10:57.555 --> 01:10:58.275
<v Speaker 2>Sure. Let's

01:10:59.955 --> 01:11:02.275
<v Speaker 1>no. Can you describe the bot? Yep.

01:11:03.955 --> 01:11:04.594
<v Speaker 2>Ah,

01:11:04.915 --> 01:11:05.795
<v Speaker 2>it's better.

01:11:06.675 --> 01:11:08.995
<v Speaker 2>At parts, I hope it returns faster.

01:11:09.810 --> 01:11:12.610
<v Speaker 0>I actually knew that list. Thanks for sharing.

01:11:15.010 --> 01:11:16.690
<v Speaker 0>Wish it was something better.

01:11:18.850 --> 01:11:20.850
<v Speaker 1>That slowness is really killing me.

01:11:24.255 --> 01:11:26.015
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I think the slowness was a nice

01:11:26.015 --> 01:11:28.815
<v Speaker 0>touch. I really enjoyed that. Does this happen?

01:11:32.015 --> 01:11:32.495
<v Speaker 2>Did I

01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Did Okay. Can we get events?

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:38.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh.

01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:40.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean, it's a Oh,

01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:42.219
<v Speaker 2>it didn't get scheduled.

01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:43.020
<v Speaker 2>So

01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:46.060
<v Speaker 2>yes.

01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:49.260
<v Speaker 2>Let me check if the scheduler is running.

01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:50.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. It's running.

01:11:51.145 --> 01:11:52.905
<v Speaker 2>You start to get emails. Right?

01:12:02.265 --> 01:12:04.265
<v Speaker 0>Did you know events are stored as resources

01:12:04.265 --> 01:12:05.705
<v Speaker 0>in FTD and can be deleted?

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:09.520
<v Speaker 1>They can be deleted. I think they get

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:11.600
<v Speaker 1>deleted anyway, but after an hour or something.

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:13.040
<v Speaker 1>There is a time for it. There is

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:14.880
<v Speaker 1>a threshold by default. I've not left you

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:16.960
<v Speaker 0>any events or logs. Sorry about that.

01:12:18.765 --> 01:12:19.565
<v Speaker 2>Really?

01:12:24.285 --> 01:12:26.925
<v Speaker 2>I can send oh, it's called validating web

01:12:26.925 --> 01:12:28.285
<v Speaker 2>config. Right?

01:12:28.605 --> 01:12:30.685
<v Speaker 0>Evaluating web config configurations. Yep.

01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:38.380
<v Speaker 2>It could can't they have anything like v,

01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:39.660
<v Speaker 2>w c, or something?

01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:45.260
<v Speaker 1>I need to resolve this timing problem first.

01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:47.020
<v Speaker 2>Yep.

01:12:48.875 --> 01:12:51.275
<v Speaker 1>Okay. That's good. Try the mutating.

01:12:52.315 --> 01:12:53.035
<v Speaker 2>Yep.

01:12:53.835 --> 01:12:55.595
<v Speaker 0>This is so much fun.

01:12:59.995 --> 01:13:02.555
<v Speaker 2>It's good to enjoy once in a while.

01:13:06.929 --> 01:13:08.610
<v Speaker 1>I want to check the logs,

01:13:08.849 --> 01:13:09.570
<v Speaker 1>Noel.

01:13:10.929 --> 01:13:12.849
<v Speaker 2>The port? Okay. Yeah. Let's go. Yeah.

01:13:17.835 --> 01:13:19.994
<v Speaker 1>David said he deleted the logs,

01:13:20.954 --> 01:13:23.114
<v Speaker 1>but we can get them easily.

01:13:23.275 --> 01:13:25.835
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So we need to restart. Okay. So

01:13:26.074 --> 01:13:27.675
<v Speaker 0>That was a cruel touch, I must say,

01:13:27.675 --> 01:13:28.875
<v Speaker 0>but I joined. No. It's okay.

01:13:33.170 --> 01:13:35.170
<v Speaker 1>You cannot get rid of the logs.

01:13:35.970 --> 01:13:36.610
<v Speaker 1>I

01:13:41.810 --> 01:13:43.490
<v Speaker 2>think we should just restart your play.

01:13:44.514 --> 01:13:46.114
<v Speaker 1>This

01:13:46.114 --> 01:13:47.954
<v Speaker 1>should do the trick probably.

01:13:49.155 --> 01:13:50.034
<v Speaker 1>Not yet.

01:13:52.275 --> 01:13:54.114
<v Speaker 1>You know when when you restart the Qubelet,

01:13:54.114 --> 01:13:54.594
<v Speaker 1>what happens?

01:13:58.790 --> 01:14:00.869
<v Speaker 1>You play the Ah, if you restart it

01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:05.429
<v Speaker 2>if you restart it quite fast,

01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:08.310
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it would actually cause issues with continuity

01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:10.710
<v Speaker 2>and, like, gives you weird errors. I just

01:14:10.710 --> 01:14:12.555
<v Speaker 2>learned it yesterday in the talk. So if

01:14:12.555 --> 01:14:14.955
<v Speaker 2>you keep on restarting QBlack, content will start

01:14:14.955 --> 01:14:16.474
<v Speaker 2>to, like, be errors.

01:14:16.875 --> 01:14:18.875
<v Speaker 2>Okay. So things are up.

01:14:21.835 --> 01:14:23.915
<v Speaker 1>Yes. Things are up, but I don't see

01:14:23.915 --> 01:14:27.170
<v Speaker 1>logs. They should start logging already unless he

01:14:27.170 --> 01:14:28.530
<v Speaker 1>changed all the logging.

01:14:29.090 --> 01:14:29.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:14:30.690 --> 01:14:32.930
<v Speaker 2>Oh, it's a container deconfiguration?

01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:35.650
<v Speaker 1>So where's the configuration

01:14:36.610 --> 01:14:37.330
<v Speaker 1>for logging?

01:14:39.145 --> 01:14:40.745
<v Speaker 2>I think it must be the container d

01:14:40.745 --> 01:14:41.704
<v Speaker 2>configuration.

01:14:43.864 --> 01:14:44.985
<v Speaker 1>The back is

01:14:45.385 --> 01:14:46.425
<v Speaker 1>what is it?

01:14:47.465 --> 01:14:50.184
<v Speaker 1>Is it how do I know the files?

01:14:50.185 --> 01:14:52.280
<v Speaker 1>The back is query, is it? Oh, I

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:53.880
<v Speaker 2>don't know the You can run container d

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:56.120
<v Speaker 0>config dump to see the config.

01:14:58.040 --> 01:14:59.160
<v Speaker 2>Yep. Container

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:04.200
<v Speaker 2>d.

01:15:04.865 --> 01:15:06.705
<v Speaker 0>P. A space Oh, I know. It's just

01:15:06.705 --> 01:15:08.465
<v Speaker 2>containerds. Yep. Config

01:15:08.625 --> 01:15:11.585
<v Speaker 2>config dump. A space dump. Config default.

01:15:12.385 --> 01:15:14.945
<v Speaker 2>Oh, you just started containerd. Yeah. Delete the

01:15:14.945 --> 01:15:16.465
<v Speaker 0>control c that. You're cool.

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:21.199
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's config space dump, I think.

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Space dump. Percentage one. Yep. So percentage one

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:30.079
<v Speaker 2>is, the previous process.

01:15:35.375 --> 01:15:37.295
<v Speaker 1>And it's doing that. It's like time reading

01:15:37.295 --> 01:15:39.294
<v Speaker 2>the container data configuration.

01:15:39.934 --> 01:15:40.655
<v Speaker 2>No.

01:15:41.855 --> 01:15:44.655
<v Speaker 2>No? There's nothing in regards to

01:15:45.870 --> 01:15:46.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:48.909
<v Speaker 1>Run container d sock.

01:15:51.230 --> 01:15:51.949
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:55.230
<v Speaker 1>I want to try something, actually. Find

01:15:56.995 --> 01:15:57.795
<v Speaker 1>var.

01:15:59.075 --> 01:16:01.235
<v Speaker 2>Oh, let's take a permission of that folder,

01:16:01.235 --> 01:16:02.755
<v Speaker 2>and maybe it's not able to write to

01:16:02.755 --> 01:16:05.074
<v Speaker 2>that container var log container d.

01:16:05.635 --> 01:16:06.275
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

01:16:06.515 --> 01:16:08.434
<v Speaker 1>That would be too easy now.

01:16:10.035 --> 01:16:11.690
<v Speaker 1>You You said that it would be too.

01:16:12.330 --> 01:16:13.770
<v Speaker 1>And let's add a

01:16:18.090 --> 01:16:20.890
<v Speaker 0>I didn't modify any attributes on that directory.

01:16:23.405 --> 01:16:25.005
<v Speaker 2>So just the permissions?

01:16:25.485 --> 01:16:27.325
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's just it's just permissions. I'll give

01:16:27.325 --> 01:16:28.925
<v Speaker 0>you the you you got it.

01:16:29.965 --> 01:16:32.125
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. So it's not able to write.

01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:37.820
<v Speaker 2>Yep. Where's the little log.

01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:41.100
<v Speaker 2>Ah,

01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:43.420
<v Speaker 2>yep.

01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:46.060
<v Speaker 2>Yep. It should have w two actually do

01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:46.860
<v Speaker 2>something in there.

01:16:48.695 --> 01:16:50.695
<v Speaker 0>See, sometimes it's the simple things.

01:16:51.095 --> 01:16:53.175
<v Speaker 1>Yes. We always ignore the simple things.

01:17:10.410 --> 01:17:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Not yet.

01:17:14.425 --> 01:17:17.225
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I think restarting a easier.

01:17:17.225 --> 01:17:17.625
<v Speaker 2>Not

01:17:19.465 --> 01:17:20.185
<v Speaker 1>yet.

01:17:20.425 --> 01:17:22.185
<v Speaker 1>Yes. I got it.

01:17:22.585 --> 01:17:23.945
<v Speaker 1>Manager is up.

01:17:24.905 --> 01:17:26.905
<v Speaker 1>ABI server is

01:17:26.905 --> 01:17:27.225
<v Speaker 1>up.

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:31.960
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So because the log file can't be

01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:34.280
<v Speaker 0>created when the container starts, you'll actually need

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:37.320
<v Speaker 0>to rotate all the pods.

01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:40.855
<v Speaker 0>But you don't Let it say I gave

01:17:40.855 --> 01:17:41.974
<v Speaker 0>you a head. You I don't think you

01:17:41.974 --> 01:17:43.815
<v Speaker 0>need the logs to fix the other two

01:17:43.815 --> 01:17:44.454
<v Speaker 0>problems.

01:17:47.815 --> 01:17:48.775
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

01:17:48.775 --> 01:17:50.695
<v Speaker 2>So what are the two problems right now?

01:17:52.455 --> 01:17:54.935
<v Speaker 2>What is something said about

01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:05.070
<v Speaker 1>I need to check.

01:18:05.710 --> 01:18:07.309
<v Speaker 1>I need just to check

01:18:07.630 --> 01:18:08.510
<v Speaker 1>anything

01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:12.565
<v Speaker 1>with minus v. Let's say Yeah. That one

01:18:12.565 --> 01:18:14.965
<v Speaker 0>should have done in the first place. But

01:18:16.965 --> 01:18:17.844
<v Speaker 1>okay.

01:18:18.085 --> 01:18:20.645
<v Speaker 1>Accept. This looks fast, and there is no

01:18:21.605 --> 01:18:23.445
<v Speaker 1>one? Okay. Let's try with

01:18:23.925 --> 01:18:24.885
<v Speaker 1>11.

01:18:25.205 --> 01:18:26.725
<v Speaker 1>11 is really

01:18:27.610 --> 01:18:29.289
<v Speaker 1>verbose. Wow. Okay.

01:18:31.610 --> 01:18:33.610
<v Speaker 1>So account application.

01:18:33.610 --> 01:18:34.969
<v Speaker 1>Q1820.

01:18:35.290 --> 01:18:36.410
<v Speaker 2>5. 9 Seconds.

01:18:48.435 --> 01:18:49.315
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

01:18:50.035 --> 01:18:50.435
<v Speaker 1>So

01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:58.079
<v Speaker 1>and

01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:03.840
<v Speaker 2>so

01:19:04.719 --> 01:19:07.280
<v Speaker 2>Should we check at CD help?

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:10.640
<v Speaker 0>Have not touched the CD.

01:19:12.225 --> 01:19:13.265
<v Speaker 2>Okay. Thanks.

01:19:13.745 --> 01:19:15.344
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't tell you. I want to

01:19:21.345 --> 01:19:23.985
<v Speaker 1>get AI resources. Is it AI resources or

01:19:23.985 --> 01:19:26.145
<v Speaker 1>get AI resources? Yeah. AI resources.

01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:28.440
<v Speaker 2>That is also yep.

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:37.400
<v Speaker 1>I want to check these things.

01:19:39.085 --> 01:19:40.605
<v Speaker 1>What happens? It's taking, like

01:19:41.885 --> 01:19:43.485
<v Speaker 2>I think it's taking time.

01:19:44.045 --> 01:19:44.684
<v Speaker 2>So

01:19:45.085 --> 01:19:47.485
<v Speaker 2>the API server is, like, taking a long

01:19:47.485 --> 01:19:48.764
<v Speaker 2>time to respond.

01:19:48.925 --> 01:19:50.684
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons could have been the

01:19:50.684 --> 01:19:52.445
<v Speaker 2>limits, but the limits

01:19:52.764 --> 01:19:55.005
<v Speaker 2>what are the default settings in there seems

01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:55.539
<v Speaker 2>fine.

01:19:56.820 --> 01:19:57.460
<v Speaker 2>So

01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:00.739
<v Speaker 1>thank god.

01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:02.340
<v Speaker 2>That was something that

01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:03.940
<v Speaker 2>I think

01:20:04.659 --> 01:20:05.940
<v Speaker 2>Jim did. Right?

01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:07.460
<v Speaker 2>Changing the limits.

01:20:08.665 --> 01:20:10.185
<v Speaker 0>Which is, what the hell is with the

01:20:10.185 --> 01:20:11.304
<v Speaker 0>intermittent slowness?

01:20:13.705 --> 01:20:14.344
<v Speaker 1>Wait.

01:20:14.585 --> 01:20:15.224
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:20:16.505 --> 01:20:18.824
<v Speaker 1>No. No. I mean, slowness could be network,

01:20:18.824 --> 01:20:19.784
<v Speaker 1>could be disk.

01:20:20.505 --> 01:20:22.185
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing it's network here,

01:20:23.770 --> 01:20:25.209
<v Speaker 1>But I wanted to see

01:20:27.290 --> 01:20:28.809
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to see

01:20:29.610 --> 01:20:30.969
<v Speaker 1>now it should be cached. So it should

01:20:30.969 --> 01:20:33.130
<v Speaker 1>be faster. It's not faster while it's cached.

01:20:33.130 --> 01:20:33.530
<v Speaker 1>How come?

01:20:37.605 --> 01:20:40.324
<v Speaker 1>Or some or some governance, some checking. But

01:20:40.324 --> 01:20:42.405
<v Speaker 1>we check the mutating hooks. Correct?

01:20:42.645 --> 01:20:44.565
<v Speaker 1>We check the mutating. We check the validating.

01:20:44.645 --> 01:20:46.645
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't find any mutating or validating.

01:20:50.210 --> 01:20:51.650
<v Speaker 2>It might be that,

01:20:52.370 --> 01:20:53.650
<v Speaker 2>like, a static

01:20:53.730 --> 01:20:55.409
<v Speaker 2>one rather than

01:20:57.090 --> 01:20:59.809
<v Speaker 2>oh, but I don't think we see the

01:20:59.969 --> 01:21:01.969
<v Speaker 2>mutating or that we should that talks enabled

01:21:01.969 --> 01:21:03.650
<v Speaker 2>in the manifest, so I think we should

01:21:03.650 --> 01:21:04.210
<v Speaker 2>be okay.

01:21:04.755 --> 01:21:05.795
<v Speaker 2>By default,

01:21:05.955 --> 01:21:07.635
<v Speaker 2>are they enabled? I don't know which version

01:21:07.635 --> 01:21:08.515
<v Speaker 2>you called it.

01:21:13.875 --> 01:21:14.594
<v Speaker 2>Oh,

01:21:15.395 --> 01:21:17.635
<v Speaker 2>yeah. This is something about the HNC,

01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:18.790
<v Speaker 2>hierarchical

01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:19.910
<v Speaker 2>namespieces.

01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:23.350
<v Speaker 0>So the intermittent slowness the is the one

01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:25.830
<v Speaker 0>thing that's I didn't do with cube control.

01:21:30.075 --> 01:21:33.515
<v Speaker 1>You promised, man. One thing is and it's

01:21:33.515 --> 01:21:35.115
<v Speaker 0>not broken, and I finished just slowed you

01:21:35.115 --> 01:21:36.155
<v Speaker 0>down. That's it.

01:21:36.795 --> 01:21:38.555
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Okay. Okay. So you're still not I

01:21:38.555 --> 01:21:40.475
<v Speaker 0>mean, the real problem is the container creating.

01:21:40.475 --> 01:21:42.475
<v Speaker 0>The slowness was just for my amusement. That

01:21:42.475 --> 01:21:44.555
<v Speaker 0>was all. Let's see if there are drops.

01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:49.889
<v Speaker 1>So

01:21:54.210 --> 01:21:56.769
<v Speaker 1>nothing. Okay. So it didn't put it.

01:21:58.690 --> 01:22:00.530
<v Speaker 1>So there is an alias. Is this normal,

01:22:00.530 --> 01:22:01.090
<v Speaker 1>the alias?

01:22:02.815 --> 01:22:03.455
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

01:22:04.175 --> 01:22:04.975
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

01:22:07.455 --> 01:22:08.574
<v Speaker 0>The problem

01:22:08.975 --> 01:22:11.375
<v Speaker 0>when you said the verbose control get pods,

01:22:11.375 --> 01:22:12.735
<v Speaker 0>it was there.

01:22:13.935 --> 01:22:15.534
<v Speaker 1>The verbose, the 11.

01:22:16.015 --> 01:22:17.375
<v Speaker 0>I I was there with seven too.

01:22:18.219 --> 01:22:19.419
<v Speaker 0>It's just subtle.

01:22:19.820 --> 01:22:20.219
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:23.260
<v Speaker 2>Let's

01:22:24.139 --> 01:22:25.739
<v Speaker 2>yeah. Let's go one by one. Yeah.

01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:28.539
<v Speaker 1>Loaded from Etsy. Get

01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:30.300
<v Speaker 1>API version namespaces

01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:31.179
<v Speaker 1>default.

01:22:31.179 --> 01:22:32.835
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Request

01:22:32.835 --> 01:22:33.635
<v Speaker 1>header

01:22:33.795 --> 01:22:34.994
<v Speaker 1>looks fine.

01:22:36.275 --> 01:22:38.675
<v Speaker 1>User agent response status.

01:22:38.995 --> 01:22:39.395
<v Speaker 1>Now

01:22:39.875 --> 01:22:41.554
<v Speaker 1>setting didn't show us anything,

01:22:41.875 --> 01:22:44.755
<v Speaker 1>does it? It is Kubernetes admin comp. Yeah.

01:22:44.835 --> 01:22:46.435
<v Speaker 0>I wonder if the audience can see it.

01:22:47.850 --> 01:22:50.170
<v Speaker 1>The board, 6443.

01:22:50.330 --> 01:22:50.969
<v Speaker 1>This

01:22:52.889 --> 01:22:54.170
<v Speaker 1>is 6334.

01:22:54.170 --> 01:22:55.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh.

01:22:58.250 --> 01:23:00.090
<v Speaker 2>So did you set up, like, a IP

01:23:00.090 --> 01:23:00.810
<v Speaker 2>tables forward?

01:23:03.615 --> 01:23:04.255
<v Speaker 0>No.

01:23:06.015 --> 01:23:08.094
<v Speaker 0>It's a bit more sinister than that.

01:23:11.055 --> 01:23:12.815
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at the manifest and see which

01:23:12.815 --> 01:23:14.014
<v Speaker 2>part it's listening.

01:23:15.375 --> 01:23:15.855
<v Speaker 1>So

01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:19.260
<v Speaker 1>so do we have 643 or no?

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:23.740
<v Speaker 2>No. Let's look at the cube control manifest

01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:26.540
<v Speaker 2>sorry. The API server manifest and see which

01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:29.100
<v Speaker 2>part it's also listening. Because this is working.

01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:29.980
<v Speaker 2>Right? That's the

01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:32.255
<v Speaker 1>Yes. Yes. That's better now.

01:23:32.655 --> 01:23:34.655
<v Speaker 1>So okay. Now how did how did you

01:23:34.655 --> 01:23:35.295
<v Speaker 1>do it?

01:23:37.295 --> 01:23:38.815
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. That should be some kind of, like,

01:23:38.815 --> 01:23:41.055
<v Speaker 2>a proxy or something that does support code.

01:23:41.055 --> 01:23:42.735
<v Speaker 2>Right? Yeah. It's a it's a proxy. Run

01:23:42.735 --> 01:23:44.094
<v Speaker 0>p s a u x.

01:23:44.495 --> 01:23:47.070
<v Speaker 1>Throttling proxy. It's Toxiproxy

01:23:47.070 --> 01:23:48.750
<v Speaker 0>with a 40%

01:23:49.150 --> 01:23:49.630
<v Speaker 0>toxic

01:23:50.030 --> 01:23:53.310
<v Speaker 0>toxicology on delays of two and a half

01:23:53.310 --> 01:23:54.670
<v Speaker 0>seconds or longer.

01:23:55.230 --> 01:23:57.390
<v Speaker 0>What's the name of the proxy? It's called

01:23:57.390 --> 01:23:58.110
<v Speaker 0>SE Linux.

01:23:59.615 --> 01:24:01.614
<v Speaker 1>SE Linux, man. I renamed it.

01:24:02.015 --> 01:24:03.455
<v Speaker 1>Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

01:24:05.135 --> 01:24:06.575
<v Speaker 2>Actually, we would have caught it if you

01:24:06.575 --> 01:24:08.815
<v Speaker 2>listed the process and look because this is

01:24:08.815 --> 01:24:10.655
<v Speaker 2>a devian system and there is no way

01:24:10.655 --> 01:24:12.255
<v Speaker 2>SE Linux could be in here. Oh, yeah.

01:24:12.255 --> 01:24:13.615
<v Speaker 0>I thought it would be a nice hint,

01:24:13.615 --> 01:24:15.520
<v Speaker 0>but then you got to like, if you

01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:16.639
<v Speaker 0>don't look at the Yeah. You never let

01:24:16.639 --> 01:24:17.440
<v Speaker 2>it do. Yeah.

01:24:18.239 --> 01:24:19.040
<v Speaker 2>Alright.

01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:20.479
<v Speaker 0>There you go. You fixed that. Okay.

01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:24.400
<v Speaker 1>So this is one issue. Now what's the

01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:26.559
<v Speaker 1>other issue? The the containers.

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:29.039
<v Speaker 1>The containers are still

01:24:30.705 --> 01:24:32.784
<v Speaker 2>Yep. Loading. See. Okay.

01:24:38.065 --> 01:24:40.225
<v Speaker 1>So the con we have the containers still

01:24:40.225 --> 01:24:42.545
<v Speaker 1>creating, and this is create container error.

01:24:43.730 --> 01:24:44.929
<v Speaker 1>Kube scheduler.

01:24:45.090 --> 01:24:46.210
<v Speaker 1>Ah, scheduler.

01:24:47.010 --> 01:24:49.889
<v Speaker 1>And okay. So the scheduler has an issue,

01:24:51.090 --> 01:24:53.570
<v Speaker 1>the control manager also has an issue.

01:24:54.610 --> 01:24:55.329
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

01:24:55.489 --> 01:24:56.690
<v Speaker 1>Let's describe it.

01:24:57.545 --> 01:25:00.264
<v Speaker 0>So you can ignore the controller, ma'am. I

01:25:01.065 --> 01:25:02.665
<v Speaker 2>think we fixed that shit. You're right. Could

01:25:02.665 --> 01:25:03.304
<v Speaker 2>it just

01:25:05.864 --> 01:25:07.705
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Got it. But it's okay.

01:30:46.445 --> 01:30:48.445
<v Speaker 2>I have to go watch it. Wow.

01:30:48.605 --> 01:30:49.085
<v Speaker 2>And

01:30:51.725 --> 01:30:53.725
<v Speaker 2>if Lewis is watching, please don't do this

01:30:53.725 --> 01:30:55.005
<v Speaker 2>for the next CPF.

01:31:00.610 --> 01:31:02.449
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Cluster road binding.

01:31:04.370 --> 01:31:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Cluster road binding.

01:31:05.890 --> 01:31:09.010
<v Speaker 0>I have not modified any RPac policies.

01:31:09.969 --> 01:31:11.650
<v Speaker 1>Any roles. Oh, you haven't? No. This must

01:31:11.650 --> 01:31:14.450
<v Speaker 2>be, like, a static admission controller that must

01:31:14.450 --> 01:31:15.489
<v Speaker 2>be set up in the

01:31:16.015 --> 01:31:17.054
<v Speaker 2>manifest.

01:31:18.495 --> 01:31:20.735
<v Speaker 1>Just a second. Just a second. Just a

01:31:20.735 --> 01:31:22.335
<v Speaker 1>second. Yeah. So the error

01:31:23.295 --> 01:31:26.015
<v Speaker 1>so the error is saying error from server

01:31:26.015 --> 01:31:29.055
<v Speaker 1>forbidden limit ranges case is forbidden. Admission control

01:31:29.055 --> 01:31:30.895
<v Speaker 1>is denying. It is an admission control.

01:31:32.010 --> 01:31:34.889
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is that his that the

01:31:34.889 --> 01:31:36.169
<v Speaker 1>ABI server,

01:31:38.329 --> 01:31:40.169
<v Speaker 1>if we look at admission,

01:31:43.770 --> 01:31:45.369
<v Speaker 1>I have only node restrictions.

01:31:47.665 --> 01:31:49.985
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Node restriction is the cube plate to

01:31:49.985 --> 01:31:51.985
<v Speaker 1>cube ABI things. Correct?

01:31:52.864 --> 01:31:53.665
<v Speaker 2>Isn't

01:31:53.665 --> 01:31:56.065
<v Speaker 2>isn't the static admission part of the cube

01:31:56.065 --> 01:31:56.864
<v Speaker 2>plate config?

01:31:57.905 --> 01:32:00.304
<v Speaker 1>No. It's 20. It's 24 I don't know.

01:32:00.304 --> 01:32:00.385
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:32:01.530 --> 01:32:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I am not really I have really

01:32:03.130 --> 01:32:03.929
<v Speaker 2>old questions.

01:32:04.409 --> 01:32:07.209
<v Speaker 2>Oh, any plug mission plug ins always deny.

01:32:07.690 --> 01:32:09.449
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So I figured if I just one

01:32:09.449 --> 01:32:10.650
<v Speaker 0>of the kills well, not cool. One of

01:32:10.650 --> 01:32:12.570
<v Speaker 0>the annoying things with the API server is

01:32:12.570 --> 01:32:15.195
<v Speaker 0>you can do admission these plugins separately. And

01:32:15.195 --> 01:32:16.554
<v Speaker 0>I figured if I just put it below

01:32:16.554 --> 01:32:18.155
<v Speaker 0>the bottom of the screen, you wouldn't notice

01:32:18.155 --> 01:32:19.114
<v Speaker 0>the second one.

01:32:19.514 --> 01:32:20.235
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

01:32:20.395 --> 01:32:21.434
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

01:32:22.795 --> 01:32:24.235
<v Speaker 1>Because I checked

01:32:24.315 --> 01:32:26.395
<v Speaker 1>that first time we opened it, I checked.

01:32:28.740 --> 01:32:30.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Let's give it a minute.

01:32:34.820 --> 01:32:37.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Still not up. Oh, no. It's restarting.

01:32:37.540 --> 01:32:38.099
<v Speaker 2>Yep.

01:32:41.860 --> 01:32:42.659
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

01:32:42.820 --> 01:32:43.700
<v Speaker 1>Hey. It's up.

01:32:44.945 --> 01:32:46.945
<v Speaker 1>Yay. That's get the bots.

01:32:50.465 --> 01:32:51.905
<v Speaker 1>Let's delete it. I think we should probably

01:32:51.905 --> 01:32:53.105
<v Speaker 2>just delete. Yep.

01:32:53.665 --> 01:32:54.145
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

01:32:58.039 --> 01:33:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Oops. Too many olds. Too many else in

01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:00.919
<v Speaker 1>old.

01:33:01.239 --> 01:33:02.039
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Do we have another surprise, or that's it?

01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:07.719
<v Speaker 0>No. No. That was it. You got them

01:33:07.719 --> 01:33:09.320
<v Speaker 0>all. That's a nice one. I love that

01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:10.199
<v Speaker 1>one. Oh.

01:33:10.795 --> 01:33:13.434
<v Speaker 1>Because it's cascading. You know? But it's strange.

01:33:13.434 --> 01:33:15.994
<v Speaker 2>It's not always been so it only applies

01:33:15.994 --> 01:33:18.394
<v Speaker 2>to oh, it only applies to create or

01:33:18.394 --> 01:33:21.594
<v Speaker 2>update operations. Yep. Because all gets Yeah. So

01:33:21.594 --> 01:33:23.755
<v Speaker 0>the limit range actually my idea first.

01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:28.040
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead. Yeah. The the limit range is

01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:30.280
<v Speaker 0>just one of those resources. I don't think

01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:32.360
<v Speaker 0>a lot of people know. I think Walid

01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:34.440
<v Speaker 0>was very fortunate to pick that up. I'm

01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:35.800
<v Speaker 0>not sure everyone else would have.

01:33:36.199 --> 01:33:37.479
<v Speaker 1>What do mean unfortunate?

01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:39.375
<v Speaker 0>No. No. I think you were I think

01:33:39.375 --> 01:33:41.055
<v Speaker 0>you're experienced saying there that you knew a

01:33:41.055 --> 01:33:42.815
<v Speaker 0>limit range was a thing. Like, I think

01:33:42.815 --> 01:33:44.735
<v Speaker 0>many people could have had no idea.

01:33:45.375 --> 01:33:48.175
<v Speaker 0>The intermittent It's that's what open shift exam,

01:33:48.175 --> 01:33:48.735
<v Speaker 2>actually.

01:33:48.975 --> 01:33:50.655
<v Speaker 2>The limit range is right. It's actually in

01:33:50.655 --> 01:33:52.540
<v Speaker 2>the syllabus of the open shift exam. So

01:33:52.540 --> 01:33:54.140
<v Speaker 2>I have played with it, but it does

01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:56.620
<v Speaker 2>as a curriculum, then I I never did

01:33:56.620 --> 01:33:58.700
<v Speaker 2>it in any actual systems or anything. It's

01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:00.620
<v Speaker 2>anything, but I think no one really uses

01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:01.180
<v Speaker 2>it.

01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:03.500
<v Speaker 0>You got a a well done from Deshaun

01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:04.060
<v Speaker 0>there.

01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:06.095
<v Speaker 0>So yeah. There was And when I was

01:34:06.095 --> 01:34:08.655
<v Speaker 2>actually more breaking the cluster, one of my

01:34:08.655 --> 01:34:10.575
<v Speaker 2>ideas was when you do a GET, I

01:34:10.575 --> 01:34:12.015
<v Speaker 2>was thinking, like, of doing a GET your

01:34:12.015 --> 01:34:14.415
<v Speaker 2>dating report, but I didn't realize that we

01:34:14.415 --> 01:34:16.255
<v Speaker 2>couldn't do a GET on the rotating report.

01:34:16.255 --> 01:34:18.175
<v Speaker 2>I was actually, like, showing you the right

01:34:18.175 --> 01:34:20.335
<v Speaker 2>image, but it was actually running around image.

01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:23.200
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I mean, I mean yeah.

01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:27.600
<v Speaker 0>Let me go with it. One

01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:30.640
<v Speaker 1>thing that I'm happy today is that we

01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:32.560
<v Speaker 1>made David happy as Lewis said.

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:33.120
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

01:34:34.485 --> 01:34:37.045
<v Speaker 1>He has been miserable with this cluster thing,

01:34:37.045 --> 01:34:39.205
<v Speaker 1>but now I think today he's happy.

01:34:39.765 --> 01:34:41.205
<v Speaker 0>You know what? I I think we all

01:34:41.205 --> 01:34:42.645
<v Speaker 0>did really well. I think it's three broken

01:34:42.645 --> 01:34:45.445
<v Speaker 0>clusters, all broken slightly differently. We all stuck

01:34:45.445 --> 01:34:46.005
<v Speaker 0>mostly

01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:48.820
<v Speaker 0>to the cube control plane, which is nice.

01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:50.420
<v Speaker 0>We got to explore a bit more depth.

01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:51.619
<v Speaker 0>I think that was a good job all

01:34:51.619 --> 01:34:52.099
<v Speaker 0>around.

01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:54.739
<v Speaker 2>And we didn't really

01:34:54.900 --> 01:34:56.980
<v Speaker 2>kind of finish it in time too, so

01:34:56.980 --> 01:34:57.780
<v Speaker 2>it's actually good.

01:34:58.435 --> 01:35:00.275
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. We're only a little bit over,

01:35:00.515 --> 01:35:01.875
<v Speaker 0>so all good for me. Yeah. A little

01:35:01.875 --> 01:35:03.874
<v Speaker 2>bit over. And if it has not been

01:35:03.955 --> 01:35:05.554
<v Speaker 2>all the stuff I did, I think, like,

01:35:05.554 --> 01:35:06.835
<v Speaker 2>if I just stick with

01:35:07.235 --> 01:35:09.475
<v Speaker 2>probably, like, remote IP tables on the bot

01:35:09.475 --> 01:35:11.074
<v Speaker 2>for, we would have probably finished it in

01:35:11.074 --> 01:35:11.235
<v Speaker 2>time.

01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:15.780
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Awesome. Well, thank you both for joining

01:35:15.780 --> 01:35:18.260
<v Speaker 0>me for part one of this KubeCon special.

01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:20.660
<v Speaker 0>There's two more parts. We've got Thomas Stromberg

01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:22.660
<v Speaker 0>and Chris Nova joining me this evening. And

<v Speaker 0>tomorrow, we have Gifei and Chris Carter.

01:35:26.145 --> 01:35:28.385
