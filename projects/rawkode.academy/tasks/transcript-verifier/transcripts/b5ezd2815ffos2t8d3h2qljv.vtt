00:01:18.164 --> 00:01:21.365
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Welcome back to the Rawkode Academy.

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:22.670
<v Speaker 0>Today,

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.310
<v Speaker 0>have another episode of Clustered.

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:26.750
<v Speaker 0>Woo hoo.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.390
<v Speaker 0>Feel free to say hello in the comment

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.950
<v Speaker 0>section. I'll pop them up on the screen.

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.030
<v Speaker 0>My name is David Flanagan, but I go

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.390
<v Speaker 0>by the handle Rawkode.

00:01:35.785 --> 00:01:38.505
<v Speaker 0>And today we have a solo edition of

00:01:38.505 --> 00:01:40.345
<v Speaker 0>clusters. So we've got two great guests with

00:01:40.345 --> 00:01:42.505
<v Speaker 0>us with two broken clusters that we will

00:01:42.505 --> 00:01:43.465
<v Speaker 0>attempt to fix.

00:01:43.865 --> 00:01:46.505
<v Speaker 0>Remember, it doesn't matter how our guests fix

00:01:46.505 --> 00:01:48.104
<v Speaker 0>the clusters, all you need to do is

00:01:48.104 --> 00:01:49.785
<v Speaker 0>get that v two image running,

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.580
<v Speaker 0>which I've made some fixes this week. I

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.500
<v Speaker 0>haven't added logging, but I forgot.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.180
<v Speaker 0>But I hopefully have

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.500
<v Speaker 0>introduced enough cache busting

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.460
<v Speaker 0>so that we'll actually see v two without

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.220
<v Speaker 0>10,000 refreshes

00:02:02.865 --> 00:02:04.384
<v Speaker 0>or at least fingers crossed.

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:07.185
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Before we get started, there's a little

00:02:07.185 --> 00:02:09.264
<v Speaker 0>bit of housekeeping where I wanna thank our

00:02:09.264 --> 00:02:12.224
<v Speaker 0>sponsors. Teleport have been sponsoring Custard for a

00:02:12.224 --> 00:02:13.745
<v Speaker 0>very long time now, and we've been using

00:02:13.745 --> 00:02:16.140
<v Speaker 0>Teleport since the very first episode. You see

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.140
<v Speaker 0>it in action every single week. It is

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.540
<v Speaker 0>an amazing tool that allows you to commoditize

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.580
<v Speaker 0>and secure

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.780
<v Speaker 0>the access to your Linux machines, Kubernetes clusters,

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.260
<v Speaker 0>applications

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.100
<v Speaker 0>and databases.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.075
<v Speaker 0>So you'll see us using it, Go check

00:02:29.075 --> 00:02:32.115
<v Speaker 0>it out by visiting rokode.live/teleport.

00:02:32.995 --> 00:02:34.915
<v Speaker 0>And also thank you to Equinix Metal. They

00:02:34.915 --> 00:02:37.235
<v Speaker 0>provide all of the hardware. We run clustered

00:02:37.235 --> 00:02:39.875
<v Speaker 0>on bare metal machines with, I think, like

00:02:39.875 --> 00:02:42.995
<v Speaker 0>32 cores and 60, maybe even a hundred

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.940
<v Speaker 0>gig of RAM. I can't remember. They're pretty

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.940
<v Speaker 0>big beefy boxes. Why?

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.860
<v Speaker 0>Well, because it makes it more fun. So

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.180
<v Speaker 0>thank you to EquinixMetal for that as well.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.420
<v Speaker 0>Now I'm gonna pop over and introduce our

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.100
<v Speaker 0>guests, and then we'll get the comments going,

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.100
<v Speaker 0>and then we'll fix some broken clusters.

00:02:59.135 --> 00:03:02.174
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Welcome, guest. Today, I am joined by

00:03:02.174 --> 00:03:03.295
<v Speaker 0>Rawkode and.

00:03:04.174 --> 00:03:05.535
<v Speaker 0>Hi there. How are you both?

00:03:06.655 --> 00:03:07.375
<v Speaker 0>Hello.

00:03:08.254 --> 00:03:08.815
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.709
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I don't know if he's nervous or

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.550
<v Speaker 0>excited or a little bit of both,

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.190
<v Speaker 0>but let's start with some introductions

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.030
<v Speaker 0>there. Barco, why don't you go first? Tell

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.230
<v Speaker 0>us who you are, and then we'll move

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.790
<v Speaker 0>over.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.069
<v Speaker 1>Hi. My name is Barco.

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:24.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm currently working

00:03:24.975 --> 00:03:28.095
<v Speaker 1>as a software engineer at RenderCloud.

00:03:28.895 --> 00:03:31.775
<v Speaker 1>Big fan of the cluster series. I think

00:03:31.775 --> 00:03:34.575
<v Speaker 1>it's a great resource for people learning Kubernetes.

00:03:35.055 --> 00:03:37.935
<v Speaker 1>So I'm happy and humbled to be here

00:03:37.935 --> 00:03:39.855
<v Speaker 1>and try and fix some clusters.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.849
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. You also participate in officers with me,

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.250
<v Speaker 0>sharing more Kubernetes knowledge with everyone. So thank

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.450
<v Speaker 0>you for that as well.

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:49.450
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.410
<v Speaker 0>Bojan?

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Hello. Nice

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.409
<v Speaker 1>to meet you. And,

00:03:55.405 --> 00:03:57.165
<v Speaker 1>yeah, I'm a software engineer

00:03:57.325 --> 00:03:59.245
<v Speaker 1>at Digital Ocean.

00:03:59.245 --> 00:04:02.285
<v Speaker 1>Is my identical twin brother, so it's a

00:04:02.285 --> 00:04:03.325
<v Speaker 1>quintessential

00:04:03.405 --> 00:04:05.885
<v Speaker 1>twin thing that we're working at the computing

00:04:05.885 --> 00:04:06.845
<v Speaker 1>companies, I guess.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:08.410
<v Speaker 1>And

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.370
<v Speaker 1>not really super familiar with this show. I've

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.010
<v Speaker 1>only watched it once when participated

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.130
<v Speaker 1>once before.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.970
<v Speaker 1>And but, yeah, looking forward to, I guess,

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.850
<v Speaker 1>trying to fix what he did.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.490
<v Speaker 1>And

00:04:22.935 --> 00:04:25.975
<v Speaker 1>yeah. Maybe a little bit of expectation setting.

00:04:25.975 --> 00:04:28.615
<v Speaker 1>I think mostly what I do is

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:29.815
<v Speaker 1>interacting

00:04:29.815 --> 00:04:31.895
<v Speaker 1>with Kubernetes programmatically.

00:04:32.855 --> 00:04:35.815
<v Speaker 1>So, you know, manually configuring control plane is

00:04:35.815 --> 00:04:38.535
<v Speaker 1>not something I do on a regular basis.

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.759
<v Speaker 1>So maybe I don't have the operational muscle

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:42.560
<v Speaker 1>memory

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.600
<v Speaker 1>for

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.880
<v Speaker 1>everything involved there. But, yeah, looking forward to

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.120
<v Speaker 1>learning maybe something new myself as well.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.039
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Well, thank you very much for sharing.

00:04:53.645 --> 00:04:55.885
<v Speaker 0>This is the first ever identical twins we've

00:04:55.885 --> 00:04:57.645
<v Speaker 0>had on custard, so that's pretty cool.

00:04:58.045 --> 00:05:00.285
<v Speaker 0>And we're gonna see if the twin tuition.

00:05:00.285 --> 00:05:02.445
<v Speaker 0>Is that a thing? Right? Twin tuition? You

00:05:02.445 --> 00:05:04.685
<v Speaker 0>both can just read each other's mind now?

00:05:05.325 --> 00:05:07.325
<v Speaker 1>I think we have found that not to

00:05:07.325 --> 00:05:10.010
<v Speaker 1>be true, I think. Would you agree, Rawkode?

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:12.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:14.330
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.810
<v Speaker 0>Well, we're gonna find out if you could

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.210
<v Speaker 0>protect each other's breaks. So I'm gonna pop

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.850
<v Speaker 0>open

00:05:20.634 --> 00:05:23.354
<v Speaker 0>my screen share here. I'm gonna pause the

00:05:23.354 --> 00:05:25.034
<v Speaker 0>timer just because we're not quite ready. I'm

00:05:25.034 --> 00:05:26.634
<v Speaker 0>not even decided who's going first.

00:05:26.955 --> 00:05:29.675
<v Speaker 0>We have our teleport server here. Does do

00:05:29.675 --> 00:05:31.275
<v Speaker 0>either of you have a preference for going

00:05:31.275 --> 00:05:34.715
<v Speaker 0>first? Yeah. Barcode, you suggested. Right? So Yeah.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.670
<v Speaker 0>Let's pop open

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.110
<v Speaker 0>control plan.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.270
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna start the timer.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay. If you could please join the session.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.510
<v Speaker 0>Just type echo hello, anything to let us

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.284
<v Speaker 0>know that you're there. Start setting up your

00:05:50.284 --> 00:05:52.285
<v Speaker 0>KubeConfig, and we'll take it from there.

00:05:54.044 --> 00:05:56.844
<v Speaker 1>You guys see that? We do indeed. Good

00:05:56.844 --> 00:05:57.725
<v Speaker 1>luck. Awesome.

00:05:58.764 --> 00:05:59.884
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:06:01.405 --> 00:06:04.525
<v Speaker 1>So first thing I'm gonna do is

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.360
<v Speaker 1>get my completion.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.400
<v Speaker 0>No. Even setting up the KubeConfig first. It's

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.000
<v Speaker 0>just like I want my auto complete. Just

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:14.000
<v Speaker 1>Mhmm.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:06:19.455 --> 00:06:21.135
<v Speaker 1>Is that okay? Yep.

00:06:22.015 --> 00:06:22.975
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:06:23.455 --> 00:06:25.375
<v Speaker 1>And then we will

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.069
<v Speaker 1>So first thing I'm gonna do is just

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:46.550
<v Speaker 1>check if we have nodes

00:06:44.395 --> 00:06:45.115
<v Speaker 1>or

00:06:45.675 --> 00:06:46.875
<v Speaker 1>namespaces,

00:06:47.514 --> 00:06:50.074
<v Speaker 1>and things seem to be I mean, we're

00:06:50.074 --> 00:06:51.035
<v Speaker 1>connecting

00:06:51.195 --> 00:06:53.675
<v Speaker 1>to the cluster. Yeah. You've got a healthy

00:06:53.675 --> 00:06:54.715
<v Speaker 0>control plan.

00:06:56.074 --> 00:06:56.794
<v Speaker 0>A good start.

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.860
<v Speaker 1>So we don't have our application running.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.260
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if we have

00:07:16.044 --> 00:07:18.044
<v Speaker 1>I mean, things seem to be okay.

00:07:19.164 --> 00:07:21.085
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So I will

00:07:22.604 --> 00:07:24.285
<v Speaker 1>so here we have

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.130
<v Speaker 1>so we have invalid

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:29.090
<v Speaker 1>image

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:29.970
<v Speaker 1>name.

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:30.770
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.810
<v Speaker 1>So I'm guessing he

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.530
<v Speaker 1>so it just to explain things, this is

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:39.330
<v Speaker 1>a deployment.

00:07:41.675 --> 00:07:43.995
<v Speaker 1>So we can see that there's a deployment.

00:07:43.995 --> 00:07:45.355
<v Speaker 1>So we'll take

00:07:48.795 --> 00:07:50.315
<v Speaker 1>a so we'll take a

00:07:52.395 --> 00:07:54.795
<v Speaker 1>look at this deployment.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.199
<v Speaker 1>And take a look at if he changed

00:08:04.199 --> 00:08:05.000
<v Speaker 1>the image.

00:08:11.465 --> 00:08:12.505
<v Speaker 1>Is that

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:16.105
<v Speaker 1>I I feel like that's probably not correct.

00:08:16.105 --> 00:08:17.785
<v Speaker 1>Is that supposed to be the right?

00:08:18.025 --> 00:08:20.425
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So it has been updated to the

00:08:20.425 --> 00:08:23.225
<v Speaker 0>Rawkode Academy GitHub organization now rather than my

00:08:23.225 --> 00:08:25.625
<v Speaker 0>Rawkode username. So that does look

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.350
<v Speaker 0>alright. Yeah. That looks fine.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:30.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Interesting.

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:36.990
<v Speaker 0>It passes the a test, at least. I'm

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.350
<v Speaker 0>not telling you it's correct, but I'm gonna

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:39.950
<v Speaker 0>say that it looks correct.

00:08:45.645 --> 00:08:46.285
<v Speaker 0>So

00:08:46.525 --> 00:08:49.165
<v Speaker 0>I don't think we've seen invalid image name

00:08:49.165 --> 00:08:50.605
<v Speaker 0>before Yeah. On cluster.

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:55.779
<v Speaker 1>That's not a, like,

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.180
<v Speaker 1>image pulling error. So I'm trying to think

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.740
<v Speaker 1>what does that quite mean.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.779
<v Speaker 0>I'm also curious. Are you on a vertical

00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:06.740
<v Speaker 0>screen by any chance?

00:09:09.235 --> 00:09:11.075
<v Speaker 0>No. No. No. Or just a very large

00:09:11.075 --> 00:09:14.035
<v Speaker 0>screen? Like, your screen is massive compared to

00:09:14.035 --> 00:09:14.595
<v Speaker 0>mine.

00:09:15.795 --> 00:09:18.274
<v Speaker 0>Alright. It doesn't matter. I'm I'm scrolling frantically

00:09:18.274 --> 00:09:19.395
<v Speaker 0>to keep up. But

00:09:20.355 --> 00:09:21.875
<v Speaker 1>there anything I can do here to fix

00:09:21.875 --> 00:09:23.840
<v Speaker 1>it? No. We're we're we're all good. It's

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.120
<v Speaker 0>all good. Don't worry about it, mate.

00:09:35.195 --> 00:09:35.835
<v Speaker 0>So

00:09:36.075 --> 00:09:38.395
<v Speaker 0>just because I'm I'm curious about what we're

00:09:38.395 --> 00:09:40.155
<v Speaker 0>seeing. Right? Is that we have two clustered

00:09:40.155 --> 00:09:41.995
<v Speaker 0>replica sets here or at least two pods

00:09:41.995 --> 00:09:43.595
<v Speaker 0>with different replica IDs.

00:09:44.075 --> 00:09:46.075
<v Speaker 0>So it's as if the image has been

00:09:46.075 --> 00:09:46.555
<v Speaker 0>updated.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.520
<v Speaker 0>It's now being considered invalid

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.360
<v Speaker 0>by the kubelet.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.920
<v Speaker 0>But when you go to the deployment spec,

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.320
<v Speaker 0>it it doesn't appear to have been modified.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.880
<v Speaker 1>Right. And the image pull policy is always

00:10:04.645 --> 00:10:05.605
<v Speaker 1>Let's

00:10:07.285 --> 00:10:08.485
<v Speaker 1>take out

00:10:08.805 --> 00:10:10.165
<v Speaker 1>the sledgehammer

00:10:10.165 --> 00:10:11.045
<v Speaker 1>already.

00:10:12.965 --> 00:10:13.765
<v Speaker 0>Oh, there's lots.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.260
<v Speaker 0>The sledgehammer's coming out.

00:10:37.264 --> 00:10:39.105
<v Speaker 0>So you're gonna delete all the replica sets

00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:42.305
<v Speaker 0>and force the deployment to recreate. I'm

00:10:42.305 --> 00:10:44.384
<v Speaker 1>not going to be trying to figure out

00:10:44.384 --> 00:10:47.400
<v Speaker 1>if that's a cause of the issue

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:48.920
<v Speaker 1>or not.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.120
<v Speaker 1>What's the l equals clustered.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure if dash dash label

00:10:57.415 --> 00:10:59.975
<v Speaker 0>Oh. Work. But dash l one l. Well,

00:10:59.975 --> 00:11:00.935
<v Speaker 0>one dash.

00:11:03.575 --> 00:11:05.335
<v Speaker 0>And a d on custard.

00:11:06.135 --> 00:11:07.655
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

00:11:07.895 --> 00:11:09.655
<v Speaker 0>Sorry. It's the it's the rule of typing

00:11:09.655 --> 00:11:10.855
<v Speaker 0>when people are watching. Right?

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:23.710
<v Speaker 1>Wow. Image name.

00:11:24.695 --> 00:11:25.335
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:11:28.695 --> 00:11:30.215
<v Speaker 1>I mean, this is Oh, yeah. I was

00:11:30.215 --> 00:11:31.575
<v Speaker 0>laughing at it. Is there idea.

00:11:37.379 --> 00:11:39.540
<v Speaker 0>Why don't we just describe the pod? Is

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.620
<v Speaker 0>there maybe there's something else in the event?

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:11:49.765 --> 00:11:52.005
<v Speaker 0>Failed to apply default image

00:11:52.005 --> 00:11:52.885
<v Speaker 0>tag.

00:11:55.525 --> 00:11:59.045
<v Speaker 1>I mean, this sounds something like container d.

00:11:59.045 --> 00:12:02.725
<v Speaker 1>Like, something's different. Like, I almost feel like

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:04.750
<v Speaker 1>something's

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.110
<v Speaker 1>off there.

00:12:06.589 --> 00:12:08.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. I have never seen this

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:09.310
<v Speaker 1>here before,

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:13.390
<v Speaker 1>but invalid reference format. Right? Like, that

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:15.710
<v Speaker 1>for some reason,

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:16.750
<v Speaker 1>my inclination

00:12:17.135 --> 00:12:20.575
<v Speaker 1>is saying that it's not Kubernetes.

00:12:24.815 --> 00:12:27.055
<v Speaker 1>What what were you what do you think?

00:12:28.415 --> 00:12:30.175
<v Speaker 0>So it's fact field.

00:12:30.415 --> 00:12:30.895
<v Speaker 0>I mean,

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:34.370
<v Speaker 0>it passes

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.129
<v Speaker 0>the eye test, and I've been burned by

00:12:36.129 --> 00:12:37.889
<v Speaker 0>this before on clustered.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:38.769
<v Speaker 0>I'm

00:12:39.569 --> 00:12:41.170
<v Speaker 0>half tempted

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:43.889
<v Speaker 0>to guess that there's maybe a Unicode character

00:12:43.889 --> 00:12:44.930
<v Speaker 0>in that image name.

00:12:49.904 --> 00:12:50.865
<v Speaker 0>It's

00:12:50.865 --> 00:12:53.105
<v Speaker 0>kinda where my my brain that has been

00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:55.425
<v Speaker 0>hurt in the past by breakers is going

00:12:55.425 --> 00:12:56.065
<v Speaker 0>to right now.

00:12:58.130 --> 00:12:59.170
<v Speaker 0>So I mean,

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.410
<v Speaker 0>what I would do would be to edit

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:03.730
<v Speaker 0>the deployment again and retype that whole image

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:04.610
<v Speaker 0>name from scratch.

00:13:17.335 --> 00:13:19.815
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Yeah. Let's do that.

00:13:20.135 --> 00:13:21.815
<v Speaker 0>I mean, it's just a guess. Like, I

00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:24.535
<v Speaker 0>I'm wrong more often than I'm right. So

00:13:24.535 --> 00:13:25.575
<v Speaker 0>it's

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:27.940
<v Speaker 0>your call.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.100
<v Speaker 0>Well, Robert Cable said, is that even a

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.740
<v Speaker 0>valid URL? It certainly looks valid,

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:38.900
<v Speaker 0>and

00:13:39.795 --> 00:13:40.755
<v Speaker 0>Russell

00:13:40.835 --> 00:13:43.555
<v Speaker 0>is saying that the Unicorn is against the

00:13:43.555 --> 00:13:46.915
<v Speaker 0>rules. Only unofficially. It's never become an

00:13:46.915 --> 00:13:47.714
<v Speaker 0>official rule.

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:55.490
<v Speaker 0>Like like the no e b p f

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:57.009
<v Speaker 0>rule. Like, you can use e b p

00:13:57.009 --> 00:13:59.570
<v Speaker 0>f. It's not not a real rule. Why

00:14:01.889 --> 00:14:03.730
<v Speaker 1>did that jump over?

00:14:04.209 --> 00:14:06.850
<v Speaker 0>Sometimes when does that, it's particularly annoying.

00:14:09.035 --> 00:14:11.595
<v Speaker 0>Abhishek is saying why people talk very low

00:14:11.595 --> 00:14:12.715
<v Speaker 0>about DevOps.

00:14:13.595 --> 00:14:15.275
<v Speaker 0>I can talk louder if that's what you

00:14:15.275 --> 00:14:17.035
<v Speaker 0>mean. I'm not sure. Hey.

00:14:19.435 --> 00:14:19.915
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:22.620
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:24.300
<v Speaker 0>Does it still stay invalid?

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Well, I updated it to v two because

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.339
<v Speaker 1>that's the goal, and we type the image

00:14:29.339 --> 00:14:32.139
<v Speaker 1>names. So I don't know. I mean, things

00:14:32.139 --> 00:14:33.740
<v Speaker 1>seem to be working. So

00:14:34.254 --> 00:14:36.495
<v Speaker 1>can we open the page and see if

00:14:36.495 --> 00:14:38.894
<v Speaker 1>the I suspect we have more things to

00:14:38.894 --> 00:14:39.774
<v Speaker 1>fix. But

00:14:40.975 --> 00:14:42.255
<v Speaker 0>Sure. Hopefully

00:14:43.214 --> 00:14:45.615
<v Speaker 1>hopefully, my breaks are correct.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:49.980
<v Speaker 0>Yes. We have a database connection time out.

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.540
<v Speaker 1>So You want I was using the only

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.620
<v Speaker 1>code in there. If that if that was

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.300
<v Speaker 1>against the rules, my apologies. I didn't know.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.060
<v Speaker 1>But It's it's not against the rule. It's

00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.580
<v Speaker 0>an unofficial rule because

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.660
<v Speaker 0>it hurt me so much last time. I

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:02.459
<v Speaker 0>literally spent

00:15:02.835 --> 00:15:04.195
<v Speaker 0>thirty or forty minutes

00:15:04.595 --> 00:15:06.435
<v Speaker 0>pulling my hair out. I have no idea.

00:15:06.435 --> 00:15:08.195
<v Speaker 0>So it's it's not against the rules. You

00:15:08.195 --> 00:15:09.715
<v Speaker 0>can use it. Or something.

00:15:10.355 --> 00:15:12.115
<v Speaker 0>Was it the k? Because I thought the

00:15:12.115 --> 00:15:14.195
<v Speaker 0>k looked It was it was the c.

00:15:14.195 --> 00:15:16.675
<v Speaker 1>The c was the serialic c or the

00:15:16.675 --> 00:15:19.150
<v Speaker 1>serialic s, I guess. Yeah. So It was

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:20.910
<v Speaker 0>the c last time as well. So that's

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:22.990
<v Speaker 0>just that hurt even more. But there we

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:23.470
<v Speaker 0>go.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.190
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So we've got a v two,

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.830
<v Speaker 0>but we cannot reach the database.

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:31.950
<v Speaker 1>So the issue is now your application needs

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:33.950
<v Speaker 1>to connect to our database.

00:15:34.254 --> 00:15:37.375
<v Speaker 1>And if I recall correctly, that's hard coded

00:15:37.375 --> 00:15:40.014
<v Speaker 1>in the application. Correct? It is hard coded,

00:15:40.014 --> 00:15:41.535
<v Speaker 0>yep, as Postgres.

00:15:42.415 --> 00:15:44.574
<v Speaker 1>Right. Okay. So let's

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.940
<v Speaker 1>that stateful set.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:54.019
<v Speaker 0>Yep. That stateful set called PostgresQL

00:15:54.019 --> 00:15:55.620
<v Speaker 0>just to make it more annoying.

00:15:57.379 --> 00:15:59.300
<v Speaker 0>But the service is Postgres. I should fix

00:15:59.300 --> 00:15:59.699
<v Speaker 0>that too.

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:21.990
<v Speaker 0>So you're going straight into the service definition.

00:16:26.295 --> 00:16:29.014
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I just want to see if there

00:16:29.014 --> 00:16:31.415
<v Speaker 1>there was something off here because

00:16:31.575 --> 00:16:33.975
<v Speaker 1>last time I was in Cluster, they put

00:16:34.695 --> 00:16:37.014
<v Speaker 1>a startup probe to change the password. So

00:16:37.014 --> 00:16:39.095
<v Speaker 1>I thought maybe he was doing the same

00:16:39.095 --> 00:16:39.975
<v Speaker 1>thing back to me.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.640
<v Speaker 1>But there doesn't seem to be a startup

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.240
<v Speaker 1>probe that's

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.600
<v Speaker 1>that's doing anything.

00:16:55.275 --> 00:16:57.755
<v Speaker 1>Is that correct? Redness probe?

00:16:59.115 --> 00:17:00.315
<v Speaker 0>That

00:17:00.315 --> 00:17:01.755
<v Speaker 0>looks alright to me.

00:17:02.315 --> 00:17:04.954
<v Speaker 0>If that were failing, the pods would not

00:17:04.954 --> 00:17:06.635
<v Speaker 0>be healthy. Right. And I think the pod

00:17:06.635 --> 00:17:07.595
<v Speaker 0>was healthy.

00:17:07.835 --> 00:17:08.875
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Correct. Okay.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.020
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just going to take a look

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.220
<v Speaker 1>at our

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:24.220
<v Speaker 1>pods and services

00:17:25.155 --> 00:17:26.355
<v Speaker 1>and endpoints.

00:17:30.355 --> 00:17:31.554
<v Speaker 0>It looks good.

00:17:35.315 --> 00:17:36.035
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:17:37.235 --> 00:17:40.030
<v Speaker 0>Got a service. Got an IP address. We've

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:41.149
<v Speaker 0>got an endpoint.

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:50.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:17:56.955 --> 00:17:58.795
<v Speaker 1>Did you say we have logging now or

00:17:58.795 --> 00:18:01.515
<v Speaker 1>something? No. I didn't add logging.

00:18:01.675 --> 00:18:04.315
<v Speaker 0>Oh. I I added cache and validation so

00:18:04.315 --> 00:18:06.539
<v Speaker 0>that when we deploy v two, we'll actually

00:18:06.539 --> 00:18:08.620
<v Speaker 0>see the video rather than the browser. Because

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.379
<v Speaker 0>I used the same video name on both.

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:13.820
<v Speaker 0>It should be it should work better now.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.059
<v Speaker 0>So Okay. What would cause the

00:18:18.945 --> 00:18:21.424
<v Speaker 0>cluster pod to be unable to speak to

00:18:21.424 --> 00:18:22.864
<v Speaker 0>the Postgres pod?

00:18:26.065 --> 00:18:29.504
<v Speaker 1>Let's check if there's any network policies.

00:18:31.664 --> 00:18:32.544
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Good idea.

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:38.270
<v Speaker 0>This is a Selium cluster. How's your Selium

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.990
<v Speaker 0>knowledge?

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:41.470
<v Speaker 1>Terrible.

00:18:46.095 --> 00:18:48.575
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So I'm just checking,

00:18:49.054 --> 00:18:51.934
<v Speaker 1>like, what other network policies

00:18:52.575 --> 00:18:53.374
<v Speaker 1>may

00:18:53.455 --> 00:18:54.174
<v Speaker 1>exist.

00:18:57.294 --> 00:19:01.294
<v Speaker 1>So we have some

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.820
<v Speaker 1>ceiling specific network policies.

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.340
<v Speaker 0>Yes. We have CMP and CCNP,

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:07.940
<v Speaker 0>which are cluster cluster

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.540
<v Speaker 0>network policies and cluster

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.780
<v Speaker 0>cluster wide network policies.

00:19:19.025 --> 00:19:20.225
<v Speaker 1>Is that correct?

00:19:23.185 --> 00:19:25.025
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so. Right?

00:19:26.545 --> 00:19:27.905
<v Speaker 0>Well, I think we need to take a

00:19:27.905 --> 00:19:28.385
<v Speaker 0>look at it.

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I mean, I'm I'm just going to

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:34.630
<v Speaker 1>get that.

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:37.510
<v Speaker 0>Yes. We have an Anchorage deny on app

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:40.470
<v Speaker 0>cluster to Port 5432. Yeah. That would probably

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:42.070
<v Speaker 0>get in the way of things, wouldn't it?

00:19:51.625 --> 00:19:52.664
<v Speaker 1>Oh,

00:19:55.065 --> 00:19:55.865
<v Speaker 1>there's that too.

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:58.550
<v Speaker 0>You can just do CCNP

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:01.030
<v Speaker 0>as a sharp or, yeah, tap to put

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:02.230
<v Speaker 0>that out. That works.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:20:08.565 --> 00:20:10.964
<v Speaker 1>Maybe let's give it another try.

00:20:11.605 --> 00:20:14.245
<v Speaker 0>I'm afraid that it's still unable to connect

00:20:14.245 --> 00:20:15.284
<v Speaker 0>to the database.

00:20:16.325 --> 00:20:18.325
<v Speaker 0>And I I love the laughter on the

00:20:18.325 --> 00:20:18.804
<v Speaker 0>face there.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:25.470
<v Speaker 1>So what we had some other policies maybe

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:28.030
<v Speaker 1>we should Yeah. There's also CNPs.

00:20:40.015 --> 00:20:42.095
<v Speaker 0>And there's our first DNS comment on the

00:20:42.095 --> 00:20:43.215
<v Speaker 0>chat from Bradley.

00:20:45.615 --> 00:20:46.815
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:50.310
<v Speaker 0>We pointed out that the error message was

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:51.510
<v Speaker 0>slightly different.

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh, was it Failed to look up address.

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:55.190
<v Speaker 0>So yeah. So this was not a failure

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:56.550
<v Speaker 0>to connect. This was a failure to look

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:58.790
<v Speaker 0>up address. Good catch there, Bradley. I don't

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:00.309
<v Speaker 0>know if that So

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:02.550
<v Speaker 1>this sounds like DNS.

00:21:06.875 --> 00:21:08.154
<v Speaker 1>So if I

00:21:10.475 --> 00:21:13.034
<v Speaker 1>I think it's in the config map.

00:21:13.115 --> 00:21:13.835
<v Speaker 1>No.

00:21:15.914 --> 00:21:19.274
<v Speaker 1>Right. Is that where the DNS might be

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:19.580
<v Speaker 1>configured?

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:24.620
<v Speaker 0>There is a conflict map called core DNS,

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:26.780
<v Speaker 0>and they could just have namespace. Yep.

00:21:37.335 --> 00:21:40.215
<v Speaker 0>Bradley has seen the previous Unicode break

00:21:41.335 --> 00:21:43.414
<v Speaker 0>where Guy Templeton

00:21:43.575 --> 00:21:46.054
<v Speaker 0>put the Unicode c and stayed

00:21:46.535 --> 00:21:49.340
<v Speaker 0>resolver for the Kubernetes namespace. Yeah. So I

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:52.780
<v Speaker 1>I see something here that does not look

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:53.500
<v Speaker 1>right.

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:55.020
<v Speaker 0>What do you see?

00:22:01.755 --> 00:22:02.474
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:22:02.955 --> 00:22:04.234
<v Speaker 1>Right. Yeah.

00:22:04.955 --> 00:22:06.475
<v Speaker 1>So let's fix that.

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:19.930
<v Speaker 0>You don't like that rewrite then?

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:22.570
<v Speaker 1>I do not.

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:26.730
<v Speaker 0>Would you like me to or that?

00:22:28.045 --> 00:22:29.405
<v Speaker 0>What what do you want me to do?

00:22:29.405 --> 00:22:30.605
<v Speaker 0>You want me to try again?

00:22:31.085 --> 00:22:31.804
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:22:33.485 --> 00:22:34.845
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Look up failed.

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:43.950
<v Speaker 1>Did I okay.

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:53.390
<v Speaker 0>This is actually a question we get on

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:55.070
<v Speaker 0>officers a lot, if that helps you.

00:22:57.285 --> 00:22:59.445
<v Speaker 0>I modified a config map. Oh, we got

00:22:59.445 --> 00:23:01.845
<v Speaker 1>we got we got to restart the

00:23:04.805 --> 00:23:05.765
<v Speaker 0>Everyone's

00:23:05.765 --> 00:23:08.325
<v Speaker 0>biggest gripe with config maps. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh, what is this?

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:15.690
<v Speaker 1>That's CT blank control point one. That's not

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:17.690
<v Speaker 1>good. That's okay. That's

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:20.490
<v Speaker 0>that's because it's a matter of pods. So

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:22.490
<v Speaker 0>it inherits the name of the control plan.

00:23:23.485 --> 00:23:24.684
<v Speaker 1>Right. Okay.

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:45.700
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. All the comments are coming in there.

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.700
<v Speaker 0>Restart, Gordon. Yeah.

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. The

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:51.860
<v Speaker 0>audience are always much better than us than

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:52.260
<v Speaker 0>I am.

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:12.779
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Would you like me to try again?

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:13.820
<v Speaker 1>Let's

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:17.259
<v Speaker 1>yeah. Let's give it another try.

00:24:19.179 --> 00:24:20.299
<v Speaker 0>And we have to Dan.

00:24:21.545 --> 00:24:22.424
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:24:22.905 --> 00:24:24.745
<v Speaker 1>That was good. Well done.

00:24:26.505 --> 00:24:28.904
<v Speaker 1>I know. Very pragmatic.

00:24:28.905 --> 00:24:29.385
<v Speaker 0>It

00:24:31.385 --> 00:24:33.545
<v Speaker 1>I think it was good learning

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.999
<v Speaker 1>debugging exercise for sure.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.999
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Definitely.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.039
<v Speaker 1>I got some clever ideas.

00:24:45.039 --> 00:24:46.960
<v Speaker 1>I want to try to make the API

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:49.760
<v Speaker 1>servers that are returning, like, I'm a teapot

00:24:49.695 --> 00:24:51.854
<v Speaker 1>status code for, like,

00:24:52.174 --> 00:24:55.215
<v Speaker 1>image or, like, random stuff, but I can't

00:24:55.215 --> 00:24:56.894
<v Speaker 1>get that working. So

00:24:57.855 --> 00:24:58.575
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:24:58.894 --> 00:25:00.975
<v Speaker 0>I I reckon if I haven't if if

00:25:00.975 --> 00:25:02.894
<v Speaker 0>I didn't mention the previous unit code break,

00:25:02.894 --> 00:25:03.695
<v Speaker 0>we may have been

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:06.700
<v Speaker 0>looking at that error and valid image name

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:07.740
<v Speaker 0>a bit longer.

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.260
<v Speaker 0>You think you would have got the Unicode

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.779
<v Speaker 0>given enough time there?

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:14.539
<v Speaker 1>Me? No.

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:16.059
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.140
<v Speaker 1>Probably wouldn't have any side of that.

00:25:18.705 --> 00:25:20.624
<v Speaker 0>Because there's a truly evil break.

00:25:20.865 --> 00:25:23.745
<v Speaker 0>Well done there. Alright. Let's Who is the

00:25:23.745 --> 00:25:26.544
<v Speaker 1>evil twin, I guess? We'll find out. Well,

00:25:27.825 --> 00:25:30.065
<v Speaker 0>let's say that right now. I'm gonna open

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:33.529
<v Speaker 0>a session on Rawkode.

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:35.049
<v Speaker 0>Control plan one

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:36.570
<v Speaker 0>is now there.

00:25:37.289 --> 00:25:39.129
<v Speaker 0>I have shared my screen again.

00:25:40.649 --> 00:25:41.289
<v Speaker 0>So,

00:25:41.529 --> 00:25:42.249
<v Speaker 0>Rawkode,

00:25:42.409 --> 00:25:43.210
<v Speaker 0>if you can

00:25:44.025 --> 00:25:46.585
<v Speaker 0>join our So I'm joining yeah. Okay. Join

00:25:46.585 --> 00:25:48.265
<v Speaker 0>the session. Just take echo so that we

00:25:48.265 --> 00:25:49.545
<v Speaker 0>can see it on the screen. We know

00:25:49.545 --> 00:25:50.664
<v Speaker 0>we're in the same session.

00:25:51.065 --> 00:25:53.785
<v Speaker 0>Yep. Perfect. And then set up your Kube

00:25:53.785 --> 00:25:56.265
<v Speaker 0>config tech for our control plan, and best

00:25:56.265 --> 00:25:56.665
<v Speaker 0>of luck.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.600
<v Speaker 0>Oh, the alias key. That's

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.279
<v Speaker 0>the season pro right there.

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:08.480
<v Speaker 1>I

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:09.600
<v Speaker 1>don't know about that.

00:26:10.625 --> 00:26:12.145
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know. Let's

00:26:16.225 --> 00:26:16.945
<v Speaker 1>just

00:26:17.185 --> 00:26:19.185
<v Speaker 1>trying to get all the parts, and this

00:26:19.185 --> 00:26:21.184
<v Speaker 1>is not looking good.

00:26:21.345 --> 00:26:23.825
<v Speaker 0>It is not. I do not think

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:26.500
<v Speaker 1>I think we know if we'll be able

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:27.459
<v Speaker 1>to train now.

00:26:32.419 --> 00:26:33.299
<v Speaker 1>Oh, no.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:35.860
<v Speaker 1>K. That's running.

00:26:38.035 --> 00:26:40.835
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So we do have a Kiplit over

00:26:40.835 --> 00:26:41.555
<v Speaker 0>the pier.

00:26:42.435 --> 00:26:45.715
<v Speaker 0>But there there are some banners. Running.

00:26:50.195 --> 00:26:51.475
<v Speaker 1>Now let me just

00:26:55.799 --> 00:26:57.239
<v Speaker 1>is it queue?

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.759
<v Speaker 0>If we got the the CTL,

00:27:02.919 --> 00:27:05.559
<v Speaker 0>system control status, or are you trying to

00:27:05.559 --> 00:27:06.280
<v Speaker 0>check something else?

00:27:08.465 --> 00:27:10.304
<v Speaker 1>Well, q v p I is here. Where

00:27:10.304 --> 00:27:10.945
<v Speaker 1>is it?

00:27:11.904 --> 00:27:14.304
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yes. So that runs under a static

00:27:14.304 --> 00:27:16.225
<v Speaker 0>manifest, so there won't be a system d

00:27:16.225 --> 00:27:16.945
<v Speaker 0>service.

00:27:17.184 --> 00:27:17.904
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:27:19.105 --> 00:27:21.105
<v Speaker 0>But we do have some error messages

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.559
<v Speaker 0>Here. Okay.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.000
<v Speaker 1>Error get

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.759
<v Speaker 0>Says our container runtime network is not ready.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:27:37.635 --> 00:27:39.475
<v Speaker 1>Never plug in. Oh, okay.

00:27:40.435 --> 00:27:42.434
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So c and nine.

00:27:44.435 --> 00:27:46.115
<v Speaker 1>I mean, I'd be running.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:52.810
<v Speaker 1>You can always just use PS to see

00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:55.610
<v Speaker 1>what, like, if you a running.

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:57.690
<v Speaker 1>Right? The PS and and filter for Kubernetes

00:27:57.690 --> 00:27:59.529
<v Speaker 0>is probably a good step right now.

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:03.050
<v Speaker 0>Because we have no eye no idea what's

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:03.370
<v Speaker 0>running.

00:28:10.505 --> 00:28:11.224
<v Speaker 1>So

00:28:11.544 --> 00:28:12.904
<v Speaker 1>we have HCD.

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:20.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to save for now. That looks

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:22.470
<v Speaker 0>okay.

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:24.549
<v Speaker 0>Yep. We have a scheduler. We have a

00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:26.389
<v Speaker 0>controller manager. We have a kubelet.

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:28.470
<v Speaker 0>We do have an HD. I don't see

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:29.909
<v Speaker 0>an API server.

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:28:31.895 --> 00:28:32.614
<v Speaker 1>So

00:28:33.174 --> 00:28:33.815
<v Speaker 1>yeah.

00:28:41.735 --> 00:28:42.695
<v Speaker 1>So that

00:28:43.255 --> 00:28:43.895
<v Speaker 1>I guess.

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:54.030
<v Speaker 1>Is that even okay. I mean, should that

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:54.670
<v Speaker 1>be

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:57.630
<v Speaker 0>No. I wouldn't expect to see that there

00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:00.590
<v Speaker 0>because it runs inside of container.

00:29:00.735 --> 00:29:03.375
<v Speaker 0>So the kiplet is responsible for starting at

00:29:03.375 --> 00:29:06.575
<v Speaker 0>c d and the control manager and the

00:29:06.575 --> 00:29:07.534
<v Speaker 0>scheduler.

00:29:07.775 --> 00:29:09.534
<v Speaker 0>And those all started fine.

00:29:10.335 --> 00:29:10.975
<v Speaker 0>So

00:29:11.855 --> 00:29:13.455
<v Speaker 0>your next step is maybe to go look

00:29:13.455 --> 00:29:15.055
<v Speaker 0>at the static manifest directory.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:16.660
<v Speaker 1>Yes. And

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:23.940
<v Speaker 0>we do have an API server.

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:29.634
<v Speaker 1>So I guess Untouched fail snaps. Although that

00:29:29.634 --> 00:29:31.714
<v Speaker 0>means nothing these days. But still,

00:29:32.034 --> 00:29:33.874
<v Speaker 0>Rawkode wouldn't be that mean, would he?

00:29:36.434 --> 00:29:37.475
<v Speaker 1>Sorry. We'd

00:29:38.835 --> 00:29:40.595
<v Speaker 1>okay. I I don't know. I did break

00:29:40.595 --> 00:29:42.274
<v Speaker 1>at CB last time. So

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:48.330
<v Speaker 0>There's some suspicious output right in the middle

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:49.210
<v Speaker 0>of our screen.

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:51.450
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if you see that.

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:54.330
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if I should mention it,

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:54.970
<v Speaker 0>but I have now.

00:29:58.025 --> 00:29:59.784
<v Speaker 0>Do you see the process is running?

00:30:01.385 --> 00:30:04.825
<v Speaker 0>These looks suspicious. Oh, yeah. I do. Yeah.

00:30:06.505 --> 00:30:07.384
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:30:08.585 --> 00:30:10.905
<v Speaker 1>I know what that is, but, like, I

00:30:10.905 --> 00:30:12.025
<v Speaker 1>guess, let's yeah.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.360
<v Speaker 0>Rawkode's like, shit. I've I've been cut. I

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.599
<v Speaker 1>can't have said that PS comment.

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.279
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Well, I'm just gonna

00:30:27.705 --> 00:30:28.904
<v Speaker 1>oh, wait.

00:30:31.304 --> 00:30:33.464
<v Speaker 1>First, I'm going to delete that. Yeah.

00:30:36.825 --> 00:30:37.464
<v Speaker 1>That

00:30:37.784 --> 00:30:40.190
<v Speaker 1>kinda so the idea was that you'd check

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:41.549
<v Speaker 1>IP tables,

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:43.390
<v Speaker 1>but I have a lock in it so

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:44.830
<v Speaker 1>you can't flash them.

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:48.750
<v Speaker 1>So you'd have to figure out, like, how

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:50.270
<v Speaker 1>to remove the lock

00:30:51.885 --> 00:30:54.525
<v Speaker 1>or find this file and just stop the

00:30:54.525 --> 00:30:56.125
<v Speaker 1>crunch up or something.

00:30:56.845 --> 00:30:59.804
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Yeah. Like, we do IP tables at

00:30:59.565 --> 00:31:02.605
<v Speaker 0>Let's do IP tables dash f, capital f,

00:31:02.605 --> 00:31:04.205
<v Speaker 0>and see what I've never seen a

00:31:04.765 --> 00:31:07.005
<v Speaker 0>lock on it before. A capital f. Sorry.

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:08.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh,

00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:11.529
<v Speaker 0>nice.

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:15.130
<v Speaker 1>Even if, yeah, even if you go, like,

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:16.490
<v Speaker 1>flash w,

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:20.010
<v Speaker 1>right, because it's right now running as a

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:22.325
<v Speaker 1>cron job, It would rewrite.

00:31:23.285 --> 00:31:25.205
<v Speaker 1>So, like, you might get

00:31:27.605 --> 00:31:30.085
<v Speaker 1>you might, like, flash them and be able

00:31:30.085 --> 00:31:32.565
<v Speaker 1>to access the best like, delete them, and

00:31:32.565 --> 00:31:34.005
<v Speaker 1>then it would recreate them.

00:31:35.279 --> 00:31:37.279
<v Speaker 0>Sneaky. Very, very sneaky.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:40.719
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.159
<v Speaker 0>So

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.200
<v Speaker 0>you've already just kinda given away. This is

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.640
<v Speaker 0>the cron, so we're gonna have to edit

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.684
<v Speaker 0>the system cron to stop the script.

00:32:03.485 --> 00:32:04.845
<v Speaker 1>So I I have

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:09.010
<v Speaker 0>You can do crontab dash e. It'll drop

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:10.690
<v Speaker 0>again. It's straight in. Yeah.

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:15.009
<v Speaker 1>So

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:20.770
<v Speaker 1>I have seen, like, this error

00:32:22.455 --> 00:32:24.695
<v Speaker 1>in in, like, live,

00:32:24.855 --> 00:32:27.255
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of it was inspired

00:32:27.255 --> 00:32:29.495
<v Speaker 1>by, like, an instant I had to deal

00:32:29.495 --> 00:32:30.695
<v Speaker 1>with previously.

00:32:31.895 --> 00:32:33.735
<v Speaker 1>But it was when you have a lot

00:32:33.735 --> 00:32:35.495
<v Speaker 1>of if you're using IP tables,

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:38.399
<v Speaker 1>if you have a lot of rules,

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.120
<v Speaker 1>the

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:43.759
<v Speaker 1>the IP tables can get pretty large,

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.040
<v Speaker 1>and then they take a while to update.

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.975
<v Speaker 1>And then you can have a lot of

00:32:49.055 --> 00:32:50.255
<v Speaker 1>if you have a lot of pods or

00:32:50.255 --> 00:32:52.414
<v Speaker 1>a lot of things changing quickly,

00:32:52.895 --> 00:32:55.855
<v Speaker 1>you can get into some weird behavior where

00:32:56.015 --> 00:32:58.414
<v Speaker 1>processes start tearing out because

00:32:59.135 --> 00:33:01.855
<v Speaker 1>they time out

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:03.630
<v Speaker 1>trying to update the IP tables where another

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:04.909
<v Speaker 1>process has it.

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:08.990
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted to kinda replicate something similar.

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:11.470
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately, I couldn't do anything with network

00:33:12.805 --> 00:33:14.804
<v Speaker 1>policies because we're using.

00:33:15.045 --> 00:33:16.725
<v Speaker 1>So I just kinda had to

00:33:18.485 --> 00:33:19.284
<v Speaker 1>just

00:33:20.405 --> 00:33:21.924
<v Speaker 1>do a lock on it,

00:33:22.485 --> 00:33:24.885
<v Speaker 1>I guess, using the fake command.

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:26.869
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:28.869
<v Speaker 0>It was nice. I like that.

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:33:37.365 --> 00:33:39.285
<v Speaker 0>I There's something not working. Let me

00:33:41.765 --> 00:33:44.245
<v Speaker 1>oh. There we go. Thank you. There we

00:33:44.245 --> 00:33:44.804
<v Speaker 1>go.

00:33:45.525 --> 00:33:47.684
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So the crown has been removed.

00:33:49.845 --> 00:33:51.684
<v Speaker 0>Maybe we should check the process table just

00:33:51.684 --> 00:33:52.965
<v Speaker 0>to make sure this

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:54.690
<v Speaker 0>they're they're actually gone.

00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:00.289
<v Speaker 0>That that looks a bit better.

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:05.890
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Okay. Okay. You wanna check our control

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:06.450
<v Speaker 0>plan again?

00:34:17.035 --> 00:34:19.594
<v Speaker 0>Well, the point where IP team will still

00:34:19.594 --> 00:34:21.355
<v Speaker 0>be there. So we'll we we will need

00:34:21.355 --> 00:34:22.155
<v Speaker 0>to flush them again.

00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:33.730
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Now surely we're have a control plan.

00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:34.370
<v Speaker 0>Well,

00:34:36.929 --> 00:34:38.610
<v Speaker 1>let's just

00:34:45.225 --> 00:34:46.825
<v Speaker 1>oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. We still don't have

00:34:46.825 --> 00:34:49.305
<v Speaker 0>a API server. Yeah. Well remembered.

00:34:59.020 --> 00:34:59.980
<v Speaker 1>No. This

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:03.420
<v Speaker 1>is interesting.

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I broke the UPS server.

00:35:12.275 --> 00:35:13.555
<v Speaker 1>Oh, man.

00:35:14.994 --> 00:35:16.115
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Oops.

00:35:16.515 --> 00:35:17.234
<v Speaker 1>Am I?

00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:28.329
<v Speaker 0>So it could just be that with the

00:35:28.329 --> 00:35:31.130
<v Speaker 0>the drops on the table, the API server,

00:35:31.289 --> 00:35:32.970
<v Speaker 0>maybe under some sort of crashing state.

00:35:34.505 --> 00:35:36.825
<v Speaker 0>You could try restarting the kubelet to encourage

00:35:36.825 --> 00:35:38.585
<v Speaker 0>it to restart the API server again.

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:51.550
<v Speaker 1>That's I don't know. Oh.

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:56.030
<v Speaker 0>Bradley wants to know, Rawkode, if you changed

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:57.630
<v Speaker 0>the default editor to Nano.

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:01.785
<v Speaker 1>No. I think that's just when you do

00:36:01.785 --> 00:36:04.105
<v Speaker 1>cron tap, it, like, asks you what you

00:36:04.105 --> 00:36:06.505
<v Speaker 1>want to open. So the default is Nano.

00:36:06.825 --> 00:36:08.745
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Okay. So

00:36:11.545 --> 00:36:13.385
<v Speaker 1>Well, can you check the IP tables?

00:36:15.609 --> 00:36:17.690
<v Speaker 0>We're now getting a connection refused instead of

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:19.369
<v Speaker 0>a timeout, which makes me think the IP

00:36:19.369 --> 00:36:20.090
<v Speaker 0>tables

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:21.770
<v Speaker 0>are now working correctly,

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:25.130
<v Speaker 0>but we're not getting the APIs ever started.

00:36:26.089 --> 00:36:26.490
<v Speaker 0>So

00:36:30.375 --> 00:36:31.575
<v Speaker 0>Let's

00:36:31.575 --> 00:36:33.735
<v Speaker 0>run the PS one more time just just

00:36:33.735 --> 00:36:35.335
<v Speaker 0>to be sure that we don't see

00:36:36.455 --> 00:36:37.975
<v Speaker 0>the API server there.

00:36:40.775 --> 00:36:42.695
<v Speaker 1>I see it. Yeah. It says there now.

00:36:42.695 --> 00:36:45.160
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Good. So I think it just the

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:46.600
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes just needed a bit of a bit

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:47.320
<v Speaker 0>of help.

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:50.680
<v Speaker 1>So

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:54.840
<v Speaker 1>let me see.

00:37:03.494 --> 00:37:05.415
<v Speaker 0>Maybe try to get pods or something and

00:37:05.415 --> 00:37:07.335
<v Speaker 0>see if it's actually working.

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:12.460
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. There we go. Alright.

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.500
<v Speaker 1>Celeum is crashing.

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.140
<v Speaker 1>But, like, I guess

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:23.740
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming one of our notes is maybe

00:37:26.835 --> 00:37:28.595
<v Speaker 0>offline or maybe it's just this node that's

00:37:28.595 --> 00:37:30.195
<v Speaker 0>offline and it's just because

00:37:30.435 --> 00:37:33.075
<v Speaker 0>it's not restarted those ones yet. I'm not

00:37:33.075 --> 00:37:33.315
<v Speaker 0>sure.

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:43.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh, right. Namespace.

00:37:51.665 --> 00:37:53.825
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm just going to check.

00:38:00.385 --> 00:38:02.465
<v Speaker 1>This looks sane at the

00:38:04.869 --> 00:38:07.110
<v Speaker 1>let's see if there's any events.

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:09.430
<v Speaker 1>No status

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.630
<v Speaker 1>here.

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Let's just check.

00:38:45.565 --> 00:38:46.685
<v Speaker 1>So, yeah, the

00:38:49.645 --> 00:38:51.405
<v Speaker 0>Are those are those pods still crash the

00:38:51.405 --> 00:38:51.885
<v Speaker 0>back off?

00:39:07.025 --> 00:39:08.785
<v Speaker 0>And so one of those come back. I

00:39:08.785 --> 00:39:10.545
<v Speaker 0>think if I think if you kick kick

00:39:10.545 --> 00:39:12.705
<v Speaker 0>the crash loop back Yeah. They do take

00:39:13.105 --> 00:39:16.225
<v Speaker 0>mhmm. I think it's because this node

00:39:16.305 --> 00:39:19.025
<v Speaker 0>the API server was offline, and it just

00:39:19.265 --> 00:39:20.225
<v Speaker 0>It's cool.

00:39:20.865 --> 00:39:21.585
<v Speaker 1>It up, actually.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.560
<v Speaker 1>So it should be sync

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:28.200
<v Speaker 1>three.

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:30.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:32.920
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Do a wait.

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.720
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no. That's a worker one. Okay.

00:39:38.345 --> 00:39:40.025
<v Speaker 0>So Potentially,

00:39:40.105 --> 00:39:41.865
<v Speaker 0>he's been on worker two,

00:39:42.984 --> 00:39:44.425
<v Speaker 0>causing some pain.

00:39:46.105 --> 00:39:48.825
<v Speaker 1>No. Okay. But, I mean But we don't

00:39:48.825 --> 00:39:50.744
<v Speaker 0>we don't need worker two. Right? So

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:53.450
<v Speaker 1>I I mean, possible

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:56.089
<v Speaker 1>because I did do try to do some

00:39:56.089 --> 00:39:57.770
<v Speaker 1>other stuff that might have,

00:39:58.569 --> 00:39:59.930
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:03.130
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Our custard pod looks alright. Shall we

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:04.490
<v Speaker 0>shall we try the update?

00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:06.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,

00:40:06.775 --> 00:40:08.535
<v Speaker 1>can can we just see whether the app

00:40:08.535 --> 00:40:12.135
<v Speaker 1>works? Can you open whether version one works

00:40:12.135 --> 00:40:14.215
<v Speaker 1>first, I guess? Yeah. Sure.

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:20.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:25.340
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Connection tagged out. Speaking to the database.

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:25.820
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:29.500
<v Speaker 1>Which is

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:30.940
<v Speaker 1>interesting.

00:40:36.635 --> 00:40:38.795
<v Speaker 1>Okay. We've we've got ceiling working. Okay. So

00:40:38.795 --> 00:40:39.755
<v Speaker 1>that's not

00:40:40.075 --> 00:40:42.075
<v Speaker 1>okay. That is so that's that's not an

00:40:42.075 --> 00:40:43.434
<v Speaker 1>issue anymore.

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:49.650
<v Speaker 1>So yeah. Okay. So we're kinda at the

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:52.930
<v Speaker 1>same problem that he had Yep.

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:54.770
<v Speaker 1>To assume.

00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:57.730
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully, he didn't do the same thing I

00:40:57.730 --> 00:40:58.370
<v Speaker 1>did.

00:40:59.170 --> 00:41:01.010
<v Speaker 1>That'd be very

00:41:03.205 --> 00:41:05.765
<v Speaker 1>train intuition type of thing, I guess. Definitely.

00:41:05.765 --> 00:41:06.725
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.

00:41:08.405 --> 00:41:09.205
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So

00:41:10.565 --> 00:41:13.685
<v Speaker 1>let I mean, Postgres is running.

00:41:14.565 --> 00:41:16.165
<v Speaker 0>It does appear to be. Yeah.

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:18.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So let's just,

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:20.390
<v Speaker 1>I guess,

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:21.270
<v Speaker 1>get

00:41:32.315 --> 00:41:34.315
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at oops.

00:41:39.115 --> 00:41:40.395
<v Speaker 1>So

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:51.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm, like, attempted to rewrite the image here,

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:53.160
<v Speaker 1>but I know that's not wrong.

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:56.280
<v Speaker 1>So redness.

00:41:57.545 --> 00:41:59.545
<v Speaker 1>I mean, that's fine.

00:41:59.865 --> 00:42:01.385
<v Speaker 1>Right? Because there's no

00:42:02.424 --> 00:42:02.984
<v Speaker 1>oh,

00:42:07.464 --> 00:42:07.865
<v Speaker 1>wait.

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:10.660
<v Speaker 1>Start approved.

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:12.900
<v Speaker 0>That that looks a bit interesting.

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:13.460
<v Speaker 0>Right?

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:15.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:17.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:19.620
<v Speaker 1>Let's

00:42:24.765 --> 00:42:25.724
<v Speaker 0>I think you got

00:42:27.085 --> 00:42:28.845
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if it was just intuition

00:42:28.845 --> 00:42:31.645
<v Speaker 0>or luck that you described that deployment instead

00:42:31.645 --> 00:42:33.325
<v Speaker 0>of looking going down the rabbit hole of

00:42:33.325 --> 00:42:36.045
<v Speaker 0>services and endpoints. So that's definitely to intuition

00:42:36.045 --> 00:42:37.805
<v Speaker 0>that you went in there. I think so.

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:42.060
<v Speaker 0>Because I wouldn't have got that.

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:44.220
<v Speaker 0>I I would have been debugging the network

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:44.619
<v Speaker 0>stuff.

00:42:55.795 --> 00:42:57.955
<v Speaker 0>So that was you setting the domain. So

00:42:57.955 --> 00:43:00.435
<v Speaker 0>the postgres lookup was gonna end up its

00:43:00.435 --> 00:43:02.195
<v Speaker 0>way down custard.com.

00:43:02.275 --> 00:43:03.235
<v Speaker 0>Very sneaky.

00:43:03.555 --> 00:43:05.955
<v Speaker 1>Wait. Did I did I delete too much?

00:43:05.955 --> 00:43:06.435
<v Speaker 1>I

00:43:06.915 --> 00:43:08.995
<v Speaker 0>No. You're I mean You're you're good. That's

00:43:08.995 --> 00:43:09.955
<v Speaker 0>fine. Oh, okay.

00:43:10.450 --> 00:43:12.530
<v Speaker 1>Let me just make sure this all looks

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:16.370
<v Speaker 1>me go to

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:19.410
<v Speaker 1>the source code and

00:43:24.464 --> 00:43:27.905
<v Speaker 1>Make sure this all checks out. Okay. Sorry.

00:43:28.545 --> 00:43:30.465
<v Speaker 0>You don't trust trust your brother?

00:43:32.704 --> 00:43:34.385
<v Speaker 1>Not in this area. No.

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:37.930
<v Speaker 1>So

00:43:40.089 --> 00:43:41.050
<v Speaker 1>I miss

00:43:41.369 --> 00:43:42.650
<v Speaker 1>probably speak

00:43:43.289 --> 00:43:46.490
<v Speaker 1>yeah. Let try that case. Sure. He's speaking.

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:47.690
<v Speaker 1>How can I

00:43:47.849 --> 00:43:48.410
<v Speaker 1>obviously?

00:43:49.725 --> 00:43:51.325
<v Speaker 0>I do think that's, like,

00:43:51.805 --> 00:43:54.445
<v Speaker 0>my code right now. I think I think

00:43:54.445 --> 00:43:55.965
<v Speaker 0>this is alright. Yeah.

00:43:56.445 --> 00:43:57.725
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Let's

00:44:00.285 --> 00:44:03.860
<v Speaker 1>give it a shot. Oops. What happened?

00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:06.180
<v Speaker 0>There should be an error at the top

00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:07.220
<v Speaker 0>if it was

00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:11.940
<v Speaker 0>or

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:13.940
<v Speaker 0>maybe I was wrong when I said that

00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:15.700
<v Speaker 0>you you cut it properly. I think I

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:16.900
<v Speaker 1>might have

00:44:17.535 --> 00:44:18.175
<v Speaker 1>deleted

00:44:18.335 --> 00:44:20.095
<v Speaker 1>something too much. Yeah. I think you've been

00:44:20.095 --> 00:44:21.135
<v Speaker 1>doing it. Click

00:44:21.454 --> 00:44:22.335
<v Speaker 1>and delete.

00:44:24.494 --> 00:44:26.174
<v Speaker 1>So what's the shortcut to go to the

00:44:26.255 --> 00:44:27.295
<v Speaker 1>okay. So

00:44:27.934 --> 00:44:29.454
<v Speaker 0>no. No. You didn't delete so much.

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:35.230
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no. You didn't delete enough.

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:38.030
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. The failure threshold looked into the

00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:39.710
<v Speaker 0>resources, and I thought it was okay. But

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:42.030
<v Speaker 0>yeah. So we have to delete four more

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:42.590
<v Speaker 0>lanes. Yeah.

00:44:44.545 --> 00:44:45.505
<v Speaker 1>And then

00:44:45.665 --> 00:44:48.225
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That that's better. There we go. Okay.

00:44:52.945 --> 00:44:54.465
<v Speaker 1>So that should

00:44:57.185 --> 00:44:57.825
<v Speaker 1>restart it.

00:44:58.839 --> 00:45:00.120
<v Speaker 0>You've got v one?

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh, awesome. Okay.

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:06.280
<v Speaker 1>So let's now change it.

00:45:22.815 --> 00:45:23.295
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:28.080
<v Speaker 0>Almost.

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.119
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. There's just I

00:45:32.799 --> 00:45:36.400
<v Speaker 1>mean, I Well We got V2. Cable stuff

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:38.720
<v Speaker 1>could have taken a really long time. Right?

00:45:39.225 --> 00:45:42.425
<v Speaker 1>I did not expect to be discovered so

00:45:42.425 --> 00:45:43.065
<v Speaker 1>quickly.

00:45:43.945 --> 00:45:45.865
<v Speaker 0>Well, mean, you you you don't even try

00:45:45.865 --> 00:45:47.625
<v Speaker 0>to hate it in the process table. They're

00:45:47.625 --> 00:45:49.705
<v Speaker 0>like, he ran the PS command and it

00:45:49.705 --> 00:45:50.905
<v Speaker 0>was just that rare.

00:45:51.465 --> 00:45:51.785
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:56.180
<v Speaker 1>That and that's probably not my forties, so

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:57.460
<v Speaker 1>he was definitely

00:45:57.860 --> 00:45:59.540
<v Speaker 1>hitting on a weak spot

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:00.500
<v Speaker 1>here.

00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:02.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That was interesting.

00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:05.460
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That was good. It was that was

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:07.674
<v Speaker 0>that was fun. I like that. I mean,

00:46:07.674 --> 00:46:10.075
<v Speaker 0>I'm not entirely impressed with the Unicode, but

00:46:10.075 --> 00:46:12.875
<v Speaker 0>it's it's now that I I've seen it.

00:46:12.875 --> 00:46:13.675
<v Speaker 0>It's good.

00:46:15.355 --> 00:46:17.275
<v Speaker 0>I I I really thought the Unicode is

00:46:17.275 --> 00:46:18.795
<v Speaker 0>gonna be in the DNS as well all

00:46:18.795 --> 00:46:19.355
<v Speaker 0>over again.

00:46:20.049 --> 00:46:20.770
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:25.170
<v Speaker 1>Well, I guess, not surprising that other others

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:27.410
<v Speaker 1>have come up with that idea. Yeah.

00:46:28.849 --> 00:46:30.769
<v Speaker 0>Think you undersold yourself by saying that this

00:46:30.769 --> 00:46:32.769
<v Speaker 0>is not the yeah. But Russell's still there.

00:46:32.769 --> 00:46:34.049
<v Speaker 0>Nice work. Because then you said you weren't

00:46:34.049 --> 00:46:35.484
<v Speaker 0>used to this type of work. Like, you

00:46:35.484 --> 00:46:37.325
<v Speaker 0>were you were working through that pretty quickly.

00:46:38.285 --> 00:46:39.805
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So I think you can see the

00:46:39.805 --> 00:46:42.365
<v Speaker 1>contrast. Like, I'm more used to, like,

00:46:43.085 --> 00:46:43.885
<v Speaker 1>debugging

00:46:43.885 --> 00:46:44.765
<v Speaker 1>workload

00:46:44.765 --> 00:46:47.085
<v Speaker 1>related things. So that's kinda where I was

00:46:47.085 --> 00:46:50.780
<v Speaker 1>gravitating towards, like, things like network policies,

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:52.860
<v Speaker 1>things that would affect functioning of what the

00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:54.460
<v Speaker 1>app was supposed to be doing

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:56.540
<v Speaker 1>and and how it was supposed to be

00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:59.660
<v Speaker 1>running in its environment rather than the cluster

00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:02.954
<v Speaker 1>itself and yeah. Just probably why Barco went

00:47:02.954 --> 00:47:05.035
<v Speaker 0>for the Linux route and the the control

00:47:05.035 --> 00:47:05.994
<v Speaker 0>plane because

00:47:06.315 --> 00:47:08.154
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Because you you knew that's where he

00:47:08.154 --> 00:47:09.275
<v Speaker 0>was weaker. Right?

00:47:09.835 --> 00:47:10.474
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:47:10.714 --> 00:47:11.994
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Yeah. I was just

00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:16.830
<v Speaker 1>one inspired by, like, the issue that faced,

00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:18.910
<v Speaker 1>but I couldn't really I want to get

00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:22.190
<v Speaker 1>it through Kubernetes somehow, like, with network policies

00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:23.070
<v Speaker 1>or, like,

00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:25.710
<v Speaker 1>creating a lot of IP table rules that

00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:26.590
<v Speaker 1>way. But,

00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:28.510
<v Speaker 1>like, it didn't work with.

00:47:30.015 --> 00:47:32.494
<v Speaker 1>And then I was like, okay. Whatever. I'll

00:47:32.494 --> 00:47:35.454
<v Speaker 1>just make take a look on it, like,

00:47:35.454 --> 00:47:37.775
<v Speaker 1>through a script and then put it in

00:47:37.775 --> 00:47:38.975
<v Speaker 1>the cron job.

00:47:39.694 --> 00:47:42.174
<v Speaker 1>And then I probably shouldn't have said you

00:47:42.174 --> 00:47:43.420
<v Speaker 1>can use PS.

00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:46.780
<v Speaker 1>It's running. That's right. That

00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:49.420
<v Speaker 1>kinda gave it away because I suspect it

00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:51.260
<v Speaker 1>would have taken a longer

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:54.140
<v Speaker 1>time to figure it out, but well. Well,

00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:55.980
<v Speaker 0>I felt it only fair to mention the

00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:57.500
<v Speaker 0>the script that I put in the PS

00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:00.125
<v Speaker 0>consider. I also mentioned the unique codes. So

00:48:00.125 --> 00:48:01.725
<v Speaker 0>I think that I I even talked to

00:48:01.725 --> 00:48:02.925
<v Speaker 0>match a little bit there.

00:48:03.965 --> 00:48:05.965
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, thank you both for joining us.

00:48:05.965 --> 00:48:07.405
<v Speaker 0>That was really cool. Thank you for taking

00:48:07.405 --> 00:48:09.165
<v Speaker 0>the time to to break these clusters and

00:48:09.165 --> 00:48:10.525
<v Speaker 0>then to come on and share your knowledge

00:48:10.525 --> 00:48:13.005
<v Speaker 0>with the audience. It's it's not easy. Thank

00:48:13.005 --> 00:48:15.240
<v Speaker 1>you. So I really appreciate you taking the
