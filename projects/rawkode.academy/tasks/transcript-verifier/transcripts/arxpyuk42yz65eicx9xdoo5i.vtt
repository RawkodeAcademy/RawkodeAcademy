00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.840
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So you're really, really close.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.759
<v Speaker 0>But instead of going to the host list

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:06.720
<v Speaker 0>in here, you

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.559
<v Speaker 0>can just go to explore.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.840
<v Speaker 0>And because there's no query,

00:00:12.485 --> 00:00:14.644
<v Speaker 0>we're just gonna browse. So we're writing to

00:00:14.644 --> 00:00:17.525
<v Speaker 0>the telegraph database at an auto gen retention

00:00:17.525 --> 00:00:18.324
<v Speaker 0>policy.

00:00:19.445 --> 00:00:21.765
<v Speaker 0>We can click on our measurement here, group

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:23.765
<v Speaker 0>by URL, and we can see our values

00:00:23.765 --> 00:00:24.085
<v Speaker 0>here.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.180
<v Speaker 0>And they're in a match. Now this only

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.539
<v Speaker 0>updates once per hour,

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.420
<v Speaker 0>so you'll need to wait for more metrics

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.860
<v Speaker 0>to come. But I will work on a

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.100
<v Speaker 0>Python script to import the old metrics, and

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.860
<v Speaker 0>I'll try and get that to you today

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.059
<v Speaker 0>or tomorrow.

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:40.565
<v Speaker 0>Thanks.
