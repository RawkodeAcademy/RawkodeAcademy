00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
<v Speaker 0>My name is Marino Widje. I am a

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.359
<v Speaker 0>platform slash developer advocate at Solo. One thing

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:07.440
<v Speaker 0>I will share is that, David, you've been

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.559
<v Speaker 0>a fantastic

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.639
<v Speaker 0>pillar in our community. You've done so much.

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:12.160
<v Speaker 0>I know it's it's a little bit heartfelt

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.945
<v Speaker 0>and emotional, but I will say, like, the

00:00:13.945 --> 00:00:15.545
<v Speaker 0>last year, I've been impacted by all the

00:00:15.545 --> 00:00:17.465
<v Speaker 0>things you've done, and I've been inspired by

00:00:17.465 --> 00:00:19.144
<v Speaker 0>all the things you've done and accomplished,

00:00:19.465 --> 00:00:21.865
<v Speaker 0>and it only makes me incrementally better. Right?

00:00:21.865 --> 00:00:23.465
<v Speaker 0>It's not the idea of, hey, I need

00:00:23.465 --> 00:00:24.889
<v Speaker 0>to take on something else, but to be

00:00:24.889 --> 00:00:26.489
<v Speaker 0>a lot more intentional. And I've seen that

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:28.089
<v Speaker 0>through you and in the work that you've

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:29.449
<v Speaker 0>done. And you know what, I wanna kind

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.209
<v Speaker 0>of emulate emulate some of that too if

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:32.969
<v Speaker 0>possible. So thank you for all you do.
