<v Speaker 0>Hello, and welcome to today's episode of Rawkode

00:01:26.945 --> 00:01:29.265
<v Speaker 0>Live. I am your host, Rawkode. Today, we

00:01:29.265 --> 00:01:31.345
<v Speaker 0>are gonna be taking a look at Policy

00:01:31.345 --> 00:01:32.305
<v Speaker 0>Reporter.

00:01:32.545 --> 00:01:35.425
<v Speaker 0>It is an open source software for hooking

00:01:35.425 --> 00:01:37.825
<v Speaker 0>up the policy reports from Kivernal to other

00:01:37.825 --> 00:01:39.665
<v Speaker 0>pieces of other

00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:42.510
<v Speaker 0>pieces of software to your monitoring systems so

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.510
<v Speaker 0>that you can get better visibility into the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.070
<v Speaker 0>policy violations and audits within your cluster.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.310
<v Speaker 0>Before we get started, this is a little

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.350

<v Speaker 0>wanna just start with a little bit of

00:03:08.225 --> 00:03:10.225
<v Speaker 0>a introduction to yourself, and then we'll talk

00:03:10.225 --> 00:03:11.880
<v Speaker 0>about Policy Reporter just after.

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:13.879
<v Speaker 1>Sure. I'm

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:14.600
<v Speaker 1>Frank

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.799
<v Speaker 1>in

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:16.840
<v Speaker 1>German.

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:21.480
<v Speaker 1>Frank j in the, yeah, communities

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 1>because it's much easier to say.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.425
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. How I say, I'm from Germany,

00:03:27.425 --> 00:03:29.185
<v Speaker 1>from the New York Dresden.

00:03:29.505 --> 00:03:33.665
<v Speaker 1>I'm working as software developer for Move Elevator.

00:03:33.985 --> 00:03:35.105
<v Speaker 1>We are a

00:03:35.825 --> 00:03:37.185
<v Speaker 1>company creating

00:03:37.265 --> 00:03:38.945
<v Speaker 1>custom applications

00:03:39.105 --> 00:03:40.865
<v Speaker 1>for our clients,

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.370
<v Speaker 1>mainly with PHP,

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Vue. Js, and, yeah, the old, good web

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.930
<v Speaker 1>stack.

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.650
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, I started with

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.210
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes and the cloud stuff

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:54.650
<v Speaker 1>for a year,

00:03:55.305 --> 00:03:57.945
<v Speaker 1>And I really like the community. It's

00:03:58.425 --> 00:04:01.465
<v Speaker 1>very cool to work with other people.

00:04:01.945 --> 00:04:04.745
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm today part of the Fackle

00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:05.465
<v Speaker 1>community

00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:07.705
<v Speaker 1>as well as Hiverno.

00:04:07.865 --> 00:04:09.145
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, I'm

00:04:09.465 --> 00:04:11.920
<v Speaker 1>in the Rawkode chat every day

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.160
<v Speaker 1>as well as the CNCN show.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.639
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Thank you very much for sharing that

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:17.360
<v Speaker 0>with us.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.560
<v Speaker 0>So

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.560
<v Speaker 0>today, we're taking a look at

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.045
<v Speaker 0>policy policy reporter. I I was gonna say

00:04:24.045 --> 00:04:25.805
<v Speaker 0>your latest open source project, but I don't

00:04:25.805 --> 00:04:27.485
<v Speaker 0>know like how many of these you just

00:04:27.485 --> 00:04:29.645
<v Speaker 0>have lying around. But Policy Reporter is is

00:04:29.645 --> 00:04:31.485
<v Speaker 0>a really cool project that we've been talking

00:04:31.485 --> 00:04:33.485
<v Speaker 0>about a lot on a Discord server and

00:04:33.485 --> 00:04:35.965
<v Speaker 0>you you're shipping updates so fast

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.830
<v Speaker 0>that it's just amazing to watch that evolve

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.710
<v Speaker 0>over time.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.630
<v Speaker 0>But why don't we take it back a

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.389
<v Speaker 0>little bit and you just tell us, like,

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:44.030
<v Speaker 0>what

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.150
<v Speaker 0>is the primary responsibility of your project policy

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.630
<v Speaker 0>reporter?

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:52.635
<v Speaker 1>The main goal is to get a better

00:04:52.955 --> 00:04:54.315
<v Speaker 1>visibility of

00:04:54.635 --> 00:04:57.275
<v Speaker 1>what happens with your Kiverno policies.

00:04:57.595 --> 00:04:58.235
<v Speaker 1>So

00:04:58.635 --> 00:05:00.315
<v Speaker 1>I use Kiverno

00:05:00.795 --> 00:05:01.435
<v Speaker 1>to

00:05:01.995 --> 00:05:03.595
<v Speaker 1>enforce more best practices.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.380
<v Speaker 1>But it's really hard

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.140
<v Speaker 1>to enforce everything

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.980
<v Speaker 1>because a developer's stuck. They have no no

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.460
<v Speaker 1>not much experience with Kubernetes. They don't know

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.180
<v Speaker 1>how to do things. So I thought it's

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.900
<v Speaker 1>better to audit these violations

00:05:18.865 --> 00:05:21.345
<v Speaker 1>and have, in the later point in time,

00:05:21.345 --> 00:05:22.305
<v Speaker 1>a look at it.

00:05:22.705 --> 00:05:25.585
<v Speaker 1>But, yeah, this was not that easy

00:05:26.384 --> 00:05:29.425
<v Speaker 1>because you only have this CLE

00:05:30.064 --> 00:05:30.865
<v Speaker 1>CRD

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.150
<v Speaker 1>commands to see what's going wrong.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Then it's across the complete cluster with many

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.030
<v Speaker 1>different namespaces.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.390
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, it's

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.390
<v Speaker 1>was not that easy. And so I

00:05:44.284 --> 00:05:46.845
<v Speaker 1>thought it's a good idea to create a

00:05:46.845 --> 00:05:49.085
<v Speaker 1>tool for this. I'm

00:05:49.085 --> 00:05:51.485
<v Speaker 1>part of a FARGO community. In FARGO, we

00:05:51.485 --> 00:05:53.565
<v Speaker 1>have a tool called FARGO Sidekick.

00:05:53.965 --> 00:05:55.805
<v Speaker 1>And FARGO Sidekick UI,

00:05:56.125 --> 00:05:57.880
<v Speaker 1>it's very similar.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.000
<v Speaker 1>You have a UI where your violations from

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Fireco are displayed. You have a table to

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.680
<v Speaker 1>filter, sort, and so on.

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:08.885
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, I translate this into Kaverner. And

00:06:08.885 --> 00:06:10.885
<v Speaker 1>so Policy Reporter was born.

00:06:12.325 --> 00:06:13.205
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:06:13.685 --> 00:06:15.285
<v Speaker 0>So I think that's a really

00:06:15.845 --> 00:06:18.325
<v Speaker 0>common story that, you know, I hear when

00:06:18.325 --> 00:06:19.765
<v Speaker 0>I'm speaking to people in the cloud native

00:06:19.765 --> 00:06:22.010
<v Speaker 0>ecosystem is that they want to adopt, you

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.170
<v Speaker 0>know, tools like Kiverrnal and open policy agent

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.770
<v Speaker 0>and all of these best practices.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.210
<v Speaker 0>But at the same time,

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.530
<v Speaker 0>you know, the platform teams and the SRE

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.090
<v Speaker 0>teams want their developers to be as productive

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.570
<v Speaker 0>as possible, especially with learning all of these

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.365
<v Speaker 0>new technologies as well. So moving and having

00:06:37.365 --> 00:06:39.685
<v Speaker 0>policies run-in audit mode rather than force mode,

00:06:39.685 --> 00:06:42.485
<v Speaker 0>I think is is extremely common. I think

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:44.565
<v Speaker 0>what you articulated well there is that you

00:06:44.565 --> 00:06:47.285
<v Speaker 0>you gotta do something with those audit logs,

00:06:47.445 --> 00:06:49.125
<v Speaker 0>and that's where Policy Reporter comes in. It

00:06:49.125 --> 00:06:50.565
<v Speaker 0>gives us the ability to hook it up

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.640
<v Speaker 0>to our existing tooling like Prometheus and Loki,

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.760
<v Speaker 0>and we'll take a look at this on

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:55.960
<v Speaker 0>the hands on bit. But

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.520
<v Speaker 0>just making sure that they're not lost in

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.600
<v Speaker 0>the abyss, the noise or the migrations or

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.360
<v Speaker 0>all those other things that we have surrounded

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.675
<v Speaker 0>us all the time. So very,

00:07:04.995 --> 00:07:05.555
<v Speaker 0>very We

00:07:06.275 --> 00:07:10.035
<v Speaker 0>have a question now from Carlos.

00:07:11.155 --> 00:07:14.035
<v Speaker 0>Carlos is curious of how does this compare

00:07:14.035 --> 00:07:16.675
<v Speaker 0>to other solutions that are pros and cons?

00:07:17.509 --> 00:07:19.910
<v Speaker 0>Is there anything similar to Policy Reporter out

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:20.870
<v Speaker 0>there at the moment?

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:25.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't know other tools for Kivera, especially.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if there is anything else

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.030
<v Speaker 1>in the OPA community.

00:07:30.915 --> 00:07:34.275
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure about the products from the

00:07:34.275 --> 00:07:36.115
<v Speaker 1>as a company behind.

00:07:38.355 --> 00:07:41.235
<v Speaker 1>I think if so, the main difference would

00:07:41.235 --> 00:07:44.275
<v Speaker 1>be that it's not a platform or any

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.200
<v Speaker 1>byte solution. It's

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.080
<v Speaker 1>open source tool to install, to debug your

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.800
<v Speaker 1>policies. You can try what is affected.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.520
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't need it anymore because

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.895
<v Speaker 1>you're in a production environment,

00:08:00.135 --> 00:08:01.735
<v Speaker 1>you can remove it easily.

00:08:02.695 --> 00:08:03.335
<v Speaker 1>So,

00:08:03.655 --> 00:08:07.095
<v Speaker 1>yeah, it's a small small application, I think.

00:08:07.335 --> 00:08:09.655
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's touch on one of other Carlos's

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:11.574
<v Speaker 0>questions just before we we kinda move on

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:13.610
<v Speaker 0>a little bit here. So Carlos says, they're

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.410
<v Speaker 0>a little confused. Is it Falco versus Kiverna?

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:18.650
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna assume you would run both, but

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:20.170
<v Speaker 0>do you wanna just give me your thoughts

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:20.810
<v Speaker 0>on that?

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:23.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I'm running both.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:28.945
<v Speaker 1>Security in Kubernetes has more than one layer.

00:08:28.945 --> 00:08:31.185
<v Speaker 1>You have runtime things. You have

00:08:31.585 --> 00:08:34.065
<v Speaker 1>money manifest validation.

00:08:34.625 --> 00:08:37.105
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, Faggle is security

00:08:37.184 --> 00:08:38.225
<v Speaker 1>at runtime.

00:08:38.865 --> 00:08:40.304
<v Speaker 1>It tracks if

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.870
<v Speaker 1>you SSH in a node.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.230
<v Speaker 1>If you change a file in a it's

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:47.430
<v Speaker 1>a c it

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.350
<v Speaker 1>its directory

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:51.190
<v Speaker 1>or in the root system,

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:54.310
<v Speaker 1>it affects all this this time on runtime.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:55.589
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, you can

00:08:56.285 --> 00:08:57.005
<v Speaker 1>also

00:08:57.485 --> 00:08:58.045
<v Speaker 1>alert

00:08:59.005 --> 00:08:59.805
<v Speaker 1>track

00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:02.685
<v Speaker 1>track or alerts and other applications.

00:09:04.045 --> 00:09:08.125
<v Speaker 1>But Kavana is for static validation, I think.

00:09:08.125 --> 00:09:09.245
<v Speaker 1>So more you

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.300
<v Speaker 1>if you have resources defined in your manifest,

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.860
<v Speaker 1>if you don't use latest, all these

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:19.300
<v Speaker 1>things,

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:20.820
<v Speaker 1>it's related to

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.780
<v Speaker 1>port security policies where you

00:09:24.384 --> 00:09:25.505
<v Speaker 1>try to remove

00:09:25.745 --> 00:09:29.345
<v Speaker 1>host paths, host ports, these things. So it's

00:09:29.345 --> 00:09:31.985
<v Speaker 1>another level of security, I think. It's Oh,

00:09:31.985 --> 00:09:33.345
<v Speaker 0>yes. Best differentiation.

00:09:33.745 --> 00:09:35.904
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I couldn't agree more. I think Falco

00:09:35.904 --> 00:09:37.904
<v Speaker 0>fits into that space. Like you said, runtime

00:09:37.904 --> 00:09:39.824
<v Speaker 0>security is monitoring syscalls

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.980
<v Speaker 0>on the kernel and alerting you when things

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.580
<v Speaker 0>are doing things that you maybe don't want

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:44.300
<v Speaker 0>them to do.

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.340
<v Speaker 0>Kiverrno and open policy agent on the other

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.020
<v Speaker 0>side, they're taking a look more at the

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.500
<v Speaker 0>declaration or the manifest that we're applying to

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.260
<v Speaker 0>our cluster and making sure that they conform

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
<v Speaker 0>to the constraints that we apply as well.

00:09:56.275 --> 00:09:58.115
<v Speaker 0>And we'll see that, you know, we've we've

00:09:58.115 --> 00:09:59.075
<v Speaker 0>got, well,

00:09:59.395 --> 00:10:01.075
<v Speaker 0>not a cluster. I have a Docker for

00:10:01.075 --> 00:10:03.155
<v Speaker 0>Mac, which has got a Kubernetes API where

00:10:03.155 --> 00:10:04.755
<v Speaker 0>I have deployed Kiverno.

00:10:05.155 --> 00:10:06.515
<v Speaker 0>I think what we can we can do

00:10:06.515 --> 00:10:08.115
<v Speaker 0>to start with is maybe just take a

00:10:08.115 --> 00:10:11.110
<v Speaker 0>look at the pod security policy replacement policies

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.310
<v Speaker 0>from Kiverrno.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:13.990
<v Speaker 0>I can't remember if it ships with a

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:15.670
<v Speaker 0>default report, but maybe we can look at

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.910
<v Speaker 0>that and and actually see the problem. Right?

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.070
<v Speaker 0>Is that Kiverrno does expose some of this

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.670
<v Speaker 0>information, but not in a way that is

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:22.470
<v Speaker 0>consumable

00:10:22.815 --> 00:10:24.975
<v Speaker 0>by other tooling. And then then we can

00:10:24.975 --> 00:10:27.375
<v Speaker 0>move move into Policy Reporter. How does that

00:10:27.375 --> 00:10:31.055
<v Speaker 0>sound to you, Frank? Yep. Makes sense. Awesome.

00:10:31.535 --> 00:10:32.655
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's

00:10:32.975 --> 00:10:35.295
<v Speaker 0>get my screen share up. So for anyone

00:10:35.295 --> 00:10:36.895
<v Speaker 0>who wants to follow along or is watching

00:10:36.895 --> 00:10:38.895
<v Speaker 0>this not in real time, you can find

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:39.990
<v Speaker 0>Policy Reporter,

00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:42.149
<v Speaker 0>Frank's GitHub

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:43.350
<v Speaker 0>username

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:47.110
<v Speaker 0>slash policy dash reporter.

00:10:47.589 --> 00:10:48.310
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:52.709
<v Speaker 0>Now what if I go prepared upfront?

00:10:53.894 --> 00:10:56.375
<v Speaker 0>Very, very little. I have Docker for Mac

00:10:56.375 --> 00:10:59.095
<v Speaker 0>running. I have deployed Kiverno.

00:10:59.735 --> 00:11:02.855
<v Speaker 0>I've got Kip Prometheus deployed as per Frank's

00:11:02.855 --> 00:11:05.175
<v Speaker 0>request. Oh, no. My note export is broken.

00:11:05.175 --> 00:11:07.654
<v Speaker 0>Although that probably wouldn't work in Docker for

00:11:07.654 --> 00:11:08.454
<v Speaker 0>Mac, so that's okay.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.280
<v Speaker 0>Which gives us a Prometheus operator, a Grafana,

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.040
<v Speaker 0>and a Prometheus instance.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.640
<v Speaker 0>So pretty much all the tools that we

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.880
<v Speaker 0>wanna kinda hook into and and show what's

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.760
<v Speaker 0>happening. So

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.280
<v Speaker 0>what's the best way for someone new to

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.774
<v Speaker 0>Policy Reporter to get started? Do you want

00:11:24.774 --> 00:11:26.055
<v Speaker 0>me to pop open the docs, or do

00:11:26.055 --> 00:11:27.975
<v Speaker 0>you wanna just go off script? What what

00:11:27.975 --> 00:11:28.695
<v Speaker 0>are you thinking?

00:11:29.815 --> 00:11:31.574
<v Speaker 1>I think the easiest thought is with the

00:11:31.574 --> 00:11:33.175
<v Speaker 1>policy report UI.

00:11:33.574 --> 00:11:34.295
<v Speaker 1>It's

00:11:34.454 --> 00:11:35.975
<v Speaker 1>yeah. You

00:11:36.959 --> 00:11:39.519
<v Speaker 1>add the repo as available as hand chart,

00:11:39.519 --> 00:11:40.480
<v Speaker 1>so it's

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.120
<v Speaker 1>very easy to install it.

00:11:44.959 --> 00:11:45.600
<v Speaker 1>Then,

00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:49.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah, you have this basic installation be but

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.895
<v Speaker 1>this is only the metrics for Grafana, so

00:11:51.895 --> 00:11:54.855
<v Speaker 1>you need an existing monitoring to use this.

00:11:55.335 --> 00:11:58.215
<v Speaker 1>So the, yeah, way easier part would be

00:11:58.215 --> 00:12:00.535
<v Speaker 1>the second installation where you enable

00:12:01.255 --> 00:12:05.240
<v Speaker 1>the UI and have a standalone UI UI

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.000
<v Speaker 1>where you can start from.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.839
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So I can just copy and paste

00:12:10.839 --> 00:12:12.920
<v Speaker 0>this helm install command that sets the value

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.480
<v Speaker 0>to true for the UI deployment, and I'm

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.279
<v Speaker 0>still gonna get the Prometheus exposition. Is is

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:18.920
<v Speaker 0>that correct?

00:12:20.335 --> 00:12:24.655
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You the the parameters metrics are default,

00:12:24.655 --> 00:12:26.415
<v Speaker 1>so they're always enabled.

00:12:26.575 --> 00:12:29.135
<v Speaker 1>With the UI enabled, you get a second

00:12:29.135 --> 00:12:32.575
<v Speaker 1>application's UI. So it's not backed into the

00:12:32.575 --> 00:12:34.255
<v Speaker 1>Policy Reporter. It's

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:36.340
<v Speaker 1>standalone

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.020
<v Speaker 1>application which works over a REST API policy

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:40.900
<v Speaker 1>reporter.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:42.340
<v Speaker 1>And

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.620
<v Speaker 1>you can access UI over

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:46.820
<v Speaker 1>port forward.

00:12:47.435 --> 00:12:50.955
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Perfect. Okay. So I've added your Helm

00:12:50.955 --> 00:12:51.835
<v Speaker 0>repository.

00:12:52.635 --> 00:12:55.675
<v Speaker 0>I'm now doing the Policy Reporter installation

00:12:55.755 --> 00:12:57.435
<v Speaker 0>with the UI enabled,

00:12:57.435 --> 00:13:00.235
<v Speaker 0>and then I'm gonna copy and paste the

00:13:00.235 --> 00:13:00.955
<v Speaker 0>port forward,

00:13:01.959 --> 00:13:03.720
<v Speaker 0>which I'm assuming is just gonna take me

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.000
<v Speaker 0>straight in to the UI if I knew

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.400
<v Speaker 0>how to copy and paste. There we go.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.120
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.200
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So okay. So it's just pulling some

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.959
<v Speaker 0>images right now. We'll give that just a

00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:14.760
<v Speaker 0>few seconds

00:13:15.855 --> 00:13:17.135
<v Speaker 0>We'll get started.

00:13:17.375 --> 00:13:18.335
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

00:13:22.575 --> 00:13:24.415
<v Speaker 0>Why are you pending?

00:13:25.855 --> 00:13:26.895
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no. There we go.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.720
<v Speaker 0>Just me being impatient. So this is pro

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.200
<v Speaker 0>forward into 8082.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.080
<v Speaker 0>Ta da.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.120
<v Speaker 0>Easy. Yeah.

00:13:42.835 --> 00:13:44.755
<v Speaker 0>Love it I love it when things are

00:13:44.755 --> 00:13:45.955
<v Speaker 0>just, you know,

00:13:46.435 --> 00:13:49.635
<v Speaker 0>helm repository at helm install. Like, job is

00:13:49.635 --> 00:13:51.475
<v Speaker 0>done. There you go. There's your next UI.

00:13:51.475 --> 00:13:54.115
<v Speaker 0>Oh, look at material and shiny. Very, very

00:13:54.115 --> 00:13:54.275
<v Speaker 0>cool.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:57.490
<v Speaker 1>Hamstrap reduce reduce

00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:00.370
<v Speaker 1>the effort to get started because it's, you

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:02.290
<v Speaker 1>know, has all this default

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:03.570
<v Speaker 1>URLs,

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.930
<v Speaker 1>ports, and so on. So it's all configured

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:07.810
<v Speaker 1>for you behind.

00:14:09.285 --> 00:14:12.165
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, you see your first violations

00:14:12.325 --> 00:14:13.765
<v Speaker 1>for the monitoring

00:14:13.765 --> 00:14:15.685
<v Speaker 1>ports because, you know,

00:14:16.085 --> 00:14:18.165
<v Speaker 1>they has host paths and

00:14:18.965 --> 00:14:20.645
<v Speaker 1>host namespace configured,

00:14:21.365 --> 00:14:23.605
<v Speaker 1>which is not allowed with the PSP

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:25.900
<v Speaker 1>policy no.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Pod security policies, so to say.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.100
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:33.980
<v Speaker 0>an issue I what I'm seeing is just

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.555
<v Speaker 0>how many policy violations we have. We've got

00:14:36.555 --> 00:14:38.235
<v Speaker 0>a kind of graph here. So I'm assuming

00:14:38.235 --> 00:14:39.995
<v Speaker 0>if we fix any of these, if we

00:14:39.995 --> 00:14:41.435
<v Speaker 0>can fix any of them, we'll start to

00:14:41.435 --> 00:14:44.715
<v Speaker 0>see this drop. We've got failing cluster policies.

00:14:45.275 --> 00:14:47.355
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. What's the difference here? Is that

00:14:48.779 --> 00:14:50.779
<v Speaker 1>The the dashboard is a overlook

00:14:51.259 --> 00:14:52.860
<v Speaker 1>of failing resources,

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.579
<v Speaker 1>so you don't see any passes because it's

00:14:55.579 --> 00:14:57.339
<v Speaker 1>a, you know, short introduction.

00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:59.899
<v Speaker 1>And the main diff or the the only

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:02.940
<v Speaker 1>difference besides

00:15:02.555 --> 00:15:05.035
<v Speaker 1>policy report and the cluster policy report is

00:15:05.035 --> 00:15:07.035
<v Speaker 1>that the cluster policy report

00:15:07.275 --> 00:15:10.395
<v Speaker 1>is only for resources that are cluster scoped,

00:15:10.395 --> 00:15:11.515
<v Speaker 1>like namespaces.

00:15:12.075 --> 00:15:14.875
<v Speaker 0>Got it. So they have its own CID

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.760
<v Speaker 1>in Kiverno and also in the

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.000
<v Speaker 1>policy report standard.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.960
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a yeah. It's different.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.640
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So should I click on policy reports?

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.274
<v Speaker 0>Should I click on one of these things?

00:15:30.274 --> 00:15:31.475
<v Speaker 0>What do wanna look at?

00:15:33.315 --> 00:15:34.995
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. If you click on any of these

00:15:34.995 --> 00:15:37.714
<v Speaker 1>labels, it's only a filter for the table.

00:15:37.714 --> 00:15:39.795
<v Speaker 1>So you have a search field so you

00:15:39.795 --> 00:15:40.915
<v Speaker 1>can easily

00:15:41.315 --> 00:15:42.435
<v Speaker 1>filter for a specific

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:47.800
<v Speaker 1>policy or rule or severity if supported.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.360
<v Speaker 1>And I think you can go to the

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.480
<v Speaker 1>policy reports. There is a more detailed use

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.560
<v Speaker 1>only for the policy

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:56.680
<v Speaker 1>report CID.

00:15:57.645 --> 00:15:58.285
<v Speaker 1>So

00:15:59.085 --> 00:16:02.205
<v Speaker 1>at first, you don't see any violations

00:16:02.205 --> 00:16:04.685
<v Speaker 1>because you have a default filter for a

00:16:04.685 --> 00:16:05.805
<v Speaker 1>single policy

00:16:05.805 --> 00:16:06.845
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning.

00:16:07.245 --> 00:16:08.205
<v Speaker 1>But you can

00:16:08.685 --> 00:16:11.485
<v Speaker 1>open this select field, and you should have

00:16:12.399 --> 00:16:14.320
<v Speaker 1>option for all policies.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:15.840
<v Speaker 1>So you can

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.360
<v Speaker 1>define what you were looking for if you

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.760
<v Speaker 1>would like to see any violations

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.399
<v Speaker 1>or for a single policy or for a

00:16:24.399 --> 00:16:25.200
<v Speaker 1>set of policies.

00:16:26.485 --> 00:16:29.045
<v Speaker 1>And if you like, you have also a

00:16:29.045 --> 00:16:29.925
<v Speaker 1>optional

00:16:30.005 --> 00:16:32.404
<v Speaker 1>filter on the right side for only a

00:16:32.404 --> 00:16:34.964
<v Speaker 1>namespace. So you can also recreate the view

00:16:34.964 --> 00:16:36.805
<v Speaker 1>of a single report for a single namespace

00:16:36.805 --> 00:16:37.365
<v Speaker 1>if you like.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:38.980
<v Speaker 1>It's Yeah.

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:40.260
<v Speaker 1>On you.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:42.980
<v Speaker 0>I I think I prefer looking at the

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.060
<v Speaker 0>sea of green passes rather than my three

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:46.580
<v Speaker 0>failing policies.

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.220
<v Speaker 0>At at least we can see here what

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.220
<v Speaker 0>what's happening and how the policies are being

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.740
<v Speaker 0>used and consumed, which is

00:16:53.394 --> 00:16:54.355
<v Speaker 0>I think just

00:16:54.915 --> 00:16:57.235
<v Speaker 0>exposing more of this information in an official

00:16:57.235 --> 00:16:59.555
<v Speaker 0>way is really important for people to understand

00:16:59.555 --> 00:17:01.635
<v Speaker 0>what is happening and and just get more

00:17:01.635 --> 00:17:03.635
<v Speaker 0>comfortable using tools like this.

00:17:04.035 --> 00:17:04.355
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.319
<v Speaker 1>Standard for policy reports has two more status

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:12.200
<v Speaker 1>codes, and they also have error and warning.

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:14.040
<v Speaker 1>But at

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.599
<v Speaker 1>this time only has passed and failed

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:17.879
<v Speaker 1>violations.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.240
<v Speaker 1>If

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:23.415
<v Speaker 1>our feature future tools also use the CRD

00:17:23.415 --> 00:17:24.054
<v Speaker 1>like,

00:17:24.695 --> 00:17:27.494
<v Speaker 1>they have this additional status codes, you will

00:17:27.494 --> 00:17:31.015
<v Speaker 1>all also see additional tables for status

00:17:31.015 --> 00:17:31.655
<v Speaker 1>codes.

00:17:32.055 --> 00:17:35.415
<v Speaker 1>So it's high the UI hide automatically

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.779
<v Speaker 1>all tables and charts

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:39.299
<v Speaker 1>without any value.

00:17:41.299 --> 00:17:42.019
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:43.139
<v Speaker 0>So

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.260
<v Speaker 0>I just wanna understand then, like, you know,

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.660
<v Speaker 0>we've deployed Policy Reporter and the UI. They're

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:51.815
<v Speaker 0>two separate deployments, two separate pieces of software.

00:17:52.215 --> 00:17:56.134
<v Speaker 0>Is the Policy Reporter UI just creating Kubernetes

00:17:56.134 --> 00:17:57.494
<v Speaker 0>API for

00:17:57.815 --> 00:17:59.494
<v Speaker 0>the Kivernal reports,

00:17:59.495 --> 00:18:02.134
<v Speaker 0>or is it going through Policy Reporter in

00:18:02.134 --> 00:18:03.735
<v Speaker 0>the middle? Like, how how does this actually

00:18:03.735 --> 00:18:04.934
<v Speaker 0>work? It's

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.779
<v Speaker 1>working with the Policy Reporter together.

00:18:08.179 --> 00:18:09.460
<v Speaker 1>Policy Reporter

00:18:10.179 --> 00:18:11.940
<v Speaker 1>fetches over the

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.899
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes API the CRDs

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.580
<v Speaker 1>and convert them

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.739
<v Speaker 1>in the one side into

00:18:19.059 --> 00:18:20.260
<v Speaker 1>parameters metrics

00:18:20.585 --> 00:18:23.065
<v Speaker 1>and the other side in a custom

00:18:23.065 --> 00:18:24.105
<v Speaker 1>structure,

00:18:24.585 --> 00:18:25.145
<v Speaker 1>which

00:18:25.385 --> 00:18:26.265
<v Speaker 1>also

00:18:27.385 --> 00:18:30.425
<v Speaker 1>available as REST API. So the Policy Reporter

00:18:30.425 --> 00:18:31.705
<v Speaker 1>has a REST API,

00:18:32.185 --> 00:18:33.865
<v Speaker 1>which you can also use with your own

00:18:33.865 --> 00:18:36.740
<v Speaker 1>tools. The UI is not required. They are

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.980
<v Speaker 1>open and also available endpoint.

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.820
<v Speaker 1>And UI use this REST API from the

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.860
<v Speaker 1>policy reported UI Policy Reporter

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:46.980
<v Speaker 1>and

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.060
<v Speaker 1>has

00:18:49.745 --> 00:18:51.025
<v Speaker 1>a proxy

00:18:51.025 --> 00:18:54.705
<v Speaker 1>back end because if you put forward your

00:18:54.785 --> 00:18:57.025
<v Speaker 1>Policy Reporter UI, you need access to the

00:18:57.025 --> 00:18:58.705
<v Speaker 1>API it's fetching from.

00:18:59.105 --> 00:19:01.345
<v Speaker 1>So you can only fetch from the

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.320
<v Speaker 1>back end from the Policy Reporter UI, and

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.560
<v Speaker 1>so you need some API in the middle.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.600
<v Speaker 1>But this API fetches information from the Policy

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:13.040
<v Speaker 1>Reporter and forward it to the UI itself.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.654
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Very cool.

00:19:15.215 --> 00:19:17.294
<v Speaker 0>We have a question

00:19:17.455 --> 00:19:18.094
<v Speaker 0>from

00:19:18.575 --> 00:19:21.375
<v Speaker 0>Walid who is asking, can I monitor the

00:19:21.375 --> 00:19:22.734
<v Speaker 0>audited policies

00:19:22.894 --> 00:19:23.774
<v Speaker 0>only?

00:19:24.255 --> 00:19:25.774
<v Speaker 0>And then a little bit of a follow-up

00:19:25.774 --> 00:19:27.855
<v Speaker 0>is, like, audit events not enforced.

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.910
<v Speaker 0>Maybe we could just explain the difference between

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:33.549
<v Speaker 0>Kivernal policies with enforced mode and audit mode

00:19:33.549 --> 00:19:35.470
<v Speaker 0>and what that actually means as well. You

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:36.669
<v Speaker 0>wanna dive into that?

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:38.029
<v Speaker 1>Sure.

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:40.429
<v Speaker 1>Audit events

00:19:40.669 --> 00:19:43.470
<v Speaker 1>don't affect you if you apply any manifests.

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:47.105
<v Speaker 1>It's creating this policy report in the background,

00:19:47.185 --> 00:19:48.304
<v Speaker 1>and you can

00:19:48.465 --> 00:19:51.505
<v Speaker 1>access this information when anything violates.

00:19:51.505 --> 00:19:53.184
<v Speaker 1>If you have an enforced mode,

00:19:53.425 --> 00:19:56.465
<v Speaker 1>it blocks you from applying this manifest. So

00:19:56.465 --> 00:19:56.785
<v Speaker 1>you

00:19:57.649 --> 00:19:59.250
<v Speaker 1>the the kubectl

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:02.209
<v Speaker 1>will return an error with the message

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:03.969
<v Speaker 1>from your policy.

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:06.769
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, you have to fix the manifest

00:20:06.769 --> 00:20:08.690
<v Speaker 1>before you can apply it to a cluster.

00:20:09.169 --> 00:20:10.529
<v Speaker 1>Kavura offers

00:20:10.929 --> 00:20:13.250
<v Speaker 1>configuration in your policies, the background.

00:20:15.305 --> 00:20:16.745
<v Speaker 1>Background has

00:20:18.265 --> 00:20:19.545
<v Speaker 1>well, background

00:20:20.265 --> 00:20:21.705
<v Speaker 1>is used to

00:20:22.905 --> 00:20:26.265
<v Speaker 1>validate existing resources. When you apply a new

00:20:26.265 --> 00:20:29.930
<v Speaker 1>policy in an enforced mode, you enforce new

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:31.690
<v Speaker 1>manifests. It has no

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:36.570
<v Speaker 1>don't it's used for existing resources.

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:40.570
<v Speaker 1>So with the background enabled, it also scans

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:44.144
<v Speaker 1>existing resources and creates a report for it.

00:20:44.225 --> 00:20:46.144
<v Speaker 1>So if you apply an enforce

00:20:47.184 --> 00:20:50.145
<v Speaker 1>policy with the background scan enabled, you also

00:20:50.145 --> 00:20:52.065
<v Speaker 1>get the report for this policy, and you

00:20:52.065 --> 00:20:53.504
<v Speaker 1>also see the result

00:20:53.745 --> 00:20:55.664
<v Speaker 1>for these policies in the UI.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.940
<v Speaker 1>So you can also track the violations for

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.220
<v Speaker 1>existing resources.

00:21:02.419 --> 00:21:03.139
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:07.700
<v Speaker 0>Slight segue then. I'm assuming you run this

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.700
<v Speaker 0>in your production Kubernetes environment?

00:21:12.355 --> 00:21:14.195
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. How I say I'm

00:21:15.235 --> 00:21:16.515
<v Speaker 1>using Kubernetes

00:21:16.515 --> 00:21:20.114
<v Speaker 1>in my free time as a hobby project.

00:21:20.595 --> 00:21:23.554
<v Speaker 1>We introduced Kubernetes in my company

00:21:24.195 --> 00:21:28.115
<v Speaker 1>a few weeks ago and created our

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:28.409
<v Speaker 1>first

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:31.690
<v Speaker 1>playground Kubernetes.

00:21:32.809 --> 00:21:35.369
<v Speaker 1>But we don't have any production

00:21:37.049 --> 00:21:37.850
<v Speaker 1>applications

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:38.890
<v Speaker 1>running on

00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:40.174
<v Speaker 1>cloud services?

00:21:40.415 --> 00:21:43.215
<v Speaker 0>Not yet. That day is coming. Not yet.

00:21:43.215 --> 00:21:45.455
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I am working on it.

00:21:45.935 --> 00:21:47.935
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Okay. I'll just I guess, we'll you

00:21:47.935 --> 00:21:50.015
<v Speaker 0>know, we can kinda speak hypothetically then. But

00:21:50.015 --> 00:21:52.495
<v Speaker 0>I'm I'm gonna assume that it's okay to

00:21:52.495 --> 00:21:55.200
<v Speaker 0>have policies that are failing and be aware

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.760
<v Speaker 0>of it rather than having policies not enforced

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.480
<v Speaker 0>at all. I can imagine, especially maybe in

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.080
<v Speaker 0>my own production environments, is it

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.400
<v Speaker 0>as the goal to have

00:22:04.975 --> 00:22:07.774
<v Speaker 0>zero failing policies, or is it just to

00:22:07.774 --> 00:22:09.615
<v Speaker 0>keep that number going down? Do you get

00:22:09.615 --> 00:22:10.894
<v Speaker 0>any opinions on that?

00:22:11.294 --> 00:22:14.254
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that you have to fix

00:22:14.254 --> 00:22:15.294
<v Speaker 1>all issues.

00:22:15.375 --> 00:22:19.054
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you can't really fix it because

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:21.070
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's an application you installed with Helm,

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:23.390
<v Speaker 1>and you don't have access to this

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:24.990
<v Speaker 1>configuration.

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you have tools. They need this

00:22:30.865 --> 00:22:33.825
<v Speaker 1>host path, for example Yeah. To work with.

00:22:34.225 --> 00:22:35.105
<v Speaker 1>LongHorn

00:22:35.105 --> 00:22:36.544
<v Speaker 1>as storage

00:22:37.505 --> 00:22:38.464
<v Speaker 1>application

00:22:38.465 --> 00:22:41.585
<v Speaker 1>or fleet or something like this. So you

00:22:41.585 --> 00:22:42.544
<v Speaker 1>can't fix everything.

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:47.490
<v Speaker 1>I use it as best practices. So it's

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:50.610
<v Speaker 1>good if they pass, but it's not required.

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:53.010
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you create

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:56.370
<v Speaker 1>a policy to get some information about your

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:57.250
<v Speaker 1>environment.

00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:59.650
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you want to know which

00:23:00.475 --> 00:23:02.794
<v Speaker 1>pod's running with the latest image. So you

00:23:02.794 --> 00:23:05.195
<v Speaker 1>can create a policy. You can set to

00:23:05.195 --> 00:23:08.474
<v Speaker 1>audit mode, apply it, see the result, and

00:23:08.475 --> 00:23:09.754
<v Speaker 1>remove it instantly.

00:23:09.914 --> 00:23:12.394
<v Speaker 1>So it's also a tool to get

00:23:12.715 --> 00:23:14.554
<v Speaker 1>any information you want from your cluster.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:16.999
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Thank you.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.360
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.360
<v Speaker 0>Is there anything else you wanna look at

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.799
<v Speaker 0>in the UI before we move on to

00:23:21.799 --> 00:23:23.080
<v Speaker 0>other best NPCs?

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.000
<v Speaker 1>You can click on locks,

00:23:27.575 --> 00:23:29.335
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if there are no.

00:23:29.335 --> 00:23:31.975
<v Speaker 1>Not Yeah. My local cluster may not really

00:23:31.975 --> 00:23:34.615
<v Speaker 0>have much going on. Yeah.

00:23:34.615 --> 00:23:34.934
<v Speaker 1>It's

00:23:35.415 --> 00:23:37.975
<v Speaker 1>the locks are coming when you deploy

00:23:38.375 --> 00:23:39.895
<v Speaker 1>violations after the

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:43.500
<v Speaker 1>UI started. So you started the UI right

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.340
<v Speaker 1>now. So there was

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:47.740
<v Speaker 1>no new workload, so it didn't work. But

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.220
<v Speaker 1>we can also see this maybe later on

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.660
<v Speaker 1>when we did some stuff.

00:23:52.795 --> 00:23:55.915
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So we've got some default policies installed.

00:23:55.915 --> 00:23:57.515
<v Speaker 0>I'm sure we can definitely violate a couple

00:23:57.515 --> 00:23:59.835
<v Speaker 0>of them and see those logs coming in.

00:24:00.955 --> 00:24:02.475
<v Speaker 0>Why don't we take a look? You know,

00:24:02.475 --> 00:24:04.475
<v Speaker 0>we've got all of this deployed to the

00:24:04.475 --> 00:24:05.275
<v Speaker 0>to the cluster

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:09.370
<v Speaker 0>with Prometheus and Grafana. So can we walk

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:11.770
<v Speaker 0>through the process and the steps involved for,

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:13.289
<v Speaker 0>you know, maybe bells on out my own

00:24:13.289 --> 00:24:14.570
<v Speaker 0>little dashboard here?

00:24:16.809 --> 00:24:19.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. To getting started with Grafana.

00:24:20.535 --> 00:24:23.255
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So you said that

00:24:25.335 --> 00:24:27.175
<v Speaker 0>policy report are running in the cluster. It

00:24:27.175 --> 00:24:29.655
<v Speaker 0>takes all of the policy reports from Kiverno

00:24:29.655 --> 00:24:32.455
<v Speaker 0>and produces Prometheus metrics. So I'm assuming the

00:24:32.455 --> 00:24:33.815
<v Speaker 0>first thing we wanna do is is make

00:24:33.815 --> 00:24:35.495
<v Speaker 0>sure that those are being consumed by the

00:24:35.495 --> 00:24:38.110
<v Speaker 0>Prometheus and our our Kubernetes environment. Yes.

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:41.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:42.190
<v Speaker 1>can

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:45.870
<v Speaker 1>when you're running with Prometheus

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:46.830
<v Speaker 1>operator,

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:49.309
<v Speaker 1>you can use optional

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:50.590
<v Speaker 1>monitoring

00:24:51.565 --> 00:24:53.645
<v Speaker 1>sub chart of Policy Reporter.

00:24:54.045 --> 00:24:57.725
<v Speaker 1>It provides you a service monitor, a CID

00:24:57.725 --> 00:24:59.565
<v Speaker 1>for this operator to

00:24:59.565 --> 00:25:01.405
<v Speaker 1>scrape the metrics,

00:25:01.885 --> 00:25:03.645
<v Speaker 1>and it provides also

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:07.049
<v Speaker 1>configurable

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:10.009
<v Speaker 1>dashboards for Grafana, if you like.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:11.210
<v Speaker 1>So

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:12.889
<v Speaker 1>to

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:14.730
<v Speaker 1>running the

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:17.289
<v Speaker 1>installed version of your operator,

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:19.529
<v Speaker 1>you have to

00:25:20.225 --> 00:25:20.945
<v Speaker 1>I

00:25:21.185 --> 00:25:22.145
<v Speaker 1>don't know if

00:25:22.465 --> 00:25:25.505
<v Speaker 1>it's good to do it over the CLI.

00:25:25.505 --> 00:25:27.585
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the values YAML is

00:25:27.825 --> 00:25:30.065
<v Speaker 1>better in this case because we have

00:25:31.425 --> 00:25:32.945
<v Speaker 1>to configure a few things.

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:36.130
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. You're right. Okay. So

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:38.930
<v Speaker 0>where is that first one? So we enabled

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:41.650
<v Speaker 0>UI dot enabled. That's all so far. So

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:43.570
<v Speaker 0>why don't we do I think I created

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:44.610
<v Speaker 0>a YAML. There we go.

00:25:48.545 --> 00:25:50.705
<v Speaker 0>Oh, that's the Cavernon YAML. Okay. Alright.

00:25:51.265 --> 00:25:52.385
<v Speaker 0>So UI

00:25:52.945 --> 00:25:53.825
<v Speaker 0>enabled.

00:25:53.905 --> 00:25:55.745
<v Speaker 0>True. This is always done so far, I

00:25:55.745 --> 00:25:57.425
<v Speaker 0>believe. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

00:25:57.905 --> 00:25:58.705
<v Speaker 0>What

00:25:58.705 --> 00:26:00.945
<v Speaker 0>this other command you've got here from the

00:26:00.945 --> 00:26:03.160
<v Speaker 0>documentation is saying is that we can turn

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.280
<v Speaker 0>on monitoring

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.240
<v Speaker 0>dot enabled and then provide a

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.600
<v Speaker 0>name space.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:10.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.880
<v Speaker 1>You need to enable the monitoring.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.605
<v Speaker 1>That's enabled part of the name space.

00:26:16.845 --> 00:26:18.365
<v Speaker 1>When you're using this

00:26:18.845 --> 00:26:20.445
<v Speaker 1>prometheus operator,

00:26:21.165 --> 00:26:22.284
<v Speaker 1>you have to

00:26:22.525 --> 00:26:25.805
<v Speaker 1>install the config maps, which include the configuration

00:26:25.805 --> 00:26:27.885
<v Speaker 1>for the Grafana dashboards in the same name

00:26:27.885 --> 00:26:29.965
<v Speaker 1>space as Grafana.

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:33.510
<v Speaker 1>So that's why you need to declare namespace

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:36.390
<v Speaker 1>where the Grafana lives in.

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:38.710
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:40.950
<v Speaker 0>So where is my I think it's just

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:41.990
<v Speaker 0>in monitoring.

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.310
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:26:44.825 --> 00:26:48.424
<v Speaker 1>So So, yeah. You define it as monitoring.

00:26:48.664 --> 00:26:48.985
<v Speaker 1>And

00:26:50.424 --> 00:26:52.184
<v Speaker 1>I've got like there.

00:26:52.504 --> 00:26:53.624
<v Speaker 0>It's happy now.

00:26:54.024 --> 00:26:54.985
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:58.220
<v Speaker 0>Is there anything else we should tweak now

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:00.300
<v Speaker 0>before we do an upgrade just so that

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:01.580
<v Speaker 0>we have it available?

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:05.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You have to add a service monitor

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.019
<v Speaker 1>label. I think it's

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:09.179
<v Speaker 1>was right over the

00:27:10.544 --> 00:27:13.424
<v Speaker 1>commands when you see the description with monitoring

00:27:13.424 --> 00:27:15.424
<v Speaker 1>service monitor dot labels.

00:27:17.105 --> 00:27:18.065
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:27:18.065 --> 00:27:19.424
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. This part.

00:27:19.905 --> 00:27:20.465
<v Speaker 1>So

00:27:21.025 --> 00:27:25.105
<v Speaker 1>I am using Ranger, and Ranger has included

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.120
<v Speaker 1>preconfigured

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.559
<v Speaker 1>monitoring system,

00:27:29.679 --> 00:27:31.999
<v Speaker 1>which is built on top of the

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Prometheus operator.

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.080
<v Speaker 1>In this case, you don't set this label

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.760
<v Speaker 1>because Prometheus

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.360
<v Speaker 1>looks over all namespaces.

00:27:40.595 --> 00:27:42.115
<v Speaker 1>In this installation,

00:27:42.195 --> 00:27:44.515
<v Speaker 1>in this custom installation, you need to declare

00:27:44.515 --> 00:27:46.675
<v Speaker 1>a label for the service monitor. So the

00:27:46.675 --> 00:27:47.795
<v Speaker 1>Prometheus

00:27:48.195 --> 00:27:49.235
<v Speaker 1>resource,

00:27:49.475 --> 00:27:51.475
<v Speaker 1>yeah, scrapes the service monitor.

00:27:51.635 --> 00:27:53.635
<v Speaker 1>That's why we need to define it in

00:27:53.635 --> 00:27:54.035
<v Speaker 1>this case.

00:27:54.929 --> 00:27:56.929
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we need to

00:27:58.049 --> 00:27:59.969
<v Speaker 0>define service monitor.

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:03.009
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:08.529
<v Speaker 0>So what label is this looking for?

00:28:11.105 --> 00:28:14.705
<v Speaker 1>I think the default one would be release

00:28:16.465 --> 00:28:17.505
<v Speaker 1>and the name of your

00:28:19.664 --> 00:28:22.145
<v Speaker 0>Should I just describe the Prometheus

00:28:22.145 --> 00:28:22.705
<v Speaker 0>operator?

00:28:23.664 --> 00:28:24.065
<v Speaker 0>Is that?

00:28:24.929 --> 00:28:26.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:27.009
<v Speaker 1>You need to

00:28:27.649 --> 00:28:29.809
<v Speaker 1>describe the Prometheus

00:28:29.809 --> 00:28:30.769
<v Speaker 1>resource.

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:34.049
<v Speaker 1>So not the pod,

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:35.730
<v Speaker 1>but the Prometheus

00:28:37.445 --> 00:28:41.045
<v Speaker 1>CRD. Ah, yes. Yes. Okay. So let's do

00:28:41.045 --> 00:28:42.804
<v Speaker 0>a get Prometheus.

00:28:45.205 --> 00:28:46.885
<v Speaker 0>Describe Prometheus,

00:28:47.125 --> 00:28:49.205
<v Speaker 0>this one. And there should be a label

00:28:49.205 --> 00:28:50.805
<v Speaker 0>on here that we wanna target.

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:54.789
<v Speaker 1>Yes. Service monitor selector on the bottom.

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.909
<v Speaker 0>Got it.

00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.990
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:01.910
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming this is maybe just a map

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:04.309
<v Speaker 0>then rather than a Yeah. Less.

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:05.590
<v Speaker 0>Does the case matter?

00:29:06.475 --> 00:29:08.794
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure, but I think it's lower

00:29:08.794 --> 00:29:10.315
<v Speaker 1>case. In my

00:29:11.355 --> 00:29:12.235
<v Speaker 1>installation,

00:29:12.235 --> 00:29:13.594
<v Speaker 1>I use lower case.

00:29:17.195 --> 00:29:18.554
<v Speaker 0>This is pop up.

00:29:20.669 --> 00:29:21.950
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Lowercase.

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:23.229
<v Speaker 0>Weird that it's

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:24.830
<v Speaker 0>capitalized.

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:26.830
<v Speaker 0>Must be something to do with that output.

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:28.030
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna ignore it for now. But, yeah,

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:29.229
<v Speaker 0>let's go with lowercase.

00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:30.830
<v Speaker 0>So

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:33.390
<v Speaker 0>our values fail for the policy reporter deployment

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:36.085
<v Speaker 0>has monitoring enabled. Service monitor should be under

00:29:36.085 --> 00:29:38.644
<v Speaker 1>monitoring, not on the same

00:29:39.205 --> 00:29:40.084
<v Speaker 0>syntax. Yeah.

00:29:40.725 --> 00:29:42.164
<v Speaker 0>See? It's always good to have a second

00:29:42.164 --> 00:29:44.164
<v Speaker 0>set of eyes on these things. Okay.

00:29:45.125 --> 00:29:47.845
<v Speaker 0>Monitors enabled. We've pointed it to the correct

00:29:47.845 --> 00:29:50.470
<v Speaker 0>namespace, and we've added the service monitor from

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:51.990
<v Speaker 0>the Prometheus CRD.

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:53.669
<v Speaker 0>Means

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:56.309
<v Speaker 0>I should be able to do a helm

00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:58.070
<v Speaker 0>upgrade

00:30:00.755 --> 00:30:03.155
<v Speaker 0>policy reporter policy reporter. We don't need any

00:30:03.155 --> 00:30:04.995
<v Speaker 0>of the sets nor the create

00:30:05.635 --> 00:30:06.515
<v Speaker 0>thingy,

00:30:06.755 --> 00:30:08.595
<v Speaker 0>but I will need the namespace one.

00:30:12.035 --> 00:30:12.595
<v Speaker 0>Does that look?

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:17.399
<v Speaker 1>Do you need to set the values, Yandian?

00:30:17.399 --> 00:30:18.200
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:20.759
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:30:22.919 --> 00:30:23.639
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:30:23.799 --> 00:30:25.159
<v Speaker 0>I think that was okay.

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:28.304
<v Speaker 1>I think this should work. I hope it

00:30:28.304 --> 00:30:28.864
<v Speaker 1>will.

00:30:29.345 --> 00:30:31.745
<v Speaker 0>We're both just ringing with confidence here, but

00:30:31.745 --> 00:30:34.065
<v Speaker 0>we've got revision two, so I'm gonna take

00:30:34.065 --> 00:30:35.104
<v Speaker 0>that as a win.

00:30:35.825 --> 00:30:37.345
<v Speaker 0>So I'm assuming

00:30:37.985 --> 00:30:40.385
<v Speaker 0>at our policy reporter namespace,

00:30:40.385 --> 00:30:41.345
<v Speaker 0>we should see

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:45.180
<v Speaker 0>oh, wait. We see I don't see that

00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:48.380
<v Speaker 1>it should update the Policy Reporter because it

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:51.820
<v Speaker 1>doesn't change it. You only apply more resources

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.780
<v Speaker 1>for the operator. That's right. Because we're deploying

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:56.060
<v Speaker 0>a service

00:30:56.485 --> 00:30:57.445
<v Speaker 0>monitor.

00:30:58.645 --> 00:31:01.524
<v Speaker 0>Maybe not oh, yeah. There we go. Yeah.

00:31:02.485 --> 00:31:03.205
<v Speaker 0>So should

00:31:03.684 --> 00:31:06.164
<v Speaker 0>we pop open the Prometheus and see if

00:31:06.164 --> 00:31:07.524
<v Speaker 0>we have any metrics?

00:31:08.085 --> 00:31:10.390
<v Speaker 1>You can show it in

00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:11.990
<v Speaker 1>Prometheus or

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:13.510
<v Speaker 1>later on in

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:15.430
<v Speaker 1>Grafana.

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:17.110
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Let's take a look at the the

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:18.630
<v Speaker 0>Prometheus first and then

00:31:20.565 --> 00:31:22.245
<v Speaker 0>we'll see if we can get well, we

00:31:22.245 --> 00:31:23.605
<v Speaker 0>will. Confidence.

00:31:23.605 --> 00:31:25.445
<v Speaker 0>We will get Gafana hooked up.

00:31:26.164 --> 00:31:27.365
<v Speaker 0>But I always like to test at the

00:31:27.365 --> 00:31:28.804
<v Speaker 0>source first. So

00:31:29.845 --> 00:31:30.964
<v Speaker 0>in theory,

00:31:32.245 --> 00:31:33.445
<v Speaker 0>if we go to target,

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:40.750
<v Speaker 0>I think that's okay. Do we have any

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:41.629
<v Speaker 0>policy?

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:43.869
<v Speaker 0>Hey, look at that. Yep.

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:44.990
<v Speaker 1>Nice.

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:48.030
<v Speaker 0>Which means we should have access to a

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:49.070
<v Speaker 0>graph. There we go.

00:31:50.845 --> 00:31:51.484
<v Speaker 0>So

00:31:53.645 --> 00:31:55.965
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure what this search for policy.

00:31:55.965 --> 00:31:56.684
<v Speaker 1>Policy.

00:31:57.645 --> 00:32:00.445
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Policy report results, summary.

00:32:03.565 --> 00:32:04.684
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna execute.

00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:08.590
<v Speaker 0>And we have loads of metrics.

00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:09.790
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Yeah.

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:12.270
<v Speaker 0>But, of course, we do not encourage people

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:13.950
<v Speaker 0>to use the Prometheus

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:15.470
<v Speaker 0>baked in UI.

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:18.670
<v Speaker 0>This is where Grafana really shines.

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:20.350
<v Speaker 1>That's right. Yeah.

00:32:21.095 --> 00:32:22.774
<v Speaker 0>Alright. You mentioned sorry.

00:32:23.335 --> 00:32:24.534
<v Speaker 0>On you go. What?

00:32:25.015 --> 00:32:26.855
<v Speaker 1>No. Continue.

00:32:27.255 --> 00:32:28.055
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:32:28.055 --> 00:32:30.455
<v Speaker 0>It's just crazy. I mean, you mentioned something

00:32:30.455 --> 00:32:32.935
<v Speaker 0>really cool earlier on in the episode is

00:32:32.935 --> 00:32:35.790
<v Speaker 0>that there are pre canned dashboards that are

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:37.950
<v Speaker 0>shipped for us. So let's

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:40.270
<v Speaker 0>can I just put forward to Grafana and

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:42.350
<v Speaker 0>we walk through the process again those hooked

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:42.909
<v Speaker 0>up?

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:44.430
<v Speaker 0>Sure. Yeah.

00:32:46.765 --> 00:32:47.645
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:32:47.645 --> 00:32:48.684
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

00:32:49.805 --> 00:32:51.085
<v Speaker 0>Port forward.

00:32:54.685 --> 00:32:55.405
<v Speaker 0>3,000.

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:02.470
<v Speaker 0>Okay. We have Grafana.

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:04.790
<v Speaker 0>But I'm gonna ask if my dashboard isn't

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:06.470
<v Speaker 0>here already. Right?

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:09.909
<v Speaker 1>They should already

00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:10.789
<v Speaker 1>available.

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:11.350
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:33:22.045 --> 00:33:23.805
<v Speaker 0>Give it a refresh, see if it helps.

00:33:30.929 --> 00:33:32.769
<v Speaker 0>Oh, it does not appear happy with me

00:33:32.769 --> 00:33:33.889
<v Speaker 0>at all, does it?

00:33:40.769 --> 00:33:42.370
<v Speaker 0>Now I have to decide, am I being

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:43.409
<v Speaker 0>impatient

00:33:43.409 --> 00:33:44.929
<v Speaker 0>or is it broken?

00:33:45.765 --> 00:33:46.965
<v Speaker 0>Let's try

00:33:48.405 --> 00:33:49.605
<v Speaker 0>one more time.

00:33:53.045 --> 00:33:54.085
<v Speaker 0>Strange. Okay.

00:33:54.645 --> 00:33:55.445
<v Speaker 0>So

00:33:55.685 --> 00:33:57.445
<v Speaker 0>we have our dashboard home.

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:02.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You should click home on the yeah.

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:04.330
<v Speaker 1>And there you already see policy

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:05.610
<v Speaker 1>reports or label.

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:08.570
<v Speaker 1>So you can also in your list, in

00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:10.010
<v Speaker 1>the first entry, yeah,

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:12.250
<v Speaker 1>can click on it and you should get

00:34:13.135 --> 00:34:14.495
<v Speaker 1>three dashboards.

00:34:14.975 --> 00:34:16.255
<v Speaker 1>So they

00:34:16.575 --> 00:34:17.535
<v Speaker 1>all very

00:34:18.575 --> 00:34:21.295
<v Speaker 1>similar to the dashboards you saw in the

00:34:21.295 --> 00:34:22.095
<v Speaker 1>UI.

00:34:23.535 --> 00:34:27.039
<v Speaker 1>So they provide similar informations, but in a

00:34:27.039 --> 00:34:27.760
<v Speaker 1>better

00:34:28.079 --> 00:34:29.600
<v Speaker 1>scope in Grafana.

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:32.159
<v Speaker 0>So is that something that the Prometheus

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.960
<v Speaker 0>the Kube Prometheus project is is doing? How

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.719
<v Speaker 0>did you get those Grafana dashboards into my

00:34:36.719 --> 00:34:37.119
<v Speaker 0>Grafana?

00:34:39.225 --> 00:34:41.145
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. The operator supports

00:34:41.385 --> 00:34:43.225
<v Speaker 1>config maps to

00:34:44.665 --> 00:34:45.945
<v Speaker 1>define dashboards.

00:34:46.505 --> 00:34:48.985
<v Speaker 1>And what I did is I built these

00:34:48.985 --> 00:34:51.865
<v Speaker 1>dashboards in my own Grafana and export them.

00:34:52.185 --> 00:34:53.305
<v Speaker 1>I replaced

00:34:53.305 --> 00:34:54.025
<v Speaker 1>some

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:56.170
<v Speaker 1>informations with

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:57.450
<v Speaker 1>dynamic

00:34:57.690 --> 00:35:01.050
<v Speaker 1>variables you can configure in the Helm chart.

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:04.410
<v Speaker 1>So as I said, you have some status

00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:07.610
<v Speaker 1>codes like warning and error. They are not

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:08.410
<v Speaker 1>supported yet.

00:35:09.125 --> 00:35:10.325
<v Speaker 1>So but I

00:35:11.765 --> 00:35:15.045
<v Speaker 1>would like to support the CRD complete.

00:35:15.045 --> 00:35:16.165
<v Speaker 1>So I

00:35:16.885 --> 00:35:19.285
<v Speaker 1>add them to the dashboards,

00:35:19.605 --> 00:35:22.645
<v Speaker 1>but I added

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:21.770
<v Speaker 1>Helm

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:23.210
<v Speaker 1>values

00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:25.770
<v Speaker 1>to disable them or hide them in this

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:26.170
<v Speaker 1>case.

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:27.370
<v Speaker 1>And,

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:31.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah, the sub chart includes this config maps

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:34.305
<v Speaker 1>and add them to your Grafana namespace.

00:35:34.305 --> 00:35:36.465
<v Speaker 1>And so they picked up from Grafana and

00:35:36.465 --> 00:35:37.345
<v Speaker 1>available.

00:35:37.744 --> 00:35:39.585
<v Speaker 0>That's a nice a nice touch. I like

00:35:39.585 --> 00:35:40.065
<v Speaker 0>that.

00:35:41.105 --> 00:35:42.945
<v Speaker 0>Alright. What one do wanna pop open first

00:35:42.945 --> 00:35:43.505
<v Speaker 0>then?

00:35:44.625 --> 00:35:47.665
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I think you will see the most

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:49.300
<v Speaker 1>You can do the

00:35:49.619 --> 00:35:51.859
<v Speaker 1>third one, the policy reports.

00:35:51.859 --> 00:35:53.620
<v Speaker 1>So that's it's a

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:57.460
<v Speaker 1>complete overview as you saw in the UI.

00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:01.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You have all tables currently

00:36:00.744 --> 00:36:01.945
<v Speaker 1>also without

00:36:02.505 --> 00:36:03.305
<v Speaker 1>items.

00:36:04.825 --> 00:36:05.705
<v Speaker 1>You can

00:36:07.705 --> 00:36:08.345
<v Speaker 1>well,

00:36:09.625 --> 00:36:10.105
<v Speaker 1>in

00:36:11.145 --> 00:36:13.945
<v Speaker 1>you should see tables with results,

00:36:14.025 --> 00:36:14.905
<v Speaker 1>but maybe

00:36:15.385 --> 00:36:15.785
<v Speaker 1>not.

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:20.990
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'm not sure. I mean,

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:23.630
<v Speaker 0>if I was oh, there we go. I

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:25.150
<v Speaker 0>was gonna I was gonna say, if I

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:27.390
<v Speaker 0>was better at my job here, then I

00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:29.550
<v Speaker 0>would have deployed all of this much earlier

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:32.030
<v Speaker 0>so we had retro data to capture. But

00:36:33.385 --> 00:36:34.265
<v Speaker 0>miraculously,

00:36:34.265 --> 00:36:36.105
<v Speaker 0>it just popped right on there, so that's

00:36:36.105 --> 00:36:36.905
<v Speaker 0>pretty cool.

00:36:39.704 --> 00:36:41.944
<v Speaker 0>Well, our confana did take the attempts to

00:36:41.944 --> 00:36:44.744
<v Speaker 0>load the homepage. So something tells me there's

00:36:44.744 --> 00:36:46.904
<v Speaker 0>a maybe there's something going on with the

00:36:46.904 --> 00:36:49.040
<v Speaker 0>communication back to my Docker for Mac.

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:52.320
<v Speaker 0>But but it doesn't matter. It's possible.

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.680
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we got our we can see

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.040
<v Speaker 0>how many policies we have failing. We got

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:59.200
<v Speaker 0>the cluster policies. These two very

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:01.280
<v Speaker 0>similar to what were available in the policy

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.160
<v Speaker 0>report or UI.

00:37:02.595 --> 00:37:04.595
<v Speaker 0>We then actually have some time series here

00:37:04.595 --> 00:37:07.235
<v Speaker 0>where we're seeing the count of

00:37:08.115 --> 00:37:11.635
<v Speaker 0>failing policies over time grouped by the policy

00:37:11.715 --> 00:37:13.315
<v Speaker 0>that had the failure,

00:37:13.475 --> 00:37:15.234
<v Speaker 0>which is a very nice one to chart.

00:37:15.234 --> 00:37:16.035
<v Speaker 0>I could imagine

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:17.550
<v Speaker 0>in

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:20.510
<v Speaker 0>real production clusters where there's a vast array

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:22.910
<v Speaker 0>of policies being audited and enforced,

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:25.950
<v Speaker 0>that single graph alone is gonna be

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:29.070
<v Speaker 0>really, really interesting for anybody, I would imagine.

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:31.555
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And that's a graph that I can't

00:37:31.555 --> 00:37:34.675
<v Speaker 1>provide in the Policy Reporter UI because then

00:37:34.675 --> 00:37:36.915
<v Speaker 1>I need the complete history of all

00:37:37.475 --> 00:37:38.515
<v Speaker 1>violations.

00:37:38.515 --> 00:37:39.075
<v Speaker 1>So

00:37:39.395 --> 00:37:40.195
<v Speaker 1>that's, I think

00:37:40.915 --> 00:37:43.555
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. This is classic classic time series now.

00:37:43.555 --> 00:37:45.549
<v Speaker 0>Like, you you need a TSDB for it.

00:37:45.549 --> 00:37:46.910
<v Speaker 0>You need that available.

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:48.109
<v Speaker 0>That makes a lot of sense.

00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:50.829
<v Speaker 0>And then we have a table just down

00:37:50.829 --> 00:37:52.430
<v Speaker 0>the bottom. I think it's just showing pretty

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:54.109
<v Speaker 0>much the same thing as the graph.

00:37:54.829 --> 00:37:57.470
<v Speaker 0>And we have no cluster policies, so that's

00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:58.109
<v Speaker 0>to be expected.

00:38:00.255 --> 00:38:02.015
<v Speaker 0>Should we pop open the other two?

00:38:02.815 --> 00:38:06.095
<v Speaker 1>You can also see the policy

00:38:06.174 --> 00:38:07.535
<v Speaker 1>report details.

00:38:08.174 --> 00:38:09.934
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Cluster policy

00:38:09.934 --> 00:38:12.015
<v Speaker 1>don't show anything because we don't have any

00:38:12.015 --> 00:38:14.540
<v Speaker 1>cluster policy. So I think we can skip

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:18.380
<v Speaker 1>it. Yep. We got the namespace breakdown,

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.580
<v Speaker 0>and we got another little time series graph.

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:23.340
<v Speaker 0>And I think these aren't loading just because

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:25.580
<v Speaker 0>of my whatever's going on with my network.

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:28.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And in this dashboard, you

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:31.875
<v Speaker 1>also see currently the status and the arrows

00:38:31.875 --> 00:38:32.675
<v Speaker 1>status

00:38:33.395 --> 00:38:35.475
<v Speaker 1>chart without any value.

00:38:36.275 --> 00:38:37.475
<v Speaker 1>But if

00:38:37.475 --> 00:38:40.355
<v Speaker 1>you dive more into the configuration purpose of

00:38:40.355 --> 00:38:42.515
<v Speaker 1>this monitoring chart, you

00:38:42.835 --> 00:38:43.795
<v Speaker 1>could be

00:38:44.595 --> 00:38:48.349
<v Speaker 1>you could be enable disable this this parts

00:38:48.349 --> 00:38:50.990
<v Speaker 1>of the dashboard if you don't need it.

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:55.069
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I mean, I think this this alone

00:38:55.069 --> 00:38:55.710
<v Speaker 0>is

00:38:55.869 --> 00:38:58.349
<v Speaker 0>the main reason why everybody running Kivernal and

00:38:58.349 --> 00:39:00.190
<v Speaker 0>their clusters just needs to have Policy Reporter

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:02.725
<v Speaker 0>available to it. Like, you know, I think

00:39:02.725 --> 00:39:03.525
<v Speaker 0>every

00:39:03.925 --> 00:39:05.285
<v Speaker 0>I think it's really safe to see every

00:39:05.285 --> 00:39:07.445
<v Speaker 0>operational team out there in the world probably

00:39:07.445 --> 00:39:09.685
<v Speaker 0>has a Grafana instance running in their cluster

00:39:09.685 --> 00:39:11.685
<v Speaker 0>with Prometheus. Like, they want

00:39:12.085 --> 00:39:13.845
<v Speaker 0>again, I'm not gonna put words in everybody's

00:39:13.845 --> 00:39:15.685
<v Speaker 0>nose. I want to use the same tooling

00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:18.070
<v Speaker 0>across my stack. And I think this is

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:19.910
<v Speaker 0>just really super cool.

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:21.670
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:23.430
<v Speaker 0>Because once I have it all here and

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:25.350
<v Speaker 0>I have my dashboards, you know, the entire

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:27.270
<v Speaker 0>team has visibility into it. But I also

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:28.950
<v Speaker 0>have the ability to then build my alerting

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:30.550
<v Speaker 0>on top of it. There may be some

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:33.075
<v Speaker 0>policies that although I have an audit mode

00:39:33.075 --> 00:39:34.835
<v Speaker 0>due to migration issues,

00:39:34.915 --> 00:39:37.315
<v Speaker 0>probably wanna notify somebody

00:39:37.555 --> 00:39:38.275
<v Speaker 0>quickly.

00:39:38.675 --> 00:39:40.595
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I can imagine there are some

00:39:40.675 --> 00:39:43.315
<v Speaker 0>that I would deem probably a security risk.

00:39:43.315 --> 00:39:45.475
<v Speaker 0>Although, maybe I should just enforce them. I

00:39:45.475 --> 00:39:46.595
<v Speaker 0>don't know. I'll talk myself out of that

00:39:46.595 --> 00:39:47.235
<v Speaker 0>one at some time.

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. For alerting and notification purposes,

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:55.930
<v Speaker 1>the second main part of the policy reporter,

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:59.370
<v Speaker 1>which was the initial idea behind it

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:00.730
<v Speaker 1>to

00:40:01.085 --> 00:40:02.525
<v Speaker 1>send notifications

00:40:02.924 --> 00:40:05.484
<v Speaker 1>when any violations happen to

00:40:05.644 --> 00:40:07.645
<v Speaker 1>tools like Loki,

00:40:07.724 --> 00:40:08.925
<v Speaker 1>Elasticsearch.

00:40:09.884 --> 00:40:11.964
<v Speaker 1>It also has support for

00:40:12.045 --> 00:40:13.644
<v Speaker 1>Microsoft Teams and Slack.

00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:14.950
<v Speaker 1>So,

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:18.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah, only with Policy Reporter and any chat

00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:20.790
<v Speaker 1>client you use, you can also

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:21.830
<v Speaker 1>notification

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:23.990
<v Speaker 1>send notifications to it.

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:28.150
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So back and send notifications to Slack

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:30.525
<v Speaker 0>and Discord, I guess, to any HTTP point,

00:40:30.525 --> 00:40:32.204
<v Speaker 0>really, as long as I just connect it

00:40:32.204 --> 00:40:32.685
<v Speaker 0>up.

00:40:33.165 --> 00:40:35.805
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And if your chat client is not

00:40:35.805 --> 00:40:37.485
<v Speaker 1>available yet, you can,

00:40:37.805 --> 00:40:40.445
<v Speaker 1>at any time, create an issue or

00:40:41.005 --> 00:40:41.885
<v Speaker 1>develop

00:40:42.365 --> 00:40:45.610
<v Speaker 1>it yourself and create a p p effort.

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:48.730
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I love that. Pill request welcome always.

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:51.130
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:54.010
<v Speaker 0>Is there anything else you would like to

00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:55.530
<v Speaker 0>to show if I forgotten anything?

00:40:59.425 --> 00:41:00.545
<v Speaker 1>One

00:41:01.025 --> 00:41:01.825
<v Speaker 1>part

00:41:01.905 --> 00:41:04.785
<v Speaker 1>which we don't cover because it's only related

00:41:04.785 --> 00:41:06.305
<v Speaker 1>to this notification

00:41:06.305 --> 00:41:07.665
<v Speaker 1>things are

00:41:07.744 --> 00:41:08.785
<v Speaker 1>priorities.

00:41:09.265 --> 00:41:10.785
<v Speaker 1>So for

00:41:10.785 --> 00:41:11.585
<v Speaker 1>Loki,

00:41:12.305 --> 00:41:13.105
<v Speaker 1>I created,

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah, a priority

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:17.720
<v Speaker 1>to violations

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:19.480
<v Speaker 1>because

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.480
<v Speaker 1>the policies

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.960
<v Speaker 1>pass or fail. So if you have a

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:24.920
<v Speaker 1>failed one,

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:26.840
<v Speaker 1>maybe you differentiate

00:41:26.615 --> 00:41:30.375
<v Speaker 1>between that's not that important, that's very important,

00:41:30.375 --> 00:41:31.255
<v Speaker 1>that's disaster.

00:41:33.095 --> 00:41:33.734
<v Speaker 1>And

00:41:34.135 --> 00:41:34.855
<v Speaker 1>so

00:41:35.015 --> 00:41:35.895
<v Speaker 1>I

00:41:36.295 --> 00:41:38.535
<v Speaker 1>integrated a mechanism

00:41:38.535 --> 00:41:39.734
<v Speaker 1>to define

00:41:39.895 --> 00:41:40.375
<v Speaker 1>what's

00:41:40.855 --> 00:41:43.630
<v Speaker 1>how important your policy is.

00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Per default, you create

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:49.310
<v Speaker 1>it creates a priority of warning

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:50.590
<v Speaker 1>for a policy.

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:52.510
<v Speaker 1>But you have

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:53.790
<v Speaker 1>the possibility

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:55.950
<v Speaker 1>also over the helm chart to create a

00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:57.415
<v Speaker 1>mapping between

00:41:57.734 --> 00:42:00.055
<v Speaker 1>policy name and the priority.

00:42:00.454 --> 00:42:01.815
<v Speaker 1>And so you can

00:42:02.135 --> 00:42:04.535
<v Speaker 1>switch between a info policy,

00:42:05.255 --> 00:42:07.895
<v Speaker 1>running policy, critical policy.

00:42:08.535 --> 00:42:10.775
<v Speaker 1>You have a special key for a default.

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:13.270
<v Speaker 1>So if you like to

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:15.270
<v Speaker 1>default all

00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:17.350
<v Speaker 1>policies to info,

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:19.590
<v Speaker 1>you can also do that

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:21.910
<v Speaker 1>with one configuration

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:23.510
<v Speaker 1>and, yeah,

00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:24.950
<v Speaker 1>configure how you like it.

00:42:25.724 --> 00:42:28.365
<v Speaker 1>And in Loki, you have different

00:42:28.924 --> 00:42:32.444
<v Speaker 1>colors and, yeah, your alerting tools will stick

00:42:32.444 --> 00:42:33.724
<v Speaker 1>on these priorities.

00:42:34.605 --> 00:42:36.125
<v Speaker 0>Oh, nice. Very cool feature.

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:38.200
<v Speaker 1>I

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:41.240
<v Speaker 1>opened an issue and also a PR to

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.360
<v Speaker 1>Kiverno for

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:43.880
<v Speaker 1>configure

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.040
<v Speaker 1>severity to policies,

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:46.840
<v Speaker 1>which is

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.400
<v Speaker 1>CRD way currently to

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:50.360
<v Speaker 1>define

00:42:51.455 --> 00:42:54.095
<v Speaker 1>between low, medium, and high.

00:42:54.655 --> 00:42:56.095
<v Speaker 1>And if

00:42:56.335 --> 00:42:58.975
<v Speaker 1>this feature will be available in Kiverno, it

00:42:58.975 --> 00:43:02.415
<v Speaker 1>use this information also to map your priority

00:43:02.415 --> 00:43:03.135
<v Speaker 1>between

00:43:03.535 --> 00:43:05.215
<v Speaker 1>info, warning, and critical.

00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:09.810
<v Speaker 1>So you get two ways, the Policy Reporter

00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:12.210
<v Speaker 1>way and the more native

00:43:12.609 --> 00:43:15.810
<v Speaker 1>Policy Calverno

00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:16.450
<v Speaker 1>way.

00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:18.770
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. So

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:21.010
<v Speaker 0>you said you've opened that as your conversations

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:23.025
<v Speaker 0>are happening, and maybe that's something we'll see

00:43:23.025 --> 00:43:25.665
<v Speaker 0>in a a future release of Caverno. Right?

00:43:26.065 --> 00:43:27.505
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's

00:43:28.545 --> 00:43:29.665
<v Speaker 1>scheduled for

00:43:30.145 --> 00:43:31.905
<v Speaker 1>January,

00:43:31.905 --> 00:43:32.465
<v Speaker 1>I think.

00:43:33.025 --> 00:43:33.905
<v Speaker 0>Sweet. Awesome.

00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:37.010
<v Speaker 0>So what's next for Policy Reporter then? Do

00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:38.610
<v Speaker 0>you have any other, you know,

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:42.290
<v Speaker 0>features, ideas, pencils, under your head that you're

00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:43.410
<v Speaker 0>you're gonna bring to us soon?

00:43:46.755 --> 00:43:49.315
<v Speaker 1>At first, I have a look if any

00:43:49.315 --> 00:43:52.115
<v Speaker 1>other tools will implement the CRDs,

00:43:52.194 --> 00:43:52.675
<v Speaker 1>like,

00:43:53.474 --> 00:43:55.714
<v Speaker 1>already mentioned. And if so,

00:43:56.115 --> 00:43:58.674
<v Speaker 1>have a look if it worked as expected

00:43:58.674 --> 00:44:01.600
<v Speaker 1>or if there are any differences I have

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:02.160
<v Speaker 1>to

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:04.720
<v Speaker 1>change in the Policy Reporter to also work

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:05.600
<v Speaker 1>with these tools.

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:10.000
<v Speaker 1>The second part will be more Kiverno specific.

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Currently, Kiverno

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:13.520
<v Speaker 1>works on

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:17.355
<v Speaker 1>its own metrics with more informations I can

00:44:17.355 --> 00:44:20.555
<v Speaker 1>provide because they yeah. Kyverno internal.

00:44:21.195 --> 00:44:21.835
<v Speaker 1>And

00:44:22.395 --> 00:44:24.475
<v Speaker 1>if they will be available,

00:44:24.635 --> 00:44:27.595
<v Speaker 1>I want to integrate them into the UI

00:44:27.595 --> 00:44:28.475
<v Speaker 1>as as

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:30.630
<v Speaker 1>module, I think.

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:34.310
<v Speaker 1>So you don't only have the CRD

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:35.350
<v Speaker 1>global

00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:37.350
<v Speaker 1>metrics,

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:39.430
<v Speaker 1>but also

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:42.869
<v Speaker 1>more detailed one for specific tools that work

00:44:42.869 --> 00:44:43.829
<v Speaker 1>with the CRDs.

00:44:44.675 --> 00:44:46.915
<v Speaker 1>But this this depends

00:44:46.915 --> 00:44:49.715
<v Speaker 1>on the metrics for Kaverno and when they

00:44:49.715 --> 00:44:51.235
<v Speaker 1>are available and so on.

00:44:51.795 --> 00:44:54.915
<v Speaker 1>But I will have a look, an eye

00:44:54.915 --> 00:44:55.715
<v Speaker 1>on it. So

00:44:56.595 --> 00:44:56.994
<v Speaker 0>k.

00:44:58.200 --> 00:44:59.960
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Is there anything else you want to

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:01.320
<v Speaker 0>cover before I let you get back to

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:02.040
<v Speaker 0>your day?

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:06.520
<v Speaker 1>I
