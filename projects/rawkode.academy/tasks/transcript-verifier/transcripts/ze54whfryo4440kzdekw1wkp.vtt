00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560
<v Speaker 0>But if you want to do something with

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.919
<v Speaker 0>the user interface

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:05.839
<v Speaker 0>or if you want to create code with

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:08.639
<v Speaker 0>the user interface, like code as the interface,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.240
<v Speaker 0>I think TypeScript

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.919
<v Speaker 0>with its rich

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:14.240
<v Speaker 0>generic

00:00:13.535 --> 00:00:14.655
<v Speaker 0>capabilities,

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:16.574
<v Speaker 0>it's the perfect language

00:00:17.135 --> 00:00:19.855
<v Speaker 0>for a user interface. If we think, you

00:00:19.855 --> 00:00:22.814
<v Speaker 0>know, not buttons, but for developers, the user

00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:25.295
<v Speaker 0>interface is the language. And I think TypeScript

00:00:25.295 --> 00:00:26.974
<v Speaker 0>is actually the best language

00:00:27.615 --> 00:00:28.735
<v Speaker 0>to create

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.880
<v Speaker 0>amazing

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.720
<v Speaker 0>developer experiences.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.200
<v Speaker 0>Like, that that's that's my love for for

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.080
<v Speaker 0>TypeScript. So everything that should be super fast,

00:00:37.765 --> 00:00:38.885
<v Speaker 0>I would say,

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:41.205
<v Speaker 0>go. Everything that should be

00:00:41.605 --> 00:00:44.325
<v Speaker 0>pleasant to use, TypeScript, and everything that should

00:00:44.325 --> 00:00:45.685
<v Speaker 0>be super safe,

00:00:45.925 --> 00:00:46.885
<v Speaker 0>I would go Rust.
