00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.770
<v Speaker 0>Hello, and welcome back to the Rawkode Academy.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.610
<v Speaker 0>I'm your host, David Flanagan,

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.330
<v Speaker 0>and today, I'm excited to be doing Rawkode

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.730
<v Speaker 0>live as we take a look at Gimlet,

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.090
<v Speaker 0>a developer platform built around GitOps principles.

00:02:02.895 --> 00:02:05.695
<v Speaker 0>To teach us more about Gimlet, we are

00:02:05.695 --> 00:02:08.335
<v Speaker 0>joined by its creator and maintainer,

00:02:08.975 --> 00:02:11.055
<v Speaker 0>Laszlo Fugas. Hey, man. How are you?

00:02:11.535 --> 00:02:13.695
<v Speaker 1>Hey. Hey, David. Thanks for having me. Thanks

00:02:13.695 --> 00:02:14.335
<v Speaker 1>for the intro.

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.500
<v Speaker 0>Absolutely. My pleasure to have you on today's

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.580
<v Speaker 0>session. I'm really excited for this one. I'm

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.860
<v Speaker 0>looking forward to just,

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.860
<v Speaker 0>you and I, we always have good conversations.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.739
<v Speaker 0>So this is going to be a good

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:24.700
<v Speaker 0>episode today.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.275
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, we don't necessarily see eye to eye

00:02:28.275 --> 00:02:30.195
<v Speaker 1>on every topic, but I think that's a

00:02:31.555 --> 00:02:33.474
<v Speaker 1>good part of it. So I'm really excited

00:02:33.474 --> 00:02:34.675
<v Speaker 1>to be here. Yeah,

00:02:34.995 --> 00:02:36.755
<v Speaker 1>hello, everyone. Yeah,

00:02:36.995 --> 00:02:37.635
<v Speaker 0>yeah,

00:02:37.954 --> 00:02:39.555
<v Speaker 0>always see that as a great thing, though,

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:40.915
<v Speaker 0>right? Because we get to share our own

00:02:40.915 --> 00:02:43.474
<v Speaker 0>opinions and as long as we're all wise

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.710
<v Speaker 0>enough to share them in a way where

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.150
<v Speaker 0>we can have an open mind and learn

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.990
<v Speaker 0>together, it doesn't matter if you win or

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.550
<v Speaker 0>change someone's opinion, but we broaden our experience

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.350
<v Speaker 0>as a whole.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.470
<v Speaker 0>So, yeah, excited is definitely where I am

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.710
<v Speaker 0>today.

00:02:55.495 --> 00:02:58.055
<v Speaker 0>For anyone who's not aware of you, can

00:02:58.055 --> 00:02:59.255
<v Speaker 0>you just tell us a little bit more

00:02:59.255 --> 00:03:00.855
<v Speaker 0>about you and what you've been up to?

00:03:01.975 --> 00:03:04.935
<v Speaker 1>Sure. So I'm Laszlo Fogash. I'm sitting in

00:03:04.935 --> 00:03:05.735
<v Speaker 1>Hungary,

00:03:06.055 --> 00:03:09.095
<v Speaker 1>very it's very warm right now, 35 Celsius.

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:11.110
<v Speaker 1>Hey, Alessandro.

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.510
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah. So it's end of the week.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.550
<v Speaker 1>We've been busy.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.069
<v Speaker 1>We have relaunched Gimlet's onboarding flow just a

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.470
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks ago and, did a lot

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.150
<v Speaker 1>of marketing efforts recently.

00:03:22.545 --> 00:03:24.545
<v Speaker 1>So that's what we are up to.

00:03:24.865 --> 00:03:27.185
<v Speaker 1>We are a bootstrap company, so it's just

00:03:27.185 --> 00:03:28.465
<v Speaker 1>the three of us. So it's not like

00:03:28.465 --> 00:03:30.945
<v Speaker 1>a huge venture backed operation

00:03:31.105 --> 00:03:32.145
<v Speaker 1>with a

00:03:32.944 --> 00:03:35.665
<v Speaker 1>plethora of developers and DevRel people and so

00:03:35.665 --> 00:03:35.745
<v Speaker 1>on.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.330
<v Speaker 1>We are bootstrapping,

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.250
<v Speaker 1>meaning we are building the the product. I

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.290
<v Speaker 1>am sort of the

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.250
<v Speaker 1>marketing slash product guy and and trying

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.050
<v Speaker 1>to figure out the direction and so on.

00:03:49.685 --> 00:03:51.365
<v Speaker 1>There is a React developer

00:03:51.525 --> 00:03:54.165
<v Speaker 1>and also Golang, so, like, full stack. He's

00:03:54.165 --> 00:03:55.125
<v Speaker 1>building features.

00:03:55.765 --> 00:03:58.165
<v Speaker 1>And then there is someone who is working

00:03:58.165 --> 00:04:01.285
<v Speaker 1>with clients. So we we do consulting,

00:04:01.605 --> 00:04:04.710
<v Speaker 1>Gimlet's related and bespoke consultancy as well. So

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:05.670
<v Speaker 1>like cloud

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.110
<v Speaker 1>things

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.710
<v Speaker 1>from Terraform to Kubernetes and doing all kinds

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.070
<v Speaker 1>of stuff just to, you know, keep the

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.790
<v Speaker 1>lights on,

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.270
<v Speaker 1>keep the lights on. And they have been

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.190
<v Speaker 1>on for more than four years now. So

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.510
<v Speaker 1>it's a bit slow doing like this, but

00:04:19.955 --> 00:04:22.915
<v Speaker 1>we are default alive. So it's pretty enjoyable,

00:04:22.915 --> 00:04:24.515
<v Speaker 1>to be honest, to be in this position.

00:04:25.155 --> 00:04:26.995
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. And sense of it. Yeah.

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:28.355
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:04:28.675 --> 00:04:30.195
<v Speaker 1>And and and we have Gimlet as our

00:04:30.195 --> 00:04:31.075
<v Speaker 1>main product.

00:04:31.475 --> 00:04:34.035
<v Speaker 1>It was formed around the GitOps principles.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.669
<v Speaker 1>I started early on with the flux1.0

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.310
<v Speaker 1>or or even before that. And,

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.390
<v Speaker 1>yeah, flux was amazing. And and

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.190
<v Speaker 1>GitOps didn't click for me at first. But

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.265
<v Speaker 1>when I've seen it in action with, I

00:04:49.265 --> 00:04:51.025
<v Speaker 1>think in the in the Nordics community, in

00:04:51.025 --> 00:04:53.025
<v Speaker 1>the cloud native Nordics, there were many early

00:04:53.025 --> 00:04:56.065
<v Speaker 1>adopters. And I I I kept fighting them,

00:04:56.065 --> 00:04:57.825
<v Speaker 1>like, why is this a good idea? But

00:04:57.825 --> 00:04:59.985
<v Speaker 1>then I I definitely joined the the the

00:04:59.985 --> 00:05:01.905
<v Speaker 1>bandwagon. And and

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.280
<v Speaker 1>it was very obvious from the get go

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.360
<v Speaker 1>that the the GitOps is not a full

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.240
<v Speaker 1>solution. So it's it's a nice idea.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.400
<v Speaker 1>But, you know, to to make it useful

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.400
<v Speaker 1>for your company, you have to build the

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.055
<v Speaker 1>workflows and you have to wire things up

00:05:16.055 --> 00:05:19.175
<v Speaker 1>the way as your team works. And since

00:05:19.574 --> 00:05:21.335
<v Speaker 1>I am doing consulting and I was doing

00:05:21.335 --> 00:05:23.495
<v Speaker 1>consulting back then as a single person, like

00:05:23.495 --> 00:05:25.895
<v Speaker 1>a solo shop, it was very

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.300
<v Speaker 1>obvious that I I I need to build

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.940
<v Speaker 1>these components myself as well. And, yeah, I

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:33.740
<v Speaker 1>have a

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.860
<v Speaker 1>handful of customers using Gimlet in the Nordics

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.340
<v Speaker 1>region, in Copenhagen and nearby.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.780
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, like, ten, twenty, 30 developers

00:05:43.205 --> 00:05:45.365
<v Speaker 1>each. And there's some open source of that

00:05:45.365 --> 00:05:46.405
<v Speaker 1>production as well.

00:05:47.205 --> 00:05:48.485
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Awesome.

00:05:48.965 --> 00:05:50.805
<v Speaker 0>Well, maybe we can dive into

00:05:51.045 --> 00:05:51.845
<v Speaker 0>what's

00:05:51.925 --> 00:05:52.725
<v Speaker 0>different

00:05:52.725 --> 00:05:55.125
<v Speaker 0>with with Gimlet. Right? You've said that you

00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:57.045
<v Speaker 0>weren't on board with the idea of GitOps

00:05:57.045 --> 00:06:00.620
<v Speaker 0>initially. You kinda slowly came towards the idea.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.300
<v Speaker 0>And, you know, Gimlet

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.460
<v Speaker 0>does want to have a differentiator, be a

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.900
<v Speaker 0>little bit different. Can you go into that

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.900
<v Speaker 0>in more detail and tell people what we're

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.020
<v Speaker 0>gonna be looking at today?

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:10.380
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.

00:06:11.354 --> 00:06:13.514
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if you bring my up my screen

00:06:13.675 --> 00:06:15.595
<v Speaker 1>Of course. So others can see as well

00:06:15.595 --> 00:06:18.634
<v Speaker 1>because we just relaunched the website, which looks

00:06:18.634 --> 00:06:20.555
<v Speaker 1>a little bit rough at the moment. But

00:06:20.634 --> 00:06:23.354
<v Speaker 1>essentially, we threw thrown out a bunch of

00:06:23.354 --> 00:06:23.514
<v Speaker 1>stuff.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not sure if my screen is

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.130
<v Speaker 1>up yet. Yeah. If you just want to

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.650
<v Speaker 0>show what you want to show now. There

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.650
<v Speaker 0>we go. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Of

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.770
<v Speaker 1>course. So so we actually actually, this looked

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.090
<v Speaker 1>much more corporate before and all kinds of

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.014
<v Speaker 1>buttons and options and stuff. But we went

00:06:41.014 --> 00:06:42.775
<v Speaker 1>really to, you know, just to the to

00:06:42.775 --> 00:06:44.455
<v Speaker 1>the core idea.

00:06:44.615 --> 00:06:46.215
<v Speaker 1>Yes. You should fire up a cluster on

00:06:46.215 --> 00:06:47.814
<v Speaker 1>your laptop and yes, you should start Gimlet

00:06:47.814 --> 00:06:49.735
<v Speaker 1>and yes, you should start deploying

00:06:49.735 --> 00:06:52.055
<v Speaker 1>from the get go. And what's different?

00:06:52.294 --> 00:06:54.800
<v Speaker 1>I think in the Kubernetes ecosystem,

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.720
<v Speaker 1>there are many tools which are

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.600
<v Speaker 1>sort of centered around the idea of of

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.400
<v Speaker 1>an

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.360
<v Speaker 1>inventory

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.280
<v Speaker 1>of pods and config maps and deployments and

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.160
<v Speaker 1>ingresses,

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.600
<v Speaker 1>and you see them in tables

00:07:08.005 --> 00:07:11.445
<v Speaker 1>without much context. So your so your application

00:07:11.445 --> 00:07:12.325
<v Speaker 1>workflows

00:07:12.325 --> 00:07:14.405
<v Speaker 1>kind of lost in the picture. You just

00:07:14.405 --> 00:07:17.365
<v Speaker 1>see this list of, resources you have. And

00:07:17.365 --> 00:07:19.445
<v Speaker 1>then, of course, there are custom resources and

00:07:19.445 --> 00:07:22.085
<v Speaker 1>all those complex all that complexity that comes

00:07:22.085 --> 00:07:24.870
<v Speaker 1>with it. And with Gimlet, I think you're

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.790
<v Speaker 1>gonna see later in the demo is that

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.550
<v Speaker 1>everything is centered around,

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.430
<v Speaker 1>like, your commits and branches you have.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:34.310
<v Speaker 1>This is very similar to GitHub, so the

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:35.965
<v Speaker 1>look and feel is kind of what you

00:07:35.965 --> 00:07:37.805
<v Speaker 1>get with GitHub's

00:07:37.805 --> 00:07:39.805
<v Speaker 1>commit view. And, of course, you have a

00:07:39.805 --> 00:07:41.325
<v Speaker 1>real time Kubernetes

00:07:43.245 --> 00:07:44.525
<v Speaker 1>view as well

00:07:45.324 --> 00:07:46.845
<v Speaker 1>to the to the to the very minimal

00:07:46.845 --> 00:07:48.285
<v Speaker 1>thing. So it's not like not like a

00:07:48.285 --> 00:07:50.990
<v Speaker 1>full map of all the resources you have.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.270
<v Speaker 1>You have deployments

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:54.270
<v Speaker 1>and pods and and that's it. Basically, there's

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:55.950
<v Speaker 1>a URL where you can click it.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.350
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, so so it was very early

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.750
<v Speaker 1>on. I think this was in focus that

00:08:01.715 --> 00:08:03.475
<v Speaker 1>the UI has to be centered around the

00:08:03.475 --> 00:08:05.795
<v Speaker 1>developer and their use cases, just a single

00:08:05.795 --> 00:08:08.435
<v Speaker 1>repository they are working with. And,

00:08:08.755 --> 00:08:11.475
<v Speaker 1>basically, they want to see their CI statuses

00:08:11.475 --> 00:08:13.155
<v Speaker 1>like, is my build done?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.880
<v Speaker 1>Is an automatic deploy is done? If I

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.360
<v Speaker 1>want to deploy manually to some environment, that

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.320
<v Speaker 1>was the key use cases. And, of course,

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.440
<v Speaker 1>rollback and so on. And and the other

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.120
<v Speaker 1>thing is that that with GitOps is that

00:08:27.685 --> 00:08:30.325
<v Speaker 1>it's great. You know, GitOps, I mean, the

00:08:30.325 --> 00:08:32.804
<v Speaker 1>flux CDs and the Argo CD approach.

00:08:33.445 --> 00:08:36.405
<v Speaker 1>So not necessarily doing Terraform triggered from a

00:08:36.405 --> 00:08:38.965
<v Speaker 1>CI pipeline and so on, but more like,

00:08:38.965 --> 00:08:40.085
<v Speaker 1>you know, the CD,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.380
<v Speaker 1>like continuous delivery of Kubernetes, YAML. That's the

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:45.980
<v Speaker 1>that kind of definition.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.060
<v Speaker 1>And with GitOps, it was very clear early

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.260
<v Speaker 1>on that there

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.020
<v Speaker 1>are a lot of details like file structures

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.460
<v Speaker 1>and folder structures.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.135
<v Speaker 1>What file goes where, where is my base

00:08:57.135 --> 00:08:58.415
<v Speaker 1>customized layer,

00:08:58.575 --> 00:09:00.815
<v Speaker 1>how does that come together in a staging

00:09:00.815 --> 00:09:03.135
<v Speaker 1>environment and so on. And the whole thing

00:09:03.135 --> 00:09:06.175
<v Speaker 1>is basically just a big exercise of copying

00:09:06.654 --> 00:09:09.214
<v Speaker 1>files here and there, templating something and writing

00:09:09.214 --> 00:09:10.334
<v Speaker 1>to git repositories.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.480
<v Speaker 1>And some

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.840
<v Speaker 1>very basic things actually got broken on the

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.120
<v Speaker 1>way. So for example,

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.080
<v Speaker 1>once you have written into the git

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.280
<v Speaker 1>repository,

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.040
<v Speaker 1>it's often things are not connected back together.

00:09:24.225 --> 00:09:26.305
<v Speaker 1>Like, is my application really deployed? Is the

00:09:26.305 --> 00:09:27.665
<v Speaker 1>health check passing?

00:09:28.065 --> 00:09:30.065
<v Speaker 1>And all those things you have to,

00:09:30.625 --> 00:09:33.584
<v Speaker 1>configure yourself in in in Flexiteam and Argo

00:09:33.584 --> 00:09:35.505
<v Speaker 1>as well. And, like,

00:09:35.985 --> 00:09:38.305
<v Speaker 1>still today, I think there were some

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.510
<v Speaker 1>GitOps skeptic articles

00:09:41.149 --> 00:09:43.230
<v Speaker 1>many years ago, like three years ago as

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:45.870
<v Speaker 1>well. And some of those criticisms still stands.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.550
<v Speaker 1>Like like if you go into, like, the

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:50.110
<v Speaker 1>GitOps room on the Kubernetes Slack or the

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:51.070
<v Speaker 1>CNCF Slack,

00:09:51.504 --> 00:09:54.384
<v Speaker 1>Like, very often you you face the question,

00:09:54.384 --> 00:09:55.985
<v Speaker 1>like, how do I do promotions?

00:09:56.384 --> 00:09:59.264
<v Speaker 1>And then somebody comes in, tells, like, how

00:09:59.264 --> 00:10:01.745
<v Speaker 1>is my folder structure looks and how do

00:10:01.745 --> 00:10:03.904
<v Speaker 1>I move files in between and so on.

00:10:03.904 --> 00:10:04.305
<v Speaker 1>And

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:06.650
<v Speaker 1>it's all very basic.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Basically,

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.330
<v Speaker 1>we are missing one abstraction level and and

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.090
<v Speaker 1>how how to do a smoke test and

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.570
<v Speaker 1>and what what what happens after the deployment.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.410
<v Speaker 1>All these things you have to basically glue

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:18.810
<v Speaker 1>together in GitHub Actions or some CI solution

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:22.105
<v Speaker 1>you have. And honestly, we should do better.

00:10:22.264 --> 00:10:25.144
<v Speaker 1>And, this is definitely a problem space where,

00:10:25.305 --> 00:10:27.145
<v Speaker 1>Gimlet wants to wants to shine.

00:10:28.185 --> 00:10:28.745
<v Speaker 1>And

00:10:29.545 --> 00:10:31.225
<v Speaker 1>yeah. So so these are the the two

00:10:31.225 --> 00:10:33.545
<v Speaker 1>two core, differences where what I wanted to

00:10:33.545 --> 00:10:35.940
<v Speaker 1>highlight, and that's where

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.860
<v Speaker 1>we have very strong opinions like how things

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:38.740
<v Speaker 1>should be done.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:42.180
<v Speaker 1>Plus, we are very much into Kubernetes.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:42.580
<v Speaker 1>Like,

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.980
<v Speaker 1>you know, we want to make Kubernetes boring.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.820
<v Speaker 1>That is sort of one of the

00:10:51.515 --> 00:10:54.315
<v Speaker 1>north star of the platform engineering

00:10:55.755 --> 00:10:58.075
<v Speaker 1>scene and the ecosystem and so on. But

00:10:58.075 --> 00:10:59.595
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm bored of really is

00:10:59.595 --> 00:11:01.275
<v Speaker 1>is Kubernetes means.

00:11:01.595 --> 00:11:03.115
<v Speaker 1>Like, it's so complex.

00:11:03.435 --> 00:11:03.915
<v Speaker 1>It's

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.940
<v Speaker 1>it's, you know, it's, it's too steep of

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:08.940
<v Speaker 1>a learning curve, which I actually don't think

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:09.580
<v Speaker 1>it's true,

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:11.340
<v Speaker 1>today.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:13.980
<v Speaker 1>Of course, you can always go into complexity

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.460
<v Speaker 1>and and people have been bad at, you

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:17.180
<v Speaker 1>know, stopping

00:11:18.115 --> 00:11:20.275
<v Speaker 1>just that they're good enough with Kubernetes. They

00:11:20.275 --> 00:11:23.395
<v Speaker 1>have to do multi cluster failover over service

00:11:23.395 --> 00:11:25.715
<v Speaker 1>mesh use cases, but not many people need

00:11:25.715 --> 00:11:27.715
<v Speaker 1>those. So actually, with Gimlet, we we just

00:11:27.715 --> 00:11:29.715
<v Speaker 1>want to focus on people who who

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.530
<v Speaker 1>get introduced to Kubernetes, and they just want

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:35.490
<v Speaker 1>to deploy something. And, they don't care too

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:36.290
<v Speaker 1>much about,

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:38.930
<v Speaker 1>you know, container networking and so on.

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:41.890
<v Speaker 1>So that's Gimlet in a nutshell.

00:11:44.045 --> 00:11:45.885
<v Speaker 1>I'm I'm pretty sure I I triggered a

00:11:45.885 --> 00:11:46.605
<v Speaker 1>few people.

00:11:46.925 --> 00:11:48.285
<v Speaker 1>Did I trigger you?

00:11:50.045 --> 00:11:53.165
<v Speaker 0>I don't feel triggered. No. I think I

00:11:53.165 --> 00:11:55.005
<v Speaker 0>actually agree with a lot of what you

00:11:55.005 --> 00:11:57.230
<v Speaker 0>were saying. So two key points for me,

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:59.310
<v Speaker 0>right, is you you spoke about the status

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:00.750
<v Speaker 0>quo right now with

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:02.910
<v Speaker 0>get ups. Right? The flux CD and Argo

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:04.750
<v Speaker 0>CD. Those are the two most adopted.

00:12:05.149 --> 00:12:06.750
<v Speaker 0>I'm I'm gonna say platform, but I don't

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.269
<v Speaker 0>mean that they they are platforms. Right? But

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:09.709
<v Speaker 0>those are the two most common tools used

00:12:09.709 --> 00:12:11.865
<v Speaker 0>for get ups. But they're building blocks or

00:12:11.865 --> 00:12:14.105
<v Speaker 0>primitives, like you said. If you want to

00:12:14.105 --> 00:12:15.945
<v Speaker 0>do blue green deployed, if you want to

00:12:15.945 --> 00:12:18.425
<v Speaker 0>do automatic remediation, if you want to do

00:12:18.425 --> 00:12:21.305
<v Speaker 0>gated deploys, none of this exists. And either

00:12:21.305 --> 00:12:22.745
<v Speaker 0>of those tools, you have to then go

00:12:22.745 --> 00:12:24.519
<v Speaker 0>use Argo Workflows, you have to go get

00:12:24.519 --> 00:12:25.959
<v Speaker 0>flagger. You have to look at the captain

00:12:25.959 --> 00:12:26.680
<v Speaker 0>project.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.600
<v Speaker 0>You have to keep leading on more and

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.320
<v Speaker 0>more tools. And that's just the common frustration

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.880
<v Speaker 0>with everyone I speak to about Kubernetes. It's

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.120
<v Speaker 0>like, I just want to run some containers.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.200
<v Speaker 1>I just want to deploy my application. And

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.120
<v Speaker 0>then that leads right into your second point,

00:12:40.185 --> 00:12:41.545
<v Speaker 0>which I also agreed with.

00:12:42.025 --> 00:12:44.185
<v Speaker 0>And the Kubernetes community,

00:12:44.585 --> 00:12:46.505
<v Speaker 0>and I'll make myself guilty of this. Right?

00:12:46.505 --> 00:12:49.145
<v Speaker 0>We start talking about eBPF and network policies

00:12:49.145 --> 00:12:50.585
<v Speaker 0>and fancy deployments,

00:12:50.585 --> 00:12:52.345
<v Speaker 0>multi clusters, hybrid architectures.

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.150
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Of course, some of this stuff is

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:58.030
<v Speaker 0>very, very logical for some subset of customers

00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:01.390
<v Speaker 0>that are trying to have certain resiliency patterns.

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.510
<v Speaker 0>But the majority of people just want some

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.775
<v Speaker 0>containers orchestrated on one, two, three nodes, like

00:13:07.775 --> 00:13:10.255
<v Speaker 0>not even large clusters. They don't need to

00:13:10.255 --> 00:13:12.655
<v Speaker 0>know about falco and all these things. Now,

00:13:12.655 --> 00:13:13.935
<v Speaker 0>of course, security is

00:13:14.975 --> 00:13:17.375
<v Speaker 0>but everyone has a different risk appetite and

00:13:17.375 --> 00:13:19.455
<v Speaker 0>we don't really appreciate it or acknowledge that

00:13:19.455 --> 00:13:21.600
<v Speaker 0>enough. And I'd say the vast majority of

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.000
<v Speaker 0>people just want to get containers into production

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.720
<v Speaker 0>and keep their customers happy. That is it.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.040
<v Speaker 0>So, yeah, not triggered as well.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:30.879
<v Speaker 1>Actually,

00:13:30.879 --> 00:13:33.519
<v Speaker 1>you said a bird like Argo workflows. Like,

00:13:34.035 --> 00:13:35.954
<v Speaker 1>I've been I go I go to many

00:13:35.954 --> 00:13:37.954
<v Speaker 1>meetups and it's very often I hear that

00:13:37.954 --> 00:13:40.915
<v Speaker 1>what kind of big machinery they built with

00:13:40.915 --> 00:13:42.675
<v Speaker 1>Argo workflows. And and there were some examples

00:13:42.675 --> 00:13:44.435
<v Speaker 1>which were basically just reimplementing

00:13:44.435 --> 00:13:47.990
<v Speaker 1>a continuous integration server, which felt like, oh

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:49.829
<v Speaker 1>my god, sure, you have these tools, but

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:51.910
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to do everything yourself. So

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:54.149
<v Speaker 1>so those those definitely not,

00:13:55.589 --> 00:13:57.510
<v Speaker 1>the kind of Kubernetes

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:00.230
<v Speaker 1>things that I like. So I, I definitely

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.985
<v Speaker 1>want to focus on making it more accessible.

00:14:04.505 --> 00:14:06.745
<v Speaker 1>Like, just a month ago or a little

00:14:06.745 --> 00:14:08.584
<v Speaker 1>bit actually, it was two months ago, I

00:14:08.584 --> 00:14:09.865
<v Speaker 1>was asking on Twitter,

00:14:09.945 --> 00:14:12.985
<v Speaker 1>like, you know, the Gartner hype cycle.

00:14:13.144 --> 00:14:13.464
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm.

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:17.230
<v Speaker 1>And I just wanted people to place Kubernetes

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:18.030
<v Speaker 1>on it.

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:21.550
<v Speaker 1>And there were a couple of answers that,

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:23.870
<v Speaker 1>hey, Kubernetes is fine. I use it. For

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:26.110
<v Speaker 1>me, it's in the plateau of productivity.

00:14:27.264 --> 00:14:30.225
<v Speaker 1>And for for, you know, more like toolmakers

00:14:30.225 --> 00:14:32.545
<v Speaker 1>and people who are aware of the of

00:14:32.545 --> 00:14:34.785
<v Speaker 1>the grand scheme of things, it's more like

00:14:34.785 --> 00:14:35.985
<v Speaker 1>in, you know, in, like,

00:14:36.385 --> 00:14:39.345
<v Speaker 1>on the beginning of going up that that

00:14:39.345 --> 00:14:41.665
<v Speaker 1>that

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:41.190
<v Speaker 1>plateau.

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:42.709
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Because

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:44.949
<v Speaker 1>we are we are missing a couple of

00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:46.709
<v Speaker 1>building blocks here. We are we are doing

00:14:46.709 --> 00:14:48.550
<v Speaker 1>a lot of complexity things. But

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:50.070
<v Speaker 1>eventually,

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.390
<v Speaker 1>like, if you reach this this plateau,

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:55.005
<v Speaker 1>like like, I believe I have reached it

00:14:55.005 --> 00:14:56.925
<v Speaker 1>for myself and and and many people who

00:14:56.925 --> 00:14:59.885
<v Speaker 1>are building these platforms. And and honestly,

00:15:00.205 --> 00:15:02.685
<v Speaker 1>I much rather copy a cube CTI command

00:15:02.685 --> 00:15:05.965
<v Speaker 1>off of the Internet today than any pseudo

00:15:05.965 --> 00:15:08.525
<v Speaker 1>do something on my VM kind of

00:15:09.589 --> 00:15:11.509
<v Speaker 1>approach. So so for me, Kubernetes is the

00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:12.790
<v Speaker 1>go to place, a go to go to

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:15.269
<v Speaker 1>platform. And I would really hope that we

00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:17.990
<v Speaker 1>would have, like, maybe resources like the digital

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:20.949
<v Speaker 1>ocean blog or this this knowledge base like

00:15:20.949 --> 00:15:22.470
<v Speaker 1>they built over the years.

00:15:22.949 --> 00:15:23.589
<v Speaker 1>And

00:15:23.855 --> 00:15:24.575
<v Speaker 1>because

00:15:25.055 --> 00:15:26.015
<v Speaker 1>what you did,

00:15:26.335 --> 00:15:28.735
<v Speaker 1>like, or maybe do today if you have

00:15:28.735 --> 00:15:30.575
<v Speaker 1>a VPS or like a VM,

00:15:30.735 --> 00:15:32.815
<v Speaker 1>is that you type, how do I install

00:15:32.815 --> 00:15:35.215
<v Speaker 1>Postgres and how do I set, I don't

00:15:35.215 --> 00:15:36.655
<v Speaker 1>know, like a max

00:15:37.215 --> 00:15:38.975
<v Speaker 1>page size for the kernel?

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.250
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea about the the the

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:44.530
<v Speaker 1>page size parameter in ETC for the kernel,

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:45.730
<v Speaker 1>but I just copy

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:48.290
<v Speaker 1>from the DigitalOcean blog and I trust them.

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:51.170
<v Speaker 1>And I I think we we might miss

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:53.954
<v Speaker 1>some of these in Kubernetes or I I

00:15:53.954 --> 00:15:55.075
<v Speaker 1>I actually don't

00:15:55.394 --> 00:15:57.795
<v Speaker 1>know or don't fully understand, like, why people

00:15:57.795 --> 00:15:58.675
<v Speaker 1>see

00:15:59.075 --> 00:16:01.955
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes as complex still. Like, yeah,

00:16:02.675 --> 00:16:04.435
<v Speaker 1>I could go on on and on about

00:16:04.435 --> 00:16:04.915
<v Speaker 1>this.

00:16:05.954 --> 00:16:06.834
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I mean,

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:09.449
<v Speaker 0>I'll add just a little bit of flavor

00:16:09.449 --> 00:16:10.649
<v Speaker 0>to that, but I don't wanna spend too

00:16:10.649 --> 00:16:13.529
<v Speaker 0>much time talking about that is specifically. Right?

00:16:13.529 --> 00:16:14.810
<v Speaker 0>We've got a really cool product to look

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:17.529
<v Speaker 0>at. But you're you're great again. I

00:16:17.769 --> 00:16:20.570
<v Speaker 0>work with a lot of companies adopting Kubernetes.

00:16:20.649 --> 00:16:22.765
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Beer break. That's a good good idea.

00:16:22.765 --> 00:16:23.325
<v Speaker 0>Cheers.

00:16:24.765 --> 00:16:26.925
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. We agreed to have a beer because

00:16:26.925 --> 00:16:29.005
<v Speaker 1>it's a yeah. It's a it's

00:16:29.005 --> 00:16:30.845
<v Speaker 1>a long weekend, a very warm one in

00:16:30.845 --> 00:16:32.365
<v Speaker 1>Hungary. So yeah.

00:16:32.605 --> 00:16:33.325
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

00:16:34.125 --> 00:16:35.405
<v Speaker 0>So, yeah, I worked with a lot of

00:16:35.405 --> 00:16:37.360
<v Speaker 0>people adopting Kubernetes and, you know, they're not

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.680
<v Speaker 0>coming to me with with difficult problems or

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.600
<v Speaker 0>difficult challenges. You know, it's not like, oh,

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.600
<v Speaker 0>we want to apply stack comp profiles and

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.839
<v Speaker 0>approve our security posture. Like, that never happens.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.959
<v Speaker 0>It's we we changed the conflict map and

00:16:48.959 --> 00:16:50.800
<v Speaker 0>our deployment didn't update. Like, what do we

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.855
<v Speaker 0>need to do? And it's like, yeah, there

00:16:52.855 --> 00:16:55.415
<v Speaker 0>are loads of these little rough edges in

00:16:55.415 --> 00:16:57.815
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes that we need more knowledge bases and

00:16:57.815 --> 00:16:59.175
<v Speaker 0>how to guys and just

00:16:59.975 --> 00:17:01.175
<v Speaker 0>a place people would just look up and

00:17:01.175 --> 00:17:02.855
<v Speaker 0>see how do I fix this? Right? No.

00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:04.694
<v Speaker 0>Even if you say adopt a mutable conflict

00:17:04.694 --> 00:17:06.855
<v Speaker 0>maps, like even the operation of a plan

00:17:06.855 --> 00:17:08.920
<v Speaker 0>of their cluster is much more difficult and

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.520
<v Speaker 0>not where it needs to be today.

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:12.600
<v Speaker 0>So, yeah, there are just are loads of

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.680
<v Speaker 0>things like that. And I and again, everything

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.359
<v Speaker 0>you're saying is right. I'm not triggered.

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm I'm I'm happy to hear that.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:21.720
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:17:23.325 --> 00:17:25.645
<v Speaker 1>Should we jump into the demo then? Yeah.

00:17:25.645 --> 00:17:27.804
<v Speaker 0>Let let's let's take a look at Gimlet.

00:17:28.284 --> 00:17:29.004
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:17:29.245 --> 00:17:29.804
<v Speaker 1>So

00:17:30.684 --> 00:17:33.325
<v Speaker 1>I will just roughly follow the documentation and

00:17:33.325 --> 00:17:36.409
<v Speaker 1>encourage everyone to to retry it because all

00:17:36.409 --> 00:17:38.729
<v Speaker 1>you need is just a Kubernetes cluster.

00:17:39.529 --> 00:17:40.889
<v Speaker 1>Just that's again,

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:42.249
<v Speaker 1>you know, could be a

00:17:42.809 --> 00:17:44.570
<v Speaker 1>a tall order for many.

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:49.289
<v Speaker 1>But we recommend k three d because it's

00:17:49.529 --> 00:17:51.130
<v Speaker 1>it just works locally.

00:17:52.195 --> 00:17:54.275
<v Speaker 1>So this is how I'm going to kick

00:17:54.275 --> 00:17:55.075
<v Speaker 1>things off.

00:17:55.635 --> 00:17:58.435
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna straight into the documentation, gonna do

00:17:58.435 --> 00:17:59.315
<v Speaker 1>installation,

00:17:59.795 --> 00:18:01.955
<v Speaker 1>launching k three d, which is optional. Of

00:18:01.955 --> 00:18:03.715
<v Speaker 1>course, you can use and

00:18:03.715 --> 00:18:04.434
<v Speaker 1>other

00:18:04.675 --> 00:18:05.235
<v Speaker 1>providers.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.159
<v Speaker 1>And

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.200
<v Speaker 1>there is this comment how you launch a

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.880
<v Speaker 1>cluster. Usually, this is how you launch a

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.760
<v Speaker 1>cluster in our k three d guide. We

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.000
<v Speaker 1>tell, like, why to launch the cluster like

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.480
<v Speaker 1>this, basically. Could you zoom in three times,

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:20.640
<v Speaker 0>please?

00:18:22.235 --> 00:18:23.995
<v Speaker 1>Could you say it again, please? Could you

00:18:23.995 --> 00:18:25.514
<v Speaker 0>zoom in three times?

00:18:26.635 --> 00:18:28.874
<v Speaker 1>Three times. Yes. Perfect. That's the one.

00:18:29.434 --> 00:18:30.234
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:18:30.315 --> 00:18:31.034
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:18:31.355 --> 00:18:32.955
<v Speaker 1>So so this is how you normal launch

00:18:32.955 --> 00:18:35.419
<v Speaker 1>a cluster with k three d, and we

00:18:35.419 --> 00:18:38.220
<v Speaker 1>basically tell people to disable the built in

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.780
<v Speaker 1>ingress controller component because we want to get

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:42.700
<v Speaker 1>ups everything. So that's just

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.020
<v Speaker 1>bytes longer than it could be.

00:18:47.505 --> 00:18:49.664
<v Speaker 1>The terminal now.

00:18:50.225 --> 00:18:51.185
<v Speaker 1>Simple.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.760
<v Speaker 1>And, again, just to just to reiterate on

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.560
<v Speaker 1>the previous point made is that if launching

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.360
<v Speaker 1>a cluster is this complex, like, that's not

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.679
<v Speaker 1>bad. I mean, I've seen a lot worse.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.440
<v Speaker 0>Definitely.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.080
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Lake K 3 d has a very

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:14.640
<v Speaker 0>handy tool.

00:19:15.245 --> 00:19:16.525
<v Speaker 1>Exactly. And the

00:19:17.485 --> 00:19:19.805
<v Speaker 1>whole ecosystem, which I believe is super super

00:19:19.805 --> 00:19:20.605
<v Speaker 1>mature.

00:19:21.165 --> 00:19:23.565
<v Speaker 1>So in commands

00:19:23.885 --> 00:19:25.885
<v Speaker 1>like get and describe and so on, you

00:19:25.885 --> 00:19:26.685
<v Speaker 1>can get very far.

00:19:28.559 --> 00:19:30.720
<v Speaker 1>So we have a cluster and how you

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.759
<v Speaker 1>install Gimlet.

00:19:32.159 --> 00:19:34.000
<v Speaker 1>One of one of the easiest ways is

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.519
<v Speaker 1>just Kubectl apply

00:19:35.679 --> 00:19:36.719
<v Speaker 1>a YAML

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.839
<v Speaker 1>off GitHub.

00:19:40.559 --> 00:19:42.885
<v Speaker 0>What are the alternative options to install? Is

00:19:42.885 --> 00:19:44.645
<v Speaker 0>there a Helm chart? Is there

00:19:44.805 --> 00:19:47.125
<v Speaker 0>operators? Like, what what's the preferred way?

00:19:47.445 --> 00:19:49.125
<v Speaker 1>There is a Helm chart,

00:19:49.685 --> 00:19:51.365
<v Speaker 1>which is hosted on GitHub.

00:19:51.685 --> 00:19:52.645
<v Speaker 1>It's actually

00:19:52.805 --> 00:19:54.245
<v Speaker 1>values are hosted here.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.879
<v Speaker 1>Basically, it's using

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.520
<v Speaker 1>a hand chart called one chart. This is

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.080
<v Speaker 1>our

00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:03.039
<v Speaker 1>general purpose web application

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.239
<v Speaker 1>Mhmm. Chart,

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.720
<v Speaker 1>which takes a few values

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.159
<v Speaker 1>like an image tag,

00:20:08.725 --> 00:20:10.804
<v Speaker 1>port, and a few variables

00:20:11.605 --> 00:20:12.804
<v Speaker 1>like host.

00:20:12.804 --> 00:20:14.644
<v Speaker 1>Like, it's running on local host.

00:20:15.125 --> 00:20:16.324
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Cool.

00:20:16.804 --> 00:20:19.124
<v Speaker 1>We don't do operators or anything like that.

00:20:19.125 --> 00:20:20.565
<v Speaker 1>That has been always

00:20:21.125 --> 00:20:23.044
<v Speaker 1>a little bit far from the vision.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.740
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So at this point, it's running in

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:27.700
<v Speaker 1>the cluster.

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:29.940
<v Speaker 1>You can copy

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:32.580
<v Speaker 1>a port forward command.

00:20:34.659 --> 00:20:35.940
<v Speaker 1>That's rather

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.059
<v Speaker 1>quickly.

00:20:38.195 --> 00:20:39.635
<v Speaker 1>And here we are.

00:20:40.195 --> 00:20:42.835
<v Speaker 1>Just a initial page.

00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:45.635
<v Speaker 1>And the admin key is in the logs.

00:20:46.755 --> 00:20:47.394
<v Speaker 1>Currently,

00:20:47.795 --> 00:20:48.755
<v Speaker 1>it could be

00:20:49.635 --> 00:20:51.235
<v Speaker 1>put into the secret,

00:20:51.235 --> 00:20:52.515
<v Speaker 1>which is on the list.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.400
<v Speaker 0>I guess that's just generated randomly on deploy.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.120
<v Speaker 1>Exactly. Exactly. This is just a and it's

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.880
<v Speaker 1>only printed until

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.200
<v Speaker 1>you you log in first and then then

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.095
<v Speaker 1>you set it up. Oh, I forgot to

00:21:07.175 --> 00:21:08.535
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. Go forward.

00:21:10.055 --> 00:21:12.775
<v Speaker 1>Oh, no. My demo is broken. Like, the

00:21:12.775 --> 00:21:13.975
<v Speaker 1>first first

00:21:14.295 --> 00:21:15.655
<v Speaker 1>first click

00:21:15.655 --> 00:21:16.375
<v Speaker 1>is broken.

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:22.830
<v Speaker 1>What you see here, very basic.

00:21:23.309 --> 00:21:25.549
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna see your repositories here once you

00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:27.549
<v Speaker 1>once you integrated GitHub,

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:29.309
<v Speaker 1>and you have environments,

00:21:29.389 --> 00:21:31.870
<v Speaker 1>and there's a built in one. It's called

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:32.830
<v Speaker 1>Profound Sky.

00:21:33.815 --> 00:21:35.735
<v Speaker 1>It's a it's a random one, the the

00:21:35.735 --> 00:21:37.654
<v Speaker 1>nice random name generator.

00:21:39.095 --> 00:21:39.735
<v Speaker 1>So basic

00:21:40.295 --> 00:21:41.414
<v Speaker 1>yeah. Go ahead.

00:21:41.655 --> 00:21:43.895
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So as you saw, was logged into

00:21:43.895 --> 00:21:46.375
<v Speaker 0>the UI for the first time, provided the

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.700
<v Speaker 0>admin key. The first two tabs is your

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:48.660
<v Speaker 0>repositories,

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:50.020
<v Speaker 0>which makes sense. Right? It's get ups. We

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:51.380
<v Speaker 0>have to add some sort of repository to

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:53.380
<v Speaker 0>apply to the cluster. But we also see

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.340
<v Speaker 0>environments, which means, initially, I'm thinking, okay, Gimlet

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.900
<v Speaker 0>supports multiple clusters out of the box. So

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.340
<v Speaker 0>is the idea for Gimlet

00:22:00.695 --> 00:22:02.934
<v Speaker 0>that you have, like, a control plane cluster

00:22:02.934 --> 00:22:05.015
<v Speaker 0>that does it on workloads that runs Gimlet,

00:22:05.015 --> 00:22:07.095
<v Speaker 0>and then you attach your workload clusters? Or

00:22:07.095 --> 00:22:07.894
<v Speaker 0>would

00:22:08.054 --> 00:22:09.495
<v Speaker 0>you run that and the cluster with the

00:22:09.495 --> 00:22:11.414
<v Speaker 0>workloads all at the same time?

00:22:12.135 --> 00:22:14.455
<v Speaker 1>Again, just due to simplicity,

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:17.670
<v Speaker 1>we tell people to run Gimlet in one

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:20.070
<v Speaker 1>of their clusters, whether that's staging or or

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:21.830
<v Speaker 1>production or preprode.

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:24.630
<v Speaker 1>I run it in the production cluster for

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:26.390
<v Speaker 1>for our Gimlet deployment.

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:28.790
<v Speaker 1>So there is no control plane cluster simply

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:31.285
<v Speaker 1>because of cost considerations.

00:22:31.605 --> 00:22:33.925
<v Speaker 1>But, of course, you can you could keep

00:22:33.925 --> 00:22:36.245
<v Speaker 1>Gimlet on the control plane cluster.

00:22:37.765 --> 00:22:38.485
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:22:38.565 --> 00:22:41.045
<v Speaker 1>Cool. And and and these these environments

00:22:41.285 --> 00:22:43.925
<v Speaker 1>naturally would be called staging production and then

00:22:43.925 --> 00:22:44.965
<v Speaker 1>preprode. This is just

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:48.220
<v Speaker 1>this communicates that, yeah, this is just for

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:50.299
<v Speaker 1>it's it's like a sandbox.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.580
<v Speaker 0>Got it. Alright.

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.900
<v Speaker 1>Let's do which one should we do first?

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:57.900
<v Speaker 1>Environments or repositories?

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.100
<v Speaker 1>GitHub or

00:22:59.674 --> 00:23:00.554
<v Speaker 1>cluster.

00:23:01.275 --> 00:23:02.475
<v Speaker 0>Let's do cluster.

00:23:02.715 --> 00:23:03.914
<v Speaker 1>Let's do cluster.

00:23:04.554 --> 00:23:06.235
<v Speaker 0>So Can you zoom in a little bit

00:23:06.235 --> 00:23:07.514
<v Speaker 0>on this page, please?

00:23:07.835 --> 00:23:10.075
<v Speaker 1>Of course. Yes. Alright. Good.

00:23:10.554 --> 00:23:12.715
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So, again, just the k three d

00:23:12.715 --> 00:23:15.115
<v Speaker 1>command if you would need a cluster again.

00:23:15.115 --> 00:23:15.355
<v Speaker 1>If you,

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:17.950
<v Speaker 1>So Gimlet has a SaaS version.

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:20.510
<v Speaker 1>So there are some people who have not

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:23.309
<v Speaker 1>started Kubernetes up yet on their laptops.

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:26.029
<v Speaker 1>So they could do that. That's optional.

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:28.990
<v Speaker 1>You definitely have to install the CLI

00:23:29.014 --> 00:23:32.614
<v Speaker 1>because there is this command Gimlet environment connect.

00:23:33.095 --> 00:23:35.095
<v Speaker 1>It takes the environment, the server, and the

00:23:35.095 --> 00:23:37.894
<v Speaker 1>token as a as a parameter. I have

00:23:37.894 --> 00:23:39.815
<v Speaker 1>all the all these previous steps, so I

00:23:39.815 --> 00:23:40.774
<v Speaker 1>just here.

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:55.390
<v Speaker 1>Do you see the bottom of the screen

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:56.110
<v Speaker 1>as well?

00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:58.669
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It says installing flux.

00:23:59.885 --> 00:24:00.845
<v Speaker 1>But yes.

00:24:01.804 --> 00:24:03.804
<v Speaker 1>So so Gimlet itself,

00:24:05.645 --> 00:24:07.725
<v Speaker 1>all it does is just it has a

00:24:07.725 --> 00:24:09.804
<v Speaker 1>dashboard and it writes to git.

00:24:10.684 --> 00:24:12.124
<v Speaker 1>And there is

00:24:12.684 --> 00:24:16.020
<v Speaker 1>a GitOps controller required to deliver those YAMLs.

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.419
<v Speaker 1>And right now, we are heavily,

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:21.380
<v Speaker 1>invested in the flux ecosystem,

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.740
<v Speaker 1>primarily because it's much

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:25.860
<v Speaker 1>more modular.

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:29.060
<v Speaker 1>There's no UI. You can, integrate with it

00:24:29.435 --> 00:24:30.394
<v Speaker 1>rather easily.

00:24:30.555 --> 00:24:32.475
<v Speaker 0>Is that flux one or flux two?

00:24:32.875 --> 00:24:34.394
<v Speaker 1>It's flux two,

00:24:34.955 --> 00:24:35.674
<v Speaker 1>VR,

00:24:35.755 --> 00:24:38.635
<v Speaker 1>I believe, on the generally available version,

00:24:39.035 --> 00:24:40.795
<v Speaker 1>two dot one, which was released

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:42.169
<v Speaker 1>yesterday,

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:45.130
<v Speaker 1>should become next week.

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:48.650
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Because I only went GA like, what,

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:50.410
<v Speaker 0>four weeks ago or something? Five weeks ago,

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:52.250
<v Speaker 0>I think it was. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

00:24:54.775 --> 00:24:57.495
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. So I've been so obviously, we

00:24:57.495 --> 00:24:59.175
<v Speaker 1>are a small company, so sometimes we are

00:24:59.175 --> 00:25:01.815
<v Speaker 1>behind versions. So we are not like super

00:25:01.815 --> 00:25:03.815
<v Speaker 1>on top all the time. In in this

00:25:03.815 --> 00:25:05.735
<v Speaker 1>case, we were very keen on doing the

00:25:05.735 --> 00:25:08.360
<v Speaker 1>RCs as well for two to two. And,

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.680
<v Speaker 1>yeah, it was very easy to to upgrade

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.520
<v Speaker 1>for us. Yeah. I love the the way

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.600
<v Speaker 0>the flux two works versus flux one. The

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.640
<v Speaker 0>way that the

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:19.080
<v Speaker 0>the sources are all separated from the customizations

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.680
<v Speaker 0>and stuff. Like you said, it's very much

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.605
<v Speaker 0>love you. And the the OCI support and

00:25:23.605 --> 00:25:25.285
<v Speaker 0>the s three bucket support is all really

00:25:25.285 --> 00:25:27.525
<v Speaker 0>sweet. So Yes. Yes. Yes.

00:25:28.325 --> 00:25:29.044
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:25:30.245 --> 00:25:32.245
<v Speaker 1>Now that the environment is connected,

00:25:32.565 --> 00:25:34.165
<v Speaker 1>we see a different icon,

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.500
<v Speaker 1>some more tabs and some information

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:38.620
<v Speaker 1>there.

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:40.700
<v Speaker 1>If you set up your own environments,

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:43.740
<v Speaker 1>it's actually interesting because now the screen is

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:46.059
<v Speaker 1>so large. If I just zoom out just

00:25:46.059 --> 00:25:46.540
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.

00:25:48.615 --> 00:25:51.095
<v Speaker 1>Never mind. Never mind. This was not a

00:25:51.415 --> 00:25:54.535
<v Speaker 1>CSS issue. I know what's going on. Anyways,

00:25:54.535 --> 00:25:56.215
<v Speaker 1>so if you set up your own environments,

00:25:56.215 --> 00:25:59.495
<v Speaker 1>can have different, folder structures and, different

00:25:59.575 --> 00:26:01.655
<v Speaker 1>amount of git repository. So there is some

00:26:01.655 --> 00:26:04.360
<v Speaker 1>flexibility in the boot strapping part of things.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:07.320
<v Speaker 1>But as of now, we have a connected

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:10.360
<v Speaker 1>environment which maps to a cluster basically.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.720
<v Speaker 1>We have clients where environments are mapped to

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:14.759
<v Speaker 1>namespaces.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:15.640
<v Speaker 1>It's doable,

00:26:15.965 --> 00:26:17.565
<v Speaker 1>not very well documented.

00:26:17.565 --> 00:26:20.045
<v Speaker 1>So, I would recommend people to jump on

00:26:20.045 --> 00:26:22.044
<v Speaker 1>the or to our Discord

00:26:22.285 --> 00:26:26.125
<v Speaker 1>to, you know, to map a namespace to

00:26:26.125 --> 00:26:27.325
<v Speaker 1>a Gimlet environment.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:33.080
<v Speaker 1>And down here, it's basically just Flux statuses.

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.519
<v Speaker 1>If it's small, it's just we have two

00:26:36.519 --> 00:26:37.799
<v Speaker 1>git repositories,

00:26:37.799 --> 00:26:40.200
<v Speaker 1>and these are the latest update times and

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.600
<v Speaker 1>when things were applied and synchronized with Flux.

00:26:43.905 --> 00:26:45.665
<v Speaker 1>And, of course, you can

00:26:46.145 --> 00:26:48.705
<v Speaker 1>dive deeper into the Git repository and customization

00:26:48.705 --> 00:26:49.665
<v Speaker 1>statuses.

00:26:51.185 --> 00:26:53.585
<v Speaker 0>K. Cool. Yeah. Alright.

00:26:54.465 --> 00:26:55.905
<v Speaker 1>Let's integrate GitHub.

00:26:59.409 --> 00:27:01.409
<v Speaker 1>There is some text like, no. We're not

00:27:01.409 --> 00:27:03.250
<v Speaker 1>gonna steal your passwords. No. We're not gonna

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:05.090
<v Speaker 1>steal your code. We you don't even grant

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:06.849
<v Speaker 1>any any access to us.

00:27:07.169 --> 00:27:07.809
<v Speaker 1>Basically,

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:10.289
<v Speaker 1>that's the whole text, and you can install

00:27:10.289 --> 00:27:13.090
<v Speaker 1>it under your organization or your personal profile.

00:27:13.615 --> 00:27:15.855
<v Speaker 1>I recommend everyone to just use their personal

00:27:15.855 --> 00:27:16.734
<v Speaker 1>profile

00:27:21.135 --> 00:27:24.495
<v Speaker 1>and only grant access even so even even

00:27:24.495 --> 00:27:25.054
<v Speaker 1>if

00:27:26.015 --> 00:27:26.894
<v Speaker 1>it's

00:27:27.559 --> 00:27:30.040
<v Speaker 1>their own application that we are creating only

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.120
<v Speaker 1>grant access to just a couple of repos

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:34.360
<v Speaker 1>while they are evaluating Gimlet.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.440
<v Speaker 1>So I select just

00:27:37.559 --> 00:27:38.520
<v Speaker 1>two examples.

00:27:43.335 --> 00:27:44.054
<v Speaker 1>System

00:27:44.535 --> 00:27:45.254
<v Speaker 1>and

00:27:45.495 --> 00:27:47.095
<v Speaker 1>I install and authorize.

00:27:47.735 --> 00:27:50.134
<v Speaker 1>Now the permission list is quite excessive,

00:27:50.215 --> 00:27:52.135
<v Speaker 1>so that's why I recommend people that

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:55.220
<v Speaker 1>that just take the repositories that, you know,

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.540
<v Speaker 1>that you use to just test things out

00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:00.899
<v Speaker 1>first. And then once you gain some trust,

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:03.140
<v Speaker 1>I hope this won't be a problem.

00:28:06.505 --> 00:28:08.825
<v Speaker 0>K. So this was a GitHub application rather

00:28:08.825 --> 00:28:11.705
<v Speaker 0>than throwing around any sort of SSH access

00:28:11.705 --> 00:28:13.865
<v Speaker 0>key or or things like that. So

00:28:14.425 --> 00:28:16.745
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming we're gonna see a deeper integration

00:28:16.745 --> 00:28:18.825
<v Speaker 0>with GitHub than what we'd see traditionally from

00:28:18.825 --> 00:28:19.865
<v Speaker 0>Flux or Argo.

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Yes. GitHub, I believe, has a a very

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:25.529
<v Speaker 1>good integration,

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:27.929
<v Speaker 1>approach with the applications

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:30.330
<v Speaker 1>and application and installations, and I could go

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:31.769
<v Speaker 1>on and on about this.

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:33.530
<v Speaker 1>Now we tried,

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:36.645
<v Speaker 1>to integrate with GitLab as well. And,

00:28:37.205 --> 00:28:39.365
<v Speaker 1>like, eight months ago, it was working.

00:28:39.925 --> 00:28:43.045
<v Speaker 1>However, since we don't have any GitLab customers

00:28:43.045 --> 00:28:44.005
<v Speaker 1>at this point,

00:28:44.405 --> 00:28:47.045
<v Speaker 1>it was left behind somewhat. So we had

00:28:47.045 --> 00:28:49.285
<v Speaker 1>to, you know, have some push to to

00:28:49.285 --> 00:28:51.205
<v Speaker 1>bring GitLab up to up to speed.

00:28:51.799 --> 00:28:55.080
<v Speaker 1>And honestly, their integration approach is is more

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.160
<v Speaker 1>like a big bang approach. Like, they have

00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:00.440
<v Speaker 1>an admin token and boom, you give access

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:03.400
<v Speaker 1>to everything. So so I'm yeah. I'm liking

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:04.600
<v Speaker 1>the GitHub way

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:05.640
<v Speaker 1>much better.

00:29:07.215 --> 00:29:09.855
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So so if you are a developer,

00:29:09.855 --> 00:29:11.135
<v Speaker 1>this is where you live. This is where

00:29:11.135 --> 00:29:12.095
<v Speaker 1>you land,

00:29:12.575 --> 00:29:13.615
<v Speaker 1>repositories.

00:29:13.775 --> 00:29:16.015
<v Speaker 1>I'm an Express JS, or like a Node

00:29:16.015 --> 00:29:17.054
<v Speaker 1>JS developer,

00:29:17.375 --> 00:29:19.695
<v Speaker 1>and I'm a test application.

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:23.450
<v Speaker 1>I came in here. I see that I

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:24.489
<v Speaker 1>have an environment.

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:27.929
<v Speaker 1>Probably my cluster administrator set it up, or

00:29:27.929 --> 00:29:30.250
<v Speaker 1>I did it just with a different hat

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:30.969
<v Speaker 1>on.

00:29:31.289 --> 00:29:33.369
<v Speaker 1>And there's no configurations,

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:34.489
<v Speaker 1>no pods running,

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:35.210
<v Speaker 1>nothing.

00:29:35.625 --> 00:29:37.545
<v Speaker 1>I just see that it's connected to a

00:29:37.545 --> 00:29:40.505
<v Speaker 1>cluster. I I should see things if there

00:29:40.505 --> 00:29:42.424
<v Speaker 1>would be things on the cluster.

00:29:42.905 --> 00:29:44.024
<v Speaker 1>And down here,

00:29:44.425 --> 00:29:47.144
<v Speaker 1>you see branches and commits and whatnot.

00:29:48.585 --> 00:29:48.905
<v Speaker 1>And,

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:52.419
<v Speaker 1>basically, this is the point where, you know,

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.059
<v Speaker 1>this is an Express JS app. I would

00:29:55.059 --> 00:29:56.740
<v Speaker 1>need a Dockerfile,

00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:58.259
<v Speaker 1>a Docker container,

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.139
<v Speaker 1>maybe integrate with CI somehow,

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:05.455
<v Speaker 1>then a Kubernetes YAML file. And and all

00:30:05.455 --> 00:30:06.894
<v Speaker 1>these steps we actually

00:30:07.774 --> 00:30:11.214
<v Speaker 1>packed into just this magically colored button.

00:30:11.375 --> 00:30:12.414
<v Speaker 1>Internally,

00:30:12.414 --> 00:30:13.774
<v Speaker 1>call the magic deploy.

00:30:15.134 --> 00:30:17.294
<v Speaker 1>Obviously, you can use all those things. So

00:30:17.294 --> 00:30:18.975
<v Speaker 1>you can have a Dockerfile, you can integrate

00:30:18.975 --> 00:30:20.335
<v Speaker 1>with CircleCI,

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:24.059
<v Speaker 1>all the CIs out there. But if you

00:30:24.059 --> 00:30:24.539
<v Speaker 1>just

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:27.419
<v Speaker 1>want to see Gimlet or you just want

00:30:27.419 --> 00:30:29.259
<v Speaker 1>to see Kubernetes for the first time,

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:33.100
<v Speaker 1>you just push deploy on the latest version

00:30:33.835 --> 00:30:35.355
<v Speaker 1>or the latest commit.

00:30:36.395 --> 00:30:38.315
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So I I wanna make sure I

00:30:38.315 --> 00:30:40.555
<v Speaker 0>understood what you're saying there. Right? Are are

00:30:40.555 --> 00:30:42.315
<v Speaker 0>you just saying that right now your express

00:30:42.315 --> 00:30:44.875
<v Speaker 0>application is just an express application with no

00:30:44.875 --> 00:30:46.715
<v Speaker 0>Docker file and no Kubernetes manifest?

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.899
<v Speaker 1>%. If I go to GitHub,

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.299
<v Speaker 1>it has a package JSON and a Node

00:30:52.299 --> 00:30:54.460
<v Speaker 1>JS file saying hello.

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:57.340
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So are you using, like, build packs

00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.659
<v Speaker 0>under the hood to deploy this application?

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:03.395
<v Speaker 1>Correct. Yes. We are using build packs, and,

00:31:03.635 --> 00:31:05.715
<v Speaker 1>this is the image building,

00:31:06.515 --> 00:31:07.234
<v Speaker 1>phase.

00:31:07.715 --> 00:31:10.195
<v Speaker 1>And here is just the Buildpacks output.

00:31:11.475 --> 00:31:12.114
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:31:14.195 --> 00:31:14.995
<v Speaker 1>Buildpacks,

00:31:15.235 --> 00:31:16.674
<v Speaker 1>is nice when it works.

00:31:16.995 --> 00:31:19.710
<v Speaker 1>And when it when it doesn't, they tell

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:22.910
<v Speaker 1>you to to create a buildpack configuration file,

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:24.750
<v Speaker 1>but it sort of defeats the purpose in

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:25.710
<v Speaker 1>my my view.

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:27.230
<v Speaker 1>And also,

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:30.830
<v Speaker 1>since everything is running on local host,

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:33.710
<v Speaker 1>if I I suppose you have a Mac

00:31:34.965 --> 00:31:36.085
<v Speaker 1>with an Apple

00:31:36.245 --> 00:31:37.285
<v Speaker 1>silicon architecture.

00:31:38.885 --> 00:31:39.924
<v Speaker 1>For that,

00:31:40.485 --> 00:31:42.325
<v Speaker 1>we had to do one of the few,

00:31:42.725 --> 00:31:44.485
<v Speaker 1>core tech contributions

00:31:44.645 --> 00:31:47.445
<v Speaker 1>to the world that, Buildpacks doesn't work on

00:31:47.445 --> 00:31:47.765
<v Speaker 1>ARM.

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.900
<v Speaker 0>There we go. So Yes.

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:54.300
<v Speaker 1>So when you when we stop the stream

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:56.780
<v Speaker 1>and you go home and, I don't know,

00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:59.100
<v Speaker 1>you play a bit of gaming and then

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.300
<v Speaker 1>then you come back to Gimlet,

00:32:01.815 --> 00:32:02.855
<v Speaker 1>reported

00:32:02.855 --> 00:32:03.894
<v Speaker 1>buildpacks

00:32:04.375 --> 00:32:06.455
<v Speaker 1>for the Node. Js ecosystem

00:32:06.615 --> 00:32:07.654
<v Speaker 1>to ARM.

00:32:08.534 --> 00:32:11.894
<v Speaker 1>So obviously, this won't build everything, but, yeah,

00:32:13.335 --> 00:32:14.375
<v Speaker 1>like your node apps.

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:17.210
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Should work. Clarify a couple more things

00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:20.650
<v Speaker 0>then. Yep. Okay. So we have a k

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:21.850
<v Speaker 0>three d cluster,

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:24.090
<v Speaker 0>which is running Yes. Gimlet. You added an

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:26.890
<v Speaker 0>environment. Is that environment that you added the

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:28.970
<v Speaker 0>same k three d cluster or an external

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:29.289
<v Speaker 0>cluster?

00:32:30.065 --> 00:32:30.945
<v Speaker 1>No.

00:32:30.945 --> 00:32:32.865
<v Speaker 1>I I have just a single k three

00:32:32.865 --> 00:32:33.745
<v Speaker 1>d cluster.

00:32:34.305 --> 00:32:34.945
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:32:35.425 --> 00:32:37.825
<v Speaker 1>So does the buildpack run

00:32:38.145 --> 00:32:38.945
<v Speaker 0>and

00:32:39.745 --> 00:32:40.465
<v Speaker 0>the

00:32:41.105 --> 00:32:43.345
<v Speaker 0>Gimlet cluster or the environment cluster?

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.320
<v Speaker 0>Even they could be the same thing, but

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:46.600
<v Speaker 0>assuming they're not.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.320
<v Speaker 1>Exactly. If you assume it is not, then

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:52.680
<v Speaker 1>it is running in the environment cluster. Okay.

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.160
<v Speaker 0>Got it. Cool.

00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:57.960
<v Speaker 1>It's

00:33:00.385 --> 00:33:01.745
<v Speaker 1>a I think later,

00:33:02.145 --> 00:33:03.665
<v Speaker 1>you will see a little bit more, like,

00:33:03.665 --> 00:33:05.105
<v Speaker 1>how things are configured.

00:33:05.265 --> 00:33:07.505
<v Speaker 1>But, basically, right now, it's one cluster, but

00:33:07.505 --> 00:33:09.185
<v Speaker 1>the this image builder is running on the

00:33:09.185 --> 00:33:11.825
<v Speaker 1>on the target, like, the deployment target cluster.

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.280
<v Speaker 1>And if it's not running there, like the

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:17.080
<v Speaker 1>registry, if it's not running there, you cannot

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:19.159
<v Speaker 1>deploy with this magic button.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.440
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So it builds an image,

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.555
<v Speaker 0>configures the deployment, and we're off to the

00:33:25.555 --> 00:33:26.755
<v Speaker 0>races. Job done.

00:33:27.395 --> 00:33:28.115
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.

00:33:28.435 --> 00:33:31.555
<v Speaker 1>And it creates a GitOps commit. So this

00:33:31.555 --> 00:33:33.715
<v Speaker 1>is where GitOps coming coming to the picture.

00:33:34.355 --> 00:33:35.715
<v Speaker 1>There is a commit

00:33:35.955 --> 00:33:37.715
<v Speaker 1>which I could click and I will click

00:33:37.715 --> 00:33:38.515
<v Speaker 1>rather soon.

00:33:40.019 --> 00:33:42.259
<v Speaker 1>There you will see the whole YAML and

00:33:42.259 --> 00:33:44.580
<v Speaker 1>all the things, and you see the flux

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:46.339
<v Speaker 1>state that it has been applied.

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:51.220
<v Speaker 1>And

00:33:51.805 --> 00:33:54.365
<v Speaker 1>now you're back in in the repository screen

00:33:54.365 --> 00:33:55.405
<v Speaker 1>where you see,

00:33:55.725 --> 00:33:58.045
<v Speaker 1>yeah, I had a deployment three minutes ago.

00:33:58.045 --> 00:33:59.325
<v Speaker 1>It was by me.

00:33:59.725 --> 00:34:01.485
<v Speaker 1>This is the version I pushed.

00:34:01.565 --> 00:34:03.645
<v Speaker 1>You can open this up, and, you can

00:34:03.645 --> 00:34:06.125
<v Speaker 1>see, like, a little heartbeat of what was

00:34:06.125 --> 00:34:06.525
<v Speaker 1>going on,

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:10.440
<v Speaker 1>like the release event and then the actual,

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:12.120
<v Speaker 1>version that was deployed.

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:14.520
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Nice.

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:17.719
<v Speaker 1>And here, this is this is a deployment,

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.239
<v Speaker 1>which has a single pod.

00:34:20.264 --> 00:34:22.984
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna configure it, guess. That's the classic

00:34:22.984 --> 00:34:24.264
<v Speaker 1>scaling example.

00:34:24.984 --> 00:34:25.864
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna,

00:34:26.505 --> 00:34:29.464
<v Speaker 1>like, take the replicas slider and just increase

00:34:29.464 --> 00:34:30.824
<v Speaker 1>it to 10 or something.

00:34:31.545 --> 00:34:33.625
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, you can look at the logs

00:34:33.625 --> 00:34:34.960
<v Speaker 1>and whatnot.

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.000
<v Speaker 1>And here you can see there is this

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.280
<v Speaker 1>little little label,

00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:41.840
<v Speaker 1>showing which version is deployed.

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.040
<v Speaker 1>And

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.520
<v Speaker 1>if we should we make a change in

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.080
<v Speaker 1>the, application or should we access the application

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:48.640
<v Speaker 1>or

00:34:49.224 --> 00:34:51.864
<v Speaker 1>we can take this wherever from here.

00:34:52.905 --> 00:34:53.625
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:34:54.344 --> 00:34:57.545
<v Speaker 0>So let's talk about this generated commit.

00:34:58.905 --> 00:35:01.145
<v Speaker 0>Is that to my express application

00:35:01.145 --> 00:35:03.305
<v Speaker 0>or is there a get ops

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:05.620
<v Speaker 0>repository now where you do all of these

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:06.660
<v Speaker 0>automated things?

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:09.300
<v Speaker 1>There is a GitOps repository.

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:10.900
<v Speaker 1>Each environment

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:12.900
<v Speaker 1>has, by convention,

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:14.580
<v Speaker 1>two repositories,

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:18.660
<v Speaker 1>one for application stuff and one for infrastructure

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:19.060
<v Speaker 1>stuff.

00:35:21.115 --> 00:35:21.835
<v Speaker 1>Now

00:35:22.635 --> 00:35:25.195
<v Speaker 1>how many git repositories, how many folders?

00:35:25.515 --> 00:35:28.155
<v Speaker 1>I think people can debate this endlessly.

00:35:28.394 --> 00:35:29.595
<v Speaker 1>This is sort of

00:35:29.994 --> 00:35:31.755
<v Speaker 1>middle ground that has worked

00:35:32.319 --> 00:35:33.280
<v Speaker 1>well for us.

00:35:33.839 --> 00:35:36.480
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So can we start by looking at

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.720
<v Speaker 0>the Kmet and see what was generated for

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:39.200
<v Speaker 0>us?

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.040
<v Speaker 1>%.

00:35:41.119 --> 00:35:44.400
<v Speaker 1>Let me just do one technical thing here

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:45.760
<v Speaker 1>to to

00:35:46.905 --> 00:35:49.065
<v Speaker 1>you know, you remember that this Profound Sky

00:35:49.065 --> 00:35:50.745
<v Speaker 1>was in Gimlet

00:35:51.305 --> 00:35:53.065
<v Speaker 1>just when we logged in. It was already

00:35:53.065 --> 00:35:53.785
<v Speaker 1>created.

00:35:54.105 --> 00:35:56.345
<v Speaker 1>There we didn't have any GitHub access at

00:35:56.345 --> 00:35:57.465
<v Speaker 1>that point or nothing.

00:35:57.785 --> 00:36:00.265
<v Speaker 1>So at this point, this is this this

00:36:00.265 --> 00:36:02.585
<v Speaker 1>is a Git repository, but lives inside Gimlet.

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.040
<v Speaker 1>But I can con but I can convert

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.960
<v Speaker 1>it to a real environment. And then if

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.800
<v Speaker 1>I push this button, it will be thrown

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:10.920
<v Speaker 1>onto GitHub.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.400
<v Speaker 1>And the magic of GitOps and Flux and

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:14.840
<v Speaker 1>everything's gonna reconfigure

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:17.965
<v Speaker 1>itself. It's it's magic. Like like when like

00:36:17.965 --> 00:36:20.045
<v Speaker 1>like like like when you update flux,

00:36:20.445 --> 00:36:22.765
<v Speaker 1>you just update the version number in the

00:36:22.765 --> 00:36:25.405
<v Speaker 1>git repository and it updates itself.

00:36:25.405 --> 00:36:26.685
<v Speaker 1>It's like magical.

00:36:27.405 --> 00:36:30.285
<v Speaker 0>Well, that's a really interesting pattern actually. Right?

00:36:30.285 --> 00:36:32.660
<v Speaker 0>Because one of the challenges with GetOps as

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:34.820
<v Speaker 0>it stands today, right, particularly around flux and

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:35.700
<v Speaker 0>Argo CD,

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:38.740
<v Speaker 0>is that the ability to spin up ephemeral

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:41.620
<v Speaker 0>clusters with preview style environments

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:44.020
<v Speaker 0>is a little bit trickier than it probably

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:46.855
<v Speaker 0>should be because it relies on a real

00:36:46.855 --> 00:36:49.015
<v Speaker 0>get repository somewhere and then all of our

00:36:49.015 --> 00:36:50.775
<v Speaker 0>environments need certain configuration.

00:36:51.015 --> 00:36:52.775
<v Speaker 0>There's loads of little parks that need to

00:36:52.775 --> 00:36:53.655
<v Speaker 0>be in the right place.

00:36:53.974 --> 00:36:56.775
<v Speaker 0>The idea that Gimlet just runs its own

00:36:56.775 --> 00:36:59.480
<v Speaker 0>internal get repository for this stuff and each

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:01.880
<v Speaker 0>environment kind of enables that pattern a lot

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:02.440
<v Speaker 0>easier.

00:37:03.559 --> 00:37:04.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:05.720
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:08.359
<v Speaker 1>I we had like three or four iterations

00:37:08.359 --> 00:37:09.480
<v Speaker 1>on the installer

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:10.119
<v Speaker 1>and how

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:13.175
<v Speaker 1>because it's so many moving parts. I mean,

00:37:13.175 --> 00:37:15.495
<v Speaker 1>it's Kubernetes, it's GitOps, it's it's everything.

00:37:16.055 --> 00:37:16.615
<v Speaker 1>And

00:37:17.095 --> 00:37:19.575
<v Speaker 1>this, by the far, the the the simplest.

00:37:19.575 --> 00:37:21.495
<v Speaker 1>And, again, if I push this button,

00:37:22.215 --> 00:37:24.055
<v Speaker 1>I convert it to a GitOps environment.

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:28.490
<v Speaker 1>This is the time when it goes to

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:30.810
<v Speaker 1>GitHub, creates the repo, pushes the

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:32.010
<v Speaker 1>manifests,

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:33.050
<v Speaker 1>updates

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:36.650
<v Speaker 1>the manifest to actually flux to point to

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:37.850
<v Speaker 1>this new GitHub

00:37:38.915 --> 00:37:39.875
<v Speaker 1>location.

00:37:39.955 --> 00:37:43.075
<v Speaker 1>So, actually, we should watch this. There is

00:37:43.075 --> 00:37:45.395
<v Speaker 1>a bug actually here that it keeps jumping

00:37:45.395 --> 00:37:46.835
<v Speaker 1>back to a deploy status.

00:37:47.474 --> 00:37:49.955
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So now the customization is,

00:37:50.515 --> 00:37:51.315
<v Speaker 1>is updating.

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.360
<v Speaker 1>Just waiting for some dependency and so on.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:55.880
<v Speaker 1>So, basically,

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:59.080
<v Speaker 1>at this point, we have these two repositories.

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.600
<v Speaker 1>One is applications

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.560
<v Speaker 1>where you can see the Express JS test

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:05.400
<v Speaker 1>application, many YAMLs,

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:06.680
<v Speaker 1>from seven minutes ago.

00:38:07.855 --> 00:38:10.255
<v Speaker 1>And there is the infrastructure one,

00:38:11.215 --> 00:38:13.295
<v Speaker 1>which has a lot more, of of course.

00:38:15.295 --> 00:38:15.855
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:38:17.135 --> 00:38:18.655
<v Speaker 1>So if if you actually jump back to

00:38:18.655 --> 00:38:19.215
<v Speaker 1>the deployment,

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:22.450
<v Speaker 1>these now are clickable,

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:24.690
<v Speaker 1>which surprises me even like I

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:26.290
<v Speaker 1>didn't refresh

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:27.730
<v Speaker 1>the page or anything and it just suddenly

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:30.370
<v Speaker 1>just works. But anyways, this was the commit

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:31.490
<v Speaker 1>that was made

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:33.250
<v Speaker 1>for for the deployment.

00:38:33.924 --> 00:38:34.964
<v Speaker 1>Deployment

00:38:35.125 --> 00:38:36.005
<v Speaker 1>service.

00:38:36.325 --> 00:38:38.885
<v Speaker 1>And there is something called the release JSON,

00:38:38.885 --> 00:38:41.684
<v Speaker 1>which is a bunch of release information for

00:38:41.684 --> 00:38:42.964
<v Speaker 1>Gimlet to

00:38:43.765 --> 00:38:44.484
<v Speaker 1>display

00:38:44.964 --> 00:38:47.525
<v Speaker 1>the version history efficiently.

00:38:48.484 --> 00:38:49.204
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Nice.

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:53.580
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So shall we make a change?

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:55.180
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

00:38:58.220 --> 00:38:59.740
<v Speaker 1>We can make two kind of changes. We

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:01.500
<v Speaker 1>can make a configuration change or we can

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:03.100
<v Speaker 1>make an application change.

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:05.020
<v Speaker 1>But let's do

00:39:05.265 --> 00:39:07.345
<v Speaker 1>an application change first. Okay?

00:39:08.625 --> 00:39:09.425
<v Speaker 1>So

00:39:09.904 --> 00:39:11.905
<v Speaker 1>I think I have this one cloned.

00:39:14.464 --> 00:39:16.545
<v Speaker 1>Projects.

00:39:16.545 --> 00:39:18.464
<v Speaker 1>I should go to Express

00:39:18.464 --> 00:39:19.664
<v Speaker 1>JS test app.

00:39:36.765 --> 00:39:38.845
<v Speaker 1>Ignore this order for now because these are

00:39:38.845 --> 00:39:40.125
<v Speaker 1>previous test

00:39:40.125 --> 00:39:41.245
<v Speaker 1>configurations.

00:39:42.045 --> 00:39:44.685
<v Speaker 1>But in the Node. Js, we're gonna say

00:39:44.685 --> 00:39:45.405
<v Speaker 1>hello,

00:39:45.964 --> 00:39:47.165
<v Speaker 1>Rawkode world.

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:52.570
<v Speaker 1>So this is the new version.

00:40:07.025 --> 00:40:08.145
<v Speaker 1>Here

00:40:08.625 --> 00:40:09.905
<v Speaker 1>on a you

00:40:10.944 --> 00:40:12.065
<v Speaker 1>wanted to say something?

00:40:12.625 --> 00:40:14.145
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I was gonna ask if this is

00:40:14.145 --> 00:40:16.145
<v Speaker 0>gonna like, because in the first deploy, you

00:40:16.145 --> 00:40:17.664
<v Speaker 0>had to push the button. I was wondering,

00:40:17.664 --> 00:40:19.340
<v Speaker 0>does it know because you've done it once,

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:21.340
<v Speaker 0>start to automate based on the main branch,

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:22.460
<v Speaker 0>or do we still have to go in

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:23.420
<v Speaker 0>and click the button?

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:26.620
<v Speaker 1>For now, we're gonna click the button,

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:28.620
<v Speaker 1>but we can automate it

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:31.020
<v Speaker 1>in the next step right afterwards.

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:33.500
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Technically technically, we could do the automation.

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.485
<v Speaker 1>I just want to finish

00:40:35.965 --> 00:40:37.245
<v Speaker 1>this this example.

00:40:37.885 --> 00:40:40.365
<v Speaker 1>So you see the commit here on a

00:40:40.365 --> 00:40:42.525
<v Speaker 1>normal deployment, which is not running a local

00:40:42.525 --> 00:40:45.085
<v Speaker 1>host. A GitHub webhook would have pushed this

00:40:45.085 --> 00:40:46.605
<v Speaker 1>commit much sooner.

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:49.090
<v Speaker 1>But if you're local host, you can push

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:51.490
<v Speaker 1>this refresh and, it's gonna appear.

00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:54.690
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So this is the latest demo with

00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:55.490
<v Speaker 1>Rawkode,

00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:56.930
<v Speaker 1>and this is the new one.

00:40:57.410 --> 00:40:59.010
<v Speaker 1>And, again, it builds the application.

00:40:59.675 --> 00:41:01.835
<v Speaker 1>I still haven't defined any Docker files or

00:41:01.835 --> 00:41:05.115
<v Speaker 1>anything or not even Kubernetes YAML, but

00:41:05.355 --> 00:41:08.795
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna soon get into that realm

00:41:09.515 --> 00:41:09.915
<v Speaker 1>as well.

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:16.270
<v Speaker 1>Now it's trailing and now it's actually you

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:17.870
<v Speaker 1>see the pods flashing.

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:21.070
<v Speaker 1>The version is demo with Rawkode.

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Commit was applied.

00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:24.110
<v Speaker 1>Actually, I click this,

00:41:24.855 --> 00:41:26.535
<v Speaker 1>this is the GitOps commit.

00:41:27.015 --> 00:41:29.975
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Some hashes were updated and yeah. The

00:41:29.975 --> 00:41:32.375
<v Speaker 1>image hash was also updated.

00:41:33.815 --> 00:41:34.535
<v Speaker 1>Nice.

00:41:34.935 --> 00:41:36.375
<v Speaker 1>Kind of what you

00:41:36.535 --> 00:41:37.015
<v Speaker 1>would expect.

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.400
<v Speaker 1>Alright. And

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:42.360
<v Speaker 1>maybe let's access the application first.

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:45.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I could port forward for now,

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:48.200
<v Speaker 1>or we could do ingress maybe later.

00:41:49.655 --> 00:41:52.615
<v Speaker 1>And you were asking if we can automate

00:41:53.255 --> 00:41:54.935
<v Speaker 1>the deployment of things.

00:41:56.775 --> 00:41:59.735
<v Speaker 1>Now this is the application configuration screen.

00:42:00.135 --> 00:42:02.295
<v Speaker 1>So up until this point, everything was default,

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:06.510
<v Speaker 1>but you can take this default and make

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:07.390
<v Speaker 1>it yours.

00:42:09.869 --> 00:42:12.349
<v Speaker 1>This is basically just a health chart, and

00:42:12.349 --> 00:42:14.829
<v Speaker 1>we have UI rendered on top.

00:42:16.335 --> 00:42:18.335
<v Speaker 1>You can start using a real image, not

00:42:18.335 --> 00:42:20.255
<v Speaker 1>just this built in registry. You can change

00:42:20.255 --> 00:42:21.295
<v Speaker 1>the replicas.

00:42:21.375 --> 00:42:23.375
<v Speaker 1>And you wanted to deploy

00:42:23.775 --> 00:42:25.215
<v Speaker 1>based on a policy.

00:42:27.215 --> 00:42:27.935
<v Speaker 1>Now

00:42:28.095 --> 00:42:30.175
<v Speaker 1>I have to tell you bad news because

00:42:30.175 --> 00:42:31.375
<v Speaker 1>this

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:32.180
<v Speaker 1>only works

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:33.540
<v Speaker 1>if

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:37.940
<v Speaker 1>if things are more properly set up with

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:39.859
<v Speaker 1>CI integration and so on.

00:42:40.819 --> 00:42:42.819
<v Speaker 1>So actually, we are missing a trigger

00:42:43.395 --> 00:42:45.155
<v Speaker 1>for this to work in this

00:42:45.795 --> 00:42:47.715
<v Speaker 1>in this in this scenario.

00:42:48.595 --> 00:42:49.315
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:42:50.115 --> 00:42:51.475
<v Speaker 1>But if

00:42:51.475 --> 00:42:52.115
<v Speaker 1>you

00:42:52.755 --> 00:42:55.795
<v Speaker 1>build your own image, like on on GitHub

00:42:55.795 --> 00:42:56.195
<v Speaker 1>actions,

00:42:56.859 --> 00:42:57.500
<v Speaker 1>And

00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:59.500
<v Speaker 1>your CI is running and that there is

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:01.580
<v Speaker 1>a point where your CI,

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:05.420
<v Speaker 1>like, today, maybe, does a Kube CTL apply

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:07.260
<v Speaker 1>or a Helm install or something.

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Instead,

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:10.700
<v Speaker 1>there is a Gimlet, GitHub action,

00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:11.339
<v Speaker 1>which would speak

00:43:12.675 --> 00:43:14.915
<v Speaker 1>or talk back to Gimlet like, hey. There's

00:43:14.915 --> 00:43:15.795
<v Speaker 1>a new version.

00:43:16.355 --> 00:43:18.355
<v Speaker 1>And then this trigger would work.

00:43:18.595 --> 00:43:20.915
<v Speaker 1>Like, hey. There's a tag on

00:43:21.155 --> 00:43:22.355
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. We

00:43:24.035 --> 00:43:24.995
<v Speaker 1>I got something.

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:32.730
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:43:35.529 --> 00:43:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Right now,

00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:38.089
<v Speaker 1>let me just make a change, like a

00:43:38.089 --> 00:43:39.369
<v Speaker 1>configuration change,

00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:41.210
<v Speaker 1>to three replicas

00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:42.490
<v Speaker 1>and maybe set

00:43:42.705 --> 00:43:44.785
<v Speaker 1>an environment variable which is,

00:43:46.305 --> 00:43:46.945
<v Speaker 1>I.

00:43:51.905 --> 00:43:52.465
<v Speaker 1>And

00:43:53.185 --> 00:43:55.185
<v Speaker 1>there is this intermediate format,

00:43:55.985 --> 00:43:56.865
<v Speaker 1>which is

00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:58.240
<v Speaker 1>basically

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.480
<v Speaker 1>parameterizing the ham chart

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:01.600
<v Speaker 1>that we

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:03.600
<v Speaker 1>use by default,

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.080
<v Speaker 1>and it takes a few parameters.

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:07.600
<v Speaker 1>If I save this

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.320
<v Speaker 1>now this is the first time where application

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:11.200
<v Speaker 1>configuration,

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:12.880
<v Speaker 1>like the the deployment configuration,

00:44:14.135 --> 00:44:15.895
<v Speaker 1>is getting into my source code.

00:44:16.855 --> 00:44:19.494
<v Speaker 1>Asafo c p h is editing this deployment

00:44:19.494 --> 00:44:22.055
<v Speaker 1>config for the Profound Sky environment.

00:44:23.974 --> 00:44:26.455
<v Speaker 1>It's placing a single file in your repository.

00:44:26.535 --> 00:44:28.214
<v Speaker 1>This is the Gimlet manifest.

00:44:29.109 --> 00:44:31.510
<v Speaker 1>It pins down the chart and have some

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:34.070
<v Speaker 1>values, or you could use customized patches or

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:35.350
<v Speaker 1>just raw,

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:38.950
<v Speaker 1>plain Kubernetes manifests.

00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:42.310
<v Speaker 1>If I merge this,

00:44:43.494 --> 00:44:44.935
<v Speaker 1>my team liked it.

00:44:45.335 --> 00:44:47.735
<v Speaker 1>And I go back to to Gimlet.

00:44:48.615 --> 00:44:49.335
<v Speaker 1>And

00:44:50.055 --> 00:44:51.575
<v Speaker 1>since this is a local, I push this

00:44:51.575 --> 00:44:52.615
<v Speaker 1>refresh button.

00:44:53.255 --> 00:44:55.095
<v Speaker 1>The pull request is here less than a

00:44:55.095 --> 00:44:57.095
<v Speaker 1>minute ago. And if I deploy this guy,

00:44:58.920 --> 00:44:59.640
<v Speaker 1>then

00:45:00.119 --> 00:45:02.760
<v Speaker 1>remember we changed the replicas to three and

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.280
<v Speaker 1>we defined

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:06.760
<v Speaker 1>environment variable.

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:09.560
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Nice.

00:45:15.925 --> 00:45:18.085
<v Speaker 0>So I'm assuming this one chart that is

00:45:18.085 --> 00:45:20.165
<v Speaker 0>being used is really just

00:45:20.725 --> 00:45:22.485
<v Speaker 0>I mean, we've all seen this time and

00:45:22.485 --> 00:45:24.245
<v Speaker 0>time again. The way that we deploy an

00:45:24.245 --> 00:45:27.119
<v Speaker 0>application to Kubernetes is almost ubiquitous. We have

00:45:27.119 --> 00:45:28.480
<v Speaker 0>a deployment, you have a service, you may

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:30.160
<v Speaker 0>have an ingress, there may be a conflict

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:32.079
<v Speaker 0>map, there may be sequence. I'm assuming there's

00:45:32.079 --> 00:45:34.559
<v Speaker 0>one chart just has value fails that allow

00:45:34.559 --> 00:45:36.079
<v Speaker 0>us to tweak how those all speak to

00:45:36.079 --> 00:45:36.720
<v Speaker 0>each other.

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.559
<v Speaker 1>Exactly. Very clever.

00:45:40.585 --> 00:45:43.465
<v Speaker 1>It's actually it's getting some traction and some

00:45:43.465 --> 00:45:45.545
<v Speaker 1>get up stars. And it's

00:45:45.545 --> 00:45:47.145
<v Speaker 1>been, you know, it's been out there for

00:45:47.145 --> 00:45:48.905
<v Speaker 1>almost four years. And

00:45:49.465 --> 00:45:51.545
<v Speaker 1>it's it's one of the easier

00:45:51.545 --> 00:45:52.665
<v Speaker 1>to explain

00:45:52.905 --> 00:45:55.280
<v Speaker 1>things Gimlet has. So I mean, all of

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:57.119
<v Speaker 0>them charts, they're they're all the same at

00:45:57.119 --> 00:45:58.560
<v Speaker 0>the end of the day. But then every

00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:00.320
<v Speaker 0>configurable,

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:02.880
<v Speaker 0>and they all regress to the same chart.

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:04.880
<v Speaker 0>Yet we all publish charts uniquely as if

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:06.480
<v Speaker 0>there's some sort of snowflake.

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:07.920
<v Speaker 0>Exactly. Exactly.

00:46:09.045 --> 00:46:10.325
<v Speaker 1>And and of course, if you're a post

00:46:10.325 --> 00:46:10.965
<v Speaker 1>SQL,

00:46:11.204 --> 00:46:14.005
<v Speaker 1>you might have, you know, an setup which

00:46:14.005 --> 00:46:16.485
<v Speaker 1>requires very intricate setups.

00:46:16.964 --> 00:46:18.005
<v Speaker 1>But most

00:46:18.405 --> 00:46:21.190
<v Speaker 1>in most cases, just I don't know. Yeah.

00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:22.790
<v Speaker 1>What you said. Yeah. Most people write a

00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:25.590
<v Speaker 0>web application that exposes some port that needs

00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:27.270
<v Speaker 0>a service, and that's it. Like,

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:29.190
<v Speaker 0>job done. Actually,

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:31.750
<v Speaker 1>I I want to do a plug. So

00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:34.470
<v Speaker 1>we have a YAML generator,

00:46:34.865 --> 00:46:37.345
<v Speaker 1>which is basically the Helm chart and the

00:46:37.345 --> 00:46:38.865
<v Speaker 1>the screen that you've seen.

00:46:39.424 --> 00:46:41.984
<v Speaker 1>You can use this online as well. So

00:46:42.305 --> 00:46:45.425
<v Speaker 1>this just, changed the replicas to to three

00:46:45.744 --> 00:46:47.744
<v Speaker 1>or five. Actually, five. Yeah.

00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:51.730
<v Speaker 1>And you can send it to your friend

00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:52.770
<v Speaker 1>with a

00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:55.970
<v Speaker 1>base 64 encoded values and so on. And

00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:58.290
<v Speaker 1>there's a static site option. This is one

00:46:58.290 --> 00:46:59.570
<v Speaker 1>of my favorites.

00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:02.290
<v Speaker 1>This actually like a this is the all

00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:03.330
<v Speaker 1>the parameters it takes.

00:47:04.175 --> 00:47:05.055
<v Speaker 1>If

00:47:05.455 --> 00:47:07.535
<v Speaker 1>you recall how Netlify works

00:47:07.695 --> 00:47:09.855
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm. You set set the build command and

00:47:09.855 --> 00:47:10.975
<v Speaker 1>the and the folder.

00:47:14.255 --> 00:47:15.695
<v Speaker 1>And basically, this is what we did with

00:47:15.695 --> 00:47:17.695
<v Speaker 1>the hub chart and the init container.

00:47:17.695 --> 00:47:18.255
<v Speaker 0>So Yeah.

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:19.840
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:22.320
<v Speaker 1>That's that's Can you go back to the

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:23.839
<v Speaker 0>web app for a second? Yeah. Yeah. Of

00:47:23.839 --> 00:47:25.359
<v Speaker 1>course. Because I see no. They're on your

00:47:25.359 --> 00:47:26.080
<v Speaker 0>generator.

00:47:27.359 --> 00:47:29.280
<v Speaker 0>There was a pot disruption budget. Right?

00:47:29.839 --> 00:47:30.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:47:31.665 --> 00:47:33.025
<v Speaker 1>Sorry. Where should I go? Should I go

00:47:33.025 --> 00:47:34.705
<v Speaker 1>to the generator? Yeah. It was on your

00:47:34.705 --> 00:47:37.185
<v Speaker 0>generator. I just noticed the part disruption budget.

00:47:37.185 --> 00:47:38.225
<v Speaker 0>Oh, that's fancy.

00:47:38.785 --> 00:47:40.705
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I don't see a lot of people

00:47:40.705 --> 00:47:42.305
<v Speaker 0>deploying them, but that's a nice a nice

00:47:42.305 --> 00:47:44.225
<v Speaker 0>little toggle button that just makes it work.

00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:48.100
<v Speaker 1>As I told you, we we operate many

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:50.100
<v Speaker 1>things for our customers.

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:52.260
<v Speaker 1>So things we need are in here.

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.580
<v Speaker 0>So here's the here's the secret self soft

00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:56.980
<v Speaker 0>question. Right? Your spread pods across nodes is

00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:58.580
<v Speaker 0>that

00:47:57.885 --> 00:48:01.325
<v Speaker 0>pod topology spread constraint or is it affinities?

00:48:02.605 --> 00:48:05.245
<v Speaker 1>I think the first one, but I don't

00:48:05.245 --> 00:48:08.445
<v Speaker 1>recall. So how about I turn it off?

00:48:08.925 --> 00:48:12.045
<v Speaker 1>I put it guy and put it here,

00:48:13.119 --> 00:48:14.800
<v Speaker 1>and and I turn it on

00:48:15.599 --> 00:48:16.800
<v Speaker 1>and copy.

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Start a new one.

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:22.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh, this is something that people can't see

00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:23.360
<v Speaker 1>very well.

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:24.560
<v Speaker 1>But,

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:25.920
<v Speaker 1>how do I do?

00:48:27.385 --> 00:48:30.185
<v Speaker 1>Reopen the tutorial. Yeah. And please let let

00:48:30.185 --> 00:48:30.905
<v Speaker 1>me scroll.

00:48:31.705 --> 00:48:33.385
<v Speaker 1>This was the off and this is the

00:48:33.385 --> 00:48:33.705
<v Speaker 1>on.

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.160
<v Speaker 1>This

00:48:47.119 --> 00:48:48.080
<v Speaker 1>is a bug.

00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:50.480
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I don't think it's actually adding.

00:48:51.119 --> 00:48:54.320
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't add anything. It's it's perhaps because

00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:56.480
<v Speaker 1>of the replica count. Oh, yeah. Perhaps.

00:49:00.785 --> 00:49:01.665
<v Speaker 1>Oh, man.

00:49:03.425 --> 00:49:05.585
<v Speaker 1>At least we found something useful today.

00:49:06.545 --> 00:49:09.025
<v Speaker 0>Well, is this open source? Can people contribute?

00:49:09.425 --> 00:49:10.065
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.

00:49:10.464 --> 00:49:11.425
<v Speaker 1>We

00:49:11.425 --> 00:49:13.744
<v Speaker 1>should have a test, a unit test for

00:49:13.744 --> 00:49:14.065
<v Speaker 1>this.

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:16.520
<v Speaker 0>Right. So we need someone to fix the

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:19.080
<v Speaker 0>bug and someone to write an open policy.

00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:21.720
<v Speaker 0>There we go. Exactly. So tests.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't know, man.

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:27.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I I I need to check this.

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:29.755
<v Speaker 1>Something is off. Maybe there is some extra

00:49:29.755 --> 00:49:30.635
<v Speaker 1>requirement.

00:49:32.075 --> 00:49:34.635
<v Speaker 0>Jump into templates and then let's open deployment

00:49:34.635 --> 00:49:37.115
<v Speaker 0>dot yaml. Exactly. Deployment

00:49:37.115 --> 00:49:37.915
<v Speaker 1>yaml

00:49:38.235 --> 00:49:39.195
<v Speaker 1>and then

00:49:39.435 --> 00:49:40.235
<v Speaker 0>See what we got.

00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:44.590
<v Speaker 1>How how is it called?

00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Affinity or something? Yeah. There would either be

00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:50.350
<v Speaker 0>an affinity or a spread constraint.

00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:52.190
<v Speaker 1>Put affinity,

00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:54.670
<v Speaker 1>spread of those nodes. Yeah. Okay.

00:49:58.005 --> 00:49:59.765
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Based on these labels.

00:50:03.444 --> 00:50:04.085
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:50:04.805 --> 00:50:06.565
<v Speaker 1>So this should be I will make my

00:50:06.565 --> 00:50:08.884
<v Speaker 0>first contribution to your chart this evening. Thank

00:50:08.884 --> 00:50:09.765
<v Speaker 1>you. Thank you.

00:50:10.619 --> 00:50:12.299
<v Speaker 0>Because there's a really nice new feature. Oh,

00:50:12.299 --> 00:50:13.579
<v Speaker 0>I guess it depends on which versions of

00:50:13.579 --> 00:50:15.579
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes you wanna support with the one chart.

00:50:15.579 --> 00:50:18.700
<v Speaker 0>Right? And Kubernetes one twenty six pod pod

00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:20.940
<v Speaker 0>topology spread constraints were added, which allows you

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:21.260
<v Speaker 0>to

00:50:22.625 --> 00:50:24.385
<v Speaker 0>replace all the old affinity stuff that we

00:50:24.385 --> 00:50:25.505
<v Speaker 0>used to use to get at one per

00:50:25.505 --> 00:50:27.105
<v Speaker 0>node. The problem with one per node is

00:50:27.105 --> 00:50:28.704
<v Speaker 0>that if you get one on it and

00:50:28.704 --> 00:50:30.145
<v Speaker 0>you need four and there's three nodes, you

00:50:30.145 --> 00:50:32.305
<v Speaker 0>can't schedule the fourth. But with pod topology

00:50:32.305 --> 00:50:34.545
<v Speaker 0>spread constraints, you can actually it will put

00:50:34.545 --> 00:50:36.305
<v Speaker 0>one on as many nodes are possible and

00:50:36.305 --> 00:50:38.400
<v Speaker 0>then spread them again and again and again.

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:39.840
<v Speaker 0>So it layers them. Uh-huh.

00:50:40.079 --> 00:50:41.040
<v Speaker 0>Cool. Uh-huh.

00:50:41.359 --> 00:50:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. This was added two years ago. So,

00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:46.960
<v Speaker 1>yeah, definitely not not one twenty six. Anyway,

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:48.400
<v Speaker 0>let's let's let's go back to the good

00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:49.920
<v Speaker 0>stuff. So Alright.

00:50:53.555 --> 00:50:54.355
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:50:55.715 --> 00:50:57.475
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So so as as a as like

00:50:57.475 --> 00:50:59.955
<v Speaker 1>a developer, you can roll back and you

00:50:59.955 --> 00:51:01.955
<v Speaker 1>can set up your integrations with Git and

00:51:01.955 --> 00:51:03.075
<v Speaker 1>and so on and

00:51:03.795 --> 00:51:05.315
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of stuff actually.

00:51:06.275 --> 00:51:07.635
<v Speaker 1>But this is the core.

00:51:08.115 --> 00:51:08.435
<v Speaker 1>So

00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:12.400
<v Speaker 1>like the view and and and, you know,

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:13.200
<v Speaker 1>like the

00:51:13.359 --> 00:51:14.880
<v Speaker 1>the field of things.

00:51:15.599 --> 00:51:16.800
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Very nice.

00:51:17.519 --> 00:51:20.000
<v Speaker 1>And, of course, if you're a cluster administrator,

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:22.720
<v Speaker 1>we have like a marketplace kind of thing,

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:24.240
<v Speaker 1>like all GitOps bagged.

00:51:24.595 --> 00:51:27.555
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's it's all GitOps bagged. So it's

00:51:27.555 --> 00:51:29.155
<v Speaker 1>not like when you you know, you go

00:51:29.155 --> 00:51:31.235
<v Speaker 1>to DigitalOcean, I think you you click one

00:51:31.235 --> 00:51:33.635
<v Speaker 1>click deploy or one click applications.

00:51:34.035 --> 00:51:36.675
<v Speaker 1>It installs it. But what happens afterwards?

00:51:36.835 --> 00:51:39.119
<v Speaker 1>That that's a question mark. Like, how do

00:51:39.119 --> 00:51:40.400
<v Speaker 1>you keep it up to date and so

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:40.880
<v Speaker 1>on?

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:43.920
<v Speaker 1>And since this is GitOps,

00:51:45.119 --> 00:51:46.720
<v Speaker 1>all these components

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:49.200
<v Speaker 1>are just community ham charts.

00:51:49.599 --> 00:51:50.400
<v Speaker 1>Like, actually,

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:52.319
<v Speaker 1>I don't have anything special here, but maybe

00:51:52.319 --> 00:51:54.895
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna deploy NGINX just just so you

00:51:54.895 --> 00:51:56.815
<v Speaker 1>can see it. But we have hand releases

00:51:56.815 --> 00:51:58.015
<v Speaker 1>repositories.

00:51:58.414 --> 00:52:00.895
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, let me enable NGINX.

00:52:02.494 --> 00:52:04.174
<v Speaker 1>There is, like, a one pager, like, what

00:52:04.174 --> 00:52:05.295
<v Speaker 1>you can do with it.

00:52:06.655 --> 00:52:07.215
<v Speaker 1>Enable.

00:52:07.535 --> 00:52:08.095
<v Speaker 1>And

00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:11.000
<v Speaker 1>we don't expose much of the, you

00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:12.840
<v Speaker 1>know, the the

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.240
<v Speaker 1>wide options of all the Helm charts.

00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:18.200
<v Speaker 1>What we have a knowledge base entry for

00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:20.600
<v Speaker 1>and what we support is like a yeah.

00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:21.400
<v Speaker 1>It's mandatory.

00:52:24.805 --> 00:52:27.925
<v Speaker 1>We'll suppose and you can use these you

00:52:27.925 --> 00:52:28.885
<v Speaker 1>can extend,

00:52:29.445 --> 00:52:30.165
<v Speaker 1>these

00:52:30.405 --> 00:52:32.325
<v Speaker 1>ham chart values in git.

00:52:32.725 --> 00:52:33.365
<v Speaker 1>So

00:52:33.685 --> 00:52:36.725
<v Speaker 1>now what is being placed into this repository

00:52:36.725 --> 00:52:37.845
<v Speaker 1>is, regular

00:52:38.550 --> 00:52:39.990
<v Speaker 1>flux CRDs

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:41.270
<v Speaker 1>like helm release.

00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:45.190
<v Speaker 1>And you can extend

00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:47.270
<v Speaker 1>these values. We will not break it. We

00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:49.270
<v Speaker 1>will not lose it. There is like a

00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:50.230
<v Speaker 1>three way merge

00:52:50.645 --> 00:52:52.885
<v Speaker 1>going on every time you we we we

00:52:52.885 --> 00:52:56.005
<v Speaker 1>update these. So so you could have custom

00:52:56.005 --> 00:52:57.445
<v Speaker 1>configurations in here.

00:52:58.484 --> 00:52:59.605
<v Speaker 1>But if your

00:53:00.085 --> 00:53:00.885
<v Speaker 1>peer

00:53:01.285 --> 00:53:03.204
<v Speaker 1>approved this and merge it,

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:09.680
<v Speaker 1>Then, of course, flux going to

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:12.160
<v Speaker 1>pull it down, install, and

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:15.280
<v Speaker 1>it is visible somewhat again in this

00:53:18.275 --> 00:53:19.875
<v Speaker 1>let me just push a refresh

00:53:20.115 --> 00:53:22.515
<v Speaker 1>in this this view. So now

00:53:23.395 --> 00:53:24.195
<v Speaker 1>this is

00:53:24.435 --> 00:53:26.195
<v Speaker 1>pointing to the latest commit,

00:53:26.755 --> 00:53:27.235
<v Speaker 1>and

00:53:27.715 --> 00:53:29.235
<v Speaker 1>there should be a message here

00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:32.890
<v Speaker 1>that what why is it waiting

00:53:32.890 --> 00:53:35.850
<v Speaker 1>right now. But, yeah, you can deploy components

00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:37.530
<v Speaker 1>like this. And now that you have an

00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:40.330
<v Speaker 1>ingress controller, of course, the world opens up

00:53:40.330 --> 00:53:41.690
<v Speaker 1>and you have cert manager.

00:53:42.010 --> 00:53:42.570
<v Speaker 1>And,

00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:44.170
<v Speaker 1>honestly, just by

00:53:45.595 --> 00:53:48.395
<v Speaker 1>Gimlet just puts YAMLs into a Git repository

00:53:48.395 --> 00:53:51.915
<v Speaker 1>and builds on brilliant components and

00:53:51.995 --> 00:53:54.395
<v Speaker 1>brilliant custom or Kubernetes

00:53:54.395 --> 00:53:55.435
<v Speaker 1>resources.

00:53:55.835 --> 00:53:58.635
<v Speaker 1>And just by this very thin feature set,

00:53:59.870 --> 00:54:01.070
<v Speaker 1>we can support

00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:02.750
<v Speaker 1>basically,

00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:04.350
<v Speaker 1>yeah,

00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:06.350
<v Speaker 1>all the needs that a

00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:08.910
<v Speaker 1>small medium company needs.

00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:12.190
<v Speaker 1>Of course, whenever you just grow out of

00:54:12.190 --> 00:54:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Gimlet,

00:54:13.095 --> 00:54:15.255
<v Speaker 1>you jump into these repositories

00:54:15.335 --> 00:54:15.975
<v Speaker 1>and

00:54:16.935 --> 00:54:19.575
<v Speaker 1>you you make modifications

00:54:19.575 --> 00:54:21.975
<v Speaker 1>to the infrastructure components as you please.

00:54:23.494 --> 00:54:25.895
<v Speaker 1>For the developer part, we have a workflow.

00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:29.240
<v Speaker 1>People might like it, might not not like

00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:31.400
<v Speaker 1>it. And, yeah, they can

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:34.040
<v Speaker 1>decide for themselves. And and I really encourage

00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:36.760
<v Speaker 1>everybody to to jump on onto the website

00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:37.480
<v Speaker 1>because

00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:39.320
<v Speaker 1>it's really all it takes is k three

00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:40.680
<v Speaker 1>d and kubectl.

00:54:41.585 --> 00:54:42.865
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:54:44.065 --> 00:54:45.265
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Nice.

00:54:46.224 --> 00:54:48.145
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let me pop this over. Is it

00:54:48.145 --> 00:54:50.305
<v Speaker 0>demo done yet? Alright. Okay. Cool. I think

00:54:50.464 --> 00:54:52.224
<v Speaker 1>yeah. I I think at least until we

00:54:52.224 --> 00:54:54.464
<v Speaker 1>have more topics to discuss, I think. Yeah.

00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:56.840
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I I like that.

00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:59.400
<v Speaker 0>What I like about Gimlet is this hooking

00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:01.160
<v Speaker 0>into the open source ecosystem.

00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:03.000
<v Speaker 0>It's just in flux under the hood, but

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:03.800
<v Speaker 0>is then,

00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:06.040
<v Speaker 0>you know, you you kind of appreciate that

00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:08.265
<v Speaker 0>flux as just a primitive. It's not a

00:55:08.265 --> 00:55:09.065
<v Speaker 0>platform,

00:55:09.065 --> 00:55:11.465
<v Speaker 0>and it requires a lot more

00:55:11.945 --> 00:55:14.425
<v Speaker 0>work from developer teams beyond that. And Gimlet

00:55:14.425 --> 00:55:15.865
<v Speaker 0>seems to just be sitting on top of

00:55:15.865 --> 00:55:17.625
<v Speaker 0>that and say, well, let's make this easier.

00:55:18.025 --> 00:55:20.425
<v Speaker 0>And so I like like that we I

00:55:19.839 --> 00:55:21.520
<v Speaker 0>can't believe you gave that thirty seconds at

00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:23.040
<v Speaker 0>the end of marketplace. Right? But that's a

00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:25.680
<v Speaker 0>huge feature. Like, again, for people that just

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:27.599
<v Speaker 0>want to get stuff deployed to Kubernetes, they

00:55:27.599 --> 00:55:29.680
<v Speaker 0>want to get Kida involved. They want to

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:32.079
<v Speaker 0>have an ingress controller. They they want to

00:55:32.079 --> 00:55:34.160
<v Speaker 0>deploy a post grids, whatever that might be.

00:55:34.775 --> 00:55:36.455
<v Speaker 0>They there's no framework that can do that.

00:55:36.455 --> 00:55:38.535
<v Speaker 0>Those things don't exist in the marketplace just

00:55:38.535 --> 00:55:40.135
<v Speaker 0>now, then someone can just go and add

00:55:40.135 --> 00:55:42.055
<v Speaker 0>it as an open source contribution.

00:55:42.055 --> 00:55:43.495
<v Speaker 0>So we're building,

00:55:43.895 --> 00:55:44.535
<v Speaker 0>you know,

00:55:45.095 --> 00:55:47.930
<v Speaker 0>an entire product that the community can benefit

00:55:47.930 --> 00:55:49.770
<v Speaker 0>from that makes life easier for the people

00:55:49.770 --> 00:55:51.690
<v Speaker 0>that don't wanna be in the nagery all

00:55:51.690 --> 00:55:52.250
<v Speaker 0>day.

00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:53.930
<v Speaker 0>I like that.

00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:56.490
<v Speaker 0>The UI and the syncing and all of

00:55:56.490 --> 00:55:57.849
<v Speaker 0>that is really cool too.

00:55:58.410 --> 00:56:00.845
<v Speaker 0>And using Buildpacks. It's very cool. I like

00:56:00.445 --> 00:56:02.205
<v Speaker 0>Thank you. Thank you.

00:56:03.005 --> 00:56:05.485
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So so you mentioned Keda and

00:56:05.645 --> 00:56:08.205
<v Speaker 1>you install Keda. It just went, you know,

00:56:08.365 --> 00:56:09.724
<v Speaker 1>just graduated

00:56:09.724 --> 00:56:11.165
<v Speaker 1>in CSCF. And

00:56:11.565 --> 00:56:12.765
<v Speaker 1>so

00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:15.590
<v Speaker 1>I set up Ketaph for the fifth time

00:56:15.590 --> 00:56:18.390
<v Speaker 1>for in the past two years or something.

00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:20.710
<v Speaker 1>And the use case was like, hey, I

00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:21.670
<v Speaker 1>have a queue.

00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:24.870
<v Speaker 1>I need to have a worker processing just

00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:26.390
<v Speaker 1>one unit unit

00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:27.190
<v Speaker 1>of the queue.

00:56:27.815 --> 00:56:30.295
<v Speaker 1>And they should auto scale this. And this

00:56:30.295 --> 00:56:31.735
<v Speaker 1>is a very complex thing.

00:56:32.215 --> 00:56:34.215
<v Speaker 1>And I told the guy,

00:56:35.095 --> 00:56:37.255
<v Speaker 1>this is gonna be fun. Like, join me,

00:56:37.255 --> 00:56:39.655
<v Speaker 1>screen share. We were done in an hour.

00:56:39.895 --> 00:56:41.335
<v Speaker 1>And and this is when I when I

00:56:41.335 --> 00:56:43.095
<v Speaker 1>say that Kubernetes is, like,

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:44.980
<v Speaker 1>crazy major

00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:47.539
<v Speaker 1>in some areas, of course, and we are

00:56:47.539 --> 00:56:49.460
<v Speaker 1>lacking a bunch of things elsewhere.

00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:52.819
<v Speaker 1>But but as you said, like, from from

00:56:52.819 --> 00:56:53.940
<v Speaker 1>those marketplace,

00:56:54.099 --> 00:56:56.615
<v Speaker 1>that's once one building block. I would really

00:56:56.615 --> 00:56:58.855
<v Speaker 1>like if Gimlet could be the content place

00:56:58.855 --> 00:57:01.415
<v Speaker 1>as well, where people could get this operational

00:57:03.095 --> 00:57:03.895
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.

00:57:04.615 --> 00:57:06.535
<v Speaker 1>Hey, I need SSL. Hey, I need an

00:57:06.535 --> 00:57:08.775
<v Speaker 1>auto scale job with a ready SKU.

00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:11.390
<v Speaker 1>All these things like what Digital Ocean did,

00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:13.630
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned earlier. So that's definitely part of

00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:14.270
<v Speaker 1>the vision.

00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:17.630
<v Speaker 1>But we are a bootstrap company and, yeah,

00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:19.710
<v Speaker 1>life is always in the way and so

00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:20.510
<v Speaker 1>on. So yeah.

00:57:21.695 --> 00:57:24.335
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I mean, every time I talk about

00:57:24.335 --> 00:57:26.494
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes at a conference, right, there's always the

00:57:26.494 --> 00:57:28.095
<v Speaker 0>people to see it, but there's a lot

00:57:28.095 --> 00:57:29.055
<v Speaker 0>of complexity.

00:57:29.215 --> 00:57:31.055
<v Speaker 0>And what if you don't need that complexity?

00:57:31.375 --> 00:57:33.055
<v Speaker 0>And my answer to that these days, right,

00:57:33.055 --> 00:57:35.215
<v Speaker 0>is that Kubernetes is what? Seven years old,

00:57:35.570 --> 00:57:37.250
<v Speaker 0>a lot of fat older than that. Right?

00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:38.770
<v Speaker 0>It's got to the point where it's almost

00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:41.890
<v Speaker 0>ubiquitous if people are deploying web containers. So

00:57:41.890 --> 00:57:43.250
<v Speaker 0>now you've got a choice as a small

00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:44.050
<v Speaker 0>organization.

00:57:44.369 --> 00:57:46.050
<v Speaker 0>Either use the thing that everyone else is

00:57:46.050 --> 00:57:46.770
<v Speaker 0>using or

00:57:47.170 --> 00:57:49.890
<v Speaker 0>you just use Docker or some other tool

00:57:49.890 --> 00:57:52.745
<v Speaker 0>that's not as complicated however because everyone else

00:57:52.745 --> 00:57:53.865
<v Speaker 0>is using Kubernetes.

00:57:53.945 --> 00:57:55.465
<v Speaker 0>All the evolution is happening here. All the

00:57:55.465 --> 00:57:57.465
<v Speaker 0>contingencies are happening here. You're gonna lose out

00:57:57.465 --> 00:58:00.665
<v Speaker 0>on tools like KEDA and Captain, Gimlet,

00:58:00.825 --> 00:58:03.465
<v Speaker 0>all of these things. Monitoring is drastically easier

00:58:03.465 --> 00:58:05.545
<v Speaker 0>with Kubernetes because you can just install Kube

00:58:05.545 --> 00:58:06.265
<v Speaker 0>Prometheus. Right?

00:58:07.059 --> 00:58:08.980
<v Speaker 0>So you sacrifice all that stuff and yes,

00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:10.500
<v Speaker 0>there is a bit of complexity,

00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:12.900
<v Speaker 0>but we're fortunate enough to have people like

00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:14.740
<v Speaker 0>you and others in this space who are

00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:16.579
<v Speaker 0>building tools to make this easier for the

00:58:16.579 --> 00:58:18.099
<v Speaker 0>people that just want to get shit done.

00:58:18.515 --> 00:58:20.675
<v Speaker 0>And I think that's really cool. So Kubernetes

00:58:20.675 --> 00:58:21.715
<v Speaker 0>has complex,

00:58:21.955 --> 00:58:24.035
<v Speaker 0>but it's worth it to take advantage of

00:58:24.035 --> 00:58:25.875
<v Speaker 0>all these amazing evolutions.

00:58:27.075 --> 00:58:29.395
<v Speaker 1>David, you're studying saying this better than I

00:58:29.395 --> 00:58:29.875
<v Speaker 1>am. So

00:58:30.609 --> 00:58:31.730
<v Speaker 1>thank

00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:33.970
<v Speaker 1>you for all this. I'm taking notes and

00:58:33.970 --> 00:58:36.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna watch the recording and put all

00:58:36.210 --> 00:58:38.130
<v Speaker 1>this on the marketing page. So thank you

00:58:38.130 --> 00:58:39.810
<v Speaker 1>for this wonderful

00:58:40.369 --> 00:58:41.090
<v Speaker 1>summary.

00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:43.895
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, before we finish up, why don't

00:58:43.895 --> 00:58:45.575
<v Speaker 0>you tell us you know, you've mentioned division

00:58:45.575 --> 00:58:47.095
<v Speaker 0>of Gimlet a couple of times. So maybe

00:58:47.095 --> 00:58:49.175
<v Speaker 0>tell us what's coming next, what he's working

00:58:49.175 --> 00:58:50.375
<v Speaker 0>on, what's exciting.

00:58:51.095 --> 00:58:53.095
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. What what's the future of Gimlet?

00:58:53.974 --> 00:58:55.415
<v Speaker 1>Many things are exciting.

00:58:55.895 --> 00:58:57.095
<v Speaker 1>Right now, I am

00:58:57.494 --> 00:58:57.895
<v Speaker 1>honestly,

00:58:59.150 --> 00:59:01.470
<v Speaker 1>we are getting Google searches on

00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:04.590
<v Speaker 1>things like how do I deploy static site

00:59:04.590 --> 00:59:05.710
<v Speaker 1>on Kubernetes.

00:59:06.190 --> 00:59:08.750
<v Speaker 1>Like, if we've wrote a static site blog

00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:11.550
<v Speaker 1>post in April and that's the highest performing

00:59:11.550 --> 00:59:11.710
<v Speaker 1>one.

00:59:12.675 --> 00:59:16.435
<v Speaker 1>Also, the CML generator you've seen is is

00:59:16.435 --> 00:59:18.195
<v Speaker 1>also on the top three

00:59:18.595 --> 00:59:20.515
<v Speaker 1>from where we get we are getting traffic.

00:59:20.515 --> 00:59:20.995
<v Speaker 1>So

00:59:21.715 --> 00:59:23.395
<v Speaker 1>it's not exciting from

00:59:23.475 --> 00:59:26.435
<v Speaker 1>the product product's perspective, but it's exciting from

00:59:26.435 --> 00:59:29.530
<v Speaker 1>the business's perspective that that we should funnel

00:59:29.530 --> 00:59:32.170
<v Speaker 1>in all those people and maybe widening this

00:59:32.170 --> 00:59:35.049
<v Speaker 1>this audience that that could come to Kubernetes.

00:59:35.049 --> 00:59:35.530
<v Speaker 1>So

00:59:35.849 --> 00:59:36.650
<v Speaker 1>definitely,

00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:38.650
<v Speaker 1>that's one focus area of mine

00:59:39.049 --> 00:59:39.690
<v Speaker 1>to

00:59:40.170 --> 00:59:42.010
<v Speaker 1>to help these people and and really,

00:59:43.944 --> 00:59:46.505
<v Speaker 1>yeah, help them and, you know, like, getting

00:59:46.505 --> 00:59:48.905
<v Speaker 1>adoption and and users and so on. And

00:59:48.905 --> 00:59:50.825
<v Speaker 1>obviously, on the product side, there's so many

00:59:50.825 --> 00:59:53.065
<v Speaker 1>things, we can do and we probably should

00:59:53.065 --> 00:59:53.945
<v Speaker 1>do, like,

00:59:55.065 --> 00:59:57.065
<v Speaker 1>like application troubleshooting,

00:59:57.145 --> 00:59:59.690
<v Speaker 1>like, if the pod is in crash loop,

00:59:59.690 --> 01:00:00.730
<v Speaker 1>like, what to do,

01:00:01.690 --> 01:00:04.250
<v Speaker 1>like, either with with content pieces or, like,

01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:06.250
<v Speaker 1>well placed warnings.

01:00:06.329 --> 01:00:09.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't wanna go, like, a like, %

01:00:09.690 --> 01:00:12.695
<v Speaker 1>in, like there are startups on this niche

01:00:12.695 --> 01:00:14.295
<v Speaker 1>alone. So I don't want to do all

01:00:14.295 --> 01:00:16.535
<v Speaker 1>that, but at least covering the basics because

01:00:16.535 --> 01:00:17.735
<v Speaker 1>I think we should do a lot more

01:00:17.735 --> 01:00:19.735
<v Speaker 1>than what we do today. So that's definitely

01:00:19.735 --> 01:00:20.855
<v Speaker 1>an interest area.

01:00:21.255 --> 01:00:21.815
<v Speaker 1>And

01:00:22.535 --> 01:00:25.270
<v Speaker 1>then comes the the brilliant use case of,

01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:27.110
<v Speaker 1>you know, if you could provision

01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:31.109
<v Speaker 1>cloud resources like an SQL database or a

01:00:31.109 --> 01:00:32.869
<v Speaker 1>cloud Redis instance

01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:34.630
<v Speaker 1>with cross plane or,

01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:37.589
<v Speaker 1>we actually had something working with the Terraform

01:00:37.589 --> 01:00:38.230
<v Speaker 1>controller.

01:00:38.415 --> 01:00:40.575
<v Speaker 1>But now sort of not

01:00:41.695 --> 01:00:42.975
<v Speaker 1>not not prioritizing

01:00:42.975 --> 01:00:44.815
<v Speaker 1>that too much at the moment.

01:00:45.135 --> 01:00:47.375
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So so those are those are like,

01:00:47.375 --> 01:00:49.695
<v Speaker 1>I'm an engineer and and I just love

01:00:49.695 --> 01:00:51.295
<v Speaker 1>that use case. Then we have it working

01:00:51.295 --> 01:00:53.710
<v Speaker 1>and it's super simple and it just comes

01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:54.670
<v Speaker 1>down again

01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:57.710
<v Speaker 1>us creating a YAML file in a git

01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:58.510
<v Speaker 1>repository

01:00:58.910 --> 01:01:01.710
<v Speaker 1>and the wonderful ecosystem of Kubernetes. All those

01:01:01.710 --> 01:01:02.990
<v Speaker 1>controllers just

01:01:03.150 --> 01:01:05.790
<v Speaker 1>just work. So I I just love that.

01:01:06.670 --> 01:01:09.070
<v Speaker 1>So most likely we're gonna do

01:01:09.684 --> 01:01:12.885
<v Speaker 1>marketing and and and nailing

01:01:12.885 --> 01:01:14.005
<v Speaker 1>the developer

01:01:14.405 --> 01:01:16.885
<v Speaker 1>workflows and some observability

01:01:16.885 --> 01:01:18.164
<v Speaker 1>and troubleshooting.

01:01:18.164 --> 01:01:20.244
<v Speaker 1>I think that's that's very

01:01:20.244 --> 01:01:22.565
<v Speaker 1>much in focus right now. Polishing

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:26.390
<v Speaker 1>the big things we have, filling in the

01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:27.910
<v Speaker 1>gaps because we have gaps.

01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:29.750
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:32.550
<v Speaker 0>And lastly, if people want to get involved,

01:01:32.550 --> 01:01:33.990
<v Speaker 0>they want to contribute, or they would just

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:35.670
<v Speaker 0>want to follow you for all of your

01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:37.270
<v Speaker 0>takes on Kubernetes and complexity,

01:01:37.635 --> 01:01:38.835
<v Speaker 0>Where do they go? They

01:01:40.195 --> 01:01:41.875
<v Speaker 1>go to Gimlet. And

01:01:42.115 --> 01:01:44.435
<v Speaker 1>launch k three d and launch Gimlet. That's

01:01:44.435 --> 01:01:46.995
<v Speaker 1>that's that's the most important because we are

01:01:46.995 --> 01:01:49.395
<v Speaker 1>we are so hungry for feedback. And we

01:01:49.395 --> 01:01:51.540
<v Speaker 1>have a Discord channel. You can find that

01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:52.740
<v Speaker 1>on the on Gimlet.

01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:55.380
<v Speaker 1>We have Twitter, Laslow CPH,

01:01:56.340 --> 01:01:56.900

<v Speaker 1>25.

01:02:10.415 --> 01:02:13.214
<v Speaker 1>Sadly, we we have to miss Sivo Navigate.

01:02:13.214 --> 01:02:16.494
<v Speaker 1>That's just not good timing wise and yeah.

01:02:16.575 --> 01:02:17.295
<v Speaker 1>All kinds of things.

01:02:18.050 --> 01:02:21.810
<v Speaker 1>But, yes, come find us on Twitter, Gimlet

01:02:21.810 --> 01:02:22.610
<v Speaker 1>underscore

01:02:22.690 --> 01:02:24.210
<v Speaker 1>and Laslow CPH.

01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:25.970
<v Speaker 1>And also GitHub.

01:02:26.130 --> 01:02:27.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Everywhere.

01:02:28.770 --> 01:02:31.010
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Just go to Google, search for Laslow

01:02:31.010 --> 01:02:32.850
<v Speaker 0>and Gimlet. You you won't miss.

01:02:33.525 --> 01:02:35.765
<v Speaker 1>Exactly. Exactly. Well, thank you so much for

01:02:35.765 --> 01:02:37.285
