00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
<v Speaker 0>Here's a tip for your shell that will

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.320
<v Speaker 0>have you navigate in all your directories

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.400
<v Speaker 0>in literally zero time.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.679
<v Speaker 0>There's a tool written in Rust, obviously,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.120
<v Speaker 0>called Zocsight.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.735
<v Speaker 0>When enabled in your shell, you can type

00:00:14.735 --> 00:00:15.455
<v Speaker 0>z,

00:00:16.255 --> 00:00:18.095
<v Speaker 0>a partial directory name,

00:00:18.255 --> 00:00:19.535
<v Speaker 0>and it will take you there.

00:00:20.815 --> 00:00:22.015
<v Speaker 0>You can do this

00:00:22.415 --> 00:00:24.654
<v Speaker 0>no matter where you are, and it will

00:00:24.654 --> 00:00:25.375
<v Speaker 0>always

00:00:25.535 --> 00:00:26.335
<v Speaker 0>find

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:29.790
<v Speaker 0>the right place. Let's find an extremely nasty

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.070
<v Speaker 0>directory within my Rawkode Academy mono repository

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.150
<v Speaker 0>for the Rawkode Studio project.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.790
<v Speaker 0>As you can see, that's quite a path

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:38.590
<v Speaker 0>to remember.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.865
<v Speaker 0>Now sometimes there's ambiguity, Like if I go

00:00:41.865 --> 00:00:43.625
<v Speaker 0>to Dagger, it takes me to the Dagger

00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:45.465
<v Speaker 0>directory in my studio project.

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:47.785
<v Speaker 0>However, Zoxides also allows you to use the

00:00:47.785 --> 00:00:48.745
<v Speaker 0>ZI

00:00:48.745 --> 00:00:49.625
<v Speaker 0>command.

00:00:49.865 --> 00:00:52.425
<v Speaker 0>This time when I run ZI Dagger, I

00:00:52.425 --> 00:00:53.545
<v Speaker 0>get to select

00:00:53.945 --> 00:00:56.265
<v Speaker 0>from all the options available.

00:00:56.894 --> 00:00:57.374
<v Speaker 0>Enjoy.
