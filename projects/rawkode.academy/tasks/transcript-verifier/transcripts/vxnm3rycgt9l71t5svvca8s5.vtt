00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
<v Speaker 0>Well, hey. I'm, I'm Jason Morgan. I'm a

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.279
<v Speaker 0>technical evangelist with Voyant, and just means it's

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.520
<v Speaker 0>my job to talk to folks about Linkerd,

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.360
<v Speaker 0>encourage them to try it out, and help

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.440
<v Speaker 0>them be successful once they get on that

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.335
<v Speaker 0>path. Yeah. And I'm Catherine Panganini. I'm the

00:00:14.335 --> 00:00:16.654
<v Speaker 1>head of marketing and community at Buoyant,

00:00:16.895 --> 00:00:19.455
<v Speaker 1>and I will work with Jason on Link4D,

00:00:19.455 --> 00:00:22.415
<v Speaker 1>but also on the cloud native glossary, something

00:00:22.735 --> 00:00:25.135
<v Speaker 1>one of our pet projects that we created

00:00:25.135 --> 00:00:28.109
<v Speaker 1>together and are very proud of. So

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.670
<v Speaker 1>yeah. Yeah. So, you're asking about what the

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.870
<v Speaker 0>cloud native glossary is. So it was it's

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.350
<v Speaker 0>it

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.150
<v Speaker 0>it's a glossary of terms, but it's not

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.230
<v Speaker 0>as boring as it sounds, I promise. Or

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.925
<v Speaker 0>it's really boring but still helpful. So our

00:00:42.925 --> 00:00:45.325
<v Speaker 0>intent was as we're as we kinda got

00:00:45.325 --> 00:00:47.325
<v Speaker 0>together and started working together, you know, before

00:00:47.325 --> 00:00:50.684
<v Speaker 0>working together at Buoyant Right. Right, we'd we'd

00:00:50.684 --> 00:00:52.045
<v Speaker 0>each spend a lot of time trying to

00:00:52.045 --> 00:00:52.845
<v Speaker 0>explain to folks

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.309
<v Speaker 0>concepts

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.109
<v Speaker 0>around Kubernetes and cloud native and like, if

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:58.949
<v Speaker 0>you've ever had to talk to your friends

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.030
<v Speaker 0>or people in your self circle about about

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.550
<v Speaker 0>this space,

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.549
<v Speaker 0>you'll find a lot of the terms don't,

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.470
<v Speaker 0>like, don't have meaning to a lot of

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.390
<v Speaker 0>people. Right? And

00:01:08.495 --> 00:01:11.535
<v Speaker 0>the glossary was an attempt to take

00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:15.135
<v Speaker 0>terms like service mesh, container,

00:01:15.215 --> 00:01:17.935
<v Speaker 0>you know, gate API gateway. It was a

00:01:17.935 --> 00:01:19.855
<v Speaker 0>pure team. Yeah. Yeah. Was their ability. All

00:01:19.855 --> 00:01:20.575
<v Speaker 0>the same.

00:01:21.295 --> 00:01:22.095
<v Speaker 0>Make them

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.840
<v Speaker 0>easy to understand in plain language.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.040
<v Speaker 0>And

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.440
<v Speaker 0>the English part's good, but the really exciting

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.840
<v Speaker 0>part is Oh, yeah. So we are we

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.040
<v Speaker 1>have several localization teams that are localizing the

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.880
<v Speaker 1>glossary in I don't know how many languages

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.865
<v Speaker 1>now, but we have Chinese,

00:01:38.345 --> 00:01:40.345
<v Speaker 1>Korean, Spanish, Portuguese,

00:01:40.665 --> 00:01:43.625
<v Speaker 1>French. Oh, French is not live yet. Spanish

00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:45.625
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know. Probably missing something. The

00:01:45.625 --> 00:01:48.505
<v Speaker 0>Hindi one's live. Oh, Hindi. Yeah. So very

00:01:48.505 --> 00:01:49.785
<v Speaker 1>excited about that. And

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.250
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the important things, especially

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.890
<v Speaker 1>for someone who is with my background who

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.050
<v Speaker 1>does not have a technical background,

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.890
<v Speaker 1>it's really

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.170
<v Speaker 1>hard to understand cloud native. There is no

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.125
<v Speaker 1>context. And most of the content out there

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:08.085
<v Speaker 1>really assumes a lot of context that people

00:02:08.085 --> 00:02:10.085
<v Speaker 1>like me don't have. And so one thing

00:02:10.085 --> 00:02:11.445
<v Speaker 1>that was important for me when we created

00:02:11.445 --> 00:02:12.725
<v Speaker 1>LostRay was to

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:17.310
<v Speaker 1>lighten a way that people like me can

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.670
<v Speaker 1>understand, because there are a lot of people

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:19.870
<v Speaker 1>who need to understand it

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.510
<v Speaker 1>and are not technologists. You have all the

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.990
<v Speaker 1>people who are working in cloud native companies,

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.045
<v Speaker 1>marketing, sales, but the leadership team too who

00:02:29.045 --> 00:02:31.605
<v Speaker 1>are ultimately taking and making all these decisions

00:02:31.605 --> 00:02:32.565
<v Speaker 1>about whether

00:02:32.725 --> 00:02:33.365
<v Speaker 1>to

00:02:34.165 --> 00:02:34.885
<v Speaker 1>fund

00:02:34.965 --> 00:02:35.445
<v Speaker 1>project

00:02:36.245 --> 00:02:39.045
<v Speaker 1>which is very expensive. And so if they

00:02:39.045 --> 00:02:40.885
<v Speaker 1>don't understand it, you cannot talk to your

00:02:40.885 --> 00:02:42.005
<v Speaker 1>leadership team about

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.720
<v Speaker 1>these projects. How how can they make these

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.120
<v Speaker 1>decisions? So so the goal is not only

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.080
<v Speaker 1>to educate technical people but also nontechnical people.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.600
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like it's good, like the

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.200
<v Speaker 1>way they're described,

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.795
<v Speaker 1>it's accessible for both. Right? Like, if you're

00:02:55.795 --> 00:02:58.515
<v Speaker 1>just getting started, a technical person will appreciate

00:02:58.515 --> 00:03:01.235
<v Speaker 1>the easy, digestible language, but it's all it's

00:03:01.235 --> 00:03:04.755
<v Speaker 1>not excluding nontechnical people as well. I think

00:03:04.755 --> 00:03:05.955
<v Speaker 0>that's a great I think that's a great

00:03:05.955 --> 00:03:08.340
<v Speaker 0>explanation. So I heard a couple questions in

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.740
<v Speaker 0>there. Right? Like, is the glossary done? No.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.380
<v Speaker 0>Right? Absolutely not. And it it won't get

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.580
<v Speaker 0>done. And what we'd really love is for

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.220
<v Speaker 0>folks

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.314
<v Speaker 0>for folks that are good at understanding and

00:03:20.314 --> 00:03:22.394
<v Speaker 0>explaining technical terms, if you have some time

00:03:22.394 --> 00:03:24.635
<v Speaker 0>and some bandwidth, look at our look at

00:03:24.635 --> 00:03:26.474
<v Speaker 0>look at the definitions that are out there.

00:03:26.474 --> 00:03:29.275
<v Speaker 0>If they can be improved, send PRs.

00:03:29.435 --> 00:03:31.754
<v Speaker 0>If there's something missing, you know, create an

00:03:31.754 --> 00:03:34.155
<v Speaker 0>entry. If you're a business or if you

00:03:34.155 --> 00:03:36.880
<v Speaker 0>are in the space and and you use

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.240
<v Speaker 0>a lot of terms, but you don't necessarily

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.080
<v Speaker 0>have them defined, don't go write your own

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.520
<v Speaker 0>glossary and definitions.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 0>Link to the cloud native glossary.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 0>You know, and then whatever whatever language is

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.240
<v Speaker 0>your native tongue, right, if it's not English,

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.675
<v Speaker 0>you know, we would love to see love

00:03:50.675 --> 00:03:52.515
<v Speaker 0>to see cloud native become

00:03:52.515 --> 00:03:53.555
<v Speaker 0>accessible.

00:03:53.635 --> 00:03:55.474
<v Speaker 0>And that sounds terrible, not as I We

00:03:55.474 --> 00:03:57.635
<v Speaker 0>love the the tooling and the technology

00:03:57.795 --> 00:04:00.595
<v Speaker 0>to become more accessible to more folks. Make

00:04:00.595 --> 00:04:02.930
<v Speaker 0>it a broader audience. Not not so much

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.370
<v Speaker 0>for like specialized

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.330
<v Speaker 0>engineers

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.810
<v Speaker 0>that really love Kubernetes and containers, but make

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.489
<v Speaker 0>it for people that are just trying to

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.650
<v Speaker 0>get things done with computers.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.610
<v Speaker 0>Alright? And make it easier for those folks.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.370
<v Speaker 0>So I think I answered a lot of

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.690
<v Speaker 0>your questions.

00:04:17.254 --> 00:04:18.294
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And think

00:04:20.854 --> 00:04:22.294
<v Speaker 1>one one of the important things is the

00:04:22.294 --> 00:04:25.014
<v Speaker 1>glossary is really a living document. Right? Like,

00:04:25.014 --> 00:04:26.775
<v Speaker 1>things change all the time. Technology changes all

00:04:26.775 --> 00:04:28.854
<v Speaker 1>the time. Right. That's why it's like, it's

00:04:29.014 --> 00:04:31.175
<v Speaker 1>it's not good to have like, if you

00:04:31.175 --> 00:04:32.215
<v Speaker 1>see definitions

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:33.840
<v Speaker 1>now out there,

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.720
<v Speaker 1>most of them are vendor provided,

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.880
<v Speaker 1>which is actually really bad because

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.680
<v Speaker 1>vendors might be biased towards their own product,

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.520
<v Speaker 1>they may not keep it up to date,

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.759
<v Speaker 1>you know. There are lots of issues with

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:49.245
<v Speaker 1>it. So like having a glossary

00:04:49.245 --> 00:04:50.685
<v Speaker 1>that is vendor neutral

00:04:50.845 --> 00:04:53.485
<v Speaker 1>by an institution like the CNCF where anyone

00:04:53.485 --> 00:04:56.525
<v Speaker 1>can contribute, you know, that is a document

00:04:56.525 --> 00:04:59.005
<v Speaker 1>that is always updated, that will ensure that

00:04:59.005 --> 00:04:59.485
<v Speaker 1>they're

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.250
<v Speaker 1>vendor neutral, that they are objective,

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.650
<v Speaker 1>they're not, you know, representing some

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 1>vendor's

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.730
<v Speaker 1>view.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.450
<v Speaker 1>And so, yeah, I mean, it is changing

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.850
<v Speaker 1>a lot. So that living aspect of it

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.530
<v Speaker 1>is really important, and that's why I think

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.264
<v Speaker 1>it will never end, Right. As cloud native

00:05:16.264 --> 00:05:19.305
<v Speaker 1>ends, you know? So there's always new technology

00:05:19.305 --> 00:05:22.185
<v Speaker 1>coming and yeah, and it's like as people

00:05:22.185 --> 00:05:23.944
<v Speaker 1>use it, that's our goal, right? As people

00:05:23.944 --> 00:05:26.104
<v Speaker 1>use it, you may because there's one approach,

00:05:26.104 --> 00:05:28.504
<v Speaker 1>right? Contributing to looking for specific terms that

00:05:28.504 --> 00:05:30.910
<v Speaker 1>you feel should be included, but my hope

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.670
<v Speaker 1>or our hope is that as people use

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.230
<v Speaker 1>it, right, you're using it because you wanna

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.550
<v Speaker 1>cling to it or understand it or explain

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.470
<v Speaker 1>it to someone, as you read it and

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.825
<v Speaker 1>you're like, Arun, I actually think this could

00:05:41.825 --> 00:05:43.905
<v Speaker 1>be improved or this could be slightly better

00:05:43.905 --> 00:05:45.985
<v Speaker 1>or we could build on that. Right? Like

00:05:45.985 --> 00:05:48.065
<v Speaker 1>like, that's how it gets better. It's a

00:05:48.065 --> 00:05:50.465
<v Speaker 1>little bit like Wikipedia. Right? Wikipedia is really

00:05:50.465 --> 00:05:52.625
<v Speaker 1>good because so many people contribute. Right? And

00:05:52.625 --> 00:05:55.040
<v Speaker 1>the more people contribute to the glossary, the

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.480
<v Speaker 1>better it will be. I think the foundation

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.640
<v Speaker 1>is there, so we have a lot of

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.000
<v Speaker 1>round covered.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.160
<v Speaker 1>But I'm pretty sure a lot can be

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.360
<v Speaker 1>improved. I'm pretty sure we missed terms. So

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. There are some terms that I really

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.255
<v Speaker 1>wanna get out there, like get ups. Meaning

00:06:10.255 --> 00:06:12.655
<v Speaker 1>help with that, simplifying that, so if anyone

00:06:12.655 --> 00:06:14.655
<v Speaker 1>is interested in helping out with that term,

00:06:14.655 --> 00:06:16.015
<v Speaker 1>it's not merged yet. So

00:06:16.495 --> 00:06:19.295
<v Speaker 1>yeah, I mean, anyone interested in that. And

00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:21.950
<v Speaker 1>what Jason mentioned, really, it's explaining

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:23.150
<v Speaker 1>complex

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.430
<v Speaker 1>terms and simple words is really hard.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.910
<v Speaker 0>Right. It requires a lot of knowledge.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:30.750
<v Speaker 1>But it's really fun once you get there.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.350
<v Speaker 1>So it's not easy, but it's like and

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.030
<v Speaker 1>it yeah. It's like once you see it,

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:34.750
<v Speaker 1>once you

00:06:35.125 --> 00:06:36.885
<v Speaker 1>read it, and it's such a yeah. It's

00:06:36.885 --> 00:06:38.245
<v Speaker 1>just I I think it's like a joy

00:06:38.245 --> 00:06:40.405
<v Speaker 1>to read it, and it's like so digestible.

00:06:40.405 --> 00:06:42.005
<v Speaker 1>It's like, suddenly it sounds so easy, and

00:06:42.005 --> 00:06:44.485
<v Speaker 1>then yeah. Them. Yeah. Yeah. The one only

00:06:44.485 --> 00:06:46.485
<v Speaker 0>caveat I'd put out there, if you're thinking

00:06:46.485 --> 00:06:49.300
<v Speaker 0>about it, right, like, if you're gonna write

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.699
<v Speaker 0>a definition for something, it's not, like, it's

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:53.460
<v Speaker 0>not an entry level thing. Even though there's

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.419
<v Speaker 0>no code, right, you really have to understand

00:06:56.419 --> 00:06:58.259
<v Speaker 0>what you're talking about in order to explain

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:00.340
<v Speaker 0>it in a clear fashion. Just be warned

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.020
<v Speaker 0>out there if you're thinking about contributing. That's

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:03.915
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Like a little bit of a misconception.

00:07:03.915 --> 00:07:05.915
<v Speaker 1>I think like the localization

00:07:05.915 --> 00:07:09.435
<v Speaker 1>aspect of this is good for entry level

00:07:09.435 --> 00:07:12.235
<v Speaker 1>contributors just because there is already a solid

00:07:12.235 --> 00:07:14.395
<v Speaker 0>Definition of the definition of And then localizing

00:07:14.395 --> 00:07:15.995
<v Speaker 1>is a lot easier in that sense. It's

00:07:15.995 --> 00:07:18.180
<v Speaker 1>still difficult. Like localizing well, but it's a

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.540
<v Speaker 1>little easier. You don't need to be an

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.860
<v Speaker 1>expert knowing it because someone did already that

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:22.900
<v Speaker 1>research and

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.780
<v Speaker 1>so, yeah. But it's fun. And, oh, the

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.700
<v Speaker 1>other thing is like we have we have

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.580
<v Speaker 1>monthly meetings where we meet with all the

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.935
<v Speaker 1>different teams around the world. It's so exciting.

00:07:32.935 --> 00:07:35.014
<v Speaker 1>You have like people from China, from Korea,

00:07:35.255 --> 00:07:35.895
<v Speaker 1>India,

00:07:36.134 --> 00:07:36.775
<v Speaker 1>Spain,

00:07:37.255 --> 00:07:38.935
<v Speaker 1>South America, and Brazil.

00:07:38.935 --> 00:07:40.694
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's it's really cool and like

00:07:40.935 --> 00:07:42.854
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That community, and we all try to

00:07:42.854 --> 00:07:44.294
<v Speaker 1>help each other, and they learn from each

00:07:44.294 --> 00:07:45.895
<v Speaker 1>other. I think that that is a little

00:07:45.895 --> 00:07:48.080
<v Speaker 1>bit special. Think that it is a little

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.639
<v Speaker 1>bit more international because of that localization

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:52.960
<v Speaker 1>aspect of it. And also, I know that

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.040
<v Speaker 1>the Kubernetes has localization, but I don't think

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.360
<v Speaker 1>they collaborate as much as our

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.175
<v Speaker 1>localization team, and they don't know each other

00:08:00.175 --> 00:08:01.455
<v Speaker 1>as much. And so I know some of

00:08:01.455 --> 00:08:04.255
<v Speaker 1>them do localize the Kubernetes docs, and they've

00:08:04.255 --> 00:08:05.535
<v Speaker 1>said that. And I think that's kind of

00:08:05.535 --> 00:08:07.855
<v Speaker 1>nice. Meeting people all around the world. So

00:08:07.855 --> 00:08:10.335
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's pretty cool. So the origin story

00:08:10.335 --> 00:08:11.855
<v Speaker 0>for the glossary, right, like where did it

00:08:11.855 --> 00:08:13.840
<v Speaker 0>come from? You know, I I say this

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.840
<v Speaker 0>a lot. Right? But it's really cool working

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.720
<v Speaker 0>with Catherine

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.800
<v Speaker 0>because, like, you know, most people, when you

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.720
<v Speaker 0>see something that's messed up, right, like, oh,

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.720
<v Speaker 0>that's funny. That's messed up or whatever. Right?

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.320
<v Speaker 0>And you kinda move on. You know? So

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.240
<v Speaker 0>Catherine and I started working together because she

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.845
<v Speaker 0>saw the CNCF landscape talk and was like,

00:08:28.845 --> 00:08:31.805
<v Speaker 0>hey, you know, this is a giant mess

00:08:31.805 --> 00:08:34.125
<v Speaker 0>of things. It's hard to understand.

00:08:34.445 --> 00:08:35.965
<v Speaker 0>And she she was like, let me figure

00:08:35.965 --> 00:08:37.165
<v Speaker 0>out how to make it better. So she

00:08:37.165 --> 00:08:39.165
<v Speaker 0>started writing this article series on

00:08:39.565 --> 00:08:40.445
<v Speaker 0>explaining

00:08:40.445 --> 00:08:43.409
<v Speaker 0>the cloud native landscape in a clear fashion.

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:45.329
<v Speaker 0>And so we started working together on that.

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:48.290
<v Speaker 0>And as that grew and, you know, we

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:51.009
<v Speaker 0>we actually started to make something really valuable,

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:53.089
<v Speaker 0>we got involved with the CNCF. And and

00:08:53.089 --> 00:08:54.850
<v Speaker 0>Catherine's been working with the CNCF for a

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:56.765
<v Speaker 0>while, but we're like, hey, there's a lot

00:08:56.765 --> 00:08:59.404
<v Speaker 0>of focus on technical value from the CNCF.

00:08:59.404 --> 00:09:01.245
<v Speaker 0>But what about, like, actual outcomes? What about

00:09:01.245 --> 00:09:04.365
<v Speaker 0>business value? And long story short, we set

00:09:04.365 --> 00:09:06.925
<v Speaker 0>up this business value committee within the CNCF.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:08.390
<v Speaker 0>And

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:09.830
<v Speaker 0>when we set it up, we're like, hey,

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:11.750
<v Speaker 0>what are some things we can do

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.430
<v Speaker 0>to help the CNCF add value to businesses?

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.030
<v Speaker 0>And one of the early ones that we

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.230
<v Speaker 0>came up with was

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:20.630
<v Speaker 0>a glossary of terms. Like, it would be

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:23.425
<v Speaker 0>really helpful if there first thing. You need

00:09:23.425 --> 00:09:25.505
<v Speaker 1>to understand the concepts before you Yeah. You

00:09:25.505 --> 00:09:27.825
<v Speaker 0>need have common language. First yeah. Right? Like,

00:09:27.825 --> 00:09:29.585
<v Speaker 0>if you don't use if you and I

00:09:29.585 --> 00:09:30.545
<v Speaker 0>use a word

00:09:31.105 --> 00:09:33.105
<v Speaker 0>differently, the same word differently,

00:09:33.425 --> 00:09:35.750
<v Speaker 0>that's that's a barrier to understanding.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:39.030
<v Speaker 0>And so having having shared definitions seemed Yeah.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.950
<v Speaker 0>Like the best and most boring place to

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.550
<v Speaker 0>start. Yeah. And I think, like, I mean,

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:45.350
<v Speaker 1>the CNCF started out really as the like,

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:47.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean, like, at the earlier on, like,

00:09:47.495 --> 00:09:50.134
<v Speaker 1>only the most technology advanced and highly skilled

00:09:50.134 --> 00:09:52.535
<v Speaker 1>engineers were interested in topics. So they had

00:09:52.535 --> 00:09:54.855
<v Speaker 1>all these content and very geeky, right, like

00:09:55.975 --> 00:09:56.695
<v Speaker 1>but so

00:09:57.095 --> 00:09:59.334
<v Speaker 1>much changed since then. Like, we're seeing so

00:09:59.589 --> 00:10:01.589
<v Speaker 1>much adoption. And as I mentioned before, you

00:10:01.589 --> 00:10:04.070
<v Speaker 1>have all these marketing and salespeople, all the

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.830
<v Speaker 1>leadership team, all we have all these people

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.670
<v Speaker 1>who are not necessarily technical,

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:10.470
<v Speaker 1>but it's, for them, critical for their biz

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.230
<v Speaker 1>like, business critical for them to understand it.

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:13.875
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise, they cannot sell it. Otherwise they cannot

00:10:13.875 --> 00:10:15.635
<v Speaker 1>make the right decisions. But there was no

00:10:15.635 --> 00:10:18.595
<v Speaker 1>content that was, like, for them. So, like,

00:10:18.595 --> 00:10:20.435
<v Speaker 1>we also thought, like, because the first articles

00:10:20.435 --> 00:10:22.195
<v Speaker 1>that we did was for the new stack,

00:10:22.195 --> 00:10:23.555
<v Speaker 1>and that was great. That's where we got

00:10:23.555 --> 00:10:25.475
<v Speaker 1>a lot of feedback. And at some point,

00:10:25.475 --> 00:10:27.970
<v Speaker 1>we said, like, CNCF should own this type

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:29.810
<v Speaker 1>of content. Like, why is I mean, it's

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:31.890
<v Speaker 1>great. We love the news stack and we

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:34.370
<v Speaker 1>appreciate appreciate the opportunity. But, like, the CNCF

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:38.130
<v Speaker 1>is the eminence in this, you know, field,

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:38.769
<v Speaker 1>and

00:10:39.425 --> 00:10:41.584
<v Speaker 1>they should kind of make it easier. How's

00:10:41.584 --> 00:10:44.144
<v Speaker 0>it work? I feel. Yeah. It's a little

00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:46.944
<v Speaker 1>too much. It's a very satisfying sound, though.

00:10:46.944 --> 00:10:49.264
<v Speaker 0>I really enjoy it. So I think one

00:10:49.264 --> 00:10:50.384
<v Speaker 1>of the things that

00:10:50.944 --> 00:10:52.865
<v Speaker 0>With the business value subcommittee,

00:10:52.865 --> 00:10:54.305
<v Speaker 0>right, do you believe

00:10:54.639 --> 00:10:56.079
<v Speaker 0>this is really a question because I don't

00:10:56.079 --> 00:10:58.079
<v Speaker 0>know the answer. Do you believe that the

00:10:58.079 --> 00:11:00.639
<v Speaker 0>CNCF is gonna do more things that focus

00:11:00.639 --> 00:11:01.120
<v Speaker 0>on

00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:04.639
<v Speaker 0>business leaders and help them understand the value

00:11:04.639 --> 00:11:06.800
<v Speaker 0>of the tech, not just the tech? So,

00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:09.199
<v Speaker 1>well, like, first of all, like, the business

00:11:09.199 --> 00:11:10.399
<v Speaker 1>value tracks

00:11:10.615 --> 00:11:13.095
<v Speaker 1>at coupon is something that came out from

00:11:13.095 --> 00:11:15.015
<v Speaker 1>our Yeah. And we so

00:11:15.015 --> 00:11:16.855
<v Speaker 1>we A of people come we did the

00:11:16.855 --> 00:11:19.095
<v Speaker 1>first we were the first reviewer for the

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:20.935
<v Speaker 1>first because it was like a separate thing.

00:11:20.935 --> 00:11:21.175
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:24.730
<v Speaker 1>So I think that is new.

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:26.970
<v Speaker 1>It's still kind

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.770
<v Speaker 1>of, well, is geared towards technical people too,

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:31.610
<v Speaker 1>but it's talking about the business value, right?

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:32.010
<v Speaker 1>And

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:34.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean, the business value sub committee is

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.810
<v Speaker 1>there to create these resources. So we we

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.610
<v Speaker 1>create we have created

00:11:38.625 --> 00:11:40.545
<v Speaker 1>the glossary where

00:11:40.945 --> 00:11:41.985
<v Speaker 1>in the works

00:11:42.385 --> 00:11:45.745
<v Speaker 1>is a project summary table, which is still

00:11:45.745 --> 00:11:47.745
<v Speaker 1>not ready, but it basically puts like all

00:11:47.745 --> 00:11:49.745
<v Speaker 1>the projects in one category side by side,

00:11:49.745 --> 00:11:51.720
<v Speaker 1>and you can compare what they do. This

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.880
<v Speaker 1>is not like business value, there's also like

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.800
<v Speaker 1>a business case in it, but it's like

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.800
<v Speaker 1>making sense of it or helping end users

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.760
<v Speaker 1>actually select which projects they should evaluate, and

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.435
<v Speaker 1>that came because like a service provider mentioned

00:12:03.435 --> 00:12:05.195
<v Speaker 1>it is so difficult for them to, like

00:12:05.195 --> 00:12:06.715
<v Speaker 1>the landscape is overwhelming,

00:12:06.875 --> 00:12:08.955
<v Speaker 1>he does not know which projects are relevant

00:12:08.955 --> 00:12:11.435
<v Speaker 1>for their clients, it's like you either have

00:12:11.435 --> 00:12:13.595
<v Speaker 1>the landscape which just just give you a

00:12:13.595 --> 00:12:15.115
<v Speaker 1>name, and then you have like deep dives,

00:12:15.115 --> 00:12:16.555
<v Speaker 1>and there's not like how do you, like,

00:12:16.555 --> 00:12:18.230
<v Speaker 1>they need an overview, it's like to understand

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:20.630
<v Speaker 1>like, okay, a, b, c look interesting, I'm

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:23.670
<v Speaker 1>gonna evaluate those. And it's really hard to

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:25.750
<v Speaker 1>kind of see what's relevant. And so that's

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.190
<v Speaker 1>like an end user request,

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.190
<v Speaker 1>right, like, or or need, so we try

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:30.870
<v Speaker 1>to cater to that. And then now we're

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:32.790
<v Speaker 1>also building

00:12:31.925 --> 00:12:34.324
<v Speaker 1>cloud native learning journey,

00:12:34.644 --> 00:12:37.125
<v Speaker 1>which is basically a page that will have

00:12:37.125 --> 00:12:39.125
<v Speaker 1>all these CMCF resources

00:12:39.204 --> 00:12:42.004
<v Speaker 1>bundled and it will start with content that

00:12:42.004 --> 00:12:43.125
<v Speaker 1>doesn't require

00:12:43.125 --> 00:12:45.365
<v Speaker 1>any previous knowledge, right? So it's like, okay,

00:12:45.365 --> 00:12:46.960
<v Speaker 1>if you're very new, this is the one

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.280
<v Speaker 1>on one section, start with the cloud native

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.680
<v Speaker 1>definition, then maybe the glossary, and then gets

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.720
<v Speaker 1>increasingly more advanced to really help people in

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.920
<v Speaker 1>their cloud native learning journey instead of having

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.240
<v Speaker 1>to find all these resources on from

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.705
<v Speaker 1>themselves. So I think most of that content

00:13:03.705 --> 00:13:05.625
<v Speaker 1>is not like initiated

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:08.745
<v Speaker 1>by the CNCF, but like groups like ours,

00:13:08.745 --> 00:13:10.665
<v Speaker 1>that's where people can tell. And most of

00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:12.585
<v Speaker 1>them is like generally people say like, oh,

00:13:12.585 --> 00:13:14.665
<v Speaker 1>this is a problem I've had. And then

00:13:14.665 --> 00:13:16.745
<v Speaker 1>we were like, okay, you're having this problem,

00:13:16.745 --> 00:13:18.790
<v Speaker 1>someone else probably having this problem. Like, let's

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:20.870
<v Speaker 1>solve this together. Like, let's create something that

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.190
<v Speaker 1>helps you, and in that way help other

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:25.670
<v Speaker 1>people too. So so I don't think yeah.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.150
<v Speaker 1>It's not CNCF driven in that sense, but

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.785
<v Speaker 1>it's like these these groups kind of create

00:13:30.865 --> 00:13:32.065
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of groups. Why the

00:13:32.065 --> 00:13:34.465
<v Speaker 1>cartographers group is another group that created like

00:13:34.465 --> 00:13:36.465
<v Speaker 1>the Cloud Native Maturity Model

00:13:36.625 --> 00:13:37.825
<v Speaker 1>and all these things. So there are all

00:13:37.825 --> 00:13:39.185
<v Speaker 1>these people who volunteer,

00:13:39.265 --> 00:13:41.905
<v Speaker 1>contribute to open source without codes, and non

00:13:41.905 --> 00:13:45.339
<v Speaker 1>code contributions, also very important and very valuable.

00:13:45.339 --> 00:13:47.579
<v Speaker 1>So Yep. There are a lot of initiatives.

00:13:47.579 --> 00:13:49.259
<v Speaker 1>Right? And so what we wanna do is

00:13:49.259 --> 00:13:51.180
<v Speaker 1>make it easier for people to find that.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.180
<v Speaker 0>And just to add add a little bit

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:54.699
<v Speaker 0>to what Catherine said, right, like you can

00:13:54.699 --> 00:13:57.100
<v Speaker 0>see with, you know, the things that the

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.105
<v Speaker 0>business value community came out with, You see

00:13:59.105 --> 00:14:01.505
<v Speaker 0>with the emphasis in talks at KubeCon, right,

00:14:01.505 --> 00:14:04.464
<v Speaker 0>more more user stories and getting getting out

00:14:04.464 --> 00:14:06.865
<v Speaker 0>of vendor stuff. That certification that's meant to

00:14:06.865 --> 00:14:09.105
<v Speaker 0>be, like, hey, you're new to this space.

00:14:09.105 --> 00:14:11.024
<v Speaker 0>Let's give you a baseline

00:14:11.379 --> 00:14:12.500
<v Speaker 0>a baseline

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:13.620
<v Speaker 0>conversational

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.939
<v Speaker 0>knowledge that you need to to have those

00:14:15.939 --> 00:14:18.259
<v Speaker 0>hallway track conversations with a lot of folks

00:14:18.259 --> 00:14:19.300
<v Speaker 0>have been in the space for a long

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.540
<v Speaker 1>time kinda take take for granted. So I

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:24.259
<v Speaker 0>think I think the CNCF is absolutely working

00:14:24.259 --> 00:14:24.980
<v Speaker 0>to

00:14:25.765 --> 00:14:27.605
<v Speaker 0>better explain the

00:14:28.245 --> 00:14:30.485
<v Speaker 0>real value, not this not just the technological

00:14:30.485 --> 00:14:33.285
<v Speaker 0>value, but the outcome value of projects things.

00:14:33.285 --> 00:14:34.725
<v Speaker 1>Super supportive. The thing is, like, the CNCF

00:14:34.725 --> 00:14:36.325
<v Speaker 1>is small. They have a very small team.

00:14:36.325 --> 00:14:38.565
<v Speaker 1>Right? And they are they depend, let's say,

00:14:38.565 --> 00:14:39.205
<v Speaker 1>on the community

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:41.310
<v Speaker 1>to help and support. And like once you

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:42.670
<v Speaker 1>have a good idea and they believe in

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:44.590
<v Speaker 1>it, they really give you the resources, right?

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Like to create a glossary, you need someone

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:48.110
<v Speaker 1>to develop the website, and so we get

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:50.270
<v Speaker 1>all the resources which is amazing, and then

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:52.510
<v Speaker 1>the PR team, like that's where my marketing

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:55.105
<v Speaker 1>sales comes, like I know what needs to

00:14:55.105 --> 00:14:56.785
<v Speaker 1>be done, and then the PR team is

00:14:56.785 --> 00:14:59.105
<v Speaker 1>amazing, and then they're like, you know, like

00:14:59.265 --> 00:15:00.625
<v Speaker 1>I don't know, they write a blog post

00:15:00.625 --> 00:15:02.865
<v Speaker 1>or talk to reporters, and like, so they

00:15:02.865 --> 00:15:05.024
<v Speaker 1>make the resources available to to help get

00:15:05.024 --> 00:15:07.010
<v Speaker 1>the word out, which is, so I think

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:09.090
<v Speaker 1>it's great. I've really enjoyed working with the

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:11.090
<v Speaker 1>CNCF. Alright. So you want me to to

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:12.850
<v Speaker 0>define service mesh? I'm gonna do it off

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:13.810
<v Speaker 0>the top of my head. I'm not gonna

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:15.730
<v Speaker 0>look it up. Right? But

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:18.210
<v Speaker 0>a service mesh is

00:15:18.384 --> 00:15:21.105
<v Speaker 0>according to the the glossary definition, and somebody

00:15:21.105 --> 00:15:22.865
<v Speaker 0>look me up as you're watching this and

00:15:22.865 --> 00:15:25.105
<v Speaker 0>and laugh at how wrong I am. But

00:15:25.185 --> 00:15:27.665
<v Speaker 0>it is it is a tool that

00:15:28.065 --> 00:15:28.865
<v Speaker 0>uses

00:15:29.824 --> 00:15:31.185
<v Speaker 0>uses effectively

00:15:31.185 --> 00:15:31.665
<v Speaker 0>a

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:33.410
<v Speaker 0>don't think it has to be a sidecar,

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:35.330
<v Speaker 0>but uses a series of load balancers

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:36.130
<v Speaker 0>to

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:39.490
<v Speaker 0>route your traffic from an application through to

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:41.570
<v Speaker 0>this other process. Right?

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:44.690
<v Speaker 0>Let me start again. A a service mesh

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:46.610
<v Speaker 0>exists to take

00:15:47.695 --> 00:15:50.095
<v Speaker 0>the platform level infrastructure

00:15:50.175 --> 00:15:52.654
<v Speaker 0>that your applications need when you're gonna run-in

00:15:52.654 --> 00:15:54.735
<v Speaker 0>a microservice environment and

00:15:54.735 --> 00:15:56.735
<v Speaker 0>take that code or that tooling that allows

00:15:56.735 --> 00:15:58.334
<v Speaker 0>you to do a good job at service

00:15:58.334 --> 00:15:59.055
<v Speaker 0>discovery,

00:15:59.295 --> 00:16:02.400
<v Speaker 0>secure your traffic over the network, do circuit

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.280
<v Speaker 0>breaking, do timeouts, do retries, take it out

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.720
<v Speaker 0>of your application code so you're not doing

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.960
<v Speaker 0>it in a shared library and instead put

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.400
<v Speaker 0>it in a separate process,

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.640
<v Speaker 0>route your traffic through that process,

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.120
<v Speaker 0>and give them the responsibility

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.400
<v Speaker 0>for core

00:16:16.745 --> 00:16:19.785
<v Speaker 0>usability on the network features for your app

00:16:19.785 --> 00:16:20.745
<v Speaker 0>to

00:16:21.065 --> 00:16:22.745
<v Speaker 0>something that can be managed by your platform

00:16:22.745 --> 00:16:25.785
<v Speaker 0>team. At its core, it's intended to allow

00:16:25.785 --> 00:16:27.945
<v Speaker 0>platform teams to deliver

00:16:28.024 --> 00:16:30.584
<v Speaker 0>more value to application development teams

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:33.990
<v Speaker 0>by reducing their operational overhead and giving them

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:37.190
<v Speaker 0>better performance, better security for their applications.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.270
<v Speaker 0>So but look it up and feel free

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:41.270
<v Speaker 0>to mock me. It's less technical in the

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:42.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Glossary. Yeah. I'll put it on the

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:44.630
<v Speaker 0>screen underneath just as you go around. Thank

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:45.350
<v Speaker 1>you. Yeah. Great.

00:16:46.795 --> 00:16:49.035
<v Speaker 0>Do I do we think everybody that's using

00:16:49.035 --> 00:16:50.875
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes should have a service mesh?

00:16:51.275 --> 00:16:54.075
<v Speaker 0>No. I don't think everybody needs to have

00:16:54.075 --> 00:16:55.355
<v Speaker 0>one, and I try not to deal in

00:16:55.355 --> 00:16:57.275
<v Speaker 0>shoulds in a general sense.

00:16:57.595 --> 00:16:58.235
<v Speaker 0>But

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:02.710
<v Speaker 0>I think for most folks that are using

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:04.230
<v Speaker 0>that are using Kubernetes,

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:05.750
<v Speaker 0>right, like, a little bit of a story.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:07.430
<v Speaker 0>Right? Like, I used to work at a

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:09.910
<v Speaker 0>company and we had we had a service

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:12.714
<v Speaker 0>mesh based on one of the big one

00:17:12.714 --> 00:17:14.714
<v Speaker 0>of the really well known service mesh products

00:17:14.714 --> 00:17:16.714
<v Speaker 0>out there. I won't I won't name it.

00:17:16.714 --> 00:17:18.554
<v Speaker 0>Right? And, you know, we used to tell

00:17:18.554 --> 00:17:19.194
<v Speaker 0>folks,

00:17:19.355 --> 00:17:22.315
<v Speaker 0>like, get get Kubernetes figured out first because

00:17:22.315 --> 00:17:24.075
<v Speaker 0>it's hard. And then you add in a

00:17:24.075 --> 00:17:26.234
<v Speaker 0>service mesh and it's harder. Right? And that's

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:28.790
<v Speaker 0>that's a thing that a lot of folks

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.790
<v Speaker 0>deal with as they begin that as they

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:31.910
<v Speaker 0>begin that journey.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:35.430
<v Speaker 0>And since I've been at Boeing, partly because,

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:36.950
<v Speaker 0>it's my job to tell you to use

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:39.190
<v Speaker 0>Linkerd e, right, but I came here because

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:41.945
<v Speaker 0>I believe Linkerd e is good. I'll tell

00:17:41.945 --> 00:17:44.745
<v Speaker 0>you, is a tool that in my view

00:17:44.745 --> 00:17:46.745
<v Speaker 0>and in my experience with customers that adopt

00:17:46.745 --> 00:17:48.985
<v Speaker 0>it, it makes Kubernetes easier.

00:17:49.145 --> 00:17:50.265
<v Speaker 0>So if you're doing

00:17:50.825 --> 00:17:53.945
<v Speaker 0>REST based services, you're doing gRPC applications, and

00:17:53.945 --> 00:17:54.985
<v Speaker 0>you're running in Kubernetes,

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.700
<v Speaker 0>this is a tool you can add to

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:57.500
<v Speaker 0>your environment

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.780
<v Speaker 0>to enhance

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:00.700
<v Speaker 0>the capabilities of your platform

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:03.820
<v Speaker 0>and to make life, like, make life easier

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.539
<v Speaker 0>for yourselves and your developers. Right? And that's

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.740
<v Speaker 0>that's pretty that's pretty awesome. So if if

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.020
<v Speaker 0>you're building custom apps,

00:18:11.554 --> 00:18:13.155
<v Speaker 0>I would recommend a service mesh. If your

00:18:13.155 --> 00:18:16.595
<v Speaker 0>cluster is intended exclusively to host infrastructure components

00:18:16.595 --> 00:18:20.115
<v Speaker 0>like your registry, your CICD system, other like

00:18:20.115 --> 00:18:22.674
<v Speaker 0>vendor products that vendors are responsible for the

00:18:22.674 --> 00:18:23.155
<v Speaker 0>core code,

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.120
<v Speaker 0>then I don't think I don't think a

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.440
<v Speaker 0>service mesh is particularly important unless you're

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.400
<v Speaker 0>have, like, a high security regulatory requirement for

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.240
<v Speaker 1>encryption in transit. And even then, you could

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.200
<v Speaker 0>probably bug your vendor to, like, use

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.575
<v Speaker 0>HPS calls between their components. Right? That's that's

00:18:38.575 --> 00:18:39.695
<v Speaker 0>my view on that. I don't know if

00:18:39.695 --> 00:18:40.895
<v Speaker 0>you have anything to add. No.

00:18:41.215 --> 00:18:42.575
<v Speaker 1>It's like, I mean, it's more of a

00:18:42.575 --> 00:18:44.255
<v Speaker 1>technical part. Yeah. Because like, I hear it

00:18:44.255 --> 00:18:45.535
<v Speaker 1>all the time that a lot of people

00:18:45.535 --> 00:18:47.935
<v Speaker 1>say, like, service metrics are are think that

00:18:47.935 --> 00:18:49.855
<v Speaker 1>it's so overly complex How complicated. That then

00:18:49.855 --> 00:18:52.175
<v Speaker 1>play try Linkerd and it's not. I, course,

00:18:52.175 --> 00:18:52.335
<v Speaker 1>cannot

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:55.170
<v Speaker 1>have experimented with it because I don't code.

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:55.970
<v Speaker 1>But it's like,

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:57.970
<v Speaker 1>apparently, it is a lot easier than a

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.810
<v Speaker 1>lot of people think. And if you get

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:01.090
<v Speaker 1>a lot of value out of it, and

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:02.850
<v Speaker 1>we always say, like, just give it a

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:04.370
<v Speaker 1>try and it's for Don't

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:06.690
<v Speaker 1>believe us. Just just try it Right. And

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:09.105
<v Speaker 1>then you'll see. Best features of Linkerd you

00:19:09.105 --> 00:19:11.424
<v Speaker 0>know, the thing that I tell people is

00:19:11.505 --> 00:19:14.304
<v Speaker 0>we think Linkerd is awesome because

00:19:14.625 --> 00:19:17.105
<v Speaker 0>it's boring. Right? Like, I think the best

00:19:17.105 --> 00:19:18.465
<v Speaker 0>feature of Linkerd is

00:19:19.265 --> 00:19:20.385
<v Speaker 0>you can have something

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.760
<v Speaker 0>that runs in Kubernetes, install Linkerd,

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.600
<v Speaker 0>add that thing, that application

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.200
<v Speaker 0>to the mesh,

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.679
<v Speaker 0>and it still works. Right? I

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.559
<v Speaker 0>think I think that's fantastic.

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.640
<v Speaker 0>Beyond that, right, like, somewhat,

00:19:35.035 --> 00:19:38.875
<v Speaker 0>whatever tongue in cheek value point. Right? Mucil

00:19:38.875 --> 00:19:39.674
<v Speaker 0>TLS,

00:19:39.675 --> 00:19:40.955
<v Speaker 0>like, having a

00:19:41.355 --> 00:19:44.075
<v Speaker 0>guarantee that every conversation in your cluster between

00:19:44.075 --> 00:19:44.794
<v Speaker 0>components

00:19:44.875 --> 00:19:46.635
<v Speaker 0>is gonna be encrypted

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:48.650
<v Speaker 0>and both the client and the server are

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:50.730
<v Speaker 0>gonna be positively identified

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:53.210
<v Speaker 0>using cryptographic identity, I think is really

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:55.290
<v Speaker 0>a big deal. Right? Like, the thing that

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:57.530
<v Speaker 0>you trust to do mobile banking, the thing

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.770
<v Speaker 0>that you trust to, you know, browse whatever

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:01.130
<v Speaker 0>secure thing you need to do on the

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:03.305
<v Speaker 0>Internet is the foundation of trust they can

00:20:03.305 --> 00:20:05.465
<v Speaker 0>use in your cluster between your components.

00:20:05.785 --> 00:20:07.785
<v Speaker 0>And that's hugely powerful.

00:20:08.265 --> 00:20:10.345
<v Speaker 0>And, you know, third,

00:20:10.585 --> 00:20:12.585
<v Speaker 0>it depends what you're doing, but I like

00:20:12.745 --> 00:20:14.905
<v Speaker 0>I'll tell you, I had a terribly painful

00:20:14.905 --> 00:20:16.025
<v Speaker 0>experience before

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:19.630
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes trying to get trying to get 15

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:22.030
<v Speaker 0>different app teams to all write a slash

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:24.590
<v Speaker 0>metrics endpoint in their app and put some

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:26.429
<v Speaker 0>sort of comparable

00:20:26.429 --> 00:20:28.110
<v Speaker 0>data. So I could look at app a

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:31.024
<v Speaker 0>and app b and see similar results. And

00:20:31.024 --> 00:20:34.385
<v Speaker 0>that was brutally hard. With with BlinkerD, you

00:20:34.385 --> 00:20:36.864
<v Speaker 0>get the same metrics for every single application

00:20:37.184 --> 00:20:38.385
<v Speaker 0>without any

00:20:38.625 --> 00:20:40.384
<v Speaker 0>without bothering any developers,

00:20:40.385 --> 00:20:43.585
<v Speaker 0>which is my favorite thing. I, I hate

00:20:43.585 --> 00:20:45.184
<v Speaker 0>trying to get people who are trying to

00:20:45.184 --> 00:20:47.450
<v Speaker 0>develop a feature to instead stop what they're

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:49.450
<v Speaker 0>doing and build plumbing. Right? That was

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:51.210
<v Speaker 0>it was not a great experience.

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:53.930
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So you're asking about what's what's next

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:56.250
<v Speaker 0>with Linkerd and and specifically around Linkerd and

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:58.730
<v Speaker 0>the Gateway API. So really exciting,

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:01.044
<v Speaker 0>I guess. Exciting is gonna depend on who

00:21:01.044 --> 00:21:02.644
<v Speaker 0>you are. What I find exciting from a

00:21:02.644 --> 00:21:03.844
<v Speaker 0>technical perspective

00:21:04.085 --> 00:21:04.804
<v Speaker 0>is

00:21:04.885 --> 00:21:08.004
<v Speaker 0>there has been a move with Linkerd to

00:21:08.325 --> 00:21:10.644
<v Speaker 0>add things like policy, let you do header

00:21:10.644 --> 00:21:12.164
<v Speaker 0>based routing, let you do some more intelligent

00:21:12.164 --> 00:21:14.220
<v Speaker 0>things with your traffic. But we're trying to

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.700
<v Speaker 0>balance that new set of features with, you

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:17.980
<v Speaker 0>know, the thing that Linkerd has always been

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.220
<v Speaker 0>famous for, which is simplicity, not having a

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.540
<v Speaker 0>ton of custom resource definitions. Right? Things like

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.700
<v Speaker 0>that. And the gateway API project

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.260
<v Speaker 0>came along at a incredibly

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.105
<v Speaker 0>good time for us. Right? And and it

00:21:29.105 --> 00:21:30.865
<v Speaker 0>turns out that the primitives that the gateway

00:21:30.865 --> 00:21:33.345
<v Speaker 0>API gives you in your Kubernetes class there

00:21:33.345 --> 00:21:35.185
<v Speaker 0>are exactly the sort of things that you

00:21:35.185 --> 00:21:36.945
<v Speaker 0>don't just need from an ingress perspective,

00:21:37.265 --> 00:21:39.425
<v Speaker 0>but that you want in order to manage

00:21:39.425 --> 00:21:40.145
<v Speaker 0>traffic

00:21:40.385 --> 00:21:42.305
<v Speaker 0>east west between your applications.

00:21:42.305 --> 00:21:42.545
<v Speaker 0>And

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:46.140
<v Speaker 0>we're adopting the constructs in Linkerd. I think

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:47.419
<v Speaker 0>by 02/14,

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:49.900
<v Speaker 0>we expect to be a % gateway API

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:50.779
<v Speaker 0>compliant,

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:53.180
<v Speaker 0>right, which is which is really exciting. And

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:54.940
<v Speaker 0>it it's gonna allow us to do

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.740
<v Speaker 0>do policy, do header based routing, do traffic

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.580
<v Speaker 0>splitting, do all of it with

00:22:00.275 --> 00:22:03.395
<v Speaker 0>no, you know, without any new linkerdy isms

00:22:03.395 --> 00:22:04.434
<v Speaker 0>in your cluster.

00:22:04.595 --> 00:22:07.235
<v Speaker 0>No adopting, no changing the way you work

00:22:07.235 --> 00:22:09.554
<v Speaker 0>to fit our mesh. Right? Which is the

00:22:09.554 --> 00:22:11.475
<v Speaker 0>reason we're easy to use today, and it's

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:13.010
<v Speaker 0>the way we're gonna be able to give

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:15.570
<v Speaker 0>new features to folks out there while keeping

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:16.769
<v Speaker 0>that same promise.

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:18.610
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Great question. Thank you so much. So,

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:20.130
<v Speaker 0>where do you go to learn more about

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:21.249
<v Speaker 0>Linkerd? Well,

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:23.330
<v Speaker 0>I biased towards Slack,

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:25.170
<v Speaker 0>slack.linkerd.io.

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:27.345
<v Speaker 0>You can join up. You meet other folks

00:22:27.345 --> 00:22:29.345
<v Speaker 0>that are doing linker d. Talk to us.

00:22:29.345 --> 00:22:31.745
<v Speaker 0>See if you have, you know, commentary about

00:22:31.745 --> 00:22:33.425
<v Speaker 0>how badly I messed up the service mesh

00:22:33.425 --> 00:22:35.985
<v Speaker 0>definition. I'm at Jason on the linker d

00:22:35.985 --> 00:22:38.225
<v Speaker 0>Slack. You can find us on Twitter, just

00:22:38.225 --> 00:22:38.945
<v Speaker 0>at linker d.

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:41.610
<v Speaker 0>We have a website, linkerd.io,

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:43.370
<v Speaker 0>where you can learn more. That's where all

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:45.770
<v Speaker 0>our docs are. Our getting started guide, which

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:46.729
<v Speaker 0>is fantastic.

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:49.049
<v Speaker 0>You can go get Linkerd up and running

00:22:49.049 --> 00:22:51.130
<v Speaker 0>in a Kubernetes cluster. If it takes you

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:53.370
<v Speaker 0>thirty minutes, let me know. I'll also apologize

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:53.770
<v Speaker 0>for that.

00:22:54.575 --> 00:22:56.895
<v Speaker 1>And we have Service Mesh Academy. Oh, oh,

00:22:56.975 --> 00:22:58.415
<v Speaker 0>right. If you go to Boynton, sorry. Go

00:22:58.415 --> 00:23:00.415
<v Speaker 0>ahead. Yeah. Yeah. So if you're interested in

00:23:00.415 --> 00:23:02.575
<v Speaker 1>getting, like, hands on experience

00:23:02.575 --> 00:23:04.335
<v Speaker 1>with Linkerd, once a month, we have a

00:23:04.335 --> 00:23:07.135
<v Speaker 1>live workshop. And, yeah, like, topics. Next topic

00:23:07.135 --> 00:23:09.450
<v Speaker 1>is GitOps with Flagr,

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:10.730
<v Speaker 1>Flux, and Liberty.

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:12.810
<v Speaker 1>So really excited about that. I think that's

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:14.169
<v Speaker 1>next week. But,

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:16.410
<v Speaker 1>yeah, like, every month there is, a new

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:18.250
<v Speaker 1>topic. It's % open source.

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:21.855
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And they're they're, like, technical deep dives.

00:23:21.855 --> 00:23:23.615
<v Speaker 0>Right? So you're gonna you're gonna really get

00:23:23.615 --> 00:23:26.575
<v Speaker 0>to know a particular component of Linkerd and

00:23:26.575 --> 00:23:28.175
<v Speaker 0>the way it works. Like, I learned a

00:23:28.175 --> 00:23:30.255
<v Speaker 0>ton when we talked about certificates and the

00:23:30.255 --> 00:23:31.375
<v Speaker 0>way we do routing,

00:23:31.695 --> 00:23:34.510
<v Speaker 0>and I could just really highly recommend it.

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:36.350
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Well, yeah. For sure. Like, thanks a

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:38.110
<v Speaker 0>ton for for having us. We really appreciate

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:39.790
<v Speaker 0>it. Thank you. You know, it's been a

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:41.230
<v Speaker 0>it's been a great conference. It's been great

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:42.510
<v Speaker 0>getting to hang out a little bit. So

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:43.870
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. We've loved it. Yeah. Thanks so much

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:46.190
<v Speaker 1>for having us and and letting us share

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.510
<v Speaker 1>our

00:23:47.014 --> 00:23:49.494
<v Speaker 1>little pet project and talk about VingerDee. I

00:23:49.494 --> 00:23:51.574
<v Speaker 1>really appreciate the opportunity. Thank you, Dave. Yeah.
