00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.489
<v Speaker 0>Hello, and welcome back to the Rawkode Academy.

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.730
<v Speaker 0>I'm your host, David Flanagan, although most people

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.730
<v Speaker 0>know me as Rawkode across the Internet.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.809
<v Speaker 0>Today is an episode of Rawkode live where

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:42.809
<v Speaker 0>we take a look at open source software

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.934
<v Speaker 0>to see how it can help make our

00:00:44.934 --> 00:00:46.535
<v Speaker 0>day to day lives a little bit easier

00:00:46.535 --> 00:00:49.175
<v Speaker 0>and what is a vast, evolving, and complex

00:00:49.495 --> 00:00:50.214
<v Speaker 0>ecosystem.

00:00:51.175 --> 00:00:52.934
<v Speaker 0>Today, we're taking a look at feature flagging

00:00:52.934 --> 00:00:56.135
<v Speaker 0>using feature flagging. Feature flagging is an a

00:00:56.135 --> 00:00:58.695
<v Speaker 0>project called Flipt, and I am joined by

00:00:58.695 --> 00:01:00.135
<v Speaker 0>Mark and George.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.780
<v Speaker 0>Hey, guys. How's it going?

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Hey. Hey. Good. How are you?

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:07.780
<v Speaker 0>Oh, thanks. Nobody ever does that.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.180
<v Speaker 2>Do they know?

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.740
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'm I'm actually doing alright. I've been

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:13.940
<v Speaker 0>a little bit stressed this week because I

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.985
<v Speaker 0>missed a few days food poisoning. But, you

00:01:15.985 --> 00:01:17.985
<v Speaker 0>know, it's nice to be back in front

00:01:17.985 --> 00:01:19.585
<v Speaker 0>of our camera playing with some pretty cool

00:01:19.585 --> 00:01:20.545
<v Speaker 0>software again.

00:01:21.825 --> 00:01:23.825
<v Speaker 2>Now for the people watching, before we even

00:01:23.825 --> 00:01:25.505
<v Speaker 0>talk about what a flag on a feature

00:01:25.505 --> 00:01:27.265
<v Speaker 0>is, can you both tell us a little

00:01:27.265 --> 00:01:29.740
<v Speaker 0>bit more about you? And let's just do

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.180
<v Speaker 0>it clockwise. So we'll start with you, George.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.980
<v Speaker 0>Off you go.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.220
<v Speaker 2>Cool. Yeah. Cool. Hey. I'm George. I work

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.660
<v Speaker 2>on Flipt, unsurprisingly,

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.220
<v Speaker 2>with Mark. I'm

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.700
<v Speaker 2>based in in The UK in a city

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.500
<v Speaker 2>called Brighton,

00:01:43.795 --> 00:01:45.235
<v Speaker 2>just South of London.

00:01:46.195 --> 00:01:46.835
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:49.475
<v Speaker 2>I've been working with working with Mark on

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:50.915
<v Speaker 2>this for last year.

00:01:52.675 --> 00:01:53.315
<v Speaker 2>And

00:01:53.715 --> 00:01:55.875
<v Speaker 2>yeah. I used to work with Mark some

00:01:55.875 --> 00:01:58.915
<v Speaker 2>years ago, that's how we came together again

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.960
<v Speaker 2>to to tackle feature flags. Yeah.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.000
<v Speaker 2>That's me. Alright. Thank you very much. Mark?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.639
<v Speaker 1>So I'm Mark. I'm the founder of

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.960
<v Speaker 1>and I am based in Raleigh, North Carolina

00:02:14.755 --> 00:02:16.515
<v Speaker 1>on the East Coast US.

00:02:16.915 --> 00:02:20.035
<v Speaker 1>And so as George alluded to, we have

00:02:20.035 --> 00:02:21.315
<v Speaker 1>been working together on this for about a

00:02:21.315 --> 00:02:21.795
<v Speaker 1>year.

00:02:22.435 --> 00:02:23.235
<v Speaker 1>I

00:02:23.235 --> 00:02:26.275
<v Speaker 1>worked on it for a few years before

00:02:26.275 --> 00:02:28.650
<v Speaker 1>this, kind of a as a side project.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.930
<v Speaker 1>Before going full time on Flipt, I was

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.770
<v Speaker 1>at GitHub for about three years.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.010
<v Speaker 1>And then before that, I was at a

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.170
<v Speaker 1>company called Code Shift, which is where George

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.530
<v Speaker 1>and I worked and met.

00:02:41.395 --> 00:02:42.834
<v Speaker 1>We worked together for about two and a

00:02:42.834 --> 00:02:44.115
<v Speaker 1>half years, I think.

00:02:45.474 --> 00:02:47.795
<v Speaker 0>Wow. So you're, like, moving

00:02:48.194 --> 00:02:49.955
<v Speaker 0>up the stack instead of down the stack.

00:02:49.955 --> 00:02:51.795
<v Speaker 0>Right? So you did CICD, then you went

00:02:51.795 --> 00:02:53.155
<v Speaker 0>to get hosting, which I guess is down

00:02:53.155 --> 00:02:54.515
<v Speaker 0>the stack, and now you went, no. Fuck

00:02:54.515 --> 00:02:56.010
<v Speaker 0>that. Let's go to feature flags and you've

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.210
<v Speaker 0>been straight back up the top.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.370
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Just all of it.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.490
<v Speaker 2>All of the best. Well, I'm assuming,

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.130
<v Speaker 0>you know,

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.130
<v Speaker 0>user engineers,

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.130
<v Speaker 0>she's a smart people, you find problems you

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.810
<v Speaker 0>like to solve them. So I'd love to

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.570
<v Speaker 0>learn more about how you got into, like,

00:03:10.705 --> 00:03:13.025
<v Speaker 0>the position where you were sitting there and

00:03:13.025 --> 00:03:15.105
<v Speaker 0>going, you know, tea, coffee, beer, whatever it

00:03:15.105 --> 00:03:15.745
<v Speaker 0>may be.

00:03:16.465 --> 00:03:18.385
<v Speaker 0>Let's fix feature flags. Like, me a bit

00:03:18.385 --> 00:03:19.265
<v Speaker 0>about the background.

00:03:20.625 --> 00:03:21.265
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:03:22.224 --> 00:03:25.410
<v Speaker 1>I had, like, always been kind of enamored

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.650
<v Speaker 1>with feature flags ever since I, like, learned

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 1>about them. You know, it's not one of

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.490
<v Speaker 1>those things that they taught in university or

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.410
<v Speaker 1>at least they did when I went, to

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.130
<v Speaker 1>university.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:35.650
<v Speaker 1>And,

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.730
<v Speaker 1>you know, I really was introduced to them

00:03:38.005 --> 00:03:40.085
<v Speaker 1>kind of midway through my career,

00:03:40.645 --> 00:03:41.845
<v Speaker 1>at another

00:03:41.845 --> 00:03:43.205
<v Speaker 1>startup I worked at.

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:45.605
<v Speaker 1>Anyways and I realized, like, the power of

00:03:45.605 --> 00:03:47.925
<v Speaker 1>feature flags and how, like, you can just,

00:03:48.005 --> 00:03:50.725
<v Speaker 1>you know, basically separate your releases of your

00:03:50.725 --> 00:03:54.090
<v Speaker 1>software from deployments and easily respond to incidents

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.569
<v Speaker 1>and, you know, test things and production and

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:57.610
<v Speaker 1>all that good stuff.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.290
<v Speaker 1>And, you know, one thing I I realized

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.810
<v Speaker 1>as my career progressed

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:04.730
<v Speaker 1>was, you know, I saw

00:04:06.005 --> 00:04:08.325
<v Speaker 1>these companies starting to use feature flags.

00:04:08.405 --> 00:04:10.565
<v Speaker 1>And another thing I saw, though, was that

00:04:10.565 --> 00:04:13.765
<v Speaker 1>everyone was kind of reinventing their reinventing the

00:04:13.765 --> 00:04:16.965
<v Speaker 1>wheel and and writing feature flag software themselves.

00:04:17.685 --> 00:04:19.524
<v Speaker 1>And so I think at

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.519
<v Speaker 1>three or four of the last companies I

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.960
<v Speaker 1>worked at, each one of them had an

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.120
<v Speaker 1>in house feature flag solution.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.199
<v Speaker 1>And I thought, you know, this is kinda

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.640
<v Speaker 1>crazy. Like, why would everyone like, I realized,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.120
<v Speaker 1>you know, from the outset, feature flags don't

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.520
<v Speaker 1>seem that complicated. So it's like, okay. We'll

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.095
<v Speaker 1>just put something in the database,

00:04:37.415 --> 00:04:38.695
<v Speaker 1>and, you know, it's just an if else

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:40.935
<v Speaker 1>statement, and we'll just create some APIs.

00:04:42.455 --> 00:04:43.895
<v Speaker 1>But as time progresses,

00:04:43.975 --> 00:04:45.735
<v Speaker 1>you know, people build up

00:04:46.055 --> 00:04:48.935
<v Speaker 1>features on top of these feature flag solutions,

00:04:48.935 --> 00:04:50.855
<v Speaker 1>and they just kind of lead to sprawl

00:04:50.855 --> 00:04:51.255
<v Speaker 1>and

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.620
<v Speaker 1>a lot of a lot of

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.860
<v Speaker 1>extra things that you don't think about from

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.700
<v Speaker 1>the start. And I was like, it doesn't

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.700
<v Speaker 1>make sense to me that

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.820
<v Speaker 1>companies are spending their engineering resources

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.780
<v Speaker 1>on implementing their own feature flag solution when

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:06.820
<v Speaker 1>that that's not even

00:05:07.465 --> 00:05:10.025
<v Speaker 1>what the company sells. You know? That's not

00:05:10.025 --> 00:05:11.705
<v Speaker 1>what their bread and butter is. Right? So

00:05:11.705 --> 00:05:13.305
<v Speaker 1>it just seemed like wasted effort.

00:05:14.025 --> 00:05:16.345
<v Speaker 1>And even at GitHub, hopefully, I'm not giving

00:05:16.345 --> 00:05:19.305
<v Speaker 1>away any secrets, but, GitHub, you know, as

00:05:19.305 --> 00:05:21.145
<v Speaker 1>big as it is, you know, it's at

00:05:21.145 --> 00:05:22.860
<v Speaker 1>the end of the day, a big Rails

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.700
<v Speaker 1>monolith. That's what you see when you log

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.100
<v Speaker 1>in to github.com. Obviously, there's all these external

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.940
<v Speaker 1>services now, like Codespaces and Copilot and GitHub

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.100
<v Speaker 1>Package Registry and all this stuff, but they

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.260
<v Speaker 1>still interface with the monolith

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.420
<v Speaker 1>for getting feature flag data.

00:05:38.444 --> 00:05:39.164
<v Speaker 1>And

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:41.645
<v Speaker 1>the solution that GitHub uses or at least

00:05:41.645 --> 00:05:44.125
<v Speaker 1>they used when I was there was a

00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:45.085
<v Speaker 1>Ruby gem

00:05:45.405 --> 00:05:46.925
<v Speaker 1>called Fliptr

00:05:46.925 --> 00:05:49.085
<v Speaker 1>that they built on top of throughout the

00:05:49.085 --> 00:05:51.324
<v Speaker 1>ten plus years that GitHub has been around.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.560
<v Speaker 1>And so they basically built their own feature

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.520
<v Speaker 1>flag solution,

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.800
<v Speaker 1>but in order to make it scale and

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.520
<v Speaker 1>make it accessible for all these external services,

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.080
<v Speaker 1>they had to end up, like, creating internal

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.880
<v Speaker 1>APIs,

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.720
<v Speaker 1>poking holes in firewalls,

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.165
<v Speaker 1>and creating clients in all these different languages

00:06:10.165 --> 00:06:11.605
<v Speaker 1>now that GitHub uses.

00:06:12.645 --> 00:06:14.885
<v Speaker 1>And I just thought that's crazy that there's

00:06:14.885 --> 00:06:17.925
<v Speaker 1>this group of engineers who maintains this feature

00:06:17.925 --> 00:06:19.605
<v Speaker 1>flag solution at GitHub

00:06:19.685 --> 00:06:21.925
<v Speaker 1>when they could be doing, you know, a

00:06:21.925 --> 00:06:23.365
<v Speaker 1>lot of a ton of other different things.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.660
<v Speaker 1>And so that was kind of the impetus

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.580
<v Speaker 1>for Flipt. I know that was a very

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.780
<v Speaker 1>rambling

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:30.660
<v Speaker 1>answer.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.580
<v Speaker 1>But, basically, I thought, you know, why don't

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.300
<v Speaker 1>we build a feature flag solution that is

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.465
<v Speaker 1>meant for engineers that they can just kind

00:06:39.465 --> 00:06:41.225
<v Speaker 1>of get up and running and works in

00:06:41.225 --> 00:06:42.025
<v Speaker 1>their stack

00:06:42.265 --> 00:06:44.265
<v Speaker 1>so they don't have to maintain it themselves.

00:06:47.145 --> 00:06:48.265
<v Speaker 0>Nice. Awesome.

00:06:50.345 --> 00:06:53.225
<v Speaker 0>That's a pretty comprehensive overview of of why

00:06:53.225 --> 00:06:55.200
<v Speaker 0>you've done this. So let's let's come at

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.120
<v Speaker 0>it from a different angle. Right? Like,

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.440
<v Speaker 0>I think we understand the importance of future

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.600
<v Speaker 0>flags. We understand some of the challenges. Definitely

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.360
<v Speaker 0>understand why people should be building their own

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.280
<v Speaker 0>solution for this. Right? It's it's one of

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.240
<v Speaker 0>these problems domains. It seems from a naive

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.505
<v Speaker 0>set of eyes really simple. But actually, once

00:07:11.505 --> 00:07:14.305
<v Speaker 0>you start building out a real production like

00:07:14.305 --> 00:07:16.785
<v Speaker 0>feature flagging system, I imagine those complexities really

00:07:16.785 --> 00:07:18.145
<v Speaker 0>start to surface themselves.

00:07:18.785 --> 00:07:20.145
<v Speaker 0>And I'm sure we're gonna get into that

00:07:20.145 --> 00:07:21.585
<v Speaker 0>as we talk about what Flipt is and

00:07:21.585 --> 00:07:23.940
<v Speaker 0>how it delivers and all that stuff. But

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.780
<v Speaker 0>let's again come at it from another angle.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.300
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna try not to just ramble at,

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.419
<v Speaker 0>you know. But you've

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:32.580
<v Speaker 0>decided to write. I've seen this in GitHub.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.500
<v Speaker 0>We wanna solve this problem.

00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:35.940
<v Speaker 0>You must have looked to see if there

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.099
<v Speaker 0>were other open source projects out there. What

00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:39.139
<v Speaker 0>was the

00:07:39.805 --> 00:07:41.565
<v Speaker 0>the point, the inflection point where you're you

00:07:41.565 --> 00:07:43.405
<v Speaker 0>know what? These don't do what I wanted

00:07:43.405 --> 00:07:45.085
<v Speaker 0>to do, and we need to build something

00:07:45.165 --> 00:07:47.405
<v Speaker 0>else. Like, what was happening at the time,

00:07:47.405 --> 00:07:48.685
<v Speaker 0>and what did you think could be different

00:07:48.685 --> 00:07:50.125
<v Speaker 0>with a potential solution?

00:07:51.645 --> 00:07:52.365
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:07:53.005 --> 00:07:55.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I mean, I guess back you know,

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.090
<v Speaker 1>this was several years ago. I was a

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.570
<v Speaker 1>bit naive myself, and, you know, I briefly

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:01.690
<v Speaker 1>looked at,

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.090
<v Speaker 1>what other solutions were out there.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:06.330
<v Speaker 1>And at the time, the big player and

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.490
<v Speaker 1>still is, I think, launched Rawkode. Right? And

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:11.335
<v Speaker 1>so that is what everyone knows or everyone

00:08:11.335 --> 00:08:13.495
<v Speaker 1>thinks of when you say feature flag solution.

00:08:13.495 --> 00:08:15.415
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. They have all the big bucks, the

00:08:15.415 --> 00:08:16.615
<v Speaker 1>big marketing dollars.

00:08:17.335 --> 00:08:18.055
<v Speaker 1>And,

00:08:18.375 --> 00:08:20.935
<v Speaker 1>you know, to me, a SaaS tool,

00:08:21.175 --> 00:08:23.575
<v Speaker 1>or a SaaS feature flag solution never didn't

00:08:23.575 --> 00:08:25.640
<v Speaker 1>make a lot of sense for what I

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.120
<v Speaker 1>thought feature flags were used for and should

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.000
<v Speaker 1>be used for.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.120
<v Speaker 1>And that's mainly because of the latency that's

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.400
<v Speaker 1>involved from, you know, making requests from your

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.600
<v Speaker 1>applications to this this external SaaS that you

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.160
<v Speaker 1>don't control.

00:08:40.195 --> 00:08:42.914
<v Speaker 1>And, you know, especially when you think about

00:08:42.914 --> 00:08:44.755
<v Speaker 1>where feature flags are

00:08:44.995 --> 00:08:47.075
<v Speaker 1>embedded in your code base, they're usually in

00:08:47.075 --> 00:08:49.155
<v Speaker 1>hot paths, like request paths.

00:08:49.795 --> 00:08:52.195
<v Speaker 1>And so any downtime in the your feature

00:08:52.195 --> 00:08:54.115
<v Speaker 1>flag solution means that your code then,

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:56.530
<v Speaker 1>you know, fails.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:59.330
<v Speaker 1>And so to me, a SaaS was not

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:03.010
<v Speaker 1>was a nonstarter. Right? And so and GitHub

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.810
<v Speaker 1>felt the same way. That's why they didn't

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:07.650
<v Speaker 1>use a a SaaS tool.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.245
<v Speaker 1>And so I looked at, okay, what self

00:09:11.245 --> 00:09:13.725
<v Speaker 1>hosted feature flag solutions are out there? And

00:09:13.725 --> 00:09:15.965
<v Speaker 1>I believe at the time, there was Unleash.

00:09:15.965 --> 00:09:17.965
<v Speaker 1>I'm try this was a few years ago.

00:09:18.605 --> 00:09:20.925
<v Speaker 1>And, hopefully, I'm it's cool to just name

00:09:20.925 --> 00:09:24.279
<v Speaker 1>drop these things. Yeah. No. Of course. Okay.

00:09:25.639 --> 00:09:27.399
<v Speaker 1>I don't wanna yeah. So, you know, there

00:09:27.399 --> 00:09:28.199
<v Speaker 1>was Unleash,

00:09:28.519 --> 00:09:30.279
<v Speaker 1>and, you know, I think

00:09:30.839 --> 00:09:33.160
<v Speaker 1>there are there are obviously others now. A

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.360
<v Speaker 1>lot of them to me,

00:09:34.839 --> 00:09:36.760
<v Speaker 1>look like they are

00:09:37.775 --> 00:09:39.935
<v Speaker 1>more focused on product,

00:09:40.175 --> 00:09:42.495
<v Speaker 1>managers to try to do things like AB

00:09:42.495 --> 00:09:44.495
<v Speaker 1>test, try to see which version of the

00:09:44.495 --> 00:09:46.735
<v Speaker 1>dashboard converts better and all that stuff.

00:09:47.615 --> 00:09:49.295
<v Speaker 1>To me, they they didn't seem like they

00:09:49.295 --> 00:09:52.015
<v Speaker 1>were meant for engineering teams that were,

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.080
<v Speaker 1>are interested in hooking up their, you know,

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.440
<v Speaker 1>telemetry tools or their observability observability

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.160
<v Speaker 1>tools,

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.360
<v Speaker 1>things like that.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.200
<v Speaker 1>And, also,

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.920
<v Speaker 1>I noticed they were all implemented using REST.

00:10:08.615 --> 00:10:10.295
<v Speaker 1>And I think, you know, obviously, REST is

00:10:10.295 --> 00:10:11.735
<v Speaker 1>a great technology.

00:10:12.135 --> 00:10:14.695
<v Speaker 1>Everyone uses is familiar with REST APIs.

00:10:15.255 --> 00:10:18.214
<v Speaker 1>But at the time, gRPC was relatively new

00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:20.055
<v Speaker 1>and or at least new to me. And

00:10:20.055 --> 00:10:21.495
<v Speaker 1>I thought, you know, this seems like a

00:10:21.495 --> 00:10:23.975
<v Speaker 1>perfect use case for gRPC where it's, like,

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.280
<v Speaker 1>you know, meant to be low latency.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.480
<v Speaker 1>It's meant to run, you know, for in

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.040
<v Speaker 1>your application in your data center,

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.000
<v Speaker 1>to do server to server communication.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.480
<v Speaker 1>So I said, okay. There's no there didn't

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.915
<v Speaker 1>seem to be a feature flag solution implemented

00:10:39.915 --> 00:10:41.835
<v Speaker 1>with gRPC. Let me see if I can

00:10:41.835 --> 00:10:42.715
<v Speaker 1>build one.

00:10:44.075 --> 00:10:45.755
<v Speaker 0>And you're seeing all the right things.

00:10:47.515 --> 00:10:50.475
<v Speaker 0>So that developer focus, open source feature flag

00:10:50.475 --> 00:10:52.795
<v Speaker 0>and library that runs over issue to p

00:10:52.795 --> 00:10:53.755
<v Speaker 0>two gRPC.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.689
<v Speaker 0>I mean, that's got performance characteristics over it

00:10:56.689 --> 00:10:58.529
<v Speaker 0>that I I like and have struggled with

00:10:58.529 --> 00:11:00.930
<v Speaker 0>in the past with feature flagging. Especially the

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:03.009
<v Speaker 0>SAS angle, I've never understood why people are

00:11:03.009 --> 00:11:05.170
<v Speaker 0>willing to accept that. We're in trip time

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:07.410
<v Speaker 0>to just query a flag and, of course,

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:08.529
<v Speaker 0>they batch them now at the start of

00:11:08.529 --> 00:11:10.315
<v Speaker 0>the application, all this other stuff. But

00:11:11.595 --> 00:11:13.835
<v Speaker 0>obviously in the wild for me and maybe

00:11:13.835 --> 00:11:15.595
<v Speaker 0>not as wild as the lunch darkly pricing,

00:11:15.595 --> 00:11:17.035
<v Speaker 0>but I don't wanna get into that. So

00:11:18.715 --> 00:11:19.835
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Yeah.

00:11:20.235 --> 00:11:22.475
<v Speaker 0>Alright. That's awesome. So why don't you give

00:11:22.475 --> 00:11:22.635
<v Speaker 0>me

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:25.130
<v Speaker 0>a I'll throw this one to you, George.

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:26.170
<v Speaker 0>I've not heard your voice in a way.

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:29.210
<v Speaker 0>I'm starting to miss it. Yeah. What's

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:31.450
<v Speaker 0>what's the the tech stack? We've heard GRPC.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:33.370
<v Speaker 0>Tell me a little bit more about what

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:34.570
<v Speaker 0>Flipt is built upon.

00:11:35.495 --> 00:11:36.295
<v Speaker 2>Totally.

00:11:36.855 --> 00:11:39.015
<v Speaker 2>Yes. Obviously, gRPC,

00:11:40.055 --> 00:11:43.014
<v Speaker 2>Flipt is written in Go primarily, although we

00:11:43.014 --> 00:11:43.654
<v Speaker 2>also,

00:11:44.295 --> 00:11:47.014
<v Speaker 2>embed a a front end application, which is

00:11:47.014 --> 00:11:49.735
<v Speaker 2>written in TypeScript and React.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.519
<v Speaker 2>Previously, we were using

00:11:54.079 --> 00:11:55.440
<v Speaker 2>just JavaScript

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.360
<v Speaker 2>and Vue, if I remember early, but we

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.120
<v Speaker 2>recently like, in the last year, we sort

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.040
<v Speaker 2>of switched to TypeScript and React.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.120
<v Speaker 2>And then Flipt is really quite extensible in

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:05.920
<v Speaker 2>terms of

00:12:06.455 --> 00:12:07.655
<v Speaker 2>what you can

00:12:07.975 --> 00:12:09.895
<v Speaker 2>run Flipt in front of,

00:12:10.215 --> 00:12:12.695
<v Speaker 2>and we we support a range of of

00:12:12.695 --> 00:12:13.495
<v Speaker 2>back ends.

00:12:14.135 --> 00:12:15.415
<v Speaker 2>So, historically,

00:12:16.935 --> 00:12:19.895
<v Speaker 2>Flipt from day one has supported, like, relational

00:12:19.895 --> 00:12:21.335
<v Speaker 2>database back ends. So

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:22.839
<v Speaker 2>SQLite,

00:12:22.839 --> 00:12:24.600
<v Speaker 2>Postgres, MySQL,

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.440
<v Speaker 2>and then eventually we had CockroachDB

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.760
<v Speaker 2>as well. I think now we we support

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:29.880
<v Speaker 2>Terso as

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.800
<v Speaker 2>well. So

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.955
<v Speaker 2>we have those back ends. And then also

00:12:34.955 --> 00:12:37.435
<v Speaker 2>more recently, we've been working on some slightly

00:12:37.435 --> 00:12:40.795
<v Speaker 2>different back ends to support more, like, GitOps

00:12:40.795 --> 00:12:42.235
<v Speaker 2>friendly workflows.

00:12:42.235 --> 00:12:44.235
<v Speaker 2>So we support going

00:12:44.395 --> 00:12:46.555
<v Speaker 2>direct to your local file system to some

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.440
<v Speaker 2>just to a set of files. We go

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.000
<v Speaker 2>direct to git. You can go to object

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.840
<v Speaker 2>storage like AWS

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.280
<v Speaker 2>s three or

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.440
<v Speaker 2>very recently, literally Wednesday,

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.200
<v Speaker 2>we added support for for OCI registries

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.240
<v Speaker 2>as a source of truth.

00:13:01.995 --> 00:13:03.995
<v Speaker 2>So you can plug this into a number

00:13:03.995 --> 00:13:05.515
<v Speaker 2>of these these back ends that can be

00:13:05.515 --> 00:13:06.955
<v Speaker 2>that can be your source of truth.

00:13:07.515 --> 00:13:08.875
<v Speaker 2>And then we also have a a bunch

00:13:08.875 --> 00:13:11.755
<v Speaker 2>of sort of, like, ancillary technologies that we

00:13:11.755 --> 00:13:12.555
<v Speaker 2>we connect into.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:14.650
<v Speaker 2>So we

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:17.690
<v Speaker 2>we're fully instrumented with OpenTelemetry.

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:21.530
<v Speaker 2>I think we also have a native one

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:23.050
<v Speaker 2>straight to Jaeger if you don't wanna use

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:24.090
<v Speaker 2>OpenTelemetry.

00:13:26.255 --> 00:13:28.255
<v Speaker 2>I forget what else. I think maybe that

00:13:28.255 --> 00:13:30.415
<v Speaker 2>is all the pieces of the puzzle. There

00:13:30.415 --> 00:13:32.175
<v Speaker 2>are lots of pieces you can pick and

00:13:32.175 --> 00:13:32.654
<v Speaker 2>choose.

00:13:33.135 --> 00:13:34.735
<v Speaker 0>Again, you're you're you're saying all the right

00:13:34.735 --> 00:13:37.375
<v Speaker 0>things. Right? I hear tracing and OpenTelemetry.

00:13:37.375 --> 00:13:39.055
<v Speaker 0>I hear Go. I mean, I'd love to

00:13:39.055 --> 00:13:40.620
<v Speaker 0>hear some rest, but, know, I'll take I'll

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.540
<v Speaker 0>still take go. I still love go. Yeah.

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.860
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. You know, TypeScript is always I know

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:47.820
<v Speaker 0>we should do in front ends. I think

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.660
<v Speaker 0>TypeScript is a phenomenal language. You know, this

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.740
<v Speaker 0>is a modern tech stack for a modern

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.165
<v Speaker 0>open source library and that's, you know, great.

00:13:54.165 --> 00:13:55.285
<v Speaker 0>The only thing I'd love to see you

00:13:55.285 --> 00:13:56.485
<v Speaker 0>just throw it in for the next really

00:13:56.485 --> 00:13:58.325
<v Speaker 0>damn hell of it would be about WebAssembly,

00:13:58.325 --> 00:14:00.885
<v Speaker 0>but maybe that's for a future stream. We

00:14:01.525 --> 00:14:03.765
<v Speaker 2>we we we have played. Yeah.

00:14:04.325 --> 00:14:04.805
<v Speaker 2>Played

00:14:05.285 --> 00:14:07.525
<v Speaker 2>with Rust. We're playing with Rust.

00:14:07.765 --> 00:14:08.805
<v Speaker 2>We have a Rust client.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:11.020
<v Speaker 2>We

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:14.460
<v Speaker 2>Mark's been playing with a client side evaluator

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.180
<v Speaker 2>in Rust. That's sweet. We've

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.340
<v Speaker 2>played with WASM on a different sort of

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:22.060
<v Speaker 2>project on the side, but we're thinking, no.

00:14:22.745 --> 00:14:24.904
<v Speaker 2>If it's new and shiny, we we love

00:14:24.904 --> 00:14:25.785
<v Speaker 2>it, I think.

00:14:26.505 --> 00:14:27.865
<v Speaker 2>Always experiment. Awesome.

00:14:29.225 --> 00:14:31.065
<v Speaker 0>Well, thank you both for sharing all of

00:14:31.065 --> 00:14:33.385
<v Speaker 0>that. I think we should get a screen

00:14:33.385 --> 00:14:35.144
<v Speaker 0>shared and maybe try and show people how

00:14:35.144 --> 00:14:37.230
<v Speaker 0>they can get started with Flipt. Unless there's

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:38.590
<v Speaker 0>anything you want to cover before we get

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.430
<v Speaker 0>onto the hands on component of this.

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:45.230
<v Speaker 1>No. I don't think so. I have a

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:46.990
<v Speaker 1>little bit of a demo prepared if if

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:48.190
<v Speaker 0>you want me share.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:52.110
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Please. Yeah. Throw it up. Let's

00:14:52.095 --> 00:14:52.574
<v Speaker 1>Do you

00:14:56.654 --> 00:14:58.654
<v Speaker 1>hopefully, it doesn't make me restart

00:14:58.654 --> 00:14:59.855
<v Speaker 1>because we're

00:15:00.415 --> 00:15:03.375
<v Speaker 1>using a new tool. Let's see. Yeah. Oh,

00:15:03.375 --> 00:15:04.095
<v Speaker 1>got it.

00:15:05.899 --> 00:15:08.300
<v Speaker 1>Sorry. I'm just gonna enter my New search.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:09.660
<v Speaker 1>Password.

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh, it's gonna make me quit.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.579
<v Speaker 0>So is it you could just say later,

00:15:15.579 --> 00:15:18.459
<v Speaker 0>and normally, it still works. Nice.

00:15:19.855 --> 00:15:20.815
<v Speaker 1>Hacks.

00:15:20.975 --> 00:15:23.535
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Alright. Let's share

00:15:23.935 --> 00:15:24.735
<v Speaker 1>screen.

00:15:25.774 --> 00:15:28.014
<v Speaker 1>Now it says Google Chrome has lost permissions

00:15:28.014 --> 00:15:29.214
<v Speaker 1>to share screen.

00:15:29.615 --> 00:15:31.375
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you can restart and jump back in

00:15:31.375 --> 00:15:33.774
<v Speaker 0>there. I'll Okay. I'll tell the joke to

00:15:33.774 --> 00:15:34.175
<v Speaker 0>George.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:36.649
<v Speaker 0>No, George. You tell the joke. Cool.

00:15:37.209 --> 00:15:39.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any jokes to that. You

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:39.930
<v Speaker 2>got my dad?

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:45.850
<v Speaker 0>I actually I came up with some like,

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:46.649
<v Speaker 0>I spent

00:15:46.895 --> 00:15:49.055
<v Speaker 0>half an hour, maybe not even as much

00:15:49.055 --> 00:15:51.375
<v Speaker 0>as that, at Halloween googling jokes from my

00:15:51.375 --> 00:15:52.655
<v Speaker 0>five year old daughter to tell her she

00:15:52.655 --> 00:15:53.935
<v Speaker 0>was going to her dream.

00:15:54.895 --> 00:15:57.295
<v Speaker 0>And they were all absolutely terrible, but the

00:15:57.295 --> 00:15:58.495
<v Speaker 0>best part of it was is that she

00:15:58.495 --> 00:16:00.415
<v Speaker 0>started trying to make up her own jokes,

00:16:00.415 --> 00:16:02.655
<v Speaker 0>but she doesn't really understand why the jokes

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:03.019
<v Speaker 0>are funny.

00:16:03.579 --> 00:16:04.860
<v Speaker 0>But she I mean, she laughs at any

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.620
<v Speaker 0>joke I tell her. But then she tries

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:07.740
<v Speaker 0>to tell a joke and she says something

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.420
<v Speaker 0>like, why did the chicken cross the road

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.500
<v Speaker 0>to get his dinner? And you're like,

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.980
<v Speaker 0>yeah. I don't think you quite understand the

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.740
<v Speaker 0>structure of the joke. Yeah.

00:16:17.225 --> 00:16:18.825
<v Speaker 0>And Rawk's just like, what the fuck? That

00:16:18.825 --> 00:16:19.705
<v Speaker 1>was a good joke.

00:16:21.785 --> 00:16:25.145
<v Speaker 1>God. Alright. It's still saying I can't share.

00:16:26.985 --> 00:16:28.665
<v Speaker 1>Let me try one more time.

00:16:28.985 --> 00:16:30.665
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Sorry. No rush. Take your time.

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:32.990
<v Speaker 1>Screen recording.

00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't normally use Google Chrome, maybe

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:36.990
<v Speaker 1>that's why.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
<v Speaker 0>I'm not typing. Tell me a dinosaur joke

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.520
<v Speaker 0>for a five year old and to chat

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.480
<v Speaker 0>GPT.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.559
<v Speaker 0>Why did the dinosaur bring a ladder to

00:17:13.559 --> 00:17:14.040
<v Speaker 0>the party?

00:17:15.194 --> 00:17:16.474
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why.

00:17:16.714 --> 00:17:20.634
<v Speaker 0>Because it heard the drinks were on the

00:17:20.714 --> 00:17:21.434
<v Speaker 0>roof.

00:17:21.994 --> 00:17:24.075
<v Speaker 0>That's

00:17:24.075 --> 00:17:24.954
<v Speaker 0>terrible.

00:17:26.794 --> 00:17:27.514
<v Speaker 2>Wait.

00:17:28.075 --> 00:17:28.315
<v Speaker 2>What?

00:17:32.309 --> 00:17:34.549
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Tell me a Linux container joke.

00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:37.590
<v Speaker 0>Why did the Linux container go to therapy?

00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:40.870
<v Speaker 2>Don't know why. Because it had a severe

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:44.105
<v Speaker 0>case of separation anxiety. Man, Chad GPT should

00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:45.465
<v Speaker 0>not give up his day job.

00:17:45.865 --> 00:17:46.984
<v Speaker 2>He should not.

00:17:48.585 --> 00:17:50.424
<v Speaker 0>Hey. I see a screen. There we go.

00:17:50.424 --> 00:17:51.304
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:17:52.585 --> 00:17:53.224
<v Speaker 1>Sweet.

00:17:53.945 --> 00:17:54.345
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:17:55.919 --> 00:17:57.679
<v Speaker 1>Let me close that.

00:17:58.799 --> 00:17:59.440
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.279
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Can you all see?

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.400
<v Speaker 0>We can. I'm gonna do the obligatory.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.400
<v Speaker 0>You're gonna have to triple tap zoom on

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.840
<v Speaker 0>a couple of these things, but other than

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:07.919
<v Speaker 0>that,

00:18:09.375 --> 00:18:10.894
<v Speaker 1>Let me increase the

00:18:11.935 --> 00:18:13.775
<v Speaker 1>is that any better? I'd go one more

00:18:13.775 --> 00:18:14.575
<v Speaker 0>on each.

00:18:15.055 --> 00:18:16.655
<v Speaker 0>I know it feels so big on your

00:18:16.655 --> 00:18:18.335
<v Speaker 0>side, but the audience will thank you.

00:18:18.975 --> 00:18:21.055
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Let me my mouse went away now.

00:18:21.055 --> 00:18:21.935
<v Speaker 1>So that's fun.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:23.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.940
<v Speaker 1>I cannot find a mouse.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:32.820
<v Speaker 1>What is happening?

00:18:35.505 --> 00:18:36.145
<v Speaker 2>Didn't

00:18:38.225 --> 00:18:39.905
<v Speaker 2>practically demo gods.

00:18:40.385 --> 00:18:40.945
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:18:42.545 --> 00:18:44.385
<v Speaker 0>If you wiggle it fast enough, did Mac

00:18:44.385 --> 00:18:46.225
<v Speaker 0>not make it jump out of the screen?

00:18:46.305 --> 00:18:48.299
<v Speaker 2>Big old big old mouse. I really don't

00:18:48.299 --> 00:18:49.660
<v Speaker 1>know where it went. I'm gonna hook up

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.820
<v Speaker 1>a USB mouse. This

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:54.379
<v Speaker 1>is wild.

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:55.340
<v Speaker 1>Cool.

00:18:56.299 --> 00:18:57.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the room.

00:18:59.745 --> 00:19:02.145
<v Speaker 0>An old channel says, thanks for putting this

00:19:02.145 --> 00:19:04.545
<v Speaker 0>together. We need more get ups. Yeah. We

00:19:04.545 --> 00:19:05.904
<v Speaker 0>always need more get ups.

00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:07.024
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:19:09.105 --> 00:19:10.705
<v Speaker 0>I always feel that with the we've worked

00:19:10.705 --> 00:19:11.825
<v Speaker 0>folks, mister Trick,

00:19:12.289 --> 00:19:14.049
<v Speaker 0>by calling it get ops and not commit

00:19:14.049 --> 00:19:16.530
<v Speaker 0>ops. Like, they've tied it Mhmm. Rate to

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:18.370
<v Speaker 0>one thing. And I think commit ops just

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:19.409
<v Speaker 0>turns a bit nicer.

00:19:22.929 --> 00:19:24.850
<v Speaker 1>Alright. I'm ready now. I don't know if

00:19:24.929 --> 00:19:26.845
<v Speaker 1>can you still see my screen? No. It's

00:19:26.845 --> 00:19:28.044
<v Speaker 0>been unshared.

00:19:28.765 --> 00:19:29.644
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:19:31.485 --> 00:19:33.085
<v Speaker 1>It's probably for the best.

00:19:33.325 --> 00:19:33.884
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:19:34.845 --> 00:19:36.764
<v Speaker 0>Thanks for coming. We'll see you later.

00:19:38.125 --> 00:19:39.325
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Alright.

00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:43.480
<v Speaker 1>Good. Good. Cool. Found my mouse. Everything's good.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.760
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So we, so this is our documentation.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:49.400
<v Speaker 1>Right? You just go to Flipt.i0/docs,

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.880
<v Speaker 1>and it puts you in this getting started

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:52.600
<v Speaker 1>page.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.985
<v Speaker 1>And the demo that I'm gonna do is

00:19:54.985 --> 00:19:57.945
<v Speaker 1>based off of what we call, Flipt Labs,

00:19:58.585 --> 00:20:01.305
<v Speaker 1>and it's this little repository put together to

00:20:01.305 --> 00:20:02.345
<v Speaker 1>kinda demonstrate,

00:20:02.665 --> 00:20:04.985
<v Speaker 1>like, what you can do with Flipt. Because

00:20:05.145 --> 00:20:07.545
<v Speaker 1>one of the challenging things that we found

00:20:07.545 --> 00:20:08.184
<v Speaker 1>when,

00:20:09.065 --> 00:20:11.440
<v Speaker 1>you know, trying to show this tool off

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.720
<v Speaker 1>is that it requires integration with an application

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.800
<v Speaker 1>to really be useful. Right? Like, it's not

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.200
<v Speaker 1>really useful in itself. Like, I mean, you

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.360
<v Speaker 1>can run it via, you know, very simply

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:22.800
<v Speaker 1>very easily via Docker,

00:20:23.775 --> 00:20:25.535
<v Speaker 1>but then you load the dashboard and it's

00:20:25.535 --> 00:20:27.375
<v Speaker 1>like, okay. I can create some flags and

00:20:27.375 --> 00:20:29.375
<v Speaker 1>create some segments, but what do I do

00:20:29.375 --> 00:20:32.015
<v Speaker 1>with that? And so to kinda solve that

00:20:32.015 --> 00:20:32.575
<v Speaker 1>problem,

00:20:33.055 --> 00:20:33.775
<v Speaker 1>we

00:20:33.935 --> 00:20:34.975
<v Speaker 1>created this

00:20:35.215 --> 00:20:37.375
<v Speaker 1>re this repo called Fliptlabs.

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:40.340
<v Speaker 1>And so we created a couple, like, demo

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:41.139
<v Speaker 1>applications,

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.180
<v Speaker 1>to to show it off. And so the

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.899
<v Speaker 1>one I'm gonna demo demonstrate is called chatbot.

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:50.580
<v Speaker 1>And so let's see. So I have it

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:51.380
<v Speaker 1>running locally,

00:20:52.174 --> 00:20:53.855
<v Speaker 1>and it's basically

00:20:53.855 --> 00:20:54.654
<v Speaker 1>a

00:20:54.815 --> 00:20:56.335
<v Speaker 1>kind of a live

00:20:56.335 --> 00:20:57.294
<v Speaker 1>tutorial,

00:20:57.855 --> 00:20:59.135
<v Speaker 1>that you can kind of,

00:20:59.695 --> 00:21:00.575
<v Speaker 1>run through,

00:21:01.455 --> 00:21:03.215
<v Speaker 1>you know, on your on your own. And

00:21:03.215 --> 00:21:05.615
<v Speaker 1>so we have, like, three different sections of

00:21:05.615 --> 00:21:07.940
<v Speaker 1>it. We have, like, a basic, advanced,

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:08.900
<v Speaker 1>and a GitOps.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna fast forward through the git to

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:13.220
<v Speaker 1>the GitOps because I think that's probably more

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:14.340
<v Speaker 1>interesting to people.

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:16.820
<v Speaker 1>The basic is just kinda like what are

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:18.340
<v Speaker 1>flags, why would you use them, that kind

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:18.740
<v Speaker 1>of thing.

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:20.900
<v Speaker 1>And so

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:22.660
<v Speaker 1>this

00:21:23.164 --> 00:21:26.605
<v Speaker 1>this example is basically gonna show you how

00:21:26.605 --> 00:21:30.125
<v Speaker 1>you could roll out a a chatbot for

00:21:30.125 --> 00:21:31.085
<v Speaker 1>your application,

00:21:32.125 --> 00:21:34.445
<v Speaker 1>to a subset of users, and so you

00:21:34.445 --> 00:21:36.400
<v Speaker 1>can kind of test it in production. And

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.320
<v Speaker 1>then it's gonna show you how you can

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:41.519
<v Speaker 1>change the runtime behavior of that chatbot

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.680
<v Speaker 1>using feature flags without having to do a

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:44.799
<v Speaker 1>code redeploy.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.280
<v Speaker 1>And it's gonna do all that with,

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.794
<v Speaker 1>serving a feature flag data from Git. And

00:21:50.794 --> 00:21:52.955
<v Speaker 1>so that's kind of the GitOps aspect of

00:21:52.955 --> 00:21:53.434
<v Speaker 1>it.

00:21:54.635 --> 00:21:55.754
<v Speaker 1>I guess, any

00:21:56.395 --> 00:21:58.715
<v Speaker 1>any, questions or anything before I start? Or

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.160
<v Speaker 1>Nope? Nope. Cool. Please hang on. Alright. David's

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.399
<v Speaker 2>saying something, but I can't hear you, David.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.960
<v Speaker 0>Can you hear me, Mark? Yeah. I can

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:13.600
<v Speaker 1>hear you now. Yep.

00:22:16.635 --> 00:22:17.515
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:22:18.475 --> 00:22:19.835
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna see I don't I don't really

00:22:19.835 --> 00:22:21.835
<v Speaker 0>have any questions. Right? There was something really

00:22:21.835 --> 00:22:23.355
<v Speaker 0>cool that you said at the start. I

00:22:23.355 --> 00:22:26.075
<v Speaker 0>wanna kinda emphasize instead of a frame, right,

00:22:26.075 --> 00:22:27.835
<v Speaker 0>for people who are gonna see this demo.

00:22:27.915 --> 00:22:30.155
<v Speaker 0>And you said that, you know, feature flags

00:22:30.155 --> 00:22:32.030
<v Speaker 0>allow us I can't remember your exact phrase.

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:35.790
<v Speaker 0>Right? But to make two things distinct, deployment

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:39.470
<v Speaker 0>and feature delivery. Really? Exactly.

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:41.470
<v Speaker 0>And, you know, feature flags are such a

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:43.790
<v Speaker 0>great way of you know, especially as people

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:46.510
<v Speaker 0>are doing proper continuous integration and we are

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:48.245
<v Speaker 0>account based development, any of these things where

00:22:48.245 --> 00:22:50.645
<v Speaker 0>they're constantly working on new things, they're always

00:22:50.645 --> 00:22:52.885
<v Speaker 0>in production, and feature flags allow you to

00:22:52.885 --> 00:22:55.284
<v Speaker 0>toggle them on, off, release them to subsets,

00:22:55.284 --> 00:22:57.044
<v Speaker 0>do alpha beta testing, a b 10, all

00:22:57.044 --> 00:22:57.924
<v Speaker 0>this other stuff.

00:22:58.725 --> 00:23:00.485
<v Speaker 0>Really, it reduces a lot of the anxiety

00:23:00.485 --> 00:23:02.920
<v Speaker 0>and fear that people have from continuous deployment

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.440
<v Speaker 0>or deployment pipelines.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.360
<v Speaker 0>So, you know, keep that in mind as

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.800
<v Speaker 0>you look at this demo and then you

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.720
<v Speaker 0>go into it and just understand how much

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.680
<v Speaker 0>flexibility,

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.000
<v Speaker 0>stability, and performance power, all of that stuff

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.995
<v Speaker 0>you can get. So no pressure, but you're

00:23:14.995 --> 00:23:16.515
<v Speaker 0>live up to all of that now. Yeah.

00:23:16.515 --> 00:23:19.315
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. One, I guess in that in

00:23:19.315 --> 00:23:21.715
<v Speaker 1>that vein, one quote I came across recently

00:23:21.715 --> 00:23:23.235
<v Speaker 1>from, Rich Hickey,

00:23:23.635 --> 00:23:25.634
<v Speaker 1>the founder of Closure, I believe,

00:23:26.435 --> 00:23:28.434
<v Speaker 1>said all bugs in production,

00:23:28.755 --> 00:23:29.635
<v Speaker 1>pass testing,

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:32.169
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was interesting because it's like,

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:34.809
<v Speaker 1>you can't, you know, you can't test everything.

00:23:34.809 --> 00:23:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Right? So, like, testing in production

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:38.490
<v Speaker 1>is, in my opinion, you know, one of

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:39.690
<v Speaker 1>the best ways to

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:40.809
<v Speaker 1>to handle,

00:23:41.049 --> 00:23:42.889
<v Speaker 1>things that you can't catch in test.

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:44.330
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.

00:23:45.255 --> 00:23:46.455
<v Speaker 1>Anyways, let's,

00:23:46.855 --> 00:23:48.615
<v Speaker 1>let's get going. So

00:23:49.095 --> 00:23:52.054
<v Speaker 1>we this all runs, with Docker Compose.

00:23:52.935 --> 00:23:55.175
<v Speaker 1>And so I have the repository checked out

00:23:55.175 --> 00:23:57.495
<v Speaker 1>locally. I'm in the chatbot folder. Here, let

00:23:57.495 --> 00:23:58.695
<v Speaker 1>me increase the

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:01.590
<v Speaker 1>font a little bit. And so it just,

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:03.269
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna kind of give you an overview

00:24:03.269 --> 00:24:04.389
<v Speaker 1>of what's gonna happen,

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:06.149
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just gonna copy and paste these

00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.869
<v Speaker 1>commands.

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:08.869
<v Speaker 1>And,

00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:11.909
<v Speaker 1>hopefully, this should all work. I tested it

00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:12.309
<v Speaker 1>yesterday.

00:24:13.315 --> 00:24:15.315
<v Speaker 1>So, basically, what this is doing

00:24:15.795 --> 00:24:18.115
<v Speaker 1>yeah. What this is doing is spinning up

00:24:18.115 --> 00:24:20.035
<v Speaker 1>an instance of Flipt in

00:24:20.035 --> 00:24:22.195
<v Speaker 1>a Docker container, and it's also spinning up

00:24:22.195 --> 00:24:25.315
<v Speaker 1>an instance of git GITI GITIIA. I'm not

00:24:25.315 --> 00:24:27.560
<v Speaker 1>really sure how to pronounce it. Probably gitea,

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.320
<v Speaker 1>which is an open source,

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.320
<v Speaker 1>you know, git, like, GitHub kinda clone.

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:34.919
<v Speaker 1>And so

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.400
<v Speaker 1>that's gonna allow us to demonstrate the the

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.360
<v Speaker 1>GitOps part of it.

00:24:39.085 --> 00:24:41.165
<v Speaker 1>And so what we're gonna do okay. It

00:24:41.165 --> 00:24:42.445
<v Speaker 1>looks like everything's running.

00:24:43.085 --> 00:24:44.525
<v Speaker 1>So we're gonna go to

00:24:46.045 --> 00:24:47.965
<v Speaker 1>yep. Alright. So this is,

00:24:49.325 --> 00:24:52.205
<v Speaker 1>it's going to ask us to log in.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.560
<v Speaker 1>I probably should've opened that in a different

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.200
<v Speaker 1>tab.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.760
<v Speaker 1>Yep. So we're gonna log in with username

00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:58.640
<v Speaker 1>Flipt,

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.480
<v Speaker 1>password, password.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.640
<v Speaker 1>And so let me also just kinda demonstrate

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.840
<v Speaker 1>Flipt while we're here.

00:25:08.575 --> 00:25:11.135
<v Speaker 1>So this is the the Flipt dashboard,

00:25:11.695 --> 00:25:13.215
<v Speaker 1>once you, you know, once you get it

00:25:13.215 --> 00:25:15.215
<v Speaker 1>up and running. And so here, you can

00:25:15.215 --> 00:25:17.855
<v Speaker 1>see we have a flag called chat enabled,

00:25:18.175 --> 00:25:20.175
<v Speaker 1>and this is the flag that is going

00:25:20.175 --> 00:25:22.015
<v Speaker 1>to guard our chatbot

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:25.410
<v Speaker 1>that's gonna show up in this tutorial.

00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:26.850
<v Speaker 1>Spoiler.

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:29.090
<v Speaker 1>And so right now, it's disabled.

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:30.770
<v Speaker 1>And one thing you can see is that

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:32.850
<v Speaker 1>Flipt is running in read only mode,

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:36.210
<v Speaker 1>and that's because it's backed by our our

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:39.054
<v Speaker 1>GitOps back end, backed by Git storage.

00:25:39.215 --> 00:25:40.975
<v Speaker 1>And so, normally, if you're not running in

00:25:40.975 --> 00:25:43.534
<v Speaker 1>in one of these declarative with one these

00:25:43.534 --> 00:25:44.815
<v Speaker 1>declarative back ends,

00:25:45.054 --> 00:25:47.375
<v Speaker 1>you know, you can it's a basic CRUD,

00:25:47.375 --> 00:25:49.940
<v Speaker 1>you know, web app. Right? You can click

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:52.500
<v Speaker 1>on things, create things, all that stuff. But

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:53.139
<v Speaker 1>because

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:55.620
<v Speaker 1>we're now serving your feature flag data from

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:56.340
<v Speaker 1>Git,

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:58.500
<v Speaker 1>you know, obviously, you can't

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.220
<v Speaker 1>there would be a a mismatch

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:03.059
<v Speaker 1>if you were able to create things in

00:26:03.059 --> 00:26:03.540
<v Speaker 1>UI

00:26:03.904 --> 00:26:05.904
<v Speaker 1>and also create things in Git. I mean,

00:26:05.904 --> 00:26:07.745
<v Speaker 1>that's something we eventually wanna solve is to

00:26:07.745 --> 00:26:10.144
<v Speaker 1>allow you to, you know, use the UI,

00:26:10.144 --> 00:26:10.945
<v Speaker 1>and then that gets

00:26:11.505 --> 00:26:14.065
<v Speaker 1>still gets persisted to whatever back end you're

00:26:14.065 --> 00:26:14.544
<v Speaker 1>using.

00:26:14.865 --> 00:26:16.705
<v Speaker 1>But right now, if you're using one of

00:26:16.705 --> 00:26:18.544
<v Speaker 1>our declarative back ends, it puts flipped in

00:26:18.544 --> 00:26:19.345
<v Speaker 1>this read only mode.

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:22.740
<v Speaker 1>And so, yeah, you can see that the

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.500
<v Speaker 1>flag is disabled right now.

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:27.539
<v Speaker 1>But we're gonna change that by

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:30.660
<v Speaker 1>taking a look at so here's the the

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:32.180
<v Speaker 1>YAML file,

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:35.554
<v Speaker 1>the declarative format that Flipt is is reading

00:26:35.554 --> 00:26:36.114
<v Speaker 1>from,

00:26:36.914 --> 00:26:39.634
<v Speaker 1>which defines that flag and defines its state.

00:26:40.434 --> 00:26:42.274
<v Speaker 1>And so right now, it matches what you

00:26:42.274 --> 00:26:43.315
<v Speaker 1>see in the UI.

00:26:43.794 --> 00:26:46.034
<v Speaker 1>And so we're gonna go continue with the

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.920
<v Speaker 1>tutorial here.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.200
<v Speaker 1>And

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:54.080
<v Speaker 1>yep. So, basically, it's saying, okay. You know,

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.520
<v Speaker 1>you're at the point where you wanna enable

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:56.560
<v Speaker 1>this chatbot,

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.520
<v Speaker 1>and here's how you would do that. So,

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.440
<v Speaker 1>you know, everything I just said, it's in

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.735
<v Speaker 1>the disabled state. Says, luckily, one of our

00:27:03.735 --> 00:27:06.535
<v Speaker 1>colleagues has already prepared a PR to enable

00:27:06.535 --> 00:27:07.415
<v Speaker 1>this flag.

00:27:07.815 --> 00:27:10.615
<v Speaker 1>So we're gonna go here and

00:27:11.095 --> 00:27:11.895
<v Speaker 1>uh-oh.

00:27:12.375 --> 00:27:14.535
<v Speaker 1>Colleague has not prepared the PR.

00:27:15.415 --> 00:27:16.215
<v Speaker 1>Let me re

00:27:16.775 --> 00:27:17.895
<v Speaker 1>let me restart this.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.679
<v Speaker 1>Nothing like a live demo.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:26.840
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes this,

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.840
<v Speaker 1>demo doesn't work,

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:31.960
<v Speaker 1>every time, so you have to recreate it.

00:27:38.715 --> 00:27:39.995
<v Speaker 1>I blame George.

00:27:40.315 --> 00:27:41.995
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. It's definitely my fault.

00:27:42.315 --> 00:27:43.035
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:27:43.995 --> 00:27:46.155
<v Speaker 1>There we go. Alright. So,

00:27:46.875 --> 00:27:48.875
<v Speaker 1>now we can see that our

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:49.940
<v Speaker 1>helpful,

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:53.620
<v Speaker 1>colleague has prepared a PR to change,

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:56.820
<v Speaker 1>the feature flag from false to true,

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:59.059
<v Speaker 1>and so we're gonna merge that.

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh, it's gonna make me sign in again.

00:28:07.455 --> 00:28:08.255
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:28:11.375 --> 00:28:13.455
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So merged.

00:28:13.775 --> 00:28:14.815
<v Speaker 1>And now

00:28:15.215 --> 00:28:18.240
<v Speaker 1>hey. Now our little chatbot shows up,

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.680
<v Speaker 1>almost instantly. Because what's happening in the background

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.640
<v Speaker 1>is Flipt is polling that GitHub repository,

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.320
<v Speaker 1>watching for changes,

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.400
<v Speaker 1>and it saw that, okay, the flag went

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.914
<v Speaker 1>from enabled false to true. And so now

00:28:30.914 --> 00:28:34.115
<v Speaker 1>your application can query that flag and get

00:28:34.115 --> 00:28:35.474
<v Speaker 1>the value of true.

00:28:35.875 --> 00:28:37.634
<v Speaker 1>And so here's our little chatbot

00:28:37.794 --> 00:28:39.474
<v Speaker 1>that that showed up.

00:28:40.995 --> 00:28:41.794
<v Speaker 1>And so

00:28:42.195 --> 00:28:44.434
<v Speaker 1>this this doesn't really matter for the demo,

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.339
<v Speaker 1>but this chatbot is actually,

00:28:47.059 --> 00:28:50.019
<v Speaker 1>trained on our, on our own docs.

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:53.380
<v Speaker 1>We actually went and embedded our documentation in

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.779
<v Speaker 1>a into a vector database and doing all

00:28:55.779 --> 00:28:56.740
<v Speaker 1>that OpenAI,

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:57.220
<v Speaker 1>business.

00:28:57.745 --> 00:28:59.985
<v Speaker 1>So you can actually ask this chatbot questions

00:28:59.985 --> 00:29:01.264
<v Speaker 1>about Flipt itself.

00:29:01.664 --> 00:29:02.465
<v Speaker 1>And you say, like

00:29:08.705 --> 00:29:09.265
<v Speaker 1>and,

00:29:09.769 --> 00:29:11.690
<v Speaker 1>yeah, we can give you a somewhat helpful

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:12.570
<v Speaker 1>answer,

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:14.249
<v Speaker 1>of where Flipt runs.

00:29:15.929 --> 00:29:18.090
<v Speaker 1>And so, yeah, I guess I'll pause here

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:19.690
<v Speaker 1>for any any questions,

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:21.690
<v Speaker 1>before I before I go on or any

00:29:21.769 --> 00:29:22.730
<v Speaker 1>anything you wanna talk about.

00:29:27.005 --> 00:29:27.725
<v Speaker 1>I can't hear

00:29:28.365 --> 00:29:29.725
<v Speaker 1>David, I think you're muted. Or

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:43.870
<v Speaker 1>Can somewhat hear you.

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:48.110
<v Speaker 0>Oh, okay.

00:29:50.315 --> 00:29:51.355
<v Speaker 0>You hear me there?

00:29:51.835 --> 00:29:52.475
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:29:53.115 --> 00:29:55.355
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I I don't know what happened there,

00:29:55.355 --> 00:29:59.755
<v Speaker 0>but the Mac changed for them to be

00:29:59.755 --> 00:30:00.395
<v Speaker 0>iPhone.

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:03.209
<v Speaker 1>Oh.

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:04.889
<v Speaker 1>And

00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:07.529
<v Speaker 0>I don't know why, which explains why I

00:30:07.529 --> 00:30:09.289
<v Speaker 0>was saying the best jokes in the world

00:30:09.289 --> 00:30:11.289
<v Speaker 0>just like five minutes. Nobody

00:30:11.289 --> 00:30:12.329
<v Speaker 0>was laughing.

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:13.210
<v Speaker 0>That's

00:30:13.875 --> 00:30:15.235
<v Speaker 0>Anyway,

00:30:15.235 --> 00:30:16.755
<v Speaker 0>I I said blame George, and then you

00:30:16.755 --> 00:30:18.195
<v Speaker 0>said blame George. And I was like, hold

00:30:18.195 --> 00:30:19.475
<v Speaker 0>on a minute. I just missed it. My

00:30:19.475 --> 00:30:19.955
<v Speaker 2>joke.

00:30:24.115 --> 00:30:25.715
<v Speaker 0>No. That's usually cool. Keep going. I do

00:30:25.715 --> 00:30:27.395
<v Speaker 0>have questions, but I think, you know, I

00:30:27.395 --> 00:30:30.330
<v Speaker 0>I wanna see the the DX of this,

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.410
<v Speaker 0>the clip perspective, but let's keep going just

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:33.690
<v Speaker 0>just now, and then I'll come back to

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:34.169
<v Speaker 0>that.

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:37.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Cool. So, yeah, so I just refreshed

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Flipt, and you can see that it's enabled

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:40.970
<v Speaker 1>here as well.

00:30:41.785 --> 00:30:42.745
<v Speaker 1>And so

00:30:42.985 --> 00:30:44.505
<v Speaker 1>let's continue on.

00:30:46.185 --> 00:30:48.585
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Already did that. Already did that. Okay.

00:30:48.585 --> 00:30:49.385
<v Speaker 1>And so,

00:30:50.025 --> 00:30:52.505
<v Speaker 1>basically, what I just showed is, like, how

00:30:52.505 --> 00:30:54.600
<v Speaker 1>most people, I think, think of feature flags,

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.440
<v Speaker 1>kind of that boolean state, like, on or

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.600
<v Speaker 1>off, either features enabled or disabled.

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:00.679
<v Speaker 1>And so another

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.400
<v Speaker 1>another cool thing you can do with Flipt

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.975
<v Speaker 1>and most other feature flag tools is they

00:31:05.975 --> 00:31:08.055
<v Speaker 1>have the idea of variance.

00:31:08.055 --> 00:31:10.375
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not just a typical on

00:31:10.375 --> 00:31:12.695
<v Speaker 1>off, but you can also return other values.

00:31:12.855 --> 00:31:14.615
<v Speaker 1>And you can say, okay. I want these

00:31:14.615 --> 00:31:16.615
<v Speaker 1>to be distributed at different,

00:31:17.015 --> 00:31:17.815
<v Speaker 1>percentages.

00:31:18.055 --> 00:31:19.640
<v Speaker 1>So you could say, you know, I want

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.679
<v Speaker 1>5050%

00:31:20.679 --> 00:31:22.760
<v Speaker 1>of my users to get the value blue,

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.519
<v Speaker 1>another 50% to get red, and you can

00:31:24.519 --> 00:31:26.679
<v Speaker 1>change that over time, right, without redeploying your

00:31:26.679 --> 00:31:27.159
<v Speaker 1>app.

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.320
<v Speaker 1>And so we're we're kind of trying to

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.599
<v Speaker 1>demonstrate that here,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.745
<v Speaker 1>where where we added another feature flag called

00:31:33.745 --> 00:31:35.025
<v Speaker 1>chat personas.

00:31:35.025 --> 00:31:36.784
<v Speaker 1>And so what we wanna do what we

00:31:36.784 --> 00:31:37.744
<v Speaker 1>wanna demonstrate

00:31:37.985 --> 00:31:40.465
<v Speaker 1>is, you know, we're testing like, put your

00:31:40.465 --> 00:31:41.024
<v Speaker 1>mind,

00:31:41.424 --> 00:31:43.105
<v Speaker 1>put yourself in the shoes of an engineer

00:31:43.105 --> 00:31:45.585
<v Speaker 1>who's trying to deploy this chatbot for real,

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:48.940
<v Speaker 1>and maybe they wanna test out different personas

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:51.179
<v Speaker 1>of that chatbot. So, like, the default

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:52.460
<v Speaker 1>is, like, friendly.

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:55.180
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they, you know, they're feeling sassy, and

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:57.419
<v Speaker 1>the they wanna test out a sarcastic

00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:58.540
<v Speaker 1>chatbot.

00:31:59.395 --> 00:32:01.235
<v Speaker 1>And then, you know, just for kicks, they

00:32:01.235 --> 00:32:03.235
<v Speaker 1>wanna test out one who who tells you,

00:32:03.235 --> 00:32:03.715
<v Speaker 1>like,

00:32:04.035 --> 00:32:06.515
<v Speaker 1>BS. Right? Who's a who's a liar. And

00:32:06.515 --> 00:32:07.154
<v Speaker 1>so

00:32:08.195 --> 00:32:11.154
<v Speaker 1>we we try to demonstrate that with another

00:32:11.475 --> 00:32:13.475
<v Speaker 1>pull request here

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.620
<v Speaker 1>where we How annoying would it be for

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:21.700
<v Speaker 0>me to ask that we change one of

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.779
<v Speaker 0>the personas just for laughs?

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:27.139
<v Speaker 0>Can we have an Ace Ventura persona?

00:32:28.525 --> 00:32:30.845
<v Speaker 1>We can we can try. Yeah.

00:32:31.805 --> 00:32:33.645
<v Speaker 1>Let me let me merge this

00:32:33.885 --> 00:32:35.725
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'll let you know and then we

00:32:35.725 --> 00:32:37.404
<v Speaker 0>can matters in the works. Right.

00:32:38.045 --> 00:32:40.365
<v Speaker 1>Actually, because yeah. Because because in in the

00:32:40.365 --> 00:32:42.685
<v Speaker 1>next step, we're actually gonna modify this file

00:32:42.685 --> 00:32:44.309
<v Speaker 1>and push it up. And so, yeah, we

00:32:44.309 --> 00:32:45.990
<v Speaker 1>we can we'll get there.

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:49.190
<v Speaker 1>So let me go ahead and merge that.

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:52.789
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:53.830
<v Speaker 1>And so

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:57.065
<v Speaker 1>let's see what happened in Flipt. So now

00:32:57.065 --> 00:32:59.065
<v Speaker 1>there's two flags. Right? There's chat enabled and

00:32:59.065 --> 00:33:00.184
<v Speaker 1>chat personas,

00:33:00.665 --> 00:33:02.425
<v Speaker 1>and you can see it created those variants

00:33:02.425 --> 00:33:04.825
<v Speaker 1>that I was talking about. And then we

00:33:04.825 --> 00:33:07.144
<v Speaker 1>have the rules defined which say,

00:33:07.385 --> 00:33:09.785
<v Speaker 1>okay. Which percentage of requests are gonna get

00:33:09.785 --> 00:33:12.360
<v Speaker 1>which, variant? And so they're all set at

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.280
<v Speaker 1>a third right now, right, where default's,

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.320
<v Speaker 1>slightly,

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:16.520
<v Speaker 1>favored.

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:17.880
<v Speaker 1>And so

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:19.320
<v Speaker 1>continuing

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.640
<v Speaker 1>with the tutorial oh, it would scroll up

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:22.440
<v Speaker 1>to the top.

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:23.080
<v Speaker 1>So

00:33:24.005 --> 00:33:24.645
<v Speaker 1>enable

00:33:24.885 --> 00:33:27.365
<v Speaker 1>sorry. In order to kind of test this,

00:33:27.365 --> 00:33:30.645
<v Speaker 1>we need we need something that is distinct.

00:33:31.525 --> 00:33:34.565
<v Speaker 1>So in this example, we're choosing, a username.

00:33:34.565 --> 00:33:35.925
<v Speaker 1>Right? But it could be anything like an

00:33:35.925 --> 00:33:38.165
<v Speaker 1>IP address or, you know, user ID or

00:33:38.165 --> 00:33:39.919
<v Speaker 1>whatever. But we need something

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.440
<v Speaker 1>to determine,

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.040
<v Speaker 1>okay, the stickiness.

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.280
<v Speaker 1>So we always wanna make sure that the

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.520
<v Speaker 1>same user gets the same variant of chatbot

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:49.760
<v Speaker 1>because it would be weird if, like, you

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:50.880
<v Speaker 1>know, all of a sudden you're talk you

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.720
<v Speaker 1>know, you're talking to a friendly chatbot, then

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.080
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden he starts to get

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.804
<v Speaker 1>all, like, sassy. Right?

00:33:56.045 --> 00:33:57.005
<v Speaker 1>And so

00:33:57.485 --> 00:33:59.645
<v Speaker 1>the the way we're demonstrating that is via

00:33:59.645 --> 00:34:01.165
<v Speaker 1>this username

00:34:01.965 --> 00:34:02.845
<v Speaker 1>field.

00:34:03.085 --> 00:34:05.645
<v Speaker 1>And so I'll just say my username is

00:34:05.645 --> 00:34:06.205
<v Speaker 1>David,

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:10.340
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm gonna ask the chatbot questions

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:10.660
<v Speaker 1>like

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:22.580
<v Speaker 1>yeah. So

00:34:22.795 --> 00:34:26.315
<v Speaker 1>first, you got the the liar chatbot,

00:34:27.034 --> 00:34:29.755
<v Speaker 1>but, actually, he is telling the truth here,

00:34:29.755 --> 00:34:30.155
<v Speaker 1>so,

00:34:30.635 --> 00:34:31.835
<v Speaker 1>ignore that.

00:34:33.355 --> 00:34:33.915
<v Speaker 1>But

00:34:34.955 --> 00:34:36.955
<v Speaker 1>let's try let's try George and see which

00:34:36.955 --> 00:34:37.995
<v Speaker 1>version George gets.

00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:50.090
<v Speaker 1>And so flip sorry. George got the sarcastic

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:50.409
<v Speaker 1>one.

00:34:51.364 --> 00:34:53.445
<v Speaker 1>So what database is done with support?

00:34:53.925 --> 00:34:55.364
<v Speaker 1>So you're pretty much covered.

00:34:56.085 --> 00:34:58.325
<v Speaker 1>And so we're just trying to show, like,

00:34:58.565 --> 00:35:00.645
<v Speaker 1>you know, that you can different users will

00:35:00.645 --> 00:35:02.724
<v Speaker 1>get different variants, but George will always get

00:35:02.724 --> 00:35:05.099
<v Speaker 1>the sarcastic one. David will always get the

00:35:05.099 --> 00:35:07.340
<v Speaker 1>liar one who's not necessarily lying.

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:11.099
<v Speaker 1>And so the way that you're controlling that

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:12.859
<v Speaker 1>is via PRs,

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:14.460
<v Speaker 1>and contributions

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:15.180
<v Speaker 1>via Git.

00:35:17.165 --> 00:35:19.005
<v Speaker 1>And so I think what might really bring

00:35:19.005 --> 00:35:21.885
<v Speaker 1>it home is if we can show, like,

00:35:21.885 --> 00:35:24.525
<v Speaker 1>okay. As a engineer, as a developer, how

00:35:24.525 --> 00:35:26.125
<v Speaker 1>would you actually make a change

00:35:26.365 --> 00:35:27.965
<v Speaker 1>to you know, if you didn't have a

00:35:27.965 --> 00:35:28.685
<v Speaker 1>PR prepared?

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:32.540
<v Speaker 1>So let's do that

00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:35.020
<v Speaker 1>here.

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:39.180
<v Speaker 1>And then we're going to clone

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:39.580
<v Speaker 1>it.

00:35:52.195 --> 00:35:54.835
<v Speaker 1>And so now we're actually gonna change that,

00:35:55.954 --> 00:35:56.755
<v Speaker 1>that percentage.

00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:59.309
<v Speaker 1>So say we wanna say, okay. We want

00:35:59.309 --> 00:36:00.910
<v Speaker 1>everyone to get the sarcastic,

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:01.710
<v Speaker 1>chatbot.

00:36:13.525 --> 00:36:16.325
<v Speaker 1>Actually, you've been done and not again because

00:36:16.325 --> 00:36:18.005
<v Speaker 1>all my key findings are off.

00:36:20.965 --> 00:36:22.805
<v Speaker 1>So, basically, what I'm doing here is I'm

00:36:22.805 --> 00:36:25.125
<v Speaker 1>setting all the other variations to zero and

00:36:25.125 --> 00:36:27.125
<v Speaker 1>the sarcastic one to 100%.

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:29.900
<v Speaker 1>And I'm gonna close it, and I'm gonna

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.420
<v Speaker 1>commit it and push it up.

00:36:35.099 --> 00:36:37.340
<v Speaker 0>Are you running fake in your terminal?

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:38.299
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

00:36:41.615 --> 00:36:44.015
<v Speaker 0>I was late seeing other people's terminal set.

00:36:48.735 --> 00:36:50.335
<v Speaker 0>They sound quite chunky. Oh,

00:36:50.815 --> 00:36:51.215
<v Speaker 1>yeah.

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:53.530
<v Speaker 1>Trying to remember which keyboard. I got it

00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:55.050
<v Speaker 1>from WASD

00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:56.090
<v Speaker 1>keyboards.

00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:58.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like Cherry MX clears.

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Nice.

00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:02.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I do like I don't know if

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:04.410
<v Speaker 0>it's WASD or WASD or whatever you're supposed

00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:06.010
<v Speaker 0>to pronounce, but I do like their keyboards.

00:37:07.675 --> 00:37:09.915
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. I had a code keyboard from

00:37:10.395 --> 00:37:12.635
<v Speaker 1>forget who. Maybe it's them. I really like

00:37:12.635 --> 00:37:15.035
<v Speaker 1>that one. But That's not what it's actually

00:37:15.275 --> 00:37:17.835
<v Speaker 0>was at, but it was the Stack Overflow

00:37:17.835 --> 00:37:20.795
<v Speaker 0>team that Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's come

00:37:20.795 --> 00:37:23.170
<v Speaker 0>back a while ago. Like, what, 2010,

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:25.090
<v Speaker 0>I think, when they first came out.

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:28.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That explains why why it was crusty,

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:29.410
<v Speaker 1>and I had to get a new one.

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:30.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's a

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:32.690
<v Speaker 1>pretty old one. They still sell them. I

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:33.970
<v Speaker 0>think they sell really well. So

00:37:35.454 --> 00:37:36.095
<v Speaker 1>Nice.

00:37:37.135 --> 00:37:38.655
<v Speaker 1>So, basically, yeah, what I did is I

00:37:38.655 --> 00:37:40.494
<v Speaker 1>just kinda YOLO'd this commit and pushed it

00:37:40.494 --> 00:37:41.215
<v Speaker 1>to main.

00:37:41.695 --> 00:37:44.494
<v Speaker 1>And now, hopefully, everybody should be getting the

00:37:44.494 --> 00:37:48.255
<v Speaker 1>the sarcastic chatbot regardless of who they are.

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:51.250
<v Speaker 1>And,

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:54.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah, this is just me testing the same

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:56.050
<v Speaker 1>thing. But, anyways, we can go back to

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:57.970
<v Speaker 1>Flipt and see that now

00:37:58.290 --> 00:38:01.410
<v Speaker 1>that variant is at a %

00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:04.530
<v Speaker 1>without you making any changes in the UI.

00:38:05.515 --> 00:38:07.675
<v Speaker 1>Cool. And that's, I guess, really ultimately what

00:38:07.675 --> 00:38:09.115
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to demonstrate there.

00:38:11.675 --> 00:38:12.475
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:38:12.555 --> 00:38:13.035
<v Speaker 0>Can

00:38:13.755 --> 00:38:15.835
<v Speaker 0>we've just seen the house to kind of

00:38:17.035 --> 00:38:19.435
<v Speaker 0>configure the flags

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:19.710
<v Speaker 0>with Flipt.

00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:22.350
<v Speaker 0>What does it look like from the SDK

00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:23.790
<v Speaker 0>point of view? Like, how do I put

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:24.910
<v Speaker 0>this into my

00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:26.750
<v Speaker 0>code?

00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:28.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:30.270
<v Speaker 1>George, do wanna take that one?

00:38:31.205 --> 00:38:32.005
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:38:33.125 --> 00:38:35.845
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to see an actual,

00:38:36.245 --> 00:38:38.485
<v Speaker 2>like, example in code? I can share my

00:38:38.485 --> 00:38:40.165
<v Speaker 2>screen. Would that be helpful? Or Well, yeah.

00:38:40.165 --> 00:38:41.685
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming this website

00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:46.210
<v Speaker 0>uses some sort of SDK to request the

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:47.490
<v Speaker 0>chatbot persona.

00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:48.690
<v Speaker 0>So, you know, if we could just take

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:50.290
<v Speaker 0>a look at that code and see, you

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:51.890
<v Speaker 0>know, like, I want developers to be able

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:54.290
<v Speaker 0>to understand. Okay. I can create a flag,

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:56.369
<v Speaker 0>push them to get all those reloading

00:38:56.369 --> 00:38:59.185
<v Speaker 0>for me, but at runtime, at code time,

00:38:59.185 --> 00:39:01.665
<v Speaker 0>how do I get this value?

00:39:02.464 --> 00:39:04.224
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I can I can show that real

00:39:04.224 --> 00:39:06.705
<v Speaker 1>quick? Just for this example labs

00:39:07.505 --> 00:39:09.744
<v Speaker 1>demo, if that's what

00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:13.090
<v Speaker 1>Let's see. So

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:15.890
<v Speaker 1>yeah. So I guess a broader answer to

00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:18.930
<v Speaker 1>your question is kind of what SDKs do

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:20.610
<v Speaker 1>we support, and then I can talk about,

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:21.970
<v Speaker 1>like, which one the demo's using.

00:39:23.665 --> 00:39:25.825
<v Speaker 1>And so as I as I alluded to

00:39:25.825 --> 00:39:26.545
<v Speaker 1>earlier,

00:39:26.704 --> 00:39:29.665
<v Speaker 1>Flipt supports both REST and gRPC,

00:39:29.744 --> 00:39:31.825
<v Speaker 1>and so we have a combination of both

00:39:32.305 --> 00:39:35.265
<v Speaker 1>SDKs. We have our REST SDKs

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:39.010
<v Speaker 1>available in, like, five or six different languages,

00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:42.770
<v Speaker 1>you know, Node, TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java.

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:44.770
<v Speaker 1>We just added a PHP

00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:48.770
<v Speaker 1>rest SDK because of a amazing contributor contributed

00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:49.090
<v Speaker 1>that.

00:39:49.765 --> 00:39:51.525
<v Speaker 1>And so that's currently in beta.

00:39:52.165 --> 00:39:54.885
<v Speaker 1>And then as far as gRPC,

00:39:55.045 --> 00:39:56.565
<v Speaker 1>obviously, with gRPC,

00:39:56.565 --> 00:39:59.205
<v Speaker 1>you can anybody can generate their own SDK

00:39:59.205 --> 00:40:01.365
<v Speaker 1>setup or any anyone can generate their own

00:40:01.365 --> 00:40:03.445
<v Speaker 1>clients. That's one of the beauties of gRPC.

00:40:03.605 --> 00:40:05.790
<v Speaker 1>But we have a couple that we already

00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:08.030
<v Speaker 1>went ahead and generated for you and published

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:10.350
<v Speaker 1>just to kind of remove that extra step.

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:12.430
<v Speaker 1>And so we have them for Go,

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:15.470
<v Speaker 1>Ruby, and.net, and we're currently working on publishing

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:16.190
<v Speaker 1>a Java one.

00:40:18.405 --> 00:40:20.645
<v Speaker 1>And then finally, we have

00:40:21.925 --> 00:40:23.925
<v Speaker 1>we are supporting this project

00:40:23.925 --> 00:40:25.925
<v Speaker 1>called Open Feature, which I don't know if

00:40:25.925 --> 00:40:27.765
<v Speaker 1>you've heard about, but it's kind of like

00:40:27.765 --> 00:40:31.390
<v Speaker 1>the open telemetry for feature flags where they

00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:34.110
<v Speaker 1>got a bunch of feature flag vendors together

00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:36.030
<v Speaker 1>and said, you know, let's come up with

00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:37.710
<v Speaker 1>a common interface,

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:40.190
<v Speaker 1>a common API that we can all,

00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:43.710
<v Speaker 1>you know, conform to to enable

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:46.815
<v Speaker 1>our to enable end users to basically have

00:40:46.815 --> 00:40:48.815
<v Speaker 1>one one SDK,

00:40:49.135 --> 00:40:51.935
<v Speaker 1>but then be able to switch out feature

00:40:51.935 --> 00:40:53.855
<v Speaker 1>flag providers. So it doesn't matter if you're

00:40:53.855 --> 00:40:57.455
<v Speaker 1>using LaunchDarkly or Unleash or Flipt. You don't

00:40:57.455 --> 00:40:59.935
<v Speaker 1>have to change your s your your code.

00:41:00.494 --> 00:41:01.214
<v Speaker 1>You can just

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.400
<v Speaker 1>swap out a different provider.

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:04.520
<v Speaker 1>And so,

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:06.360
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a CNCF,

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:07.320
<v Speaker 1>project,

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.440
<v Speaker 1>and, you know, we have two different providers

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.160
<v Speaker 1>right now,

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:14.200
<v Speaker 1>Go and Java, and then we're we have

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:15.480
<v Speaker 1>the PHP one on the way.

00:41:18.145 --> 00:41:19.265
<v Speaker 1>And so I guess

00:41:20.145 --> 00:41:23.105
<v Speaker 1>I can I can continue with the the

00:41:23.105 --> 00:41:23.745
<v Speaker 1>chat

00:41:24.065 --> 00:41:27.025
<v Speaker 1>chatbot example and show the actual SDK code

00:41:27.025 --> 00:41:29.025
<v Speaker 1>there Yeah? If you want. Or okay.

00:41:29.619 --> 00:41:31.540
<v Speaker 1>And another thing to mention, sorry, before I

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:33.619
<v Speaker 1>get to that, is we also publish our

00:41:33.619 --> 00:41:34.740
<v Speaker 1>open API

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:36.420
<v Speaker 1>definition.

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:38.580
<v Speaker 1>And so you can generate your own REST

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:40.100
<v Speaker 1>clients as well if you want,

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:42.740
<v Speaker 1>but they're not as,

00:41:43.285 --> 00:41:44.805
<v Speaker 1>you know they're they're kinda hit or miss

00:41:44.805 --> 00:41:46.805
<v Speaker 1>on which ones are idiomatic.

00:41:48.085 --> 00:41:49.765
<v Speaker 1>We have we have a Rust SDK. We

00:41:49.765 --> 00:41:51.125
<v Speaker 1>have we have a Rust

00:41:52.565 --> 00:41:53.925
<v Speaker 1>Rust SDK.

00:41:55.285 --> 00:41:57.960
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Yeah. There you go. Alright.

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:00.040
<v Speaker 1>So

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:01.480
<v Speaker 1>let's go

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:04.040
<v Speaker 1>let me just show you real quick what

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:04.600
<v Speaker 1>the

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:07.080
<v Speaker 1>chatbot

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:08.600
<v Speaker 1>is

00:42:09.405 --> 00:42:10.285
<v Speaker 1>using

00:42:10.445 --> 00:42:11.645
<v Speaker 1>think it's here.

00:42:12.685 --> 00:42:13.325
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:42:17.005 --> 00:42:19.005
<v Speaker 1>Me just search. Sorry. I wasn't.

00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:29.890
<v Speaker 2>No more code search.

00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:32.210
<v Speaker 1>I know that.

00:42:46.805 --> 00:42:48.645
<v Speaker 1>Sorry. I should have been more prepared.

00:42:51.924 --> 00:42:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Is it here? Here it is. Alright. Sorry.

00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:55.310
<v Speaker 1>So,

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:57.790
<v Speaker 1>here, we're importing our node,

00:42:58.110 --> 00:42:58.910
<v Speaker 1>SDK,

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:02.590
<v Speaker 1>and it's called Flipt API client. And,

00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:06.670
<v Speaker 1>basically, you give it the environment or the

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:08.430
<v Speaker 1>URL that Flipt is available at.

00:43:09.215 --> 00:43:11.455
<v Speaker 1>In this case, it's just local host. And

00:43:11.455 --> 00:43:14.015
<v Speaker 1>then we're just, using a use effects,

00:43:14.335 --> 00:43:16.735
<v Speaker 1>React hook to basically do

00:43:17.215 --> 00:43:18.575
<v Speaker 1>check this flag.

00:43:18.975 --> 00:43:21.295
<v Speaker 1>Default here is the namespace,

00:43:21.935 --> 00:43:23.295
<v Speaker 1>and I'll I can talk about that in

00:43:23.295 --> 00:43:23.935
<v Speaker 1>a second.

00:43:24.255 --> 00:43:26.630
<v Speaker 1>But the the flag is called chat enabled,

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:28.710
<v Speaker 1>and so it's just, you know, whenever you

00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:30.870
<v Speaker 1>refresh the page, basically, saying,

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:32.390
<v Speaker 1>okay.

00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Check and see if this

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:34.790
<v Speaker 1>this

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:38.744
<v Speaker 1>actually, sorry. Not when you refresh the page.

00:43:38.744 --> 00:43:40.185
<v Speaker 1>Just checking every five seconds.

00:43:41.545 --> 00:43:43.145
<v Speaker 1>If it's checking to see if this flag

00:43:43.145 --> 00:43:44.025
<v Speaker 1>is enabled.

00:43:44.825 --> 00:43:46.984
<v Speaker 1>And so that's that's pretty much it. It's

00:43:46.984 --> 00:43:48.984
<v Speaker 1>just a single line to to get the

00:43:48.984 --> 00:43:52.609
<v Speaker 1>flag here. Yeah. Nice and easy. Cool. Yep.

00:43:53.329 --> 00:43:55.250
<v Speaker 2>I think as well in this project, we've

00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:55.810
<v Speaker 2>got

00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:56.690
<v Speaker 2>the

00:43:57.170 --> 00:43:59.410
<v Speaker 2>correct me if I'm wrong with me. The

00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:01.329
<v Speaker 2>the part that has the LLM is in

00:44:01.329 --> 00:44:04.609
<v Speaker 2>Python, and do we that is a Flipt

00:44:04.609 --> 00:44:06.615
<v Speaker 2>client. So we have a Python SDK

00:44:06.935 --> 00:44:07.815
<v Speaker 2>in here too

00:44:08.615 --> 00:44:09.735
<v Speaker 2>being demonstrated.

00:44:10.055 --> 00:44:11.495
<v Speaker 1>Yes. Good point.

00:44:11.975 --> 00:44:13.895
<v Speaker 1>Right. I yeah. So I just showed the

00:44:13.895 --> 00:44:15.815
<v Speaker 1>the front end flag,

00:44:16.295 --> 00:44:17.975
<v Speaker 1>and then we have on the back end,

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:20.720
<v Speaker 1>as George just said, we have a Python

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:22.800
<v Speaker 1>REST SDK as well.

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.440
<v Speaker 1>And so that one is doing all the

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:29.119
<v Speaker 1>the variant checking to determine which persona the

00:44:29.119 --> 00:44:30.400
<v Speaker 1>chatbot should

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:32.640
<v Speaker 1>should should respond with.

00:44:33.325 --> 00:44:34.445
<v Speaker 1>And so

00:44:34.685 --> 00:44:36.125
<v Speaker 1>let's get down here.

00:44:36.445 --> 00:44:37.325
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So

00:44:38.685 --> 00:44:40.285
<v Speaker 1>Flipt can be used

00:44:40.685 --> 00:44:43.165
<v Speaker 1>from a consumer point of view in a

00:44:43.165 --> 00:44:44.205
<v Speaker 1>handful of ways.

00:44:44.765 --> 00:44:46.925
<v Speaker 1>I would say most probably 99%

00:44:46.925 --> 00:44:48.845
<v Speaker 1>of people use our evaluate API,

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:52.260
<v Speaker 1>and that's what this

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:55.619
<v Speaker 1>SDK is using here. And so that's taking

00:44:55.619 --> 00:44:56.900
<v Speaker 1>that context,

00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:59.220
<v Speaker 1>which in the lab example was the the

00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:00.020
<v Speaker 1>username,

00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:01.779
<v Speaker 1>and it's sending it to Flipt, and it's

00:45:01.779 --> 00:45:04.175
<v Speaker 1>saying, okay. Give me what I should what

00:45:04.175 --> 00:45:06.095
<v Speaker 1>variant I should use

00:45:06.095 --> 00:45:08.494
<v Speaker 1>return to this user. And so that's this

00:45:08.494 --> 00:45:09.935
<v Speaker 1>evaluate call here.

00:45:10.895 --> 00:45:12.415
<v Speaker 1>And so here you can see it's building

00:45:12.415 --> 00:45:14.895
<v Speaker 1>up that evaluation request,

00:45:15.375 --> 00:45:15.775
<v Speaker 1>and,

00:45:16.255 --> 00:45:19.375
<v Speaker 1>we use we use a, number called entity

00:45:19.375 --> 00:45:22.070
<v Speaker 1>ID because we didn't want to

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:24.230
<v Speaker 1>kind of force you

00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:26.790
<v Speaker 1>to you to think about feature flags as

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:28.790
<v Speaker 1>only a user facing thing.

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:31.510
<v Speaker 1>And so, you know, a lot of, feature

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:33.590
<v Speaker 1>flag tools use the the nomenclature

00:45:33.590 --> 00:45:35.705
<v Speaker 1>of user ID. Well, I mean, you can

00:45:35.705 --> 00:45:38.105
<v Speaker 1>use feature flag for pretty much anything like,

00:45:38.105 --> 00:45:40.665
<v Speaker 1>you know, rate limits or, you know, log

00:45:40.665 --> 00:45:43.785
<v Speaker 1>levels or, you know, things that aren't aren't

00:45:43.785 --> 00:45:44.665
<v Speaker 1>necessarily

00:45:44.985 --> 00:45:45.945
<v Speaker 1>driven

00:45:45.945 --> 00:45:48.069
<v Speaker 1>by a user's action. And so that's why

00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:49.990
<v Speaker 1>we just call it into the ID.

00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:53.430
<v Speaker 1>But, anyways, that's the that's the username here.

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:55.829
<v Speaker 1>It does a call to evaluate, and it

00:45:55.829 --> 00:45:57.110
<v Speaker 1>returns the variant.

00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:59.990
<v Speaker 1>And here, you can see we're actually using,

00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:01.030
<v Speaker 1>another

00:46:02.145 --> 00:46:05.665
<v Speaker 1>field from the variant, which is an attachment,

00:46:05.825 --> 00:46:07.585
<v Speaker 1>and that just allows you to to put

00:46:07.585 --> 00:46:08.945
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary JSON

00:46:09.105 --> 00:46:11.025
<v Speaker 1>in the variant response.

00:46:11.265 --> 00:46:12.945
<v Speaker 1>And that's where we're actually getting the prompt

00:46:12.945 --> 00:46:14.945
<v Speaker 1>from is that that JSON response.

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:17.520
<v Speaker 1>So you can actually change the

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.080
<v Speaker 1>well, if it wasn't in re only mode,

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:24.160
<v Speaker 1>you could actually change the

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:25.120
<v Speaker 1>the

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:28.560
<v Speaker 1>prompt within Flipt without having to redeploy your

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:28.960
<v Speaker 1>application,

00:46:29.945 --> 00:46:32.265
<v Speaker 1>which would then change the behavior that the

00:46:32.425 --> 00:46:34.025
<v Speaker 1>that OpenAI is

00:46:35.305 --> 00:46:36.905
<v Speaker 1>getting. Nice. So

00:46:37.545 --> 00:46:38.025
<v Speaker 1>yeah.

00:46:40.505 --> 00:46:43.465
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Anything else to demo, or what goes

00:46:43.465 --> 00:46:44.265
<v Speaker 0>back into Big Facebook?

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:48.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. George, did you wanna demo

00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:49.180
<v Speaker 1>the

00:46:49.579 --> 00:46:52.220
<v Speaker 1>OCI or do I don't know. I

00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:53.579
<v Speaker 2>mean, I could do I could do a

00:46:53.579 --> 00:46:54.060
<v Speaker 2>quick

00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:56.220
<v Speaker 2>run through of

00:46:56.619 --> 00:46:59.875
<v Speaker 2>sort of running Flipt with, an OCI registry

00:46:59.875 --> 00:47:01.315
<v Speaker 2>instead. That's

00:47:01.795 --> 00:47:03.395
<v Speaker 0>Happy to see it. Yeah. Let's do it.

00:47:03.555 --> 00:47:05.555
<v Speaker 2>See it. Let's do it. Alright. Bear with

00:47:05.555 --> 00:47:07.795
<v Speaker 2>me. Make sure I'm on the right

00:47:09.954 --> 00:47:10.675
<v Speaker 2>screen.

00:47:11.155 --> 00:47:12.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay. Let me share my screen.

00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:14.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. So as we said,

00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:19.630
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna make me I'm gonna have to

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:21.630
<v Speaker 2>go through that same dance sign that Mark

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:22.990
<v Speaker 2>did, obviously.

00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:24.030
<v Speaker 2>Bear with me.

00:47:24.885 --> 00:47:26.325
<v Speaker 0>I'll get the joke. So

00:47:26.725 --> 00:47:27.845
<v Speaker 2>I'll be right back.

00:47:35.045 --> 00:47:37.205
<v Speaker 0>I've asked OpenAI to tell me a joke

00:47:37.205 --> 00:47:39.285
<v Speaker 0>about feature flags for a five year old.

00:47:39.285 --> 00:47:41.180
<v Speaker 0>Are you strapped in? Ready?

00:47:41.339 --> 00:47:42.380
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Why

00:47:42.859 --> 00:47:45.579
<v Speaker 0>why did the computer go to the circus?

00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:48.779
<v Speaker 0>Because it wanted to see amazing feature flags

00:47:48.779 --> 00:47:50.220
<v Speaker 0>perform their magical trick.

00:47:55.855 --> 00:47:57.055
<v Speaker 1>No. That's

00:47:57.775 --> 00:47:59.535
<v Speaker 1>I don't I don't get it. Open AI.

00:47:59.535 --> 00:48:00.415
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.

00:48:00.735 --> 00:48:03.135
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I I don't think it under undersized

00:48:03.135 --> 00:48:04.255
<v Speaker 0>jokes. Yeah.

00:48:07.135 --> 00:48:08.575
<v Speaker 0>Much like my five year old daughter.

00:48:09.309 --> 00:48:10.270
<v Speaker 2>Can

00:48:10.829 --> 00:48:13.710
<v Speaker 2>you can you hear me? Yes. We can.

00:48:14.029 --> 00:48:15.950
<v Speaker 2>I see. I can't hear David now. Sounds

00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:17.309
<v Speaker 2>weird. But I can see that you can

00:48:17.309 --> 00:48:19.550
<v Speaker 2>hear David. This is very confusing.

00:48:20.029 --> 00:48:21.470
<v Speaker 1>How can it's wild.

00:48:23.895 --> 00:48:25.415
<v Speaker 1>Do you want me to translate? Or

00:48:26.215 --> 00:48:27.415
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. You relay.

00:48:27.495 --> 00:48:29.735
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. Relay. There you go. That's it.

00:48:33.415 --> 00:48:35.289
<v Speaker 2>Can you see my screen? I can't see

00:48:35.289 --> 00:48:36.570
<v Speaker 2>anyone. Yes. So

00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:38.490
<v Speaker 2>let me move it a bit smaller. Then

00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:39.849
<v Speaker 2>maybe I can see other people. I know

00:48:39.849 --> 00:48:41.849
<v Speaker 2>because then I get the horrible Yeah. Like,

00:48:41.849 --> 00:48:42.890
<v Speaker 2>horrible windows.

00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:45.849
<v Speaker 1>Can you, yeah, increase it?

00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:48.730
<v Speaker 2>Let's go big.

00:48:49.049 --> 00:48:49.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That's good.

00:48:51.505 --> 00:48:52.945
<v Speaker 2>And then let me go

00:48:55.825 --> 00:48:57.505
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna create my own

00:48:58.785 --> 00:49:01.025
<v Speaker 2>directory just to demonstrate this. So, yeah,

00:49:01.745 --> 00:49:04.465
<v Speaker 2>as I said, we recently added an OCI

00:49:04.465 --> 00:49:05.745
<v Speaker 2>back end

00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:07.420
<v Speaker 2>for Flipt.

00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:10.540
<v Speaker 2>The purpose here was

00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:12.620
<v Speaker 2>so as we said before, our Git back

00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:13.500
<v Speaker 2>end, it

00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:18.300
<v Speaker 2>will sync your source repository in order to,

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:19.420
<v Speaker 2>like, materialize

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:20.380
<v Speaker 2>its state.

00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:23.615
<v Speaker 2>And that's great, especially for, like, getting Flipt

00:49:23.615 --> 00:49:24.495
<v Speaker 2>up and running,

00:49:24.975 --> 00:49:26.975
<v Speaker 2>really quick because all you need is a

00:49:26.975 --> 00:49:29.695
<v Speaker 2>GitHub repo and Flipt as a container, and

00:49:29.695 --> 00:49:32.175
<v Speaker 2>then you're, like you've got everything you need,

00:49:32.415 --> 00:49:34.415
<v Speaker 2>with the clients to sort of build your

00:49:34.415 --> 00:49:35.215
<v Speaker 2>end to end setup.

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.440
<v Speaker 2>But, like, where that might eventually,

00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:40.920
<v Speaker 2>like,

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:44.520
<v Speaker 2>you know, have some issues with scale is

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:46.920
<v Speaker 2>if you're constantly cloning your repository and say

00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:49.080
<v Speaker 2>you want to have your feature flags defined

00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:51.080
<v Speaker 2>in line with your code in a site

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:52.680
<v Speaker 2>like a Monoreto repo setup.

00:49:53.325 --> 00:49:54.045
<v Speaker 2>Obviously,

00:49:54.605 --> 00:49:55.725
<v Speaker 2>Flipt's performance

00:49:55.805 --> 00:49:57.325
<v Speaker 2>starts to do a grade

00:49:57.724 --> 00:49:59.325
<v Speaker 2>with the sort of scale of the repository

00:49:59.325 --> 00:50:02.365
<v Speaker 2>there or something. So if that repository gets

00:50:02.365 --> 00:50:03.645
<v Speaker 2>really big, then it takes a little bit

00:50:03.645 --> 00:50:05.405
<v Speaker 2>longer for Flipt's to have to, like,

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:08.020
<v Speaker 2>start up and clone initially.

00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:09.619
<v Speaker 2>And then if you've also got, like, a

00:50:09.619 --> 00:50:10.260
<v Speaker 2>large

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:12.660
<v Speaker 2>sort of flow of contributions into that Git

00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:13.300
<v Speaker 2>repo,

00:50:13.619 --> 00:50:14.340
<v Speaker 2>then

00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:18.455
<v Speaker 2>then all of that becomes work that has

00:50:18.455 --> 00:50:19.815
<v Speaker 2>to go through to keep in sync that

00:50:19.815 --> 00:50:21.015
<v Speaker 2>might not be relevant.

00:50:21.415 --> 00:50:23.335
<v Speaker 2>And also maybe from, like, a security perspective,

00:50:23.335 --> 00:50:25.735
<v Speaker 2>maybe you don't wanna give Flipt an entire

00:50:25.735 --> 00:50:26.695
<v Speaker 2>repository

00:50:27.095 --> 00:50:28.935
<v Speaker 2>and all of its contents. Maybe you're really

00:50:28.935 --> 00:50:30.535
<v Speaker 2>interested in just giving it, like, what it

00:50:30.535 --> 00:50:32.640
<v Speaker 2>cares about, which is, flag state. Can you

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:35.280
<v Speaker 0>hear me yet, George? So OCI kind of

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:36.720
<v Speaker 2>presents a nice

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:40.720
<v Speaker 2>way to sort of solve your own problems.

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:44.319
<v Speaker 2>And

00:50:44.845 --> 00:50:47.485
<v Speaker 2>it obviously requires an extra component. You need,

00:50:47.485 --> 00:50:49.645
<v Speaker 2>like, an OCI registry.

00:50:50.365 --> 00:50:52.285
<v Speaker 2>But once you add that,

00:50:53.005 --> 00:50:54.765
<v Speaker 2>Flipt comes with all the pieces you need

00:50:54.765 --> 00:50:55.325
<v Speaker 2>to, like

00:50:56.045 --> 00:50:58.045
<v Speaker 2>you'd leverage that registry.

00:50:58.045 --> 00:50:59.885
<v Speaker 2>And now that registries are so

00:51:00.849 --> 00:51:02.370
<v Speaker 2>prevalent and so available,

00:51:02.530 --> 00:51:05.490
<v Speaker 2>especially for folks that are already, you in

00:51:05.490 --> 00:51:08.130
<v Speaker 2>containerized environments, they've got you've usually got access

00:51:08.130 --> 00:51:08.770
<v Speaker 2>to one.

00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:10.770
<v Speaker 2>It's probably not

00:51:11.330 --> 00:51:13.730
<v Speaker 2>a big ask to to then start leveraging

00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:14.770
<v Speaker 2>it for

00:51:16.155 --> 00:51:18.555
<v Speaker 2>for your feature flag state as well. And

00:51:18.555 --> 00:51:21.035
<v Speaker 2>so as I said, we've we've added

00:51:21.515 --> 00:51:23.275
<v Speaker 2>some extra commands

00:51:23.435 --> 00:51:25.435
<v Speaker 2>to the Flipt binary. So this is the

00:51:25.435 --> 00:51:27.675
<v Speaker 2>same binary that is the server

00:51:28.075 --> 00:51:29.620
<v Speaker 2>for Flipt, and

00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:32.660
<v Speaker 2>these commands are all nestled under a sort

00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:34.420
<v Speaker 2>of sub command called bundle.

00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:36.740
<v Speaker 2>And

00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:37.540
<v Speaker 2>this

00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:40.660
<v Speaker 2>allows you to turn a directory full of

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:42.340
<v Speaker 2>feature flag state into

00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:44.995
<v Speaker 2>it's like an OCI bundle that you can

00:51:44.995 --> 00:51:45.955
<v Speaker 2>push to

00:51:46.435 --> 00:51:49.075
<v Speaker 2>to some registry and then run Fliptover.

00:51:49.715 --> 00:51:52.195
<v Speaker 2>So I'll just quickly create one of those

00:51:52.195 --> 00:51:53.795
<v Speaker 2>files you've already seen, like a features dot

00:51:53.795 --> 00:51:54.755
<v Speaker 2>YAML file.

00:51:56.035 --> 00:51:59.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm just gonna make a flag called, like,

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.440
<v Speaker 2>awesome feature.

00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:08.760
<v Speaker 2>Probably doesn't matter. I'll

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:09.560
<v Speaker 2>turn it off for now.

00:52:11.184 --> 00:52:13.105
<v Speaker 2>And I'm gonna, like, turn that into

00:52:14.464 --> 00:52:16.625
<v Speaker 2>into a bundle. So let me just build

00:52:16.625 --> 00:52:18.785
<v Speaker 2>that. I'm just gonna call it my bundle.

00:52:21.025 --> 00:52:22.065
<v Speaker 2>Gonna give it a tag.

00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:25.120
<v Speaker 2>So there is a command to, like, look

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:26.800
<v Speaker 2>at all your bundles. This just builds a

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:28.880
<v Speaker 2>bundle that's local to your machine. You can

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:31.360
<v Speaker 2>actually run Flipt over local bundles, the two,

00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:32.320
<v Speaker 2>if you want to,

00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:35.040
<v Speaker 2>rather than having to go through a registry,

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:36.635
<v Speaker 2>but I think that doesn't really explain anything.

00:52:36.635 --> 00:52:38.474
<v Speaker 2>You can see a bunch of other bundles

00:52:38.474 --> 00:52:40.315
<v Speaker 2>I've built. This is very sort of familiar

00:52:40.315 --> 00:52:42.155
<v Speaker 2>if you're, you know, if you're used using

00:52:42.155 --> 00:52:43.435
<v Speaker 2>a tool like Docker

00:52:43.835 --> 00:52:45.355
<v Speaker 2>and Docker build and things like that.

00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:51.530
<v Speaker 2>So I'm gonna now push that to a

00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:52.330
<v Speaker 2>registry,

00:52:52.330 --> 00:52:52.730
<v Speaker 2>and

00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:56.170
<v Speaker 2>and then I'm gonna run Flipt and use

00:52:56.170 --> 00:52:57.610
<v Speaker 2>that to sort of source it.

00:52:58.010 --> 00:52:58.650
<v Speaker 2>So

00:52:59.290 --> 00:53:02.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna use if anyone's familiar with TTL,

00:53:02.410 --> 00:53:04.785
<v Speaker 2>which is like a femoral

00:53:05.984 --> 00:53:06.785
<v Speaker 2>ephemeral

00:53:06.785 --> 00:53:07.665
<v Speaker 2>registry,

00:53:08.865 --> 00:53:10.305
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna use that to sort of host

00:53:10.305 --> 00:53:11.505
<v Speaker 2>it nice and quickly.

00:53:12.224 --> 00:53:13.185
<v Speaker 2>TTL.

00:53:13.265 --> 00:53:14.385
<v Speaker 2>Shir asks

00:53:14.385 --> 00:53:15.825
<v Speaker 2>that you give them a random

00:53:16.065 --> 00:53:17.105
<v Speaker 2>UUID

00:53:17.425 --> 00:53:19.025
<v Speaker 2>to to push to push to.

00:53:20.890 --> 00:53:22.250
<v Speaker 2>So I'm gonna push

00:53:23.050 --> 00:53:24.170
<v Speaker 2>that bundle

00:53:24.970 --> 00:53:26.090
<v Speaker 2>and

00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:31.130
<v Speaker 2>just give it the UUID, and you can

00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:32.650
<v Speaker 2>give it a time limit, sort of self

00:53:32.650 --> 00:53:33.370
<v Speaker 2>destructing

00:53:36.194 --> 00:53:37.875
<v Speaker 2>self destructing bundle.

00:53:37.954 --> 00:53:39.795
<v Speaker 2>So the next ten minutes will be available

00:53:39.795 --> 00:53:42.035
<v Speaker 2>once once I get it there.

00:53:42.835 --> 00:53:44.275
<v Speaker 2>It's taking a while.

00:53:45.075 --> 00:53:47.910
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot quicker normally. Promise. And now

00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:49.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna I'm

00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:51.670
<v Speaker 2>gonna run Flipt. So I'm just gonna quickly

00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:53.030
<v Speaker 2>run it locally.

00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:56.550
<v Speaker 2>You just need to tell Flipt that we're

00:53:56.550 --> 00:53:57.830
<v Speaker 2>gonna use the

00:53:59.030 --> 00:54:00.069
<v Speaker 2>OCI back end,

00:54:00.755 --> 00:54:02.275
<v Speaker 2>and then we need to tell it, like,

00:54:02.275 --> 00:54:03.875
<v Speaker 2>what repository

00:54:03.875 --> 00:54:05.875
<v Speaker 2>we want to follow. So I'm gonna tell

00:54:05.875 --> 00:54:07.955
<v Speaker 2>it to follow this, like, ten minute

00:54:09.155 --> 00:54:09.555
<v Speaker 1>repo.

00:54:13.269 --> 00:54:14.390
<v Speaker 2>I tell you what it is. I've just

00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:15.270
<v Speaker 2>got too many

00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:17.589
<v Speaker 2>instances of flips running.

00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:19.510
<v Speaker 2>I've made that mistake before.

00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:22.150
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Wow. That was bold on the street.

00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:23.670
<v Speaker 2>And if

00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:24.310
<v Speaker 2>I

00:54:24.789 --> 00:54:26.309
<v Speaker 2>You still got here. Think I said go.

00:54:27.345 --> 00:54:29.984
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. You come back over here. You go

00:54:29.984 --> 00:54:32.465
<v Speaker 2>up to Chrome. Sorry for the infinite

00:54:32.705 --> 00:54:34.065
<v Speaker 2>infinite window.

00:54:34.625 --> 00:54:36.305
<v Speaker 2>Cool. So we can see that we can

00:54:36.305 --> 00:54:37.265
<v Speaker 2>see that flag.

00:54:38.305 --> 00:54:39.984
<v Speaker 2>We could Let me zoom in a little

00:54:39.984 --> 00:54:41.640
<v Speaker 1>bit. Zoom in here.

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:45.319
<v Speaker 2>So we're back here in there. Let me

00:54:45.319 --> 00:54:47.079
<v Speaker 0>change my name. Maybe it'll help him here,

00:54:47.079 --> 00:54:48.760
<v Speaker 1>mate. We could re we could,

00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:51.560
<v Speaker 2>you know, we could update this bundle.

00:54:53.855 --> 00:54:55.934
<v Speaker 2>Let's do that. So they have feature flag.

00:54:55.934 --> 00:54:57.055
<v Speaker 0>Can you hear me, George?

00:54:57.855 --> 00:54:59.535
<v Speaker 2>Let's let's

00:54:59.535 --> 00:55:00.815
<v Speaker 2>build the bundle.

00:55:02.015 --> 00:55:03.615
<v Speaker 0>Maybe I should restart Chrome.

00:55:04.575 --> 00:55:05.775
<v Speaker 2>And Flipt is

00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:09.220
<v Speaker 2>configured at the moment with a thirty second

00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:10.980
<v Speaker 2>polling interval,

00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:12.420
<v Speaker 2>so it might take

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:15.460
<v Speaker 2>a minute. You know? Well, not a minute,

00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:18.500
<v Speaker 2>but half half a minute to to see

00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:20.100
<v Speaker 2>that update, but

00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:22.605
<v Speaker 2>you can obviously bring that that polled interval

00:55:22.605 --> 00:55:23.645
<v Speaker 2>down for

00:55:24.845 --> 00:55:25.645
<v Speaker 2>eventually,

00:55:25.645 --> 00:55:26.605
<v Speaker 2>see this come through.

00:55:27.005 --> 00:55:28.765
<v Speaker 2>That's there. So yes. So now you've got,

00:55:28.765 --> 00:55:29.245
<v Speaker 2>like,

00:55:29.725 --> 00:55:30.845
<v Speaker 2>the CLI

00:55:31.885 --> 00:55:34.045
<v Speaker 2>for building bundles and distributing them.

00:55:34.445 --> 00:55:37.010
<v Speaker 2>We think that, yeah, this might help with

00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:39.330
<v Speaker 2>scaling out the GitOps

00:55:40.369 --> 00:55:42.370
<v Speaker 2>sort of workflow for flags.

00:55:42.850 --> 00:55:45.090
<v Speaker 2>Alright. And also you Or do have questions

00:55:45.090 --> 00:55:47.250
<v Speaker 0>when he's ready? We intend to use the

00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:49.410
<v Speaker 2>leverage tags for doing things like

00:55:49.835 --> 00:55:52.474
<v Speaker 2>pushing sort of different versions of flags for

00:55:52.474 --> 00:55:54.555
<v Speaker 2>different environments. So you might use tags for,

00:55:54.555 --> 00:55:57.194
<v Speaker 2>like, you know, long lived staging environments, or

00:55:57.194 --> 00:55:58.875
<v Speaker 2>you might tag them with the commit that

00:55:58.875 --> 00:56:01.194
<v Speaker 2>they're built from and use that for preview

00:56:01.194 --> 00:56:02.875
<v Speaker 2>environments or the branch that you're building on.

00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:06.630
<v Speaker 2>So, yeah, lots of Good George. There.

00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:07.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:11.110
<v Speaker 1>David says you look great, and he

00:56:11.110 --> 00:56:12.470
<v Speaker 1>has questions

00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:13.190
<v Speaker 1>when we

00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:17.285
<v Speaker 2>Amazing. Yes. Alright. So that I don't have

00:56:17.285 --> 00:56:20.565
<v Speaker 0>to translate everything I say through you, Mark.

00:56:20.565 --> 00:56:22.724
<v Speaker 0>If you could ask George maybe just to

00:56:22.724 --> 00:56:24.165
<v Speaker 0>leave and come back and see if it

00:56:24.165 --> 00:56:26.965
<v Speaker 0>helps before we meet with this awkward trip.

00:56:27.525 --> 00:56:30.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. The first question he has is can

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.040
<v Speaker 1>can you leave and come and see

00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:36.320
<v Speaker 1>if that will fix this audio issue? Let's

00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:37.040
<v Speaker 2>do that.

00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:38.480
<v Speaker 2>Be right back.

00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:39.120
<v Speaker 1>K.

00:56:40.525 --> 00:56:42.445
<v Speaker 0>But I have no problem written on my

00:56:42.445 --> 00:56:44.925
<v Speaker 0>questions through you, but, you know, it's kind

00:56:44.925 --> 00:56:45.645
<v Speaker 0>of fun.

00:56:48.845 --> 00:56:50.365
<v Speaker 1>Fun social experiment.

00:56:50.365 --> 00:56:50.845
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:56:52.845 --> 00:56:54.285
<v Speaker 0>It's like a, you know,

00:56:54.605 --> 00:56:56.950
<v Speaker 0>George's partner will broke it up and I'm

00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:59.510
<v Speaker 0>like, can you please tell George? I

00:56:59.510 --> 00:57:00.950
<v Speaker 1>won't be home for dinner. Come get us

00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:01.510
<v Speaker 1>stuck.

00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.630
<v Speaker 0>Hello?

00:57:08.815 --> 00:57:09.615
<v Speaker 0>George?

00:57:11.375 --> 00:57:12.335
<v Speaker 1>No.

00:57:12.655 --> 00:57:14.495
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he muted you. Is that a thing?

00:57:14.495 --> 00:57:16.095
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Did you mute me, George?

00:57:16.975 --> 00:57:18.175
<v Speaker 2>Did I a way to mute?

00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:27.839
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's try this.

00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:29.920
<v Speaker 0>It's very strange there.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.040
<v Speaker 0>Can you hear me?

00:57:32.319 --> 00:57:33.680
<v Speaker 0>And you nope. Nothing?

00:57:36.255 --> 00:57:38.095
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We'll do this the awkward way, but

00:57:38.095 --> 00:57:39.934
<v Speaker 0>we are near the end so it doesn't

00:57:39.934 --> 00:57:40.735
<v Speaker 0>really matter.

00:57:41.295 --> 00:57:43.375
<v Speaker 2>Okay. Yeah. I have I have I have

00:57:43.375 --> 00:57:44.095
<v Speaker 0>no idea

00:57:44.415 --> 00:57:46.095
<v Speaker 0>why you can't hear me, George. So really

00:57:46.095 --> 00:57:46.975
<v Speaker 0>sorry about that.

00:57:47.295 --> 00:57:49.615
<v Speaker 0>But this is really cool. There's a few

00:57:49.615 --> 00:57:52.230
<v Speaker 0>things that I think are really important about

00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:54.150
<v Speaker 0>supporting OCI in this way.

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:55.590
<v Speaker 0>One,

00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:58.550
<v Speaker 0>I really like mono repositories.

00:57:59.030 --> 00:58:00.790
<v Speaker 0>I can't remember if we've had this conversation

00:58:00.790 --> 00:58:02.230
<v Speaker 0>or not in the past.

00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:04.230
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna give you a huge monologue here,

00:58:04.275 --> 00:58:06.115
<v Speaker 0>Mark, and I I wanna hear more. Mark's

00:58:06.115 --> 00:58:06.994
<v Speaker 1>still in the word.

00:58:07.555 --> 00:58:11.555
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Real quick. David David really likes monorepository.

00:58:12.355 --> 00:58:13.315
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.

00:58:13.875 --> 00:58:14.515
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:58:14.914 --> 00:58:15.955
<v Speaker 0>And what

00:58:16.194 --> 00:58:18.035
<v Speaker 0>are the challenges of a monorepository?

00:58:18.035 --> 00:58:20.355
<v Speaker 0>And this comes down to building container artifacts

00:58:20.090 --> 00:58:21.690
<v Speaker 0>and and trying to do get ups, but

00:58:21.690 --> 00:58:22.970
<v Speaker 0>also the same for feature flags with get

00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:24.250
<v Speaker 0>ups. Is that I want my feature flags

00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:26.490
<v Speaker 0>to live next to the code or at

00:58:26.490 --> 00:58:28.250
<v Speaker 0>least in some representation of somebody that was

00:58:28.250 --> 00:58:29.850
<v Speaker 0>to ship the way so the developers can

00:58:29.850 --> 00:58:30.890
<v Speaker 0>understand what's happening. Right?

00:58:32.345 --> 00:58:34.424
<v Speaker 0>When we support OCI, we can actually say

00:58:34.424 --> 00:58:35.865
<v Speaker 0>it's through CICD

00:58:35.865 --> 00:58:38.585
<v Speaker 0>process. We can build an artifact,

00:58:38.744 --> 00:58:40.744
<v Speaker 0>a snapshot of time, and push it somewhere

00:58:40.744 --> 00:58:42.825
<v Speaker 0>that could easily be consumed. And we'll get

00:58:42.825 --> 00:58:44.904
<v Speaker 0>our commits aren't technically the sort of truth.

00:58:44.904 --> 00:58:46.970
<v Speaker 0>I mean, they are. We we just have,

00:58:46.970 --> 00:58:48.569
<v Speaker 0>like, a materialized view that we put into

00:58:48.569 --> 00:58:50.490
<v Speaker 0>OCI. I think that's a really powerful model.

00:58:50.490 --> 00:58:51.850
<v Speaker 0>So that's sweet.

00:58:55.130 --> 00:58:55.690
<v Speaker 1>You said

00:58:56.250 --> 00:58:57.130
<v Speaker 1>so it's all good.

00:58:59.295 --> 00:59:01.615
<v Speaker 2>I really enjoyed watching this back later. I

00:59:01.615 --> 00:59:03.055
<v Speaker 2>get, like, all the context.

00:59:03.615 --> 00:59:05.135
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. George, you could just watch it back

00:59:05.135 --> 00:59:07.135
<v Speaker 0>later. Right? Mark, you could answer my questions

00:59:07.135 --> 00:59:08.255
<v Speaker 0>from now on. I don't wanna speak to

00:59:08.255 --> 00:59:08.575
<v Speaker 0>George. So

00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:12.110
<v Speaker 0>what I'm curious about now is, like, say

00:59:12.110 --> 00:59:13.710
<v Speaker 0>I go all in on this. I wanna

00:59:13.710 --> 00:59:15.870
<v Speaker 0>use Flipt. I wanna use GRPC. I want

00:59:15.870 --> 00:59:17.790
<v Speaker 0>feature flags. I want OCI.

00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:19.870
<v Speaker 0>The these are things that or generally, these

00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:21.790
<v Speaker 0>are things I wanna use yesterday.

00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:24.430
<v Speaker 0>So one of the things that George did

00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:27.285
<v Speaker 0>is he's ran Flipt with the feature back

00:59:27.285 --> 00:59:29.125
<v Speaker 0>end store. I can't remember the flag. Right?

00:59:29.125 --> 00:59:30.725
<v Speaker 0>But he pointed it to an OCI

00:59:30.885 --> 00:59:32.484
<v Speaker 0>artifact including

00:59:32.484 --> 00:59:33.685
<v Speaker 0>the the tag.

00:59:33.925 --> 00:59:38.165
<v Speaker 0>Can I follow as version tag or prefix

00:59:38.165 --> 00:59:40.640
<v Speaker 0>of tags? Like, how do I get updates

00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:41.840
<v Speaker 0>to that? And

00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:43.600
<v Speaker 0>without overriding the tag, can I? Or do

00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:44.800
<v Speaker 0>I just need to accept that I have

00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:45.920
<v Speaker 0>an ephemeral tag?

00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:47.600
<v Speaker 1>Today,

00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:48.320
<v Speaker 1>you cannot.

00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:52.000
<v Speaker 1>It's basically the tags are meant to be,

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.455
<v Speaker 1>like like you said, the source of truth.

00:59:53.455 --> 00:59:55.535
<v Speaker 1>Right? And you would have to update the

00:59:55.535 --> 00:59:56.815
<v Speaker 1>configuration file,

00:59:57.455 --> 00:59:59.935
<v Speaker 1>to say, wanna follow a different tag. Prefix

00:59:59.935 --> 01:00:01.535
<v Speaker 1>tags is a good idea that we haven't

01:00:01.535 --> 01:00:02.175
<v Speaker 1>thought about.

01:00:02.655 --> 01:00:04.655
<v Speaker 1>I mean, obviously, if you use something like

01:00:04.655 --> 01:00:06.980
<v Speaker 1>latest, which is, you know, bad practice,

01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:08.980
<v Speaker 1>but if you keep pushing the latest, it

01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:11.540
<v Speaker 1>Flipt will continuously pull and pull down any

01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:12.180
<v Speaker 1>changes.

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:14.020
<v Speaker 1>But if you're using something like a git

01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:16.579
<v Speaker 1>shot to to tag your image, then you're

01:00:16.579 --> 01:00:17.780
<v Speaker 1>just gonna have to update it each time.

01:00:18.215 --> 01:00:20.375
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. A a pattern we see in Kubernetes

01:00:20.375 --> 01:00:21.335
<v Speaker 0>seems to be

01:00:21.895 --> 01:00:23.495
<v Speaker 0>to use semantic versions

01:00:24.055 --> 01:00:26.135
<v Speaker 0>on the tagging. Mhmm. And then the get

01:00:26.135 --> 01:00:28.855
<v Speaker 0>ops controller will resolve that to a SHA

01:00:28.855 --> 01:00:31.589
<v Speaker 0>over every every interval. And so you're then

01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:33.829
<v Speaker 0>you're still deploying to one specific digest, which

01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:34.550
<v Speaker 0>is great.

01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:36.710
<v Speaker 0>But we can opt them to updates on

01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:38.869
<v Speaker 0>a minor or a patch release, but not

01:00:38.869 --> 01:00:40.390
<v Speaker 0>on a major release and stuff. I think

01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:42.470
<v Speaker 0>that kind of semantic some resolver

01:00:43.985 --> 01:00:45.585
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That would be a really cool iteration.

01:00:45.585 --> 01:00:46.865
<v Speaker 0>And it's open source. Right? So if I

01:00:46.865 --> 01:00:48.145
<v Speaker 0>wanna see this, I could just go in

01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:49.585
<v Speaker 0>and hack on some code. Yeah.

01:00:50.145 --> 01:00:52.385
<v Speaker 0>Anyway yeah. Really, really cool. So that's a

01:00:52.385 --> 01:00:53.985
<v Speaker 0>great demo from both of you.

01:00:54.465 --> 01:00:54.785
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna

01:00:55.425 --> 01:00:57.585
<v Speaker 0>just because things are now awkward and George

01:00:57.585 --> 01:00:59.105
<v Speaker 0>is the is their part.

01:01:01.849 --> 01:01:04.010
<v Speaker 1>And I'll just kick it out. It's fine.

01:01:04.329 --> 01:01:05.849
<v Speaker 1>The best, to be honest.

01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:08.730
<v Speaker 0>I'll just do a quick recap then. You

01:01:08.730 --> 01:01:11.049
<v Speaker 0>know, Flipt is a a pretty sweet piece

01:01:11.049 --> 01:01:12.569
<v Speaker 0>of software. It's open source. It's ready to

01:01:12.569 --> 01:01:14.490
<v Speaker 0>go. It's GRPC. It could be performing.

01:01:14.745 --> 01:01:17.145
<v Speaker 0>It provides a strong developer first experience for

01:01:17.145 --> 01:01:18.425
<v Speaker 0>doing feature flagging

01:01:18.985 --> 01:01:21.225
<v Speaker 0>as a single binary that could be deployed

01:01:21.225 --> 01:01:24.025
<v Speaker 0>very easily locally using Terzil was the one

01:01:24.025 --> 01:01:25.225
<v Speaker 0>that stood out to me. Like, I think

01:01:25.225 --> 01:01:26.905
<v Speaker 0>Terzil is such a great product. So, you

01:01:26.905 --> 01:01:28.825
<v Speaker 0>know, do using something like that seems like

01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:31.470
<v Speaker 0>a great idea to me and

01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:34.030
<v Speaker 0>even OCI as well. So lots of different

01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:35.710
<v Speaker 0>opportunities there for me to run this in

01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:38.590
<v Speaker 0>production and be happy and a pretty nice

01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:40.750
<v Speaker 0>SDK front end where I can use generated

01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:42.830
<v Speaker 0>GRPC's in pretty much any language. Right? Because

01:01:42.830 --> 01:01:44.190
<v Speaker 0>it's so ubiquitous now.

01:01:44.925 --> 01:01:47.645
<v Speaker 0>But also a handful of rest full rest

01:01:47.645 --> 01:01:49.005
<v Speaker 0>like I don't even know what the correct

01:01:49.005 --> 01:01:51.165
<v Speaker 0>terminology is anymore. APIs for people that wanna

01:01:51.165 --> 01:01:53.005
<v Speaker 0>go on more traditional route. I mean, throwing

01:01:53.005 --> 01:01:55.245
<v Speaker 0>some GraphQL, you've got everything covered there. Right?

01:01:55.245 --> 01:01:55.725
<v Speaker 0>But

01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:57.730
<v Speaker 0>pretty sweet.

01:01:59.010 --> 01:02:00.770
<v Speaker 1>Mean We're not GraphQL fans.

01:02:01.090 --> 01:02:01.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh,

01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:04.450
<v Speaker 0>that's alright.

01:02:04.690 --> 01:02:07.410
<v Speaker 0>Any last words that you want to share

01:02:07.410 --> 01:02:08.530
<v Speaker 0>and and then

01:02:08.905 --> 01:02:10.665
<v Speaker 0>maybe share a bit more about the the

01:02:10.665 --> 01:02:12.345
<v Speaker 0>road map. Right? We've we've got a snapshot

01:02:12.345 --> 01:02:14.745
<v Speaker 0>now, a good understanding of what Flipt does,

01:02:14.745 --> 01:02:16.265
<v Speaker 0>the problem it solves, where it is today.

01:02:16.265 --> 01:02:17.305
<v Speaker 0>Why don't you tell me a little bit

01:02:17.305 --> 01:02:19.305
<v Speaker 0>more about tomorrow? And feel free to share

01:02:19.305 --> 01:02:20.825
<v Speaker 0>any of it links or

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:24.580
<v Speaker 0>prior profiles. Shameless plug anything that you want.

01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:26.900
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Yep. Great.

01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:28.900
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know if I can actually

01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:31.540
<v Speaker 1>type in chat here, but

01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:33.780
<v Speaker 1>our website is Flipt.io.

01:02:34.815 --> 01:02:37.375
<v Speaker 1>Our repository is Flipt-i0

01:02:37.375 --> 01:02:38.495
<v Speaker 1>on GitHub.

01:02:39.055 --> 01:02:41.695
<v Speaker 1>As David said, there's a number of ways

01:02:41.695 --> 01:02:43.855
<v Speaker 1>you can deploy and run Flipt yourself. We

01:02:43.855 --> 01:02:46.415
<v Speaker 1>support, you know, Docker containers, obviously. We have

01:02:46.415 --> 01:02:47.055
<v Speaker 1>a Helm chart.

01:02:48.450 --> 01:02:51.090
<v Speaker 1>So we're I would say we were cloud

01:02:51.090 --> 01:02:52.130
<v Speaker 1>adjacent.

01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:56.610
<v Speaker 1>We're not not cloud native maybe, but we

01:02:58.450 --> 01:03:01.090
<v Speaker 1>can run pretty much on any infrastructure because

01:03:01.090 --> 01:03:02.835
<v Speaker 1>it's where you can go, and we have

01:03:02.835 --> 01:03:05.635
<v Speaker 1>binaries for almost every architecture that you can

01:03:05.635 --> 01:03:06.355
<v Speaker 1>think of.

01:03:07.395 --> 01:03:08.995
<v Speaker 1>As far as the road map,

01:03:09.635 --> 01:03:12.275
<v Speaker 1>so today, Flipt does all of its evaluation

01:03:12.275 --> 01:03:13.395
<v Speaker 1>server side,

01:03:14.195 --> 01:03:17.420
<v Speaker 1>which is, you know, probably the most common

01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:20.220
<v Speaker 1>pattern that I think most feature flag tools,

01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:22.540
<v Speaker 1>kind of, use.

01:03:23.099 --> 01:03:25.579
<v Speaker 1>But that again, it's it's not great for

01:03:25.579 --> 01:03:26.220
<v Speaker 1>everybody.

01:03:26.619 --> 01:03:28.619
<v Speaker 1>So, like, the mobile use case, for example,

01:03:28.619 --> 01:03:30.925
<v Speaker 1>if you have, you know, a mobile app

01:03:30.925 --> 01:03:33.085
<v Speaker 1>that, you know, the the user might not

01:03:33.085 --> 01:03:34.605
<v Speaker 1>have great network connectivity,

01:03:34.765 --> 01:03:36.365
<v Speaker 1>you don't want everything

01:03:36.525 --> 01:03:38.365
<v Speaker 1>every time the user does something, your mobile

01:03:38.365 --> 01:03:39.724
<v Speaker 1>app to have to reach out over the

01:03:39.724 --> 01:03:41.645
<v Speaker 1>network and evaluate a feature flag.

01:03:42.130 --> 01:03:44.849
<v Speaker 1>So we're actually working on client side evaluation

01:03:44.849 --> 01:03:47.170
<v Speaker 1>as well, client side SDKs,

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:49.570
<v Speaker 1>and so that's where the Rust comes in.

01:03:49.970 --> 01:03:53.490
<v Speaker 1>We are we basically rewrote our evaluation logic

01:03:53.490 --> 01:03:54.130
<v Speaker 1>in Rust,

01:03:55.145 --> 01:03:57.224
<v Speaker 1>and then we're using FFI,

01:03:57.224 --> 01:03:59.545
<v Speaker 1>which is foreign function interface,

01:03:59.545 --> 01:04:00.345
<v Speaker 1>I think. So

01:04:01.625 --> 01:04:04.665
<v Speaker 1>we're creating a a dynamic library that actually

01:04:04.665 --> 01:04:05.785
<v Speaker 1>does evaluation.

01:04:06.105 --> 01:04:08.905
<v Speaker 1>And then the client side SDKs,

01:04:08.905 --> 01:04:11.360
<v Speaker 1>written in Go, TypeScript, Ruby, you know, what

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:13.760
<v Speaker 1>have you, will basically use FFI

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:16.640
<v Speaker 1>to say, okay. I have this context.

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Now do the evaluation Rust library, and then

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:21.040
<v Speaker 1>it will will return a response.

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.760
<v Speaker 1>And so we actually created a new set

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.120
<v Speaker 1>of gRPC,

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:27.135
<v Speaker 1>or an internal API

01:04:27.375 --> 01:04:28.095
<v Speaker 1>to

01:04:28.175 --> 01:04:30.735
<v Speaker 1>take all of the flag state

01:04:31.535 --> 01:04:34.015
<v Speaker 1>that and then the Rust library can

01:04:34.655 --> 01:04:36.575
<v Speaker 1>query that that endpoint,

01:04:36.735 --> 01:04:38.335
<v Speaker 1>get the data that it needs to then

01:04:38.335 --> 01:04:40.175
<v Speaker 1>perform the evaluation client side.

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:43.280
<v Speaker 1>And as you can imagine, it's extremely fast,

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:46.080
<v Speaker 1>you know, client side. And so we're actually

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:47.760
<v Speaker 1>working on that right now. We hope to

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.520
<v Speaker 1>have that open source in the next couple

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:50.160
<v Speaker 1>of weeks.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.880
<v Speaker 1>We're just kinda running into some issues with,

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:54.160
<v Speaker 1>like, how to package

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:54.800
<v Speaker 1>those

01:04:56.184 --> 01:04:58.905
<v Speaker 1>SDKs in the native languages because not all

01:04:58.905 --> 01:05:01.465
<v Speaker 1>of them allow you to easily

01:05:01.545 --> 01:05:02.345
<v Speaker 1>link

01:05:02.744 --> 01:05:04.905
<v Speaker 1>library written in Rust and then push up

01:05:04.905 --> 01:05:06.825
<v Speaker 1>to the package registry. But,

01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:09.460
<v Speaker 1>anyway, so if you have any interest in

01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:11.460
<v Speaker 1>Rust or FFI or,

01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:13.140
<v Speaker 1>you know, integrating

01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:14.500
<v Speaker 1>with other languages,

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:18.820
<v Speaker 1>please drop by our Discord or GitHub repository.

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:20.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:05:21.305 --> 01:05:23.145
<v Speaker 0>Nice. Can you hear me, George?

01:05:24.505 --> 01:05:25.945
<v Speaker 0>Nope. Nope. So

01:05:26.665 --> 01:05:27.305
<v Speaker 0>yeah.

01:05:27.465 --> 01:05:30.185
<v Speaker 0>That was really interesting, actually. This I mean,

01:05:30.185 --> 01:05:31.865
<v Speaker 0>if you had mentioned that sooner, we'd probably

01:05:31.865 --> 01:05:33.305
<v Speaker 0>had about a twenty minute chat on the

01:05:33.305 --> 01:05:35.540
<v Speaker 0>client side of Valuer. But I don't wanna

01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:37.220
<v Speaker 0>keep you too much longer. But it that

01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:38.820
<v Speaker 0>made me wonder, could we be in a

01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:40.260
<v Speaker 0>position six,

01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:42.260
<v Speaker 0>nine, twelve months from now, right, where

01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:44.100
<v Speaker 0>my front end application

01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:45.540
<v Speaker 0>using WebAssembly,

01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:47.780
<v Speaker 0>most likely, just pulls the OCIR effect with

01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:50.675
<v Speaker 0>the flags itself and evaluates everything in browser.

01:05:50.675 --> 01:05:51.555
<v Speaker 0>Or even

01:05:51.795 --> 01:05:53.955
<v Speaker 0>instead of me hosting Flipt somewhere,

01:05:54.275 --> 01:05:56.515
<v Speaker 0>can I just embed it maybe free of

01:05:56.515 --> 01:05:57.635
<v Speaker 0>web assembly again

01:05:57.875 --> 01:06:00.435
<v Speaker 0>into any application and have the evaluator pull

01:06:00.435 --> 01:06:02.115
<v Speaker 0>the OCIR effect for me in a regular

01:06:02.115 --> 01:06:03.860
<v Speaker 0>interval? Like, I have I think that opens

01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:05.140
<v Speaker 0>up a lot of different

01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:07.940
<v Speaker 0>runtime applications for Flipt that we just haven't

01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:09.700
<v Speaker 0>really seen before. I don't know if there's

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:11.380
<v Speaker 0>something that that people would be interested in

01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:12.980
<v Speaker 0>or want. But

01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:14.660
<v Speaker 1>if

01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:17.845
<v Speaker 0>I could, I'd probably try it. Right? Yeah.

01:06:17.925 --> 01:06:18.805
<v Speaker 1>%.

01:06:18.805 --> 01:06:21.205
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I mean and, yeah, not to not

01:06:21.205 --> 01:06:24.005
<v Speaker 1>to make this go any longer, but we

01:06:25.045 --> 01:06:26.805
<v Speaker 1>oh oh, sorry. I didn't mean that in

01:06:26.805 --> 01:06:27.045
<v Speaker 1>negative.

01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:30.800
<v Speaker 1>On the Wasm front,

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:33.600
<v Speaker 1>we have played around with you know how,

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:36.080
<v Speaker 1>like, I showed, I briefly showed, like, configuring

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:38.080
<v Speaker 1>the rules in the UI or, you know,

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:39.440
<v Speaker 1>you can do the same with,

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:40.400
<v Speaker 1>with,

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:41.200
<v Speaker 1>YAML.

01:06:41.495 --> 01:06:43.975
<v Speaker 1>Like, what if users could write their own

01:06:43.975 --> 01:06:45.495
<v Speaker 1>evaluation rules

01:06:45.495 --> 01:06:47.895
<v Speaker 1>in a language of their choice? Those compiled

01:06:47.895 --> 01:06:49.735
<v Speaker 1>to Wasm. The evaluator

01:06:49.735 --> 01:06:53.015
<v Speaker 1>then prox out to that that evaluation time.

01:06:53.015 --> 01:06:56.055
<v Speaker 1>So you're not limited to just the the

01:06:56.790 --> 01:06:58.950
<v Speaker 1>the pieces that we expose in our UI.

01:06:58.950 --> 01:07:00.710
<v Speaker 1>You can use, you know, any language to

01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:02.950
<v Speaker 1>define your rules and your rollout strategy.

01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:05.270
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I'm gonna push this a little bit

01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:07.030
<v Speaker 0>longer because there's too much here. But this

01:07:07.030 --> 01:07:08.470
<v Speaker 0>is not your roadmap roadshow for

01:07:09.875 --> 01:07:11.795
<v Speaker 0>Just because you're talking about using languages to

01:07:11.795 --> 01:07:14.115
<v Speaker 0>define what those evaluations are. Right? We're talking

01:07:14.115 --> 01:07:15.155
<v Speaker 0>about expressions

01:07:15.155 --> 01:07:16.915
<v Speaker 0>and, like, you're writing in Go, which means

01:07:16.915 --> 01:07:18.515
<v Speaker 0>you're probably in quite a nice position to

01:07:18.515 --> 01:07:20.675
<v Speaker 0>support something like Sell, like the common expression

01:07:20.675 --> 01:07:24.089
<v Speaker 0>language, allowing people to rate arbitrary queries against

01:07:24.089 --> 01:07:25.450
<v Speaker 0>that as well. And I think I've just

01:07:25.530 --> 01:07:27.289
<v Speaker 0>there's just so many ideas, man. I could

01:07:27.289 --> 01:07:28.650
<v Speaker 0>stay here for hours and just talk about

01:07:28.650 --> 01:07:29.770
<v Speaker 0>all the cool things I would like to

01:07:29.770 --> 01:07:32.089
<v Speaker 0>try with this. But I think that is

01:07:32.089 --> 01:07:34.089
<v Speaker 0>definitely a session for another day. So what

01:07:34.089 --> 01:07:35.690
<v Speaker 0>I'll do is we'll we'll look back, right,

01:07:36.275 --> 01:07:38.435
<v Speaker 0>early next year. We'll see where Flipt is

01:07:38.435 --> 01:07:40.355
<v Speaker 0>and and talk about some some fun stuff

01:07:40.355 --> 01:07:41.155
<v Speaker 0>we could do.

01:07:41.555 --> 01:07:43.795
<v Speaker 0>Alright. George, it's been a not so much

01:07:43.795 --> 01:07:45.715
<v Speaker 0>a pleasure, Mark, thank you for joining.

01:07:47.715 --> 01:07:49.475
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for having us, David. We really appreciate

01:07:49.475 --> 01:07:51.620
<v Speaker 1>it. Alright. Now

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:53.060
<v Speaker 0>it's the end.

01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:55.220
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna have the end broadcast button. But

01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:56.340
<v Speaker 0>just to make it a little bit more

01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:58.180
<v Speaker 0>fun, the pause is gonna be held in

01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:00.500
<v Speaker 0>eternity and potentially in the screenshot

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:03.780
<v Speaker 0>for this thumbnail. So as I end, prepare

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:04.180
<v Speaker 0>yourselves,

01:08:04.691 --> 01:08:06.451
<v Speaker 0>stay static, and we'll see you all next

01:08:06.451 --> 01:08:07.091
<v Speaker 0>time. Thanks.
