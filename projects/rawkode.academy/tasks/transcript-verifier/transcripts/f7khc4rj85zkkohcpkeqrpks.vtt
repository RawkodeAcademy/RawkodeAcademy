00:00:25.295 --> 00:00:28.810
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Welcome back. The screen is bright. Rawkode

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.930
<v Speaker 0>Academy shining light. Another Monday,

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.690
<v Speaker 0>live and loud. Joining the cloud native crowd.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.690
<v Speaker 0>Got a new tool on the scene today.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.850
<v Speaker 0>Up bright.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.409
<v Speaker 0>So grab your coffee, settle down. Best tech

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.610
<v Speaker 0>stream in the whole town. Rawkode live is

00:02:07.155 --> 00:02:09.794
<v Speaker 0>on the air with card knowledge we can

00:02:09.794 --> 00:02:12.834
<v Speaker 0>share. Let's get it started. Feel the buzz.

00:02:12.834 --> 00:02:15.395
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Card and K, it's because.

00:02:43.995 --> 00:02:46.075
<v Speaker 1>There's just because it speeds up the oh,

00:02:46.075 --> 00:02:46.555
<v Speaker 1>here we go.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.700
<v Speaker 1>Hello, and welcome back to the Rawkode Academy.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.300
<v Speaker 1>This is Rawkode Live, and I am your

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.940
<v Speaker 1>host, David Flanagan, also known across the Internet

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:55.980
<v Speaker 1>as Rawkode.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.900
<v Speaker 1>And that was the most awkward two minutes

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.740
<v Speaker 1>and fifty seconds of my life because for

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.260
<v Speaker 1>some weird reason, I could not hear the

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.565
<v Speaker 1>music and just had to wait patiently for

00:03:03.565 --> 00:03:04.605
<v Speaker 1>the stinger.

00:03:05.005 --> 00:03:07.085
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately, I have two fantastic guests joining me

00:03:07.085 --> 00:03:08.765
<v Speaker 1>today who kinda filled me in as we

00:03:08.765 --> 00:03:09.405
<v Speaker 1>went.

00:03:10.285 --> 00:03:11.885
<v Speaker 1>Rawkode Live is all about taking a look

00:03:11.885 --> 00:03:13.805
<v Speaker 1>at cloud native technology to make your Kubernetes

00:03:13.805 --> 00:03:15.980
<v Speaker 1>and cloud native lives a little bit easier.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.580
<v Speaker 1>And today, we're taking a look at a

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 1>project from the team

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.780
<v Speaker 1>called and

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.940
<v Speaker 1>guiding us on our journey today.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Two fantastic guests. Hello, Martin, and hello,

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.585
<v Speaker 1>How are you? Good.

00:03:31.465 --> 00:03:34.265
<v Speaker 2>Very good. You know, just let's assume

00:03:34.425 --> 00:03:35.385
<v Speaker 1>the audience

00:03:35.865 --> 00:03:38.025
<v Speaker 1>hasn't met you before. Can you please take

00:03:38.025 --> 00:03:39.465
<v Speaker 1>a minute? We'll start with you, Martin, and

00:03:39.465 --> 00:03:40.905
<v Speaker 1>then move down away just to say hello

00:03:40.905 --> 00:03:42.425
<v Speaker 1>and share anything else you wish to share

00:03:42.425 --> 00:03:43.785
<v Speaker 1>before we kick off this great session.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 2>Sure.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 2>Big fan. I've watched

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.080
<v Speaker 2>quite a few of

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.159
<v Speaker 2>the episodes.

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:52.760
<v Speaker 2>Talk about that later.

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.400
<v Speaker 2>Martin Sadler, I do a lot of things

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.319
<v Speaker 2>with products now over at Morentis.

00:03:58.695 --> 00:04:01.415
<v Speaker 2>Before that, I was at Weaveworks where we

00:04:02.055 --> 00:04:04.855
<v Speaker 2>played with something called GitOps and then helped

00:04:05.895 --> 00:04:07.415
<v Speaker 2>Stefan and team

00:04:07.815 --> 00:04:10.535
<v Speaker 2>get Flex up and running over ControlPlaying

00:04:10.535 --> 00:04:12.535
<v Speaker 2>before hopping over here to Marentis.

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.769
<v Speaker 1>Awesome. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. I've watched a

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.250
<v Speaker 3>lot of, Rawkode Academy stuff.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.889
<v Speaker 3>I mean, I've known David for I think

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.530
<v Speaker 3>five years now since I joined the community.

00:04:26.285 --> 00:04:29.165
<v Speaker 3>I was working at Harness be before that,

00:04:29.165 --> 00:04:32.125
<v Speaker 3>data kiosk data on the Litmus Kiosk project,

00:04:32.125 --> 00:04:35.485
<v Speaker 3>which hopefully graduates soon. But then post that

00:04:35.485 --> 00:04:38.044
<v Speaker 3>last year, I joined Randy

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.560
<v Speaker 3>and the OSPO team at Mirantes,

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.760
<v Speaker 3>Martin, everyone.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.760
<v Speaker 3>And right now, I'm closely working with the

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.920
<v Speaker 3>and communities.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.240
<v Speaker 3>And, again, love what Rawkode has been doing

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.200
<v Speaker 3>for the community.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. Well, you're both far too kind, but

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.440
<v Speaker 1>I really appreciate that. Thank you so much.

00:04:53.815 --> 00:04:55.735
<v Speaker 1>And I appreciate you both taking time out

00:04:55.735 --> 00:04:57.415
<v Speaker 1>of your day to sit down and help

00:04:57.415 --> 00:05:00.215
<v Speaker 1>show me and the audience some awesome technology.

00:05:00.775 --> 00:05:02.615
<v Speaker 1>So we've now said Cordon three times, which

00:05:02.615 --> 00:05:04.535
<v Speaker 1>means that in Candyman style, it should jump

00:05:04.535 --> 00:05:06.055
<v Speaker 1>through the mirror and say hello to the

00:05:06.055 --> 00:05:08.130
<v Speaker 1>audience. But before they do that, they should

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.690
<v Speaker 1>know what they're getting involved with today. Can

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:11.970
<v Speaker 1>one of you or both of you just

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.890
<v Speaker 1>take a minute to explain what the Cordon

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.290
<v Speaker 1>project is and the problem that it solves?

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:18.290
<v Speaker 2>Sure.

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:20.785
<v Speaker 2>I'll take a stab at this one.

00:05:21.185 --> 00:05:24.065
<v Speaker 2>What Cordon is, it is a

00:05:25.745 --> 00:05:26.785
<v Speaker 2>thinking about

00:05:27.185 --> 00:05:29.264
<v Speaker 2>cloud native over the last ten years where

00:05:29.264 --> 00:05:30.465
<v Speaker 2>we've grown,

00:05:31.264 --> 00:05:32.705
<v Speaker 2>complexity has

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.690
<v Speaker 2>continued to just get more and more complex.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.650
<v Speaker 2>Right? We all know this. There's lots of

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.930
<v Speaker 2>tools.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.170
<v Speaker 2>More tools are coming as CNCF

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.090
<v Speaker 2>grows

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.210
<v Speaker 2>at a steady state,

00:05:46.105 --> 00:05:49.385
<v Speaker 2>And that's very good. The challenge comes in

00:05:49.385 --> 00:05:52.185
<v Speaker 2>when you try to then glue those things

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:52.745
<v Speaker 2>together.

00:05:53.305 --> 00:05:55.545
<v Speaker 2>So the concept of Cordant,

00:05:56.104 --> 00:05:57.385
<v Speaker 2>it's a play on

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:00.490
<v Speaker 2>Hitchhiker's

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.729
<v Speaker 2>Guide to the Galaxy. So it started off

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:03.450
<v Speaker 2>as

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.370
<v Speaker 2>something called Project 2A.

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:07.210
<v Speaker 2>2A

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.210
<v Speaker 2>is hexadecimal

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.410
<v Speaker 2>four forty two.

00:06:13.395 --> 00:06:15.395
<v Speaker 2>So people were having a a bit of

00:06:15.395 --> 00:06:17.474
<v Speaker 2>a good time. But we were very serious

00:06:17.474 --> 00:06:19.474
<v Speaker 2>about what it was that we wanted to

00:06:19.474 --> 00:06:19.955
<v Speaker 2>do.

00:06:20.275 --> 00:06:21.395
<v Speaker 2>How do we make

00:06:21.634 --> 00:06:22.915
<v Speaker 2>Kubernetes

00:06:24.514 --> 00:06:25.074
<v Speaker 2>flexible,

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:26.760
<v Speaker 2>simple,

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:30.759
<v Speaker 2>still able to do all the complexities that

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:31.639
<v Speaker 2>you wanna do.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.639
<v Speaker 2>And that's what we're doing.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.240
<v Speaker 1>Sure. That's usually with Kubernetes, it's name those

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.080
<v Speaker 1>three things and then pick half of one.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.759
<v Speaker 1>Are you saying that's not the case today?

00:06:41.535 --> 00:06:42.895
<v Speaker 2>I don't know. I I think there's a

00:06:42.895 --> 00:06:44.495
<v Speaker 2>lot of lessons learned that we've been able

00:06:44.495 --> 00:06:46.895
<v Speaker 2>to apply. I'm I'm pretty chuffed with

00:06:47.294 --> 00:06:49.695
<v Speaker 2>where the project is right now. I'm I'm

00:06:49.695 --> 00:06:50.655
<v Speaker 2>pretty happy

00:06:51.055 --> 00:06:52.895
<v Speaker 2>with doing it. I think

00:06:53.375 --> 00:06:54.815
<v Speaker 2>we brought in

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.460
<v Speaker 2>a pretty pretty good team of

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.700
<v Speaker 2>you know, I've got all the the wars,

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.100
<v Speaker 2>the scars, more wounds from from

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.580
<v Speaker 2>Weaveworks with Weave GitOps Enterprise, with Weave Cloud,

00:07:08.125 --> 00:07:10.925
<v Speaker 2>and we have the same thing for MKE,

00:07:10.925 --> 00:07:13.005
<v Speaker 2>you know, the Marantis Kubernetes Engine,

00:07:13.405 --> 00:07:15.085
<v Speaker 2>Harness, as you know. So

00:07:15.725 --> 00:07:17.565
<v Speaker 2>lots of experience and and trying to think

00:07:17.565 --> 00:07:18.845
<v Speaker 2>about if we had to do this over

00:07:18.845 --> 00:07:20.685
<v Speaker 2>again, how would we do it? And

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:22.050
<v Speaker 2>this is

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.650
<v Speaker 2>our our view of what that looks like

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.010
<v Speaker 2>for Kubernetes.

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:28.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:32.050
<v Speaker 1>So, obviously, the name has that k zero,

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Arden, and and there's another moment as open

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.205
<v Speaker 1>source project called k zeros. How do these

00:07:37.205 --> 00:07:37.685
<v Speaker 1>two

00:07:38.485 --> 00:07:40.965
<v Speaker 1>correlate, work together, compete against each other? How

00:07:40.965 --> 00:07:42.565
<v Speaker 1>how what's the landscape look like from the

00:07:42.565 --> 00:07:45.685
<v Speaker 1>moment as stack? Oh, yeah. Sure. So moment

00:07:45.685 --> 00:07:48.805
<v Speaker 2>as, you know, initially started off with OpenStack.

00:07:49.685 --> 00:07:52.639
<v Speaker 2>And then, you know, as we started getting

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:53.360
<v Speaker 2>into

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.880
<v Speaker 2>cloud native,

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:56.240
<v Speaker 2>we

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.760
<v Speaker 2>started creating products initially around

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.639
<v Speaker 2>MCC

00:08:03.795 --> 00:08:06.195
<v Speaker 2>seven years ago, I believe, maybe eight at

00:08:06.195 --> 00:08:07.155
<v Speaker 2>this point in time.

00:08:07.955 --> 00:08:10.195
<v Speaker 2>You know, we did absorb some of Docker.

00:08:10.915 --> 00:08:13.075
<v Speaker 2>So we we did that. So we we

00:08:13.075 --> 00:08:13.795
<v Speaker 2>had,

00:08:14.675 --> 00:08:18.195
<v Speaker 2>a platform based around Swarm. So that's MKE

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:21.410
<v Speaker 2>three today. So it's we still provide it.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:22.690
<v Speaker 2>It's still in demand.

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:26.210
<v Speaker 2>The next release of MKE is MKE four,

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:28.850
<v Speaker 2>and that one is is Kubernetes based.

00:08:31.009 --> 00:08:32.770
<v Speaker 2>But it is it is a different

00:08:34.215 --> 00:08:36.535
<v Speaker 2>product set trying to do different things.

00:08:37.895 --> 00:08:39.414
<v Speaker 2>And then we also have,

00:08:39.655 --> 00:08:40.855
<v Speaker 2>k z r s.

00:08:42.775 --> 00:08:44.215
<v Speaker 2>I'll talk about that a little bit more

00:08:44.215 --> 00:08:46.615
<v Speaker 2>in-depth because it is really a core component

00:08:46.615 --> 00:08:47.255
<v Speaker 2>of

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.560
<v Speaker 2>Cordant.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.400
<v Speaker 2>Our we have another product called MSR, and

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.280
<v Speaker 2>that's Harbor.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
<v Speaker 2>And we we, you know, do a lot

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.760
<v Speaker 2>of upstream work there. So

00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.600
<v Speaker 2>pretty broad,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.280
<v Speaker 2>grouping of products.

00:09:02.305 --> 00:09:03.105
<v Speaker 2>What

00:09:03.345 --> 00:09:04.945
<v Speaker 2>Cordon is trying to do

00:09:05.345 --> 00:09:06.065
<v Speaker 2>is

00:09:08.145 --> 00:09:10.385
<v Speaker 2>create a template by design.

00:09:11.105 --> 00:09:13.585
<v Speaker 2>Right? So take everything that we do, and

00:09:13.585 --> 00:09:16.145
<v Speaker 2>the inspiration is not something that we invented.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.020
<v Speaker 2>Inspiration comes from

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.140
<v Speaker 2>really smart things everybody did before. So for

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:21.780
<v Speaker 2>example,

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:26.260
<v Speaker 2>Cluster API, foundational for us doing that.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.220
<v Speaker 2>We looked at different projects around services

00:09:31.225 --> 00:09:34.985
<v Speaker 2>and how do you capture Kubernetes state.

00:09:35.305 --> 00:09:36.185
<v Speaker 2>And that's

00:09:36.425 --> 00:09:38.985
<v Speaker 2>why we looked at Svelteus and said, This

00:09:38.985 --> 00:09:40.265
<v Speaker 2>is a good way for us to start

00:09:40.265 --> 00:09:41.225
<v Speaker 2>the project.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.180
<v Speaker 2>And then with observability,

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.740
<v Speaker 2>it's really selecting some of the pieces that

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.740
<v Speaker 2>are working really well in the community. So

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:49.940
<v Speaker 2>Victoria Metrics,

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.460
<v Speaker 2>as an example.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.420
<v Speaker 2>Open cost is another one. And then being

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.780
<v Speaker 2>able to put this together

00:09:57.125 --> 00:09:58.885
<v Speaker 2>into three components:

00:09:59.285 --> 00:10:00.885
<v Speaker 2>Kubernetes Cluster Manager,

00:10:01.524 --> 00:10:04.325
<v Speaker 2>Kubernetes State Management, and then Kubernetes

00:10:04.325 --> 00:10:06.005
<v Speaker 2>Observability and FinOps.

00:10:06.005 --> 00:10:08.325
<v Speaker 2>So those are the three pillars.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.860
<v Speaker 2>And it's all template based. So instead of,

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.660
<v Speaker 2>for your cluster deployments,

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.100
<v Speaker 2>you would

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.380
<v Speaker 2>typically have, what, six, seven YAML files that

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.540
<v Speaker 2>you probably have to edit and work on.

00:10:24.785 --> 00:10:27.425
<v Speaker 2>We take that, create a template of it,

00:10:27.825 --> 00:10:29.505
<v Speaker 2>and now it's one YAML file.

00:10:29.825 --> 00:10:30.465
<v Speaker 2>Well,

00:10:30.785 --> 00:10:33.585
<v Speaker 2>it's it's one YAML file, but it is

00:10:33.585 --> 00:10:34.465
<v Speaker 2>still

00:10:34.545 --> 00:10:35.425
<v Speaker 2>compliant.

00:10:35.425 --> 00:10:38.065
<v Speaker 2>It still, you know, follows the APIs,

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:41.970
<v Speaker 2>is well understood.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.050
<v Speaker 2>There's not a new language to learn,

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:46.130
<v Speaker 2>and and you can and you can go

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:46.770
<v Speaker 2>with it.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.410
<v Speaker 2>I'll I'll show some diagrams here in a

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.050
<v Speaker 2>second. But we're trying to apply that theory

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:53.170
<v Speaker 2>across the board.

00:10:53.995 --> 00:10:57.515
<v Speaker 2>And the foundation of that today is K0S,

00:10:57.515 --> 00:10:59.675
<v Speaker 2>so our Kubernetes distribution,

00:11:01.115 --> 00:11:02.795
<v Speaker 2>our open source distribution.

00:11:03.915 --> 00:11:06.475
<v Speaker 2>It's formally just gone into the CNCF.

00:11:06.475 --> 00:11:07.675
<v Speaker 2>We're really happy about that.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.920
<v Speaker 2>And and then we've built on top of

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.519
<v Speaker 2>that. So Cosmetron

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.200
<v Speaker 2>being able to bootstrap

00:11:14.279 --> 00:11:15.880
<v Speaker 2>and then build up from there.

00:11:17.959 --> 00:11:18.760
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. A lot of moving parts,

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.920
<v Speaker 1>but hopefully a lot of complexity

00:11:23.485 --> 00:11:24.285
<v Speaker 1>wrangled.

00:11:24.285 --> 00:11:27.645
<v Speaker 1>I mean, you mentioned the your Mirantis engine

00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:29.805
<v Speaker 1>v three, which was Docker Swarm based. And

00:11:29.965 --> 00:11:33.005
<v Speaker 2>Mhmm. I think back to you know, I

00:11:33.005 --> 00:11:34.045
<v Speaker 1>don't even know when it was. Let's say

00:11:34.045 --> 00:11:35.885
<v Speaker 1>ten years, nine years, something like that.

00:11:36.365 --> 00:11:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Swarm was simple, and it worked.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:42.190
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying Kubernetes is crap because,

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:43.630
<v Speaker 1>you know, it's been a big part of

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:45.230
<v Speaker 1>my career for the last ten years. But

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:46.270
<v Speaker 1>at the same time,

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:48.510
<v Speaker 1>it's a completely different path and not the

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.190
<v Speaker 1>one I wanted to take back when I

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:52.585
<v Speaker 1>started doing all this stuff. Now yous have

00:11:52.585 --> 00:11:53.865
<v Speaker 1>both been in this space a long time

00:11:53.865 --> 00:11:55.625
<v Speaker 1>too. Like, how how did we end up

00:11:55.625 --> 00:11:59.145
<v Speaker 1>here with this? Everything's configurable. Everything's

00:11:59.225 --> 00:12:01.625
<v Speaker 1>you go template nested in a YAML.

00:12:02.585 --> 00:12:04.185
<v Speaker 1>I don't wanna say a bad word. Right?

00:12:04.185 --> 00:12:06.790
<v Speaker 1>But it's it's not easy. The complexity of

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.550
<v Speaker 1>cloud native is probably at the highest it's

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.230
<v Speaker 1>ever been. And you mentioned the landscape and

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.910
<v Speaker 1>you said it's growing at a steady rate.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:13.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean Yeah. I think it's worth. I

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:15.350
<v Speaker 1>think it's exponential. I mean, every time you

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:17.605
<v Speaker 1>look at that landscape, it's, you know, it's

00:12:17.605 --> 00:12:19.285
<v Speaker 1>just going bigger and bigger and bigger to

00:12:19.285 --> 00:12:20.805
<v Speaker 1>the point where the jokes aren't even funny

00:12:20.805 --> 00:12:23.045
<v Speaker 1>anymore because we can't print it out anymore

00:12:23.045 --> 00:12:24.805
<v Speaker 1>to make the joke. It's too big. So

00:12:24.964 --> 00:12:27.524
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. I I'm just curious. Like, it's

00:12:27.524 --> 00:12:29.365
<v Speaker 1>always important to take a look at projects

00:12:29.365 --> 00:12:30.084
<v Speaker 1>that are trying to

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:33.860
<v Speaker 1>manage the complexity and provide abstractions, opinions, and

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.300
<v Speaker 1>make it easier. Right? And I'm hoping that

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:36.980
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're gonna see today. But I'm

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.100
<v Speaker 1>just curious on,

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:39.940
<v Speaker 1>you know, two people that have been in

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.100
<v Speaker 1>this industry a while, especially in this space.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.575
<v Speaker 1>Like, how did we get here versus what

00:12:44.575 --> 00:12:46.255
<v Speaker 1>was the simple path? I sort of get

00:12:46.255 --> 00:12:46.975
<v Speaker 1>it myself.

00:12:47.295 --> 00:12:48.815
<v Speaker 2>I mean, I I think part of it

00:12:48.815 --> 00:12:51.295
<v Speaker 2>is that Kubernetes is a project of projects

00:12:51.295 --> 00:12:52.255
<v Speaker 2>in a way,

00:12:53.535 --> 00:12:54.095
<v Speaker 2>really,

00:12:54.495 --> 00:12:56.415
<v Speaker 2>and it's a welcoming community too.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:00.830
<v Speaker 2>We could have been very, very strict in

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:02.590
<v Speaker 2>one

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:03.790
<v Speaker 2>function

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:06.670
<v Speaker 2>is only handled by one

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:09.550
<v Speaker 2>of the projects, right? So you'd have Flux

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:11.550
<v Speaker 2>or Argo. You would have

00:13:12.134 --> 00:13:14.454
<v Speaker 2>you know, it's the the the point is

00:13:14.454 --> 00:13:16.615
<v Speaker 2>that we welcomed in so many,

00:13:17.014 --> 00:13:18.935
<v Speaker 2>and we've created all this complexity

00:13:19.255 --> 00:13:21.015
<v Speaker 2>because of it. Right?

00:13:21.654 --> 00:13:22.935
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.600
<v Speaker 2>that's the biggest challenge.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:28.160
<v Speaker 2>I I would actually blame sidecars for a

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.040
<v Speaker 2>lot of this.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.760
<v Speaker 2>But

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.960
<v Speaker 2>we make it incredibly easy for anybody to

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.760
<v Speaker 2>develop

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:36.480
<v Speaker 2>something

00:13:37.454 --> 00:13:38.654
<v Speaker 2>and get it

00:13:40.255 --> 00:13:43.295
<v Speaker 2>functioning and working in Kubernetes, and then

00:13:44.095 --> 00:13:44.894
<v Speaker 2>getting it

00:13:45.535 --> 00:13:46.654
<v Speaker 2>into incubation,

00:13:46.654 --> 00:13:48.014
<v Speaker 2>getting it sandboxed,

00:13:48.014 --> 00:13:48.495
<v Speaker 2>all of that.

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:50.930
<v Speaker 2>So I

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:53.250
<v Speaker 2>think complexity is actually a benefit.

00:13:53.889 --> 00:13:55.010
<v Speaker 2>It's diversity,

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:59.410
<v Speaker 2>but it's gotten very, very complex.

00:14:00.209 --> 00:14:01.570
<v Speaker 1>You're right. I I think that was a

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:03.225
<v Speaker 1>great line. I'm gonna steal that one, actually.

00:14:03.225 --> 00:14:04.904
<v Speaker 1>I'm I'll rephrase it slightly, but, you know,

00:14:04.904 --> 00:14:06.665
<v Speaker 1>what was it you said? Complexity

00:14:06.665 --> 00:14:08.105
<v Speaker 1>is is choice.

00:14:08.904 --> 00:14:10.425
<v Speaker 1>You know, we have the freedom to swap

00:14:10.425 --> 00:14:12.505
<v Speaker 1>out any single component of a Kubernetes cluster

00:14:12.505 --> 00:14:14.505
<v Speaker 1>that we can. As you said, multiple get

00:14:14.505 --> 00:14:17.519
<v Speaker 1>out providers, multiple service mesh providers, multiple logging

00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:19.760
<v Speaker 1>and open telemetry back end, all this stuff.

00:14:19.839 --> 00:14:21.200
<v Speaker 1>We have so much choice.

00:14:21.759 --> 00:14:22.720
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes

00:14:22.959 --> 00:14:25.120
<v Speaker 1>when you're learning this stuff, you need someone's

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.000
<v Speaker 1>opinions to guide you. So with that,

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.079
<v Speaker 1>do you want to share some screens and

00:14:30.079 --> 00:14:31.680
<v Speaker 1>examples of what we're gonna be looking at

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.255
<v Speaker 1>today with Cardan, or do you want me

00:14:33.255 --> 00:14:35.655
<v Speaker 1>to dive straight into the documentation and talk

00:14:35.655 --> 00:14:37.255
<v Speaker 1>about it as we go? What's your preference?

00:14:37.255 --> 00:14:40.455
<v Speaker 2>No. Let me let me actually share Yeah.

00:14:40.455 --> 00:14:41.335
<v Speaker 1>Of course, man.

00:14:41.735 --> 00:14:43.015
<v Speaker 2>An overview.

00:14:43.815 --> 00:14:44.935
<v Speaker 2>Nothing ready here.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:46.660
<v Speaker 2>Where did

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:52.899
<v Speaker 2>I can find my

00:14:54.259 --> 00:14:55.220
<v Speaker 2>slides.

00:15:02.205 --> 00:15:04.765
<v Speaker 3>Think as Martin finds out his

00:15:05.245 --> 00:15:07.485
<v Speaker 3>I mean, shares his screen and shares his

00:15:07.485 --> 00:15:09.645
<v Speaker 3>slides, I would like to add something to

00:15:09.725 --> 00:15:12.220
<v Speaker 3>what we were discussing about the landscape and

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.900
<v Speaker 3>how complex it has become.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.180
<v Speaker 3>I think,

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.140
<v Speaker 3>to be honest, the community or we as

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.140
<v Speaker 3>as a whole, as an entity is to

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:23.260
<v Speaker 3>be blamed to make the landscape more complex

00:15:23.745 --> 00:15:25.825
<v Speaker 3>because, you know, a lot of things that

00:15:25.825 --> 00:15:26.945
<v Speaker 3>Kubernetes

00:15:27.025 --> 00:15:29.025
<v Speaker 3>helped resolve and provided

00:15:30.145 --> 00:15:32.945
<v Speaker 3>in itself created those complexities.

00:15:32.945 --> 00:15:34.625
<v Speaker 3>And I believe as a community, we were

00:15:34.625 --> 00:15:36.800
<v Speaker 3>not able to resolve it or because we

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.880
<v Speaker 3>were so conflicted, we moved on to make

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.880
<v Speaker 3>so many more projects.

00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:43.360
<v Speaker 3>And every aspect or every

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.920
<v Speaker 3>problem that Kubernetes threw

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.080
<v Speaker 3>to the community, it had to become a

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.160
<v Speaker 3>separate project. That is how

00:15:50.665 --> 00:15:53.705
<v Speaker 3>the whole landscape of the business has grown

00:15:53.705 --> 00:15:55.545
<v Speaker 3>and everyone has come up with their own

00:15:55.545 --> 00:15:56.745
<v Speaker 3>project. And as,

00:15:57.145 --> 00:15:59.785
<v Speaker 3>you know, Martin spoke of that Flux and

00:15:59.785 --> 00:16:02.185
<v Speaker 3>Orgo or maybe, you know, each and every

00:16:02.185 --> 00:16:03.945
<v Speaker 3>project is

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:05.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean, there's different

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:07.050
<v Speaker 3>service meshes,

00:16:07.449 --> 00:16:08.250
<v Speaker 3>policy,

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:10.170
<v Speaker 3>resilience,

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:12.010
<v Speaker 3>testing, incident management,

00:16:12.089 --> 00:16:13.050
<v Speaker 3>storage,

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:13.850
<v Speaker 3>DNS.

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:16.329
<v Speaker 3>So I I still feel that a lot

00:16:16.329 --> 00:16:18.010
<v Speaker 3>of it could have maybe become

00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:22.545
<v Speaker 3>part of the Kubernetes community itself or could

00:16:22.545 --> 00:16:24.945
<v Speaker 3>have been resolved with special interest groups.

00:16:25.585 --> 00:16:28.545
<v Speaker 3>But then, again, people focused more on expanding

00:16:28.545 --> 00:16:29.745
<v Speaker 3>the landscape.

00:16:30.385 --> 00:16:32.305
<v Speaker 3>And although as as as I agree with

00:16:32.305 --> 00:16:34.785
<v Speaker 3>David where, you know, choice

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:37.630
<v Speaker 3>makes the community diverse

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:40.589
<v Speaker 3>or makes it, like, better, but I I

00:16:40.589 --> 00:16:42.350
<v Speaker 3>I still feel that, you know,

00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:45.790
<v Speaker 3>it it it'll keep growing because, you know,

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:46.430
<v Speaker 3>there are

00:16:46.855 --> 00:16:50.615
<v Speaker 3>multiple projects coming in, people separating from communities

00:16:50.615 --> 00:16:53.495
<v Speaker 3>and building their own projects, try basically trying

00:16:53.495 --> 00:16:56.055
<v Speaker 3>to create problems for Kubernetes to,

00:16:56.375 --> 00:16:57.815
<v Speaker 3>again, solve them.

00:16:58.375 --> 00:17:00.695
<v Speaker 3>That's that's how things look right now.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.040
<v Speaker 3>And that is where, you know, you'll you'll

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.440
<v Speaker 3>see more things getting conceptualized

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.839
<v Speaker 3>even what we are talking about, Codent as

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:08.640
<v Speaker 3>a tool.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.200
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people are talking about platform

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.240
<v Speaker 3>engineering today, which I believe existed forever, but

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.240
<v Speaker 3>now it has become a niche or

00:17:16.585 --> 00:17:18.425
<v Speaker 3>in itself a concept.

00:17:19.225 --> 00:17:22.025
<v Speaker 3>So, yeah, I I personally feel that it

00:17:22.025 --> 00:17:24.425
<v Speaker 3>will keep growing and we'll see more sub

00:17:24.425 --> 00:17:27.145
<v Speaker 3>projects becoming concepts and then maybe

00:17:27.465 --> 00:17:28.745
<v Speaker 3>becoming one

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.080
<v Speaker 3>added conference

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.440
<v Speaker 3>or topic or colocated

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.640
<v Speaker 3>event for

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.080
<v Speaker 3>a KubeCon,

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.360
<v Speaker 3>you could say.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. Yeah. With that, I'll I'll Yeah. You're

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.360
<v Speaker 1>%

00:17:41.025 --> 00:17:42.705
<v Speaker 1>Correct. Right? I mean and this isn't even

00:17:42.705 --> 00:17:44.865
<v Speaker 1>a new problem. How many distributions of Linux

00:17:44.865 --> 00:17:46.945
<v Speaker 1>do we have? How many configuration management tools

00:17:46.945 --> 00:17:48.625
<v Speaker 1>did we have in the early two thousands?

00:17:48.625 --> 00:17:49.105
<v Speaker 1>Like,

00:17:49.745 --> 00:17:51.665
<v Speaker 1>developers just like to hack on stuff, and

00:17:51.665 --> 00:17:53.745
<v Speaker 1>then you've gotta find out which one's the

00:17:53.745 --> 00:17:54.945
<v Speaker 1>right one and which one's the wrong one.

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:56.530
<v Speaker 1>Did

00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:59.250
<v Speaker 1>you find your slides? Yeah. I did. I'm

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.410
<v Speaker 2>trying to see if I can share the

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:02.210
<v Speaker 2>screen.

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:04.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh, fingers crossed.

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I always

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:10.210
<v Speaker 2>be careful about sharing. See if that does

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:10.850
<v Speaker 2>that actually work?

00:18:11.545 --> 00:18:13.945
<v Speaker 1>Yes. I see a card and architecture overview,

00:18:13.945 --> 00:18:16.025
<v Speaker 1>not your bank details. So I'm gonna hop

00:18:16.025 --> 00:18:16.585
<v Speaker 1>over.

00:18:17.065 --> 00:18:19.625
<v Speaker 2>No. It yeah. It's not that. It's

00:18:20.745 --> 00:18:22.025
<v Speaker 2>careful keeping

00:18:22.025 --> 00:18:22.825
<v Speaker 2>your

00:18:23.225 --> 00:18:24.425
<v Speaker 2>slide decks

00:18:24.425 --> 00:18:25.225
<v Speaker 2>in the public

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:28.269
<v Speaker 2>folders of your company because people will

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:32.669
<v Speaker 2>modify them. So fortunately, I had an archive.

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:33.789
<v Speaker 2>So we're fine.

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:37.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm only gonna use this just for visual

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:37.869
<v Speaker 2>cues.

00:18:39.309 --> 00:18:40.669
<v Speaker 2>So that's what I like to do. You

00:18:40.669 --> 00:18:41.710
<v Speaker 2>know, this is a tech

00:18:42.245 --> 00:18:42.965
<v Speaker 2>talk,

00:18:43.525 --> 00:18:46.085
<v Speaker 2>not a sales talk. But I think it's

00:18:46.085 --> 00:18:48.645
<v Speaker 2>very good to sort of try and establish

00:18:48.885 --> 00:18:51.445
<v Speaker 2>what is Cordant today. Cordant today,

00:18:52.645 --> 00:18:53.765
<v Speaker 2>it's essentially

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:54.919
<v Speaker 2>three

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:55.799
<v Speaker 2>pillars:

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.840
<v Speaker 2>your cluster management, your service management,

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.320
<v Speaker 2>and your observability.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.559
<v Speaker 2>And the way that you can think about

00:19:03.559 --> 00:19:05.480
<v Speaker 2>it is very much,

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.865
<v Speaker 2>what is a cluster? That's what KCM solves,

00:19:08.865 --> 00:19:10.945
<v Speaker 2>right? So it does the provisioning.

00:19:11.825 --> 00:19:13.905
<v Speaker 2>It manages the lifecycle.

00:19:14.385 --> 00:19:17.505
<v Speaker 2>We use CAPI because we're not reinventing anything

00:19:17.505 --> 00:19:19.985
<v Speaker 2>new. We're sticking as close to open source

00:19:19.985 --> 00:19:20.545
<v Speaker 2>as possible.

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:25.380
<v Speaker 2>It also does some of the initial integration

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:27.140
<v Speaker 2>work.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.860
<v Speaker 2>The second one is

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.700
<v Speaker 2>our state, so

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:33.780
<v Speaker 2>coordinate

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.060
<v Speaker 2>state management.

00:19:35.495 --> 00:19:38.215
<v Speaker 2>And this is what runs on the cluster.

00:19:38.215 --> 00:19:39.415
<v Speaker 2>So what's

00:19:39.415 --> 00:19:40.855
<v Speaker 2>actually running inside of it? And we have

00:19:40.855 --> 00:19:43.655
<v Speaker 2>a concept of something called VJET services.

00:19:45.975 --> 00:19:46.855
<v Speaker 2>But essentially,

00:19:47.015 --> 00:19:48.375
<v Speaker 2>is Kiverno running in it?

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:50.540
<v Speaker 2>Is

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:51.580
<v Speaker 2>NGINX

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:54.620
<v Speaker 2>Ingress in it? All of these different components,

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:55.899
<v Speaker 2>that's a responsibility

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.340
<v Speaker 2>for KSM.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:58.539
<v Speaker 2>And then

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.460
<v Speaker 2>what are my clusters? How are they performing

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.315
<v Speaker 2>and how much is it costing me? That's

00:20:04.315 --> 00:20:05.434
<v Speaker 2>the third pillar.

00:20:06.235 --> 00:20:06.875
<v Speaker 2>And

00:20:07.115 --> 00:20:08.075
<v Speaker 2>those three

00:20:09.115 --> 00:20:11.275
<v Speaker 2>combined with the catalog, because everybody has a

00:20:11.275 --> 00:20:12.955
<v Speaker 2>catalog these days, pretty useful,

00:20:14.475 --> 00:20:15.674
<v Speaker 2>really forms

00:20:15.915 --> 00:20:17.915
<v Speaker 2>what Cortant is for us.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:21.300
<v Speaker 2>And the way that we do this is

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:21.940
<v Speaker 2>we

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:24.260
<v Speaker 2>just focusing in on

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:28.180
<v Speaker 2>something like, the cluster management here,

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.380
<v Speaker 2>we've

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.100
<v Speaker 2>taken

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:33.860
<v Speaker 2>the

00:20:34.555 --> 00:20:37.275
<v Speaker 2>cluster API, and we've created templates

00:20:37.595 --> 00:20:39.434
<v Speaker 2>for as many of the common

00:20:40.155 --> 00:20:41.515
<v Speaker 2>CAPI providers

00:20:41.915 --> 00:20:43.035
<v Speaker 2>that we believe

00:20:43.435 --> 00:20:45.515
<v Speaker 2>everybody wants to to have.

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:48.770
<v Speaker 2>Cordon, again, you know, it's less than a

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:49.570
<v Speaker 2>year old.

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:51.410
<v Speaker 2>We have

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:52.610
<v Speaker 2>AWS.

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:54.370
<v Speaker 2>We've got Azure. We've got

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:57.330
<v Speaker 2>quite a few. One of the things I

00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:59.010
<v Speaker 2>worked on very, very quickly when I got

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:00.050
<v Speaker 2>here is to make sure that we had

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:01.410
<v Speaker 2>SSH or something,

00:21:01.905 --> 00:21:04.385
<v Speaker 2>so we have that as well. But the

00:21:04.385 --> 00:21:05.664
<v Speaker 2>goal here is

00:21:06.705 --> 00:21:09.585
<v Speaker 2>define everything in a YAML file, which you

00:21:09.585 --> 00:21:11.905
<v Speaker 2>have here. I'm just looking at my screen

00:21:11.905 --> 00:21:14.304
<v Speaker 2>over here. And you can see

00:21:15.345 --> 00:21:16.465
<v Speaker 2>it is

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.000
<v Speaker 2>production cluster template.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.920
<v Speaker 2>The environment is production.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:27.320
<v Speaker 2>We version it so that it's immutable,

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.320
<v Speaker 2>this template, and then you would update the

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.600
<v Speaker 2>version to get to the next one.

00:21:33.725 --> 00:21:36.205
<v Speaker 2>This one specifically is around AWS.

00:21:37.404 --> 00:21:39.325
<v Speaker 2>So it's AWS credentials.

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:42.125
<v Speaker 2>You define all of the VPC,

00:21:42.125 --> 00:21:43.965
<v Speaker 2>CNI, Selium, etcetera.

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:46.390
<v Speaker 2>And that really is

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:49.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean, what is that? Seven YAML files

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:50.790
<v Speaker 2>typically that you touch to be able to

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:51.430
<v Speaker 2>do this?

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:55.110
<v Speaker 2>So that's that's the the idea here in

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:57.350
<v Speaker 2>that you can define these templates

00:21:58.035 --> 00:22:01.315
<v Speaker 2>and then literally swap out AWS

00:22:01.315 --> 00:22:04.435
<v Speaker 2>for Azure or for SSH or for wherever

00:22:04.435 --> 00:22:05.155
<v Speaker 2>it is

00:22:05.955 --> 00:22:07.795
<v Speaker 2>that you that you would like to use

00:22:07.795 --> 00:22:08.674
<v Speaker 2>leverage.

00:22:09.395 --> 00:22:11.475
<v Speaker 2>Fallback is SSH right now.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.279
<v Speaker 2>We've had our first open source contribution

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.639
<v Speaker 2>for Hertzner, I think, for Hertzner.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.399
<v Speaker 2>But, again, if you're gonna be on something

00:22:21.399 --> 00:22:23.559
<v Speaker 2>like Scaleway, we don't have anything yet for

00:22:23.559 --> 00:22:24.039
<v Speaker 2>it,

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.440
<v Speaker 2>but we do have the SSH provider

00:22:26.679 --> 00:22:28.600
<v Speaker 2>to be able to to get you moving.

00:22:30.255 --> 00:22:30.975
<v Speaker 2>Nice.

00:22:31.055 --> 00:22:34.015
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. So that's that is what we've done.

00:22:36.095 --> 00:22:38.735
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting that you mentioned Hetzner and.

00:22:40.175 --> 00:22:41.855
<v Speaker 1>Don't wanna make any assumptions to see where

00:22:41.855 --> 00:22:43.775
<v Speaker 1>you're at in London, but let's assume you

00:22:43.775 --> 00:22:44.015
<v Speaker 1>were.

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:45.470
<v Speaker 1>I was.

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:47.870
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the conversations that were happening

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:49.710
<v Speaker 1>that entire week were

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:50.670
<v Speaker 1>European

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:53.070
<v Speaker 1>people trying to get off of US hypervisors

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:56.750
<v Speaker 1>onto these smaller European clouds. Like, data sovereignty

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:58.590
<v Speaker 1>was a very, very big topic.

00:22:59.555 --> 00:23:01.155
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure AWS and GCP are the one

00:23:01.155 --> 00:23:03.155
<v Speaker 1>that's talking about this, but it it was.

00:23:03.155 --> 00:23:04.355
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people were like, I

00:23:04.355 --> 00:23:06.515
<v Speaker 1>need, you know, scale. We have an ElasticMetal

00:23:06.515 --> 00:23:08.434
<v Speaker 1>project. How do I use it with Kubernetes?

00:23:08.434 --> 00:23:09.955
<v Speaker 1>And the answer right now is the hard

00:23:09.955 --> 00:23:11.875
<v Speaker 1>way. And it's the same with Hertzner's bare

00:23:11.875 --> 00:23:13.475
<v Speaker 1>metal and OVH's bare metal and all these

00:23:13.475 --> 00:23:15.750
<v Speaker 1>other things as well. So Exactly. There there's

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:18.310
<v Speaker 1>a big space right now for these companies

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:20.950
<v Speaker 1>to get involved with these open source projects

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:23.350
<v Speaker 1>that do support CAPI and make their clouds

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:26.310
<v Speaker 1>sustainable for people adopting Kubernetes without all of

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:27.270
<v Speaker 1>the crazy complexity.

00:23:27.904 --> 00:23:29.505
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I I could go off on a

00:23:29.505 --> 00:23:32.144
<v Speaker 2>wild tangent on I I do sound I

00:23:32.144 --> 00:23:34.225
<v Speaker 2>do sound American, but that's only because I

00:23:34.225 --> 00:23:35.584
<v Speaker 2>lived there for twenty years.

00:23:36.304 --> 00:23:38.465
<v Speaker 2>And I've been back fifteen years and I

00:23:38.465 --> 00:23:40.225
<v Speaker 2>still haven't lost the accent. So

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:43.450
<v Speaker 1>I thought you started English. Was like completely

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:46.810
<v Speaker 1>wrong. Oh yeah. No, I'm English. You're

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:47.370
<v Speaker 2>one of the first

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:49.690
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:52.810
<v Speaker 2>no, data sovereignty is a big thing. I

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:55.210
<v Speaker 2>think that one of the challenges that,

00:23:57.445 --> 00:23:58.325
<v Speaker 2>some of the

00:23:58.885 --> 00:24:00.804
<v Speaker 2>cloud providers in Europe have

00:24:01.044 --> 00:24:03.764
<v Speaker 2>is that maybe they lack the scale,

00:24:04.725 --> 00:24:05.605
<v Speaker 2>perceived

00:24:05.605 --> 00:24:07.524
<v Speaker 2>scale. I wouldn't say it's real.

00:24:08.325 --> 00:24:10.885
<v Speaker 2>But there's a challenge in that, well, if

00:24:10.885 --> 00:24:11.445
<v Speaker 2>I

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:14.139
<v Speaker 2>put everything in scale way,

00:24:14.539 --> 00:24:15.499
<v Speaker 2>then how

00:24:16.779 --> 00:24:18.940
<v Speaker 2>do I set something up in The UK,

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:20.859
<v Speaker 2>or how do I do something else?

00:24:21.659 --> 00:24:24.779
<v Speaker 2>Important is because we do this templating,

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.460
<v Speaker 2>it is literally

00:24:27.425 --> 00:24:30.945
<v Speaker 2>changing one YAML file and renaming that service

00:24:30.945 --> 00:24:31.745
<v Speaker 2>template,

00:24:32.304 --> 00:24:33.504
<v Speaker 2>the cluster template,

00:24:33.825 --> 00:24:36.384
<v Speaker 2>to reflect that infrastructure provider.

00:24:37.985 --> 00:24:38.385
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:39.919
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.880
<v Speaker 2>We we've got a lot of interest. A

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.320
<v Speaker 2>lot of people are asking us about how

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.120
<v Speaker 2>to do this.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:48.560
<v Speaker 2>So service templates, same sort of thing. Again,

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.080
<v Speaker 2>you know, the structure is starting to look

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:50.799
<v Speaker 2>familiar.

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.760
<v Speaker 2>Deployment methods, helm charts,

00:24:54.405 --> 00:24:56.485
<v Speaker 2>raw Kubernetes manifests,

00:24:56.565 --> 00:24:58.405
<v Speaker 2>and operator based

00:24:58.405 --> 00:24:59.205
<v Speaker 2>deployments.

00:24:59.205 --> 00:25:01.845
<v Speaker 2>So we support as many as possible.

00:25:03.445 --> 00:25:05.925
<v Speaker 2>We also have a project

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:08.540
<v Speaker 2>called Recustomize

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:10.380
<v Speaker 2>so that if you have

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.580
<v Speaker 2>your clusters handcrafted

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.420
<v Speaker 2>because of your expertise or used

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:18.460
<v Speaker 2>something else,

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:20.940
<v Speaker 2>it will

00:25:21.434 --> 00:25:22.315
<v Speaker 2>extract,

00:25:23.514 --> 00:25:25.594
<v Speaker 2>it will re customize your cluster,

00:25:25.755 --> 00:25:27.835
<v Speaker 2>provide that, and then you can then use

00:25:27.835 --> 00:25:29.034
<v Speaker 2>that to provision

00:25:29.195 --> 00:25:30.634
<v Speaker 2>through KSM

00:25:30.955 --> 00:25:33.835
<v Speaker 2>into your coordinate cluster. So there are ways

00:25:33.835 --> 00:25:34.554
<v Speaker 2>to be able to do it.

00:25:36.179 --> 00:25:36.820
<v Speaker 2>Again,

00:25:37.059 --> 00:25:38.659
<v Speaker 2>immutable versions

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.780
<v Speaker 2>with your upgrade paths, and we'll talk a

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:42.739
<v Speaker 2>little bit about

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:46.100
<v Speaker 2>control and data access and things like that.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:47.940
<v Speaker 2>Configuration management,

00:25:49.655 --> 00:25:51.414
<v Speaker 2>templated values always,

00:25:51.495 --> 00:25:53.174
<v Speaker 2>environmental overrides,

00:25:53.575 --> 00:25:54.294
<v Speaker 2>and then

00:25:55.975 --> 00:25:57.095
<v Speaker 2>drift detection,

00:25:57.895 --> 00:25:59.815
<v Speaker 2>all of the benefits that you get from

00:25:59.815 --> 00:26:02.135
<v Speaker 2>the Svelteos project, because when we started,

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:05.390
<v Speaker 2>we adopted Svelteus

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:06.590
<v Speaker 2>to help us

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:07.630
<v Speaker 2>manage

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:08.750
<v Speaker 2>state.

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:10.510
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean that

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:12.350
<v Speaker 2>you're locked in.

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:14.430
<v Speaker 2>And one of the reasons why

00:26:15.225 --> 00:26:17.144
<v Speaker 2>Svelteus was very appealing,

00:26:17.304 --> 00:26:18.904
<v Speaker 2>at least for me personally,

00:26:19.545 --> 00:26:22.665
<v Speaker 2>was to ensure that we did not lock

00:26:22.665 --> 00:26:24.904
<v Speaker 2>ourselves into either flux

00:26:25.304 --> 00:26:26.985
<v Speaker 2>or into Argo.

00:26:27.465 --> 00:26:28.585
<v Speaker 2>Because depending on

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:31.710
<v Speaker 2>who you are, you might have a preference

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:32.830
<v Speaker 2>for one or the other.

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:34.590
<v Speaker 2>And this is sort of the one of

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:35.870
<v Speaker 2>the core fundamentals

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:37.950
<v Speaker 2>for Cordant

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:39.710
<v Speaker 2>is while Svelteos

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:42.110
<v Speaker 2>handles the management of templates

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:45.364
<v Speaker 2>at the at the

00:26:45.764 --> 00:26:47.924
<v Speaker 2>platform engineering team level,

00:26:48.725 --> 00:26:50.804
<v Speaker 2>one of the service templates is also Flex

00:26:50.804 --> 00:26:53.445
<v Speaker 2>CD. Another of the service templates is Argo

00:26:53.605 --> 00:26:54.324
<v Speaker 2>CD.

00:26:54.725 --> 00:26:55.364
<v Speaker 2>So

00:26:55.764 --> 00:26:59.125
<v Speaker 2>your development teams, your individual clusters

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:03.459
<v Speaker 2>can provide Flex or Argo, right?

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.699
<v Speaker 2>And we're trying to approach it

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:09.219
<v Speaker 2>across the board this way. So another example,

00:27:09.779 --> 00:27:10.659
<v Speaker 2>Kiverno

00:27:10.659 --> 00:27:11.219
<v Speaker 2>or

00:27:12.019 --> 00:27:12.979
<v Speaker 2>OPA

00:27:13.059 --> 00:27:13.940
<v Speaker 2>Gateway,

00:27:14.019 --> 00:27:16.815
<v Speaker 2>right? Gatekeeper, right? Yeah. Gatekeeper. Yeah.

00:27:17.215 --> 00:27:19.134
<v Speaker 2>Would I say gateway? K.

00:27:19.375 --> 00:27:21.855
<v Speaker 2>This is my first computer I ever had.

00:27:22.095 --> 00:27:23.455
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Gatekeeper.

00:27:24.575 --> 00:27:25.054
<v Speaker 2>Those,

00:27:26.335 --> 00:27:27.615
<v Speaker 2>you know, we give choice.

00:27:27.775 --> 00:27:28.095
<v Speaker 2>Right?

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:32.499
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I think that's a very balanced approach.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:33.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean, my

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:35.940
<v Speaker 1>opinion is unless they're a bit spicier. I

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.860
<v Speaker 1>always say if if anyone's using Argo, they're

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.780
<v Speaker 1>using the wrong tool for the wrong reason.

00:27:41.404 --> 00:27:43.325
<v Speaker 1>FluxCD just got so much right that I

00:27:43.325 --> 00:27:44.845
<v Speaker 1>think people need to pay more attention to

00:27:45.005 --> 00:27:46.765
<v Speaker 1>they go to Argo for the UI and

00:27:46.765 --> 00:27:48.365
<v Speaker 1>then don't realize how it works under the

00:27:48.365 --> 00:27:49.965
<v Speaker 1>hood is very different to FluxCD.

00:27:50.205 --> 00:27:51.565
<v Speaker 1>But that that's just my take. You know?

00:27:51.565 --> 00:27:53.404
<v Speaker 1>You get what you want people, but, yeah,

00:27:53.809 --> 00:27:55.009
<v Speaker 1>check your flux.

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:58.130
<v Speaker 2>I think think flux is I think flux

00:27:58.130 --> 00:27:59.730
<v Speaker 2>is very, very good. I'm personally

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:02.289
<v Speaker 2>invested in that thing. So

00:28:04.049 --> 00:28:06.610
<v Speaker 2>I I think I think we'll always have

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:09.250
<v Speaker 2>opinions in Kubernetes, and that's what makes

00:28:10.024 --> 00:28:11.304
<v Speaker 2>Kubernetes

00:28:11.304 --> 00:28:12.264
<v Speaker 2>interesting

00:28:12.345 --> 00:28:15.784
<v Speaker 2>and actually fun to fun to be involved

00:28:15.784 --> 00:28:16.904
<v Speaker 2>in. Right?

00:28:17.784 --> 00:28:20.265
<v Speaker 2>Personal the personal opinion there. Yeah.

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:24.470
<v Speaker 2>I think I think your audience is starting

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:25.830
<v Speaker 2>to pick up the same

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:29.750
<v Speaker 2>thing again here, and that is,

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:32.070
<v Speaker 2>again, it's another template.

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:34.549
<v Speaker 2>It does

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:37.750
<v Speaker 2>you know, focuses in on on metrics

00:28:38.375 --> 00:28:39.734
<v Speaker 2>and logging.

00:28:42.855 --> 00:28:43.815
<v Speaker 2>Cost is

00:28:44.375 --> 00:28:46.855
<v Speaker 2>one of the more complex things, and we're

00:28:46.855 --> 00:28:48.534
<v Speaker 2>working very hard. Right now, we're working with

00:28:48.534 --> 00:28:49.174
<v Speaker 2>the

00:28:49.335 --> 00:28:50.455
<v Speaker 2>open source

00:28:50.774 --> 00:28:52.615
<v Speaker 2>you know, the open cost

00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:53.429
<v Speaker 2>project

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:56.230
<v Speaker 2>and looking at how we actually invest a

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:58.230
<v Speaker 2>little bit in there as well to,

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:00.230
<v Speaker 2>help solve some of the

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:01.909
<v Speaker 2>some of the

00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:06.149
<v Speaker 2>minutiae of of getting your billing data,

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:07.190
<v Speaker 2>into

00:29:07.485 --> 00:29:09.804
<v Speaker 2>into the platform. I mean, you can upload

00:29:10.045 --> 00:29:12.124
<v Speaker 2>as you know, you can upload these things

00:29:12.125 --> 00:29:14.284
<v Speaker 2>with the c CSV file,

00:29:14.605 --> 00:29:16.445
<v Speaker 2>but that means that your data needs to

00:29:16.445 --> 00:29:17.244
<v Speaker 2>be correct.

00:29:18.125 --> 00:29:19.804
<v Speaker 2>And what we'd like to do is be

00:29:19.804 --> 00:29:22.205
<v Speaker 2>able to improve the already great

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:25.039
<v Speaker 2>API support that everybody has out there,

00:29:25.679 --> 00:29:28.239
<v Speaker 2>which make it all that much better. Alright.

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.919
<v Speaker 2>So you got the cluster manager, you've got

00:29:33.919 --> 00:29:36.399
<v Speaker 2>the state management, and you have

00:29:37.725 --> 00:29:39.725
<v Speaker 2>observability. And those are those are sort of

00:29:39.725 --> 00:29:40.524
<v Speaker 2>the three

00:29:40.765 --> 00:29:42.125
<v Speaker 2>the three tiers.

00:29:43.565 --> 00:29:45.725
<v Speaker 1>Nice. So I'll try and recap that in

00:29:45.725 --> 00:29:47.005
<v Speaker 1>one sentence to make sure I've not got

00:29:47.005 --> 00:29:48.685
<v Speaker 1>anything completely wildly inaccurate.

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:51.670
<v Speaker 1>But the three components seem to be responsible

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:54.870
<v Speaker 1>for providing a wrapper around cluster API with

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:56.790
<v Speaker 1>some sort of opinions on how to get

00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:57.429
<v Speaker 1>a

00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:00.630
<v Speaker 1>cluster with less opinions on how to compose

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:02.515
<v Speaker 1>that together. So the opinions are, if you

00:30:02.515 --> 00:30:04.035
<v Speaker 1>need to deploy it to GCP or AWS,

00:30:04.035 --> 00:30:05.075
<v Speaker 1>we've got a template for that, but you

00:30:05.075 --> 00:30:07.154
<v Speaker 1>still get to pack each individual component.

00:30:07.715 --> 00:30:09.554
<v Speaker 1>And then we have the service catalog, which

00:30:09.554 --> 00:30:11.395
<v Speaker 1>allows us to understand what is running in

00:30:11.395 --> 00:30:12.355
<v Speaker 1>each cluster.

00:30:12.675 --> 00:30:15.315
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the observability part saying, okay.

00:30:15.315 --> 00:30:16.755
<v Speaker 1>Are we doing this in a way that

00:30:16.755 --> 00:30:18.110
<v Speaker 1>is efficient, and are we doing this in

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:19.710
<v Speaker 1>a way that isn't gonna bankrupt the business

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:21.630
<v Speaker 1>in six months' time? Because you're trying to

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:24.190
<v Speaker 1>tackle quite a lot of that life cycle

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:25.950
<v Speaker 1>of a Kubernetes cluster,

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:28.029
<v Speaker 1>which is a very ambitious task.

00:30:28.269 --> 00:30:30.505
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Is that close enough to correct? That's

00:30:30.585 --> 00:30:32.905
<v Speaker 2>yeah. That's that's spot on. And I I

00:30:32.905 --> 00:30:34.585
<v Speaker 2>think already you're gonna have,

00:30:36.025 --> 00:30:37.945
<v Speaker 2>you know, some of your audience already call

00:30:37.945 --> 00:30:40.504
<v Speaker 2>out, then how do you actually control

00:30:41.145 --> 00:30:42.825
<v Speaker 2>that environment? And coordinate

00:30:43.465 --> 00:30:44.025
<v Speaker 2>coordinate

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:45.929
<v Speaker 2>is

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:47.610
<v Speaker 2>very much focused on

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:51.370
<v Speaker 2>very much focused on

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:54.409
<v Speaker 2>where'd he go? Very much focused on

00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:56.650
<v Speaker 2>fleets.

00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:58.250
<v Speaker 2>I hate the term fleet.

00:30:58.250 --> 00:30:58.970
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely

00:30:59.290 --> 00:30:59.850
<v Speaker 2>guessed it.

00:31:00.655 --> 00:31:02.735
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is, if you have

00:31:03.135 --> 00:31:06.495
<v Speaker 2>one Kubernetes cluster, two, three, four, you're fine.

00:31:06.655 --> 00:31:08.895
<v Speaker 2>Once you start scaling beyond that, that's when

00:31:08.895 --> 00:31:10.335
<v Speaker 2>you start having issues.

00:31:10.895 --> 00:31:12.015
<v Speaker 2>I think that

00:31:12.495 --> 00:31:14.895
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons why we've overused

00:31:14.895 --> 00:31:15.775
<v Speaker 2>namespaces

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:17.830
<v Speaker 2>is because

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:21.190
<v Speaker 2>it's been so difficult and challenging to actually

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:23.830
<v Speaker 2>run clusters

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:24.789
<v Speaker 2>effectively,

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:28.150
<v Speaker 2>destroy them, bring them back up. So my

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:29.190
<v Speaker 2>preference is

00:31:29.674 --> 00:31:31.995
<v Speaker 2>lots of small clusters, not one big cluster

00:31:31.995 --> 00:31:33.754
<v Speaker 2>with a lot of namespaces in it.

00:31:34.235 --> 00:31:36.475
<v Speaker 2>And Cordant helps you able to do that

00:31:36.475 --> 00:31:38.075
<v Speaker 2>so you can do it very quickly.

00:31:39.674 --> 00:31:41.515
<v Speaker 2>We've spent a lot of time building out

00:31:41.515 --> 00:31:43.274
<v Speaker 2>our RBAC credentials.

00:31:43.515 --> 00:31:45.809
<v Speaker 2>I mean, it's all there on GitHub for

00:31:45.809 --> 00:31:47.009
<v Speaker 2>everyone to view.

00:31:47.809 --> 00:31:49.010
<v Speaker 2>But what

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:50.690
<v Speaker 2>it allows us to do with these templates

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:52.690
<v Speaker 2>is then we can gate these things. So

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:55.570
<v Speaker 2>you have the concept of platform engineering,

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:57.730
<v Speaker 2>and you have the select few in platform

00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:58.609
<v Speaker 2>engineering

00:31:58.929 --> 00:31:59.730
<v Speaker 2>who

00:32:00.485 --> 00:32:03.525
<v Speaker 2>create these templates. They'll create the cluster template.

00:32:03.525 --> 00:32:04.405
<v Speaker 2>They'll create

00:32:04.885 --> 00:32:06.405
<v Speaker 2>the service template

00:32:06.565 --> 00:32:07.525
<v Speaker 2>observability.

00:32:08.485 --> 00:32:11.125
<v Speaker 2>And then your platform

00:32:11.605 --> 00:32:14.565
<v Speaker 2>team would work with the development environment, developer

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:15.769
<v Speaker 2>team.

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:19.610
<v Speaker 2>And then you might only give that development

00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:20.330
<v Speaker 2>team

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:23.610
<v Speaker 2>enough to change one or two of the

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:26.409
<v Speaker 2>variables in your template that they can change.

00:32:29.095 --> 00:32:31.415
<v Speaker 2>And so what that means is that you

00:32:31.415 --> 00:32:34.134
<v Speaker 2>have a way to actually establish control

00:32:35.015 --> 00:32:37.655
<v Speaker 2>of your Kubernetes environment but still be able

00:32:37.655 --> 00:32:38.855
<v Speaker 2>to empower

00:32:39.495 --> 00:32:40.855
<v Speaker 2>development teams,

00:32:41.015 --> 00:32:42.455
<v Speaker 2>DevOps teams

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.919
<v Speaker 2>to be able to, you know,

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:46.119
<v Speaker 2>toggle,

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.960
<v Speaker 2>you know, how many nodes are gonna be

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.080
<v Speaker 2>spun up or

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.720
<v Speaker 2>whatever the context is that you that you

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.640
<v Speaker 2>want to be able to provide them. So

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.640
<v Speaker 2>I think that is also sort of a

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.559
<v Speaker 2>critical piece of Cordant

00:32:57.904 --> 00:33:00.144
<v Speaker 2>that we took a lot of time thinking

00:33:00.144 --> 00:33:00.784
<v Speaker 2>about.

00:33:02.225 --> 00:33:03.024
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:33:03.345 --> 00:33:03.984
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:33:04.385 --> 00:33:06.945
<v Speaker 1>Sweet. I think we've got enough context there

00:33:06.945 --> 00:33:09.105
<v Speaker 1>where we should get hands on, show people

00:33:09.105 --> 00:33:10.945
<v Speaker 1>how to get started, and then take a

00:33:10.945 --> 00:33:11.424
<v Speaker 1>look at some

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:15.030
<v Speaker 1>more concrete examples as we move forward. So

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:16.150
<v Speaker 1>I am

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:21.030
<v Speaker 1>going to share my screen now

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:23.270
<v Speaker 2>Okay. And go to the docs.

00:33:24.805 --> 00:33:27.205
<v Speaker 2>Alright. And I'm gonna follow along.

00:33:28.485 --> 00:33:29.925
<v Speaker 2>My docs here too.

00:33:30.645 --> 00:33:31.365
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:33:32.085 --> 00:33:32.565
<v Speaker 1>And

00:33:33.925 --> 00:33:36.485
<v Speaker 1>there we go. Back over here. Let's get

00:33:36.485 --> 00:33:37.365
<v Speaker 1>my screen up there.

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.520
<v Speaker 1>Really need to find a way to make

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.520
<v Speaker 1>this less clicky

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:44.600
<v Speaker 1>and go.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So I've got .io.

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.640
<v Speaker 1>That is k0rdnt.

00:33:50.175 --> 00:33:52.655
<v Speaker 1>K 0 r d e n t I

00:33:52.655 --> 00:33:53.135
<v Speaker 1>o.

00:33:53.855 --> 00:33:55.455
<v Speaker 1>The links, of course, will be in the

00:33:55.455 --> 00:33:57.055
<v Speaker 1>description after the fact.

00:33:57.535 --> 00:33:59.775
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna click on documentation

00:33:59.855 --> 00:34:02.895
<v Speaker 1>and quick starts, I'm assuming, or if I

00:34:02.895 --> 00:34:04.575
<v Speaker 1>gotta do something Yep. First.

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:06.730
<v Speaker 1>Right. Let's go to let's go to quick

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:07.450
<v Speaker 2>starts.

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:09.929
<v Speaker 1>So we need to get an environment that

00:34:09.929 --> 00:34:12.570
<v Speaker 1>allows us to use Cardan.

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:15.929
<v Speaker 1>We need a Kubernetes cluster for hosting Cardan

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:18.250
<v Speaker 1>itself and a cloud environment to deploy our

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:20.864
<v Speaker 1>workload clusters. I'm just gonna use the CAPI

00:34:20.864 --> 00:34:22.625
<v Speaker 1>terminology here. I don't know if Cardan has

00:34:22.625 --> 00:34:24.705
<v Speaker 1>something of its own. No. We use CAPI.

00:34:24.705 --> 00:34:26.065
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely right.

00:34:26.705 --> 00:34:28.785
<v Speaker 1>And then use Cardan to get that managed

00:34:28.785 --> 00:34:30.305
<v Speaker 1>cluster for us.

00:34:30.465 --> 00:34:30.705
<v Speaker 1>So

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.520
<v Speaker 1>this is where I always regret my choice

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:36.840
<v Speaker 1>of Linux distribution, but hopefully, can get through

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:37.480
<v Speaker 1>this.

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Next. I see it. I've

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:41.560
<v Speaker 2>got a laptop with

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.320
<v Speaker 2>on it.

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't use it that much.

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:46.199
<v Speaker 2>So

00:34:47.454 --> 00:34:48.734
<v Speaker 2>so the first step you have to do

00:34:48.734 --> 00:34:50.094
<v Speaker 2>is you if you see where it says

00:34:50.094 --> 00:34:52.655
<v Speaker 2>quick start, see first set up a management

00:34:52.655 --> 00:34:53.534
<v Speaker 2>cluster.

00:34:54.574 --> 00:34:56.175
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So I could just use

00:34:56.574 --> 00:34:58.734
<v Speaker 1>kind for that. Right? That's what you're suggesting

00:34:58.734 --> 00:35:00.895
<v Speaker 1>here too. Perfect. Alright.

00:35:00.895 --> 00:35:01.454
<v Speaker 1>Let's do

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:04.910
<v Speaker 1>card then. How long?

00:35:05.869 --> 00:35:07.869
<v Speaker 1>I'll run dev in it because, of course,

00:35:07.869 --> 00:35:09.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't actually have any tools installed in

00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:11.070
<v Speaker 1>this wacky box.

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:14.030
<v Speaker 1>But, hopefully, that won't take more than a

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.510
<v Speaker 1>few seconds.

00:35:17.835 --> 00:35:19.115
<v Speaker 1>I mean, there's nothing in it. I don't

00:35:19.115 --> 00:35:20.475
<v Speaker 1>know why it's taking so long.

00:35:20.875 --> 00:35:21.595
<v Speaker 1>Come on.

00:35:26.955 --> 00:35:28.955
<v Speaker 1>I should've ran this twenty minutes ago.

00:35:29.115 --> 00:35:30.599
<v Speaker 1>Alright. There we go.

00:35:31.319 --> 00:35:33.160
<v Speaker 1>And let's pop this open. So for anyone

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:35.000
<v Speaker 1>who's not familiar, dev env is just what

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.480
<v Speaker 1>is next massacre issues because we don't install

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.119
<v Speaker 1>stuff.

00:35:38.519 --> 00:35:41.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna remove all this stuff. We'll send

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.440
<v Speaker 1>this in. That's too much.

00:35:44.815 --> 00:35:45.775
<v Speaker 1>There we go.

00:35:46.335 --> 00:35:48.735
<v Speaker 1>And I'll remove all this nonsense so that

00:35:48.735 --> 00:35:50.735
<v Speaker 1>I'm not polluting your screens with things you

00:35:50.735 --> 00:35:52.415
<v Speaker 1>don't need to pay attention to. So we

00:35:52.415 --> 00:35:53.615
<v Speaker 1>do need some packages

00:35:54.335 --> 00:35:56.255
<v Speaker 1>to have get. I also don't like that

00:35:56.255 --> 00:35:56.735
<v Speaker 1>syntax.

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:00.060
<v Speaker 1>We want kubectl.

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:01.740
<v Speaker 1>We want kind.

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:04.700
<v Speaker 1>We probably need helm. I'm just gonna add

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:06.220
<v Speaker 1>a few things. I don't know if we

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.460
<v Speaker 1>need these, but put them down.

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:11.665
<v Speaker 1>Do I need anything else beyond that? Is

00:36:11.665 --> 00:36:13.984
<v Speaker 1>there a coordinate CLI that I'm going to

00:36:13.984 --> 00:36:14.465
<v Speaker 1>need?

00:36:15.345 --> 00:36:17.505
<v Speaker 2>You you'll you'll do a curl and pull

00:36:17.505 --> 00:36:17.985
<v Speaker 2>it

00:36:18.305 --> 00:36:20.305
<v Speaker 2>down, and it'll it'll

00:36:21.025 --> 00:36:22.945
<v Speaker 2>it'll grab what you need.

00:36:23.585 --> 00:36:24.465
<v Speaker 1>And just

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:26.330
<v Speaker 1>I I will check and see. I I'm

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:28.810
<v Speaker 1>assuming it's not here, but you know? Yeah.

00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:32.010
<v Speaker 1>No. Okay. Maybe we'll we'll add that.

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:34.490
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So that gives me, hopefully, the tools

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:36.810
<v Speaker 1>that I need. Just this mean that I'm

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:38.570
<v Speaker 1>not switching between terminals too much.

00:36:39.635 --> 00:36:41.955
<v Speaker 1>I can start to reload this.

00:36:42.835 --> 00:36:44.435
<v Speaker 1>And I have KubeControl

00:36:44.515 --> 00:36:45.395
<v Speaker 1>helm,

00:36:45.955 --> 00:36:47.155
<v Speaker 1>and I should

00:36:47.635 --> 00:36:49.315
<v Speaker 1>oh, what? I just off.

00:36:51.155 --> 00:36:53.315
<v Speaker 1>I do this every single time. It's the

00:36:53.315 --> 00:36:56.230
<v Speaker 1>wrong helm. Helm and and next is some

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:57.270
<v Speaker 1>weird tool.

00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.790
<v Speaker 1>So I

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:01.430
<v Speaker 1>do that all the time,

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:04.230
<v Speaker 1>which means this has to be Kubernetes helm.

00:37:05.029 --> 00:37:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Like so.

00:37:06.789 --> 00:37:08.069
<v Speaker 1>So if it reloads,

00:37:08.255 --> 00:37:10.335
<v Speaker 1>it should get us the Kubernetes helm, which

00:37:10.335 --> 00:37:12.095
<v Speaker 1>is probably the only thing I don't have

00:37:12.095 --> 00:37:14.895
<v Speaker 1>cached. It's I don't ever use helm. I'm

00:37:14.895 --> 00:37:16.575
<v Speaker 1>not a big fan. But, again, that's a

00:37:16.575 --> 00:37:18.655
<v Speaker 1>space to take for another episode. It's funny.

00:37:18.655 --> 00:37:20.575
<v Speaker 2>I I'm not quite a fan either.

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Kite

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:24.550
<v Speaker 1>cluster.

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:28.310
<v Speaker 1>Create oh, create cluster. Right? There

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:30.550
<v Speaker 1>we go.

00:37:35.715 --> 00:37:37.555
<v Speaker 1>And, hopefully, that won't take too long. What

00:37:37.555 --> 00:37:39.155
<v Speaker 1>we can do in the interim is pop

00:37:39.155 --> 00:37:40.115
<v Speaker 1>back over here.

00:37:41.075 --> 00:37:42.675
<v Speaker 1>My cluster is spinning up.

00:37:43.235 --> 00:37:45.075
<v Speaker 1>We need k zeros.

00:37:46.755 --> 00:37:48.275
<v Speaker 1>Why do I need k zeros?

00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:51.450
<v Speaker 2>It's just to

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:54.570
<v Speaker 2>install the the

00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:58.170
<v Speaker 2>the management cluster. There are other ways to

00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:01.305
<v Speaker 2>doing it of of using something else. Mhmm.

00:38:01.305 --> 00:38:02.825
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to, but it's just this

00:38:02.825 --> 00:38:04.665
<v Speaker 2>is the quick start. So that's why

00:38:05.625 --> 00:38:08.265
<v Speaker 2>in the documentation, we have we have it

00:38:08.265 --> 00:38:09.785
<v Speaker 2>like that. Woo hoo.

00:38:10.984 --> 00:38:12.105
<v Speaker 1>We have a next package.

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:17.990
<v Speaker 1>So let's add k zero CTL.

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.910
<v Speaker 1>Reload.

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:21.510
<v Speaker 1>And that should give us what we need

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:23.350
<v Speaker 1>there. So we have a cluster. We've got

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:24.390
<v Speaker 1>k zeros.

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:26.950
<v Speaker 1>So I don't need to do this,

00:38:27.865 --> 00:38:30.025
<v Speaker 1>but I am gonna have to run

00:38:31.785 --> 00:38:34.025
<v Speaker 1>the k zeros install the controller.

00:38:34.505 --> 00:38:35.145
<v Speaker 1>So

00:38:35.865 --> 00:38:37.305
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious. Why

00:38:37.785 --> 00:38:39.865
<v Speaker 1>does my k zeros, which is gonna deploy

00:38:39.865 --> 00:38:42.585
<v Speaker 1>something to my Kine cluster, require a pseudo

00:38:42.585 --> 00:38:44.480
<v Speaker 1>at the start, or is that just

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.400
<v Speaker 1>over permissive dot?

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:47.200
<v Speaker 2>I think it

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:51.920
<v Speaker 2>you need

00:38:54.079 --> 00:38:56.400
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just being slightly aggressive.

00:38:59.665 --> 00:39:01.425
<v Speaker 1>Oh, wait. Is this the new oh, that's

00:39:01.425 --> 00:39:03.185
<v Speaker 1>not an alternative to a cluster?

00:39:03.744 --> 00:39:04.385
<v Speaker 1>No?

00:39:05.345 --> 00:39:07.025
<v Speaker 1>Kind. Kind create cluster.

00:39:08.224 --> 00:39:09.425
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I'm confused.

00:39:11.744 --> 00:39:13.265
<v Speaker 1>Because we have a get nodes.

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:14.800
<v Speaker 1>It's our

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.320
<v Speaker 1>kind cluster.

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.800
<v Speaker 1>I could use case to spin up another

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:19.520
<v Speaker 1>cluster.

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna skip it just now. We can

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.359
<v Speaker 1>come back. Okay. Let's see. Let's just let's

00:39:25.359 --> 00:39:26.960
<v Speaker 1>think. Let's see maybe the docs saying you

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:29.075
<v Speaker 1>can do one or one or the other

00:39:29.075 --> 00:39:29.715
<v Speaker 1>way

00:39:30.434 --> 00:39:31.155
<v Speaker 1>because

00:39:32.035 --> 00:39:33.954
<v Speaker 1>I don't wanna make too many assumptions. But,

00:39:33.954 --> 00:39:35.635
<v Speaker 1>yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna skip over it.

00:39:35.954 --> 00:39:37.234
<v Speaker 1>We've got kube control.

00:39:37.555 --> 00:39:39.635
<v Speaker 1>We have a kube config. If I need

00:39:39.635 --> 00:39:42.035
<v Speaker 1>to, I can run get nodes. I'm happy.

00:39:43.359 --> 00:39:45.200
<v Speaker 1>Alright. There's Helm. I've done it. I'm not

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.359
<v Speaker 1>happy, but I've done it. Now we want

00:39:47.359 --> 00:39:49.840
<v Speaker 1>to install cord into the cluster.

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:51.680
<v Speaker 1>So

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:53.920
<v Speaker 1>Helm install,

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.680
<v Speaker 1>this is the KCM.

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:56.880
<v Speaker 1>So it's a cluster manager

00:39:57.425 --> 00:39:59.745
<v Speaker 1>deploying from an OCI image

00:40:00.305 --> 00:40:02.865
<v Speaker 1>into a namespace within kind.

00:40:03.185 --> 00:40:03.905
<v Speaker 1>Easy.

00:40:07.825 --> 00:40:08.625
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Here we go.

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:12.470
<v Speaker 1>So this gives us a coordinate management

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:14.550
<v Speaker 1>cluster where we can run and see the

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:17.030
<v Speaker 1>pods running in that namespace.

00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.670
<v Speaker 1>So

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:20.230
<v Speaker 1>give that one more minute

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:23.750
<v Speaker 1>and then check that projects Feltos pods are

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:24.550
<v Speaker 1>running. Nice.

00:40:25.055 --> 00:40:27.135
<v Speaker 1>So I can see here there's Cosmetron. It's

00:40:27.135 --> 00:40:30.015
<v Speaker 1>a KCM cluster manager controller. We've got the

00:40:30.015 --> 00:40:31.855
<v Speaker 1>CAPI stuff running on here.

00:40:32.415 --> 00:40:34.255
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure what CAPI is.

00:40:35.695 --> 00:40:38.735
<v Speaker 1>CAPI. It's a it's

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:41.860
<v Speaker 2>a a VMware Kepc's

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:43.300
<v Speaker 2>VMware.

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:43.780
<v Speaker 2>Right?

00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:47.140
<v Speaker 1>Not sure. And we have the flux source

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:48.020
<v Speaker 1>controllers.

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:48.820
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:51.780
<v Speaker 1>I need faster Internet.

00:40:52.345 --> 00:40:53.305
<v Speaker 1>Come on.

00:40:57.385 --> 00:40:58.505
<v Speaker 2>That's so sure.

00:41:03.865 --> 00:41:05.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't run a Mac anymore. It's been

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:07.480
<v Speaker 1>a long time. But I was always impressed

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:09.240
<v Speaker 1>when home Bruce switched over to use an

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:12.119
<v Speaker 1>OCI for all of their package deliveries. Like

00:41:12.119 --> 00:41:13.480
<v Speaker 1>I said, that was a pretty slick move

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:14.520
<v Speaker 1>by the project.

00:41:14.839 --> 00:41:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh, I think it's I think it's brilliant.

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:19.400
<v Speaker 2>We we

00:41:20.505 --> 00:41:23.145
<v Speaker 2>we're all in on OCI.

00:41:25.065 --> 00:41:25.785
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:41:26.184 --> 00:41:28.665
<v Speaker 1>This looks much more manageable than the docs.

00:41:28.665 --> 00:41:30.265
<v Speaker 1>You know, I'm I'm I don't have a

00:41:30.265 --> 00:41:31.704
<v Speaker 1>CAPP or a CAPP, so I was curious

00:41:31.704 --> 00:41:32.825
<v Speaker 1>to see that there. But I do see

00:41:32.825 --> 00:41:34.744
<v Speaker 1>we've got Valero, so this is the backup

00:41:34.744 --> 00:41:37.410
<v Speaker 1>stuff, the source controller and stuff. But yeah.

00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:41.410
<v Speaker 1>That looks happy. It's running. There's no crashes.

00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:43.170
<v Speaker 1>So

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:48.370
<v Speaker 1>we want to check if we have projects

00:41:52.145 --> 00:41:53.105
<v Speaker 1>Or no.

00:41:56.145 --> 00:41:57.745
<v Speaker 1>Did I do something wrong?

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:05.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm catching up to you. I'm I'm doing

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:07.010
<v Speaker 2>the same thing. Alright.

00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:08.370
<v Speaker 2>And

00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:10.850
<v Speaker 2>Helm is taking forever.

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:12.850
<v Speaker 2>Did that work?

00:42:18.785 --> 00:42:20.224
<v Speaker 1>Not skipped anything.

00:42:20.704 --> 00:42:22.145
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if it's just a

00:42:23.025 --> 00:42:24.145
<v Speaker 1>timing thing.

00:42:24.224 --> 00:42:25.825
<v Speaker 2>You you wouldn't you wouldn't see it in

00:42:26.464 --> 00:42:28.384
<v Speaker 2>you you likely will not see it in

00:42:28.384 --> 00:42:30.625
<v Speaker 2>here. We have to deploy a child cluster

00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:33.030
<v Speaker 2>for SvelteS to really kick in,

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:37.030
<v Speaker 2>and then it'll then it'll pull it.

00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:44.549
<v Speaker 1>Alright. I'm

00:42:44.549 --> 00:42:45.029
<v Speaker 1>just waiting.

00:42:48.194 --> 00:42:50.035
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I was a bit too quick to

00:42:50.035 --> 00:42:52.275
<v Speaker 1>skip the k zeros one.

00:42:55.474 --> 00:42:57.315
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. No. Okay. So it's an alternative

00:42:57.315 --> 00:42:58.515
<v Speaker 1>because under

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.000
<v Speaker 1>here, it says k zeros isn't supported on

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.079
<v Speaker 1>macOS. So you can use kind or you

00:43:03.079 --> 00:43:04.359
<v Speaker 1>can use k zero. Okay. So I would

00:43:04.359 --> 00:43:06.760
<v Speaker 1>try to skip that. We've got kib control.

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:10.440
<v Speaker 1>We did tell Carden.

00:43:12.695 --> 00:43:15.655
<v Speaker 1>I do seem to have a management cluster.

00:43:20.775 --> 00:43:23.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay. We've not deployed KSM yet. So we

00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:25.490
<v Speaker 1>only deployed KCM,

00:43:26.290 --> 00:43:28.530
<v Speaker 1>which tells me maybe this this Yeah. There's

00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:30.610
<v Speaker 1>a step missing here from the documentation. So

00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:32.530
<v Speaker 1>maybe we can just work that out. I

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:34.130
<v Speaker 2>yeah. I think you just continue on, and

00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:34.850
<v Speaker 2>it'll pull it up.

00:43:39.745 --> 00:43:40.545
<v Speaker 1>Let's

00:43:41.585 --> 00:43:43.825
<v Speaker 1>Oh, there we go. Okay. So it's working

00:43:43.825 --> 00:43:45.745
<v Speaker 1>behind the scene. Right? It's just like, it's

00:43:45.745 --> 00:43:47.425
<v Speaker 1>my slow Internet, but we do have a

00:43:47.425 --> 00:43:49.025
<v Speaker 1>project Svelteos namespace,

00:43:49.665 --> 00:43:51.025
<v Speaker 1>which has a whole bunch of con okay.

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:53.300
<v Speaker 1>I am just being far too impatient, and

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:54.020
<v Speaker 1>I should

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:56.100
<v Speaker 1>take a minute.

00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:00.180
<v Speaker 2>Well, my my helm is taking I'm getting

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:01.300
<v Speaker 2>a special word then.

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:04.820
<v Speaker 1>You're hoping I could pay on helm from

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:05.140
<v Speaker 1>source.

00:44:06.345 --> 00:44:07.625
<v Speaker 2>No. No. No.

00:44:08.185 --> 00:44:09.465
<v Speaker 2>No. He's

00:44:09.465 --> 00:44:11.225
<v Speaker 2>on the debug box, so it should be

00:44:11.225 --> 00:44:12.345
<v Speaker 2>super quick.

00:44:13.465 --> 00:44:14.185
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:44:15.545 --> 00:44:17.785
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Let's just mains is running. I'm I'm

00:44:17.785 --> 00:44:20.105
<v Speaker 1>gonna just keep popping down here. So

00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:26.050
<v Speaker 1>we should be able to run get management

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:28.850
<v Speaker 1>and the cluster management's namespace, and it'll tell

00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:31.410
<v Speaker 1>us of our management plan is ready yet,

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:33.170
<v Speaker 1>which ours isn't, which is fair enough because

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:36.105
<v Speaker 1>things are still downloading behind the scenes. Yeah.

00:44:36.105 --> 00:44:37.705
<v Speaker 1>The system data is okay.

00:44:38.905 --> 00:44:40.585
<v Speaker 1>We can run,

00:44:40.745 --> 00:44:43.385
<v Speaker 1>get provider templates to see the providers that

00:44:43.385 --> 00:44:44.105
<v Speaker 1>we have,

00:44:44.825 --> 00:44:46.185
<v Speaker 1>and then we can start to put together

00:44:46.185 --> 00:44:49.625
<v Speaker 1>our first cluster template. So are those available?

00:44:50.349 --> 00:44:52.190
<v Speaker 1>They are. Right. I don't need to wait

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:54.829
<v Speaker 1>for a healthy management cluster, which is nice.

00:44:54.829 --> 00:44:58.349
<v Speaker 1>So we can deploy to AWS, Azure, Docker,

00:44:58.349 --> 00:44:59.150
<v Speaker 1>GCP,

00:45:00.829 --> 00:45:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Cosmetron,

00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:03.069
<v Speaker 1>OpenStack, vSphere, etcetera.

00:45:04.605 --> 00:45:07.085
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. One thing to call out for everyone

00:45:07.085 --> 00:45:09.725
<v Speaker 2>here, we we are renaming it, but the

00:45:09.725 --> 00:45:12.605
<v Speaker 2>the Cosmetron is the SSH provider.

00:45:13.725 --> 00:45:15.645
<v Speaker 1>Ah, right. Nice. Okay. So it's a little

00:45:15.645 --> 00:45:16.365
<v Speaker 2>confusing.

00:45:16.765 --> 00:45:18.045
<v Speaker 2>We're we're fixing that.

00:45:20.319 --> 00:45:23.599
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Running running running running running running running

00:45:23.599 --> 00:45:24.720
<v Speaker 1>running running.

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.000
<v Speaker 1>Capital was still

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:29.839
<v Speaker 1>alright. So it's just a couple of the

00:45:29.839 --> 00:45:32.400
<v Speaker 1>provider controller managers running there. So

00:45:33.515 --> 00:45:35.835
<v Speaker 1>we are getting closer. So why don't we

00:45:35.835 --> 00:45:38.075
<v Speaker 1>start putting together a template?

00:45:39.195 --> 00:45:39.915
<v Speaker 1>So

00:45:39.995 --> 00:45:43.035
<v Speaker 1>we can also list list cluster templates.

00:45:43.035 --> 00:45:44.875
<v Speaker 1>So this is beyond the providers.

00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So there's AWS EKS,

00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:52.710
<v Speaker 1>standalone and hosted, GCP, GKE hosted, and standalone.

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:55.750
<v Speaker 1>What's the difference between GCP hosted and GCP

00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:58.070
<v Speaker 1>standalone? Is that something I should be familiar

00:45:58.070 --> 00:45:59.590
<v Speaker 1>with? Well, I mean, it's it's

00:46:00.625 --> 00:46:03.825
<v Speaker 2>it's it depends on who's who's managing

00:46:04.385 --> 00:46:05.025
<v Speaker 2>those

00:46:05.425 --> 00:46:07.985
<v Speaker 2>nodes. Right? So you have the concept of

00:46:09.345 --> 00:46:10.865
<v Speaker 2>both you know, for example,

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:13.900
<v Speaker 2>AWS,

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:16.140
<v Speaker 2>can run Kubernetes where

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:18.220
<v Speaker 2>you manage the

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:19.820
<v Speaker 2>cluster controller,

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:21.900
<v Speaker 2>the management of

00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:24.380
<v Speaker 2>that cluster, what we call child clusters.

00:46:26.015 --> 00:46:28.255
<v Speaker 2>Or you know? So if it's EKS,

00:46:28.415 --> 00:46:30.335
<v Speaker 2>then the control plane is

00:46:30.495 --> 00:46:32.735
<v Speaker 2>Amazon's EKS control plane

00:46:32.975 --> 00:46:33.935
<v Speaker 2>versus

00:46:36.255 --> 00:46:38.975
<v Speaker 2>if it's, you know, EC two, then it's

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:41.220
<v Speaker 2>our control plane.

00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:43.060
<v Speaker 1>Right. Okay. Gotcha.

00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:45.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I didn't actually notice that. It's it's

00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:48.500
<v Speaker 1>hosted CP and standalone CP. Okay. Exactly.

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:52.900
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So now let's go for I mean,

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:54.714
<v Speaker 1>I'm I'm tempted to be really brave in

00:46:54.714 --> 00:46:57.195
<v Speaker 1>doing your SSH one, but let's try not

00:46:57.195 --> 00:46:59.115
<v Speaker 1>to break things any any

00:46:59.115 --> 00:47:01.195
<v Speaker 1>more than I already have. Yeah. I I

00:47:01.195 --> 00:47:02.715
<v Speaker 2>like the SSH one.

00:47:06.315 --> 00:47:08.395
<v Speaker 1>I mean, it's tempting. I have a

00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:12.310
<v Speaker 1>scale way ElasticMetal machine just sitting there running

00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:14.630
<v Speaker 1>barely anything on it. It's nothing to do.

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:17.030
<v Speaker 2>Right? Yeah. Maybe that'll be something I do

00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:18.950
<v Speaker 1>in my spare time. Let's focus on the

00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:20.070
<v Speaker 1>GCP approach.

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:21.830
<v Speaker 1>I am logged in. I have a project.

00:47:21.945 --> 00:47:24.025
<v Speaker 1>It's my production project, so hopefully nothing too

00:47:24.025 --> 00:47:25.065
<v Speaker 1>bad goes wrong.

00:47:28.505 --> 00:47:30.345
<v Speaker 1>Do I need a service account?

00:47:36.569 --> 00:47:38.089
<v Speaker 2>Then you go to where you are.

00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:42.330
<v Speaker 1>Editor permissions.

00:47:45.609 --> 00:47:46.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean, I could do that.

00:47:50.755 --> 00:47:51.475
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:47:51.875 --> 00:47:52.675
<v Speaker 1>Console.

00:47:54.755 --> 00:47:55.555
<v Speaker 1>Cloud.

00:47:57.475 --> 00:47:59.155
<v Speaker 1>We're just gonna land it on my cloud

00:47:59.155 --> 00:48:00.195
<v Speaker 1>run services.

00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:02.210
<v Speaker 1>I think what I'll do is just because

00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:04.130
<v Speaker 1>it needs editor permission, let's say I'm gonna

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:04.850
<v Speaker 1>create

00:48:06.609 --> 00:48:07.810
<v Speaker 1>a project

00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:10.210
<v Speaker 1>with a service account to minimize the blast

00:48:10.210 --> 00:48:10.609
<v Speaker 1>radius.

00:48:13.415 --> 00:48:14.935
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You can see I'm doing a lot

00:48:14.935 --> 00:48:17.015
<v Speaker 1>of transcription stuff on these videos. In fact,

00:48:17.015 --> 00:48:18.695
<v Speaker 1>here we go. This is actually Timoney with

00:48:18.695 --> 00:48:20.855
<v Speaker 1>Stefan. I just landed on this one absolute

00:48:20.855 --> 00:48:23.415
<v Speaker 1>randomly from the logs, but there you go.

00:48:24.535 --> 00:48:26.615
<v Speaker 1>Joining us in Spirits even if not person.

00:48:27.599 --> 00:48:30.000
<v Speaker 1>So let's switch projects.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.119
<v Speaker 1>Cardents.

00:48:32.079 --> 00:48:34.240
<v Speaker 1>It also means a service account. I can

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:36.079
<v Speaker 1>just if I flash it, it's not a

00:48:36.079 --> 00:48:37.839
<v Speaker 1>big deal, and I can kill the whole

00:48:37.839 --> 00:48:39.200
<v Speaker 1>project. So I like that.

00:48:40.194 --> 00:48:41.475
<v Speaker 2>I've I've already Yeah.

00:48:41.875 --> 00:48:42.835
<v Speaker 2>I've

00:48:42.835 --> 00:48:44.835
<v Speaker 2>already promised Stefan that we'll get to volume

00:48:44.835 --> 00:48:45.635
<v Speaker 2>into.

00:48:45.714 --> 00:48:48.115
<v Speaker 2>So Nice. Such a good project. And if

00:48:48.115 --> 00:48:49.954
<v Speaker 1>Stefan watches this at any point, I still

00:48:49.954 --> 00:48:52.515
<v Speaker 1>want that controller for Flux. Get on it,

00:48:52.515 --> 00:48:53.075
<v Speaker 1>man. Come on.

00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:55.110
<v Speaker 2>Mhmm.

00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.910
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:48:56.869 --> 00:48:58.630
<v Speaker 1>K. I am

00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.790
<v Speaker 1>service

00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:01.670
<v Speaker 1>accounts.

00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:02.550
<v Speaker 1>There we go.

00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Create new

00:49:07.945 --> 00:49:09.385
<v Speaker 1>Header current

00:49:09.385 --> 00:49:10.505
<v Speaker 1>role

00:49:15.225 --> 00:49:18.185
<v Speaker 1>currently is basic header. And there we go.

00:49:18.185 --> 00:49:18.744
<v Speaker 1>Next.

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:22.110
<v Speaker 1>And done.

00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:24.350
<v Speaker 1>Download keys.

00:49:25.869 --> 00:49:26.750
<v Speaker 1>Where am I?

00:49:27.869 --> 00:49:28.430
<v Speaker 1>And

00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:31.470
<v Speaker 1>JSON. Alright. I have a key that should

00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:32.270
<v Speaker 1>be on my desktop.

00:49:32.755 --> 00:49:34.675
<v Speaker 1>Well no. So that's good.

00:49:37.555 --> 00:49:38.915
<v Speaker 1>What do I need to do? I need

00:49:38.915 --> 00:49:41.475
<v Speaker 1>to store this key inside of

00:49:44.515 --> 00:49:46.595
<v Speaker 1>a secret object. So I'm assuming this is

00:49:46.595 --> 00:49:46.915
<v Speaker 1>just

00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:49.990
<v Speaker 1>oh, I'm putting this into my my local

00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:51.830
<v Speaker 1>management cluster. Right. Okay.

00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:53.670
<v Speaker 1>Got it. Got it. Got it.

00:49:54.310 --> 00:49:57.910
<v Speaker 2>You're you're doing the my you're you're a

00:49:58.150 --> 00:50:00.470
<v Speaker 2>live tester for the documentations.

00:50:03.695 --> 00:50:04.975
<v Speaker 1>So

00:50:04.975 --> 00:50:07.855
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna encode these. Oh, I'm in fish.

00:50:07.855 --> 00:50:09.055
<v Speaker 1>Of course, I am.

00:50:09.935 --> 00:50:11.295
<v Speaker 1>It's like I just try to make my

00:50:11.295 --> 00:50:13.695
<v Speaker 1>life harder every single day that I do

00:50:13.695 --> 00:50:14.655
<v Speaker 1>these sessions.

00:50:15.375 --> 00:50:16.975
<v Speaker 1>Sesh doesn't want that there.

00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:20.430
<v Speaker 1>It should be okay. No. Can't do equals.

00:50:21.790 --> 00:50:22.990
<v Speaker 1>You need to do

00:50:24.350 --> 00:50:25.870
<v Speaker 1>set global

00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:28.270
<v Speaker 1>best as equal to this.

00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:50:30.830 --> 00:50:32.030
<v Speaker 1>And then

00:50:34.805 --> 00:50:35.605
<v Speaker 1>we are gonna

00:50:37.125 --> 00:50:38.805
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming this is supposed to gonna get

00:50:38.805 --> 00:50:40.965
<v Speaker 1>you a load straight into the cluster. So

00:50:43.204 --> 00:50:45.125
<v Speaker 1>yes. And no namespace.

00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:51.150
<v Speaker 1>What

00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:54.190
<v Speaker 1>is wrong?

00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:58.510
<v Speaker 2>Alright. So let's see. I'm starting to troubleshoot

00:50:58.510 --> 00:50:59.470
<v Speaker 2>my problem over here.

00:51:02.635 --> 00:51:04.315
<v Speaker 1>I should be able to fix oh, no.

00:51:04.315 --> 00:51:06.475
<v Speaker 1>Bash is not happy either. Alright. I'm gonna

00:51:06.475 --> 00:51:07.515
<v Speaker 1>have to work out how do this in

00:51:07.515 --> 00:51:08.075
<v Speaker 1>fish.

00:51:08.635 --> 00:51:09.435
<v Speaker 1>So

00:51:09.915 --> 00:51:11.915
<v Speaker 1>cat EOF EOF.

00:51:12.075 --> 00:51:13.995
<v Speaker 1>I mean, why does that not work in

00:51:13.995 --> 00:51:16.329
<v Speaker 1>fish? What have I got wrong? The variable

00:51:16.329 --> 00:51:17.770
<v Speaker 1>interpolation is wrong.

00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:25.930
<v Speaker 1>Well, I mean, I just write a YAML

00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:27.530
<v Speaker 1>file. I don't even need to use it

00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:29.210
<v Speaker 1>to it this way. No. I think the

00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:31.335
<v Speaker 1>problem is the space. Well, that shouldn't really

00:51:31.335 --> 00:51:32.295
<v Speaker 1>matter either.

00:51:34.375 --> 00:51:35.895
<v Speaker 1>Why am I so bad at this?

00:51:37.015 --> 00:51:38.935
<v Speaker 2>Because it's live. That's fine.

00:51:40.935 --> 00:51:41.895
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Vem,

00:51:43.089 --> 00:51:44.690
<v Speaker 1>yaml. Yaml.

00:51:44.770 --> 00:51:47.410
<v Speaker 1>So that's that's what we're doing today.

00:51:47.730 --> 00:51:48.290
<v Speaker 1>And

00:51:50.369 --> 00:51:52.530
<v Speaker 1>I will get the value myself.

00:51:54.785 --> 00:51:58.145
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna be horrible and see echo

00:51:58.865 --> 00:52:00.225
<v Speaker 1>what was it called?

00:52:00.385 --> 00:52:01.425
<v Speaker 1>GCP.

00:52:02.705 --> 00:52:05.185
<v Speaker 1>We'll write it straight into yaml. Yaml. And,

00:52:05.185 --> 00:52:05.665
<v Speaker 1>again,

00:52:06.065 --> 00:52:08.225
<v Speaker 1>this project will be deleted momentarily.

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:10.140
<v Speaker 1>So

00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:12.780
<v Speaker 1>not that I think anyone would be able

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:14.940
<v Speaker 1>to see the whole file. And

00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:19.100
<v Speaker 1>oh, don't do that.

00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:22.540
<v Speaker 1>No. That's femme. Why am I?

00:52:24.915 --> 00:52:26.515
<v Speaker 1>And now I've lost the buffer.

00:52:27.955 --> 00:52:28.675
<v Speaker 1>Wonderful.

00:52:34.515 --> 00:52:35.155
<v Speaker 1>There we go.

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:37.760
<v Speaker 1>Whoo.

00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:38.800
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:40.960
<v Speaker 1>Let's apply the YAML dot YAML,

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:42.960
<v Speaker 1>and it's not happy.

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:45.280
<v Speaker 1>Resource name is empty.

00:52:49.494 --> 00:52:50.535
<v Speaker 1>It's not.

00:52:58.695 --> 00:53:00.055
<v Speaker 1>Hey. There's nothing wrong with that.

00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:11.960
<v Speaker 1>Resource name may not be empty.

00:53:15.319 --> 00:53:16.920
<v Speaker 1>Gordon in the chat saying,

00:53:17.675 --> 00:53:19.115
<v Speaker 1>why does it exist?

00:53:21.915 --> 00:53:24.555
<v Speaker 1>More context, please. I've been sorry. I've been

00:53:24.555 --> 00:53:26.234
<v Speaker 1>typing so fast that I'm not sure if

00:53:26.234 --> 00:53:27.515
<v Speaker 1>I've missed something there.

00:53:28.555 --> 00:53:30.075
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if this is Where do I

00:53:30.075 --> 00:53:31.595
<v Speaker 2>see the oh, why does it exist?

00:53:33.579 --> 00:53:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Could it be tabs?

00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:37.500
<v Speaker 1>No.

00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh, it's definitely spaces.

00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Data credentials.

00:53:49.994 --> 00:53:52.075
<v Speaker 1>I must be tripping. That looks fine to

00:53:52.075 --> 00:53:52.555
<v Speaker 1>me.

00:53:57.035 --> 00:53:58.315
<v Speaker 1>No, it's a different error.

00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Unknown failed credentials.

00:54:06.890 --> 00:54:08.650
<v Speaker 1>Well, mean, it's just data. I've gone into

00:54:08.650 --> 00:54:11.690
<v Speaker 1>a secret. API v one, kind of secret,

00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:12.570
<v Speaker 1>metadata,

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:13.690
<v Speaker 1>blah blah blah data.

00:54:15.815 --> 00:54:18.615
<v Speaker 1>That hanging tape is annoying, so let's just

00:54:18.615 --> 00:54:19.655
<v Speaker 1>drop that here.

00:54:24.214 --> 00:54:25.175
<v Speaker 1>Could that

00:54:25.494 --> 00:54:27.415
<v Speaker 1>I mean, it's just one lane. Right? Yeah.

00:54:27.415 --> 00:54:29.575
<v Speaker 1>Because it was stripped down. That's

00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:35.540
<v Speaker 1>component.

00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:39.460
<v Speaker 1>Ah, okay. I think it was just the

00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:40.260
<v Speaker 1>indentation.

00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:42.500
<v Speaker 2>What's that? I think it's just been the

00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:44.339
<v Speaker 1>indentation. And even though I think I'm deleting

00:54:44.339 --> 00:54:46.355
<v Speaker 1>spaces, I don't think I am. Yeah. It's

00:54:46.355 --> 00:54:48.195
<v Speaker 1>making me go through all of these. There's

00:54:48.195 --> 00:54:49.955
<v Speaker 1>just something in the docs that's

00:54:50.435 --> 00:54:51.795
<v Speaker 1>made that a bit weird.

00:54:52.915 --> 00:54:53.955
<v Speaker 1>So I'm assuming

00:54:55.474 --> 00:54:56.675
<v Speaker 2>To get under that too.

00:54:57.170 --> 00:54:59.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I have no idea what I copied.

00:54:59.090 --> 00:55:00.690
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I should have paid more attention or

00:55:00.690 --> 00:55:02.770
<v Speaker 1>turned on my blank white space thingy in

00:55:02.770 --> 00:55:04.610
<v Speaker 1>BIM, but we got it applied.

00:55:05.170 --> 00:55:07.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that was excruciating for people to

00:55:07.090 --> 00:55:07.810
<v Speaker 1>watch. I'm sorry.

00:55:10.575 --> 00:55:12.175
<v Speaker 1>But let's crack on.

00:55:12.415 --> 00:55:14.335
<v Speaker 1>I'm I'm I'm actually having fun. I'm like,

00:55:14.335 --> 00:55:15.695
<v Speaker 1>I've actually got a real smile on my

00:55:15.695 --> 00:55:17.455
<v Speaker 1>face. This is this is good fun.

00:55:17.775 --> 00:55:20.335
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So now that we've got a secret

00:55:20.335 --> 00:55:22.415
<v Speaker 1>created in our cluster, which is for the

00:55:22.415 --> 00:55:24.815
<v Speaker 1>CAPI GCP provider to do the things that

00:55:24.815 --> 00:55:27.020
<v Speaker 1>it has to do, We can now say

00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:28.940
<v Speaker 1>that we want to create a credential

00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:31.340
<v Speaker 1>within the system,

00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:33.340
<v Speaker 1>which just tells it that this provider secret

00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:35.820
<v Speaker 1>exists and it's got enough annotations here to

00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:37.900
<v Speaker 1>say this is how you access it.

00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:38.619
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.

00:55:40.365 --> 00:55:42.765
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sorry for my name and people.

00:55:42.845 --> 00:55:44.205
<v Speaker 1>That is horrendous.

00:55:45.245 --> 00:55:47.165
<v Speaker 1>YAML two has now been applied to my

00:55:47.165 --> 00:55:47.885
<v Speaker 1>cluster.

00:55:49.565 --> 00:55:52.125
<v Speaker 1>And that didn't have the weird spacing issue.

00:55:52.125 --> 00:55:53.405
<v Speaker 1>So we're good.

00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:56.980
<v Speaker 1>Now we've got a config map. This config

00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:57.700
<v Speaker 1>map

00:55:57.859 --> 00:56:00.339
<v Speaker 1>has go templates. I feel sad inside, but

00:56:00.339 --> 00:56:02.580
<v Speaker 1>I'll get over it. Yeah.

00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:08.215
<v Speaker 1>So this is is templates

00:56:10.935 --> 00:56:14.615
<v Speaker 1>that's setting up some secrets for the providers.

00:56:15.815 --> 00:56:16.615
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:56:16.775 --> 00:56:18.615
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna trust it.

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:22.190
<v Speaker 1>And I should just have put all of

00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:23.150
<v Speaker 1>this into

00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:26.510
<v Speaker 1>one YAML with document separators,

00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:28.830
<v Speaker 1>but now I'm going for YAML three. So

00:56:33.070 --> 00:56:33.790
<v Speaker 1>config map.

00:56:35.185 --> 00:56:36.145
<v Speaker 1>Go.

00:56:39.825 --> 00:56:41.025
<v Speaker 1>Oh, that was the.

00:56:42.065 --> 00:56:44.305
<v Speaker 1>This is why you don't use terrible naming.

00:56:46.785 --> 00:56:49.829
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So now I can list regions. I

00:56:49.829 --> 00:56:51.990
<v Speaker 1>know I'm gonna go for Europe West 2.

00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:55.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna need a network.

00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:57.910
<v Speaker 1>Well, it's a new project, so let's see

00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:58.550
<v Speaker 1>what we've got.

00:57:03.685 --> 00:57:05.605
<v Speaker 1>I've got mine configured for my old

00:57:06.485 --> 00:57:08.805
<v Speaker 1>my my production one. So

00:57:10.885 --> 00:57:12.725
<v Speaker 1>I just call it cordant, I think.

00:57:14.090 --> 00:57:17.370
<v Speaker 2>Alright. Cordant is a harmony chord because you

00:57:17.370 --> 00:57:18.330
<v Speaker 2>get harmony,

00:57:18.970 --> 00:57:21.930
<v Speaker 2>and arthro dent. That's where cordant comes from.

00:57:26.810 --> 00:57:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:57:28.955 --> 00:57:31.435
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I never thought about that aspect of

00:57:31.435 --> 00:57:32.875
<v Speaker 1>it. But now that I've created a new

00:57:32.875 --> 00:57:34.555
<v Speaker 1>project, I've got a project, but none of

00:57:34.555 --> 00:57:37.195
<v Speaker 1>the API is disabled. However, I should have

00:57:37.195 --> 00:57:38.395
<v Speaker 1>been able to enable that.

00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:42.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Permission to that.

00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:50.390
<v Speaker 1>Right. Oh, yeah. Okay.

00:57:53.045 --> 00:57:54.965
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Let's just do it from here.

00:57:56.245 --> 00:57:56.565
<v Speaker 1>APIs.

00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:12.300
<v Speaker 1>This rate monitor now is

00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:15.260
<v Speaker 1>frozen. And this is gonna go one of

00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:17.740
<v Speaker 1>two ways because Linux sucks on the desktop.

00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:19.020
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm gonna turn the monitor off and

00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:20.540
<v Speaker 1>back on, and it's gonna freeze this one.

00:58:23.635 --> 00:58:24.755
<v Speaker 1>Hey, Motel.

00:58:25.075 --> 00:58:26.035
<v Speaker 1>Well Yeah.

00:58:28.595 --> 00:58:29.395
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna

00:58:29.795 --> 00:58:30.515
<v Speaker 2>I

00:58:31.714 --> 00:58:33.395
<v Speaker 2>should just buy a Mac, but I can't

00:58:33.395 --> 00:58:35.150
<v Speaker 1>do it. Alright. No. I don't

00:58:35.550 --> 00:58:36.350
<v Speaker 2>I can't.

00:58:37.790 --> 00:58:38.750
<v Speaker 2>It was one of my

00:58:39.550 --> 00:58:41.390
<v Speaker 2>the only sticking point I had.

00:58:41.550 --> 00:58:42.190
<v Speaker 2>Right.

00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:48.350
<v Speaker 1>I love that you can hear me, but

00:58:48.350 --> 00:58:48.910
<v Speaker 1>no.

00:58:51.310 --> 00:58:53.235
<v Speaker 1>Oh. I'm still here. I'm still here. Yeah.

00:58:53.235 --> 00:58:55.235
<v Speaker 1>I thought my computer had just frozen, but

00:58:55.235 --> 00:58:58.035
<v Speaker 1>I'm back. And the other monitor works again.

00:58:59.955 --> 00:59:02.435
<v Speaker 1>Such is life. But I'm glad that wasn't

00:59:02.435 --> 00:59:04.835
<v Speaker 1>me having to reboot my machine to rejoin

00:59:04.915 --> 00:59:05.820
<v Speaker 1>the stream.

00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:09.420
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So APIs and services.

00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:11.660
<v Speaker 1>And

00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:14.540
<v Speaker 1>I should all just turn them on.

00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:19.660
<v Speaker 1>No. Was compute.

00:59:24.785 --> 00:59:27.505
<v Speaker 1>Because this isn't a JKE cluster, we're not

00:59:27.505 --> 00:59:29.665
<v Speaker 1>gonna need the containers API or anything like

00:59:29.665 --> 00:59:31.265
<v Speaker 1>that. So I wonder how far we can

00:59:31.265 --> 00:59:33.825
<v Speaker 1>actually get with just the compute API itself.

00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:37.140
<v Speaker 1>I I probably assume that's maybe all of

00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:38.740
<v Speaker 1>it. There may be, like, the secrets API.

00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:40.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if you're using KMS or

00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:42.820
<v Speaker 1>secrets manager behind the scenes, but I'm gonna

00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:43.700
<v Speaker 1>assume not.

00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:44.500
<v Speaker 1>No.

00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:47.859
<v Speaker 1>Just because there's that as obviously, the KSM

00:59:47.859 --> 00:59:49.940
<v Speaker 1>as well, which will handle some of this

00:59:53.255 --> 00:59:53.975
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:59:54.214 --> 00:59:56.775
<v Speaker 1>Let's try this again for list networks.

00:59:58.135 --> 00:59:59.015
<v Speaker 1>Yes. It is.

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:09.070
<v Speaker 1>I need to put the ID then. Because

01:00:09.070 --> 01:00:11.070
<v Speaker 1>there's already a card and project. So I'm

01:00:11.070 --> 01:00:12.830
<v Speaker 1>actually that's why it was a permission denied.

01:00:12.830 --> 01:00:14.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to modify someone else's card and

01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:15.710
<v Speaker 1>project.

01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:18.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh.

01:00:21.505 --> 01:00:24.385
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Enable the CLI. I'll just pull it

01:00:24.385 --> 01:00:25.425
<v Speaker 1>till it's ready. So

01:00:30.145 --> 01:00:30.945
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

01:00:30.945 --> 01:00:33.025
<v Speaker 1>So that worked. We've got the default network.

01:00:33.025 --> 01:00:34.465
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy to use the default network.

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:35.840
<v Speaker 1>And

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.640
<v Speaker 1>we can list machine types by region. We

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:40.160
<v Speaker 1>can just use an end to

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:41.920
<v Speaker 1>end standard four.

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:46.320
<v Speaker 1>We already listed the templates.

01:00:47.775 --> 01:00:49.615
<v Speaker 1>So now we get to the fun bit,

01:00:49.615 --> 01:00:52.095
<v Speaker 1>which is creating our cluster deployment.

01:00:52.095 --> 01:00:52.575
<v Speaker 1>So

01:00:54.815 --> 01:00:56.335
<v Speaker 1>where is this code?

01:00:57.214 --> 01:00:59.214
<v Speaker 1>So now

01:00:59.214 --> 01:01:00.095
<v Speaker 1>I

01:01:00.095 --> 01:01:00.815
<v Speaker 1>am

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.520
<v Speaker 1>gonna name things a little bit nicer

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:06.240
<v Speaker 1>so that we can follow along.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:11.760
<v Speaker 1>So we'll call this Rawkode production.

01:01:13.944 --> 01:01:16.345
<v Speaker 1>In this namespace, we'll go with the GCP

01:01:16.345 --> 01:01:17.305
<v Speaker 1>standalone.

01:01:18.105 --> 01:01:19.464
<v Speaker 1>I guess I should list it again to

01:01:19.464 --> 01:01:21.865
<v Speaker 1>make sure these versions haven't changed. So let's

01:01:21.865 --> 01:01:22.345
<v Speaker 1>just

01:01:22.665 --> 01:01:24.345
<v Speaker 2>Let's see. I don't think they should I

01:01:24.345 --> 01:01:25.865
<v Speaker 2>don't yeah. Go ahead.

01:01:26.185 --> 01:01:27.704
<v Speaker 1>There's a provider template.

01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:34.170
<v Speaker 1>There we go.

01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:35.690
<v Speaker 1>And

01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:39.690
<v Speaker 1>the other one was was it cluster templates?

01:01:40.329 --> 01:01:42.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Cluster there's a cluster template and a

01:01:42.730 --> 01:01:43.450
<v Speaker 2>service template.

01:01:44.105 --> 01:01:46.825
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Okay. So the GCP standalone

01:01:47.464 --> 01:01:49.224
<v Speaker 1>is zero two one, same as the docs.

01:01:49.224 --> 01:01:51.704
<v Speaker 1>That's fine. I haven't changed the credential name,

01:01:51.704 --> 01:01:52.825
<v Speaker 1>so that should be okay.

01:01:54.105 --> 01:01:56.825
<v Speaker 1>We do need to paste in my project

01:01:56.825 --> 01:01:57.224
<v Speaker 1>name,

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:01.120
<v Speaker 1>which is no longer in my history.

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Grab that one more time. Should've called it

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:06.800
<v Speaker 1>Rawkode Cordon just to make it easier.

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:11.520
<v Speaker 1>You're Europe West 2.

01:02:13.105 --> 01:02:14.465
<v Speaker 1>Default network.

01:02:15.105 --> 01:02:16.785
<v Speaker 1>Oh, and I need the full name for

01:02:16.785 --> 01:02:19.505
<v Speaker 1>the image hardware list. So we will run

01:02:19.505 --> 01:02:20.705
<v Speaker 1>that command then.

01:02:27.025 --> 01:02:27.425
<v Speaker 1>Here.

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:35.160
<v Speaker 1>List.

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:41.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh, there's lots.

01:02:44.744 --> 01:02:45.704
<v Speaker 1>Ubuntu

01:02:45.704 --> 01:02:47.545
<v Speaker 1>20 o four seems to be what the

01:02:47.545 --> 01:02:50.825
<v Speaker 1>docs suggest using. How permissive

01:02:50.825 --> 01:02:53.224
<v Speaker 1>or restrictive as my Ubuntu version?

01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:07.300
<v Speaker 1>You still with me? Oh, yeah. I'm

01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:09.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm watching along. No. I was I was

01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:10.580
<v Speaker 2>thinking about

01:03:11.165 --> 01:03:14.125
<v Speaker 2>choice of operating systems when you run

01:03:17.325 --> 01:03:20.045
<v Speaker 2>your Kubernetes clusters. I'm I'm curious

01:03:20.765 --> 01:03:22.765
<v Speaker 2>what your views are around

01:03:22.925 --> 01:03:23.805
<v Speaker 2>does it really matter?

01:03:24.849 --> 01:03:27.570
<v Speaker 2>Would you care if someone gave you

01:03:28.450 --> 01:03:30.849
<v Speaker 2>a choice or no you know, what is

01:03:30.849 --> 01:03:31.089
<v Speaker 2>the

01:03:32.130 --> 01:03:33.410
<v Speaker 2>I think I know what this I know

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:34.770
<v Speaker 2>I know the answer. It's gonna be you're

01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:35.810
<v Speaker 2>always gonna want a choice.

01:03:39.075 --> 01:03:41.075
<v Speaker 1>I mean, I know the best practice is

01:03:41.075 --> 01:03:43.715
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't care. The clusters are supposed to

01:03:43.715 --> 01:03:45.555
<v Speaker 1>be as ephemeral as possible. I should have

01:03:45.555 --> 01:03:47.075
<v Speaker 1>lots of them be able to rotate them

01:03:47.075 --> 01:03:47.955
<v Speaker 1>back up, restore.

01:03:48.355 --> 01:03:48.675
<v Speaker 2>Yep.

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:52.320
<v Speaker 1>In reality, I think so many companies

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:54.560
<v Speaker 1>are so far away from that. I mean,

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:56.560
<v Speaker 1>even in my production, which is not that

01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:57.120
<v Speaker 1>huge,

01:03:57.839 --> 01:04:00.800
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you just need convenience and debug ability.

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Like, you know, I haven't adopted,

01:04:03.654 --> 01:04:04.855
<v Speaker 1>you know, immutable.

01:04:05.015 --> 01:04:07.734
<v Speaker 1>I haven't got in my production clusters,

01:04:07.734 --> 01:04:09.734
<v Speaker 1>etcetera. I mean, I just run that on

01:04:09.734 --> 01:04:12.375
<v Speaker 1>a desktop. So I always make compromises trying

01:04:12.375 --> 01:04:14.214
<v Speaker 1>to protect the tomorrow's problems.

01:04:14.454 --> 01:04:15.015
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So,

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:17.440
<v Speaker 1>yeah, I'm not that opinionated,

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:19.120
<v Speaker 1>but I do need that break glass button

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:20.720
<v Speaker 1>for when I need to get into and

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:23.200
<v Speaker 1>do stuff. So Just get it done. Yeah.

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:25.920
<v Speaker 1>Exactly. Yeah. So what are the yeah. I

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:28.455
<v Speaker 2>mean, we're we're sort of thinking about how

01:04:28.455 --> 01:04:31.255
<v Speaker 2>how minimal could you make an OS. Right?

01:04:31.255 --> 01:04:33.655
<v Speaker 2>And could you then use something like

01:04:33.975 --> 01:04:34.775
<v Speaker 2>Distroless

01:04:34.775 --> 01:04:36.135
<v Speaker 2>to provide

01:04:36.215 --> 01:04:38.215
<v Speaker 2>your user space? And

01:04:38.535 --> 01:04:40.455
<v Speaker 2>what does that look like? And,

01:04:41.495 --> 01:04:42.055
<v Speaker 2>ultimately,

01:04:43.390 --> 01:04:45.869
<v Speaker 2>do people care enough to actually have something

01:04:45.869 --> 01:04:48.270
<v Speaker 2>like that important? I don't know the answer.

01:04:53.310 --> 01:04:54.590
<v Speaker 1>Wrong namespace.

01:04:56.109 --> 01:04:56.830
<v Speaker 1>There we go.

01:04:58.645 --> 01:05:02.245
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So cluster's not ready. Expected. Services zero

01:05:02.245 --> 01:05:03.925
<v Speaker 1>zero. Template correct.

01:05:06.005 --> 01:05:08.805
<v Speaker 1>Infrastructure ready. Wow. I wonder. Do we have

01:05:08.805 --> 01:05:10.325
<v Speaker 1>some compute nodes then?

01:05:10.565 --> 01:05:12.910
<v Speaker 2>Let's see. That'd be stupid.

01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:14.670
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot faster to enable. Yes. That's

01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:15.310
<v Speaker 2>for sure.

01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:19.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh, cloud storage. No. Other one.

01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:22.430
<v Speaker 1>Compute engine.

01:05:29.635 --> 01:05:31.075
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I mean,

01:05:33.075 --> 01:05:35.555
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to just show me the

01:05:35.555 --> 01:05:36.115
<v Speaker 1>thing.

01:05:37.235 --> 01:05:38.755
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like the UI is caught

01:05:38.755 --> 01:05:40.115
<v Speaker 1>up with the fact that that is turned

01:05:40.115 --> 01:05:40.355
<v Speaker 1>on.

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:46.720
<v Speaker 1>No. Alright.

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Is there a refresh button?

01:05:58.735 --> 01:06:01.855
<v Speaker 1>Total VMs is zero. I'm assuming it's maybe

01:06:02.815 --> 01:06:04.495
<v Speaker 1>hopefully working on it.

01:06:04.815 --> 01:06:06.415
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I think it's working on it. It's

01:06:06.415 --> 01:06:08.095
<v Speaker 2>probably it looks like you're

01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:11.630
<v Speaker 2>you need to make your screen bigger.

01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:13.070
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:16.349
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Yeah. No instances yet.

01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:21.230
<v Speaker 2>I guess while while that's happening, a couple

01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:22.430
<v Speaker 2>of things that

01:06:23.549 --> 01:06:25.309
<v Speaker 2>should be interesting for

01:06:25.445 --> 01:06:26.485
<v Speaker 2>for people.

01:06:26.645 --> 01:06:28.645
<v Speaker 2>We are, of course, going to be offering

01:06:28.725 --> 01:06:29.605
<v Speaker 2>kubect,

01:06:30.645 --> 01:06:32.805
<v Speaker 2>so that that's being actively worked on as

01:06:32.805 --> 01:06:34.885
<v Speaker 2>well. So it'll just be another provider

01:06:35.525 --> 01:06:36.725
<v Speaker 2>with kubect.

01:06:37.205 --> 01:06:37.765
<v Speaker 2>And then,

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:43.360
<v Speaker 2>we'll also want to, introduce

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:48.480
<v Speaker 2>cloud hypervisor as well, so so people of

01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:49.120
<v Speaker 2>choice.

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:55.040
<v Speaker 1>Taking a long time to list the machine

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:55.520
<v Speaker 1>types.

01:07:08.035 --> 01:07:10.630
<v Speaker 1>Refresh. They always move this refresh button. I'm

01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:11.910
<v Speaker 1>like, just stick it in one place on

01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:14.950
<v Speaker 1>every screen, please. Sometimes it's over here.

01:07:18.790 --> 01:07:21.430
<v Speaker 1>My biggest concern oh, okay. It's just slow.

01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:23.670
<v Speaker 1>My biggest concern was maybe I picked a

01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:26.685
<v Speaker 1>machine type that wasn't available in the region.

01:07:27.404 --> 01:07:29.244
<v Speaker 1>I did n two. I do see n

01:07:29.244 --> 01:07:29.964
<v Speaker 1>fours.

01:07:30.125 --> 01:07:31.484
<v Speaker 1>So let's

01:07:32.045 --> 01:07:33.244
<v Speaker 1>and grep

01:07:33.644 --> 01:07:34.605
<v Speaker 1>west

01:07:34.924 --> 01:07:37.404
<v Speaker 1>two, but I also want to look for

01:07:38.319 --> 01:07:39.840
<v Speaker 1>standard dashboards.

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:42.160
<v Speaker 1>I can always update this, I'm sure. So

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:46.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why that I mean, I'm

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:49.040
<v Speaker 1>sure it's fetching a decent amount of information,

01:07:49.119 --> 01:07:49.520
<v Speaker 1>but

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:51.440
<v Speaker 1>not that much.

01:07:53.285 --> 01:07:54.724
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure I could also just pass

01:07:54.724 --> 01:07:56.805
<v Speaker 1>dash dash region, which would probably restrict the

01:07:56.805 --> 01:07:58.565
<v Speaker 1>amount of data that I need to fetch.

01:07:58.724 --> 01:07:59.125
<v Speaker 1>But

01:07:59.525 --> 01:08:01.765
<v Speaker 1>the docs told me to use grep, so

01:08:01.765 --> 01:08:02.325
<v Speaker 1>I greped.

01:08:06.089 --> 01:08:08.330
<v Speaker 2>This is this is the reason why I'm

01:08:08.569 --> 01:08:10.970
<v Speaker 2>a fan of SSH. Right? You know, just

01:08:10.970 --> 01:08:13.290
<v Speaker 2>a little little faster on your

01:08:14.010 --> 01:08:15.849
<v Speaker 2>providers doesn't really help. So let's see. And

01:08:15.849 --> 01:08:17.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm in there. We we do have n

01:08:17.770 --> 01:08:18.489
<v Speaker 1>two standards.

01:08:19.435 --> 01:08:19.995
<v Speaker 1>So

01:08:21.675 --> 01:08:23.755
<v Speaker 1>there we go. Look at that. We got

01:08:23.755 --> 01:08:25.354
<v Speaker 1>a machine. Alright.

01:08:27.755 --> 01:08:29.035
<v Speaker 1>So let's

01:08:30.475 --> 01:08:33.435
<v Speaker 1>talk about what's actually happening

01:08:32.439 --> 01:08:34.919
<v Speaker 1>behind the scenes here. Right? So Yep.

01:08:35.559 --> 01:08:37.559
<v Speaker 1>We wrote a very small bit of YAML

01:08:37.559 --> 01:08:39.800
<v Speaker 1>that just says we want a cluster

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:41.079
<v Speaker 1>with this name.

01:08:41.559 --> 01:08:43.479
<v Speaker 1>We picked a template from the list of

01:08:43.479 --> 01:08:45.399
<v Speaker 1>templates. I provided the credentials

01:08:46.085 --> 01:08:48.564
<v Speaker 1>with some small amount of configuration, the project,

01:08:48.564 --> 01:08:50.564
<v Speaker 1>the region, the network, and then the device

01:08:50.564 --> 01:08:52.165
<v Speaker 1>types to use across the control plane and

01:08:52.165 --> 01:08:54.165
<v Speaker 1>the worker plane. Yep. Now I know this

01:08:54.165 --> 01:08:57.444
<v Speaker 1>is just in behind the scenes. Mhmm. Which

01:08:58.005 --> 01:08:58.245
<v Speaker 1>means

01:08:59.109 --> 01:09:02.229
<v Speaker 1>what's happening here is on the kind cluster

01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:03.429
<v Speaker 1>I have locally,

01:09:05.109 --> 01:09:07.350
<v Speaker 1>it is generating all of the secrets for

01:09:07.350 --> 01:09:09.830
<v Speaker 1>the control plane to successfully join with each

01:09:09.830 --> 01:09:09.989
<v Speaker 1>other,

01:09:11.284 --> 01:09:14.324
<v Speaker 1>constructing the user data, dropping that into

01:09:14.804 --> 01:09:17.045
<v Speaker 1>Google's compute engine, and then the boxes come

01:09:17.045 --> 01:09:18.164
<v Speaker 1>online and

01:09:18.645 --> 01:09:19.284
<v Speaker 1>work.

01:09:19.685 --> 01:09:21.604
<v Speaker 1>Yes. So in theory,

01:09:22.005 --> 01:09:24.564
<v Speaker 1>this is just one big massive user data

01:09:24.090 --> 01:09:26.569
<v Speaker 1>script, assuming it doesn't change anything that Capi

01:09:26.569 --> 01:09:28.569
<v Speaker 1>is doing already. So

01:09:31.689 --> 01:09:34.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. We very much follow I mean, we

01:09:36.395 --> 01:09:38.474
<v Speaker 2>I think once you've been burned by

01:09:39.194 --> 01:09:43.034
<v Speaker 2>not doing something completely open source or diverging,

01:09:43.274 --> 01:09:45.435
<v Speaker 2>you tend never to do it again. Right?

01:09:45.435 --> 01:09:45.994
<v Speaker 2>And

01:09:46.395 --> 01:09:47.835
<v Speaker 2>I think we've got enough experience.

01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:52.060
<v Speaker 1>And what what's nice about this? Again, let's

01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:53.740
<v Speaker 1>focus on the abstractions that you and your

01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:55.100
<v Speaker 1>team I don't know how many people are

01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:56.700
<v Speaker 1>working on this. Right? I'll assume there's a

01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:58.860
<v Speaker 1>team of people. Yes. When you oh, there's

01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:00.940
<v Speaker 2>a lot. There's a lot of in

01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:03.085
<v Speaker 2>here. It's like if we focus on the

01:10:03.085 --> 01:10:05.165
<v Speaker 1>problem domain and why I mean, CAPI is

01:10:05.165 --> 01:10:05.804
<v Speaker 1>amazing,

01:10:06.285 --> 01:10:08.765
<v Speaker 1>but it is laborious to actually get a

01:10:08.765 --> 01:10:10.445
<v Speaker 1>cluster at the other end of especially when

01:10:10.445 --> 01:10:12.285
<v Speaker 1>you think about you have to configure that

01:10:12.285 --> 01:10:14.205
<v Speaker 1>the CAPI doesn't do the CNI for a

01:10:14.205 --> 01:10:15.725
<v Speaker 1>start. You that's the first thing you deploy

01:10:15.725 --> 01:10:18.580
<v Speaker 1>to the cluster. Yep. But I'm assuming if

01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:20.340
<v Speaker 1>I just pop in here as well as

01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:22.260
<v Speaker 1>handling all the certs and stuff is that

01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:24.260
<v Speaker 1>if we scroll down, we're going to see

01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:26.900
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it's not in the user's area,

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:28.500
<v Speaker 1>maybe it happens in the control plane after

01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:31.060
<v Speaker 1>because there is a copy concept for doing

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:33.140
<v Speaker 1>an apply after the control plane component.

01:10:33.885 --> 01:10:35.804
<v Speaker 1>But I'm assuming the CNI stuff is maybe

01:10:35.804 --> 01:10:37.565
<v Speaker 1>in there. So we can just see this

01:10:37.565 --> 01:10:39.324
<v Speaker 1>as just user data. Like

01:10:39.804 --> 01:10:40.364
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:10:41.565 --> 01:10:42.604
<v Speaker 1>Alright. No.

01:10:45.164 --> 01:10:47.164
<v Speaker 1>So it's using k zeros for all of

01:10:47.164 --> 01:10:48.739
<v Speaker 1>the nodes and stuff like that. Alright. So

01:10:48.739 --> 01:10:50.500
<v Speaker 1>let's just get the cluster, which means it's

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:52.019
<v Speaker 1>handing off to something else,

01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:54.420
<v Speaker 1>which I guess is a KSM,

01:10:54.739 --> 01:10:55.539
<v Speaker 1>potentially.

01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:57.619
<v Speaker 2>That is the KSM.

01:10:58.340 --> 01:11:00.739
<v Speaker 2>So this is yeah. And so, you know,

01:11:01.655 --> 01:11:03.095
<v Speaker 2>it's template based.

01:11:03.735 --> 01:11:06.375
<v Speaker 2>Now we can actually go and you know,

01:11:06.375 --> 01:11:08.615
<v Speaker 2>we've got this cluster, so now we can

01:11:08.615 --> 01:11:09.175
<v Speaker 2>actually

01:11:10.055 --> 01:11:11.735
<v Speaker 2>look at what nodes look like and then

01:11:11.735 --> 01:11:13.815
<v Speaker 2>actually deploy some beachhead services.

01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:18.790
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So one thing I did notice is

01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:20.710
<v Speaker 1>that I didn't see how many control plane

01:11:20.710 --> 01:11:21.909
<v Speaker 1>nodes I

01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:24.710
<v Speaker 1>want. Is this part of this GCP standalone

01:11:24.710 --> 01:11:25.590
<v Speaker 1>template?

01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:29.030
<v Speaker 2>It is. Obviously, you can go in and

01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:31.204
<v Speaker 2>and change it, or you can just add

01:11:31.684 --> 01:11:34.164
<v Speaker 2>that to the YAML file and define it.

01:11:34.405 --> 01:11:35.044
<v Speaker 2>Right?

01:11:35.605 --> 01:11:37.764
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So if I say, get me cluster

01:11:37.764 --> 01:11:38.644
<v Speaker 1>templates,

01:11:38.645 --> 01:11:40.885
<v Speaker 1>I say GCP standalone

01:11:41.125 --> 01:11:42.804
<v Speaker 1>and just grab this as YAML,

01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:46.059
<v Speaker 1>We we can see here.

01:11:48.699 --> 01:11:51.579
<v Speaker 1>I should've I don't how do you have

01:11:51.579 --> 01:11:52.939
<v Speaker 1>I done it on back?

01:11:53.739 --> 01:11:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Let's raise it to fail. Dash or

01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:57.820
<v Speaker 1>YAML. Just so I can get colors. I

01:11:57.820 --> 01:11:58.460
<v Speaker 1>like colors.

01:11:59.675 --> 01:12:01.434
<v Speaker 1>Oh, again terrible naming.

01:12:02.875 --> 01:12:03.514
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

01:12:07.835 --> 01:12:10.235
<v Speaker 1>So where's the fun stuff? So we've got

01:12:10.235 --> 01:12:12.074
<v Speaker 1>a control plane configuration. So this is all

01:12:12.074 --> 01:12:14.315
<v Speaker 1>just vanilla cube admin config,

01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:17.829
<v Speaker 1>configure insider box, labels, network tags,

01:12:21.829 --> 01:12:23.429
<v Speaker 1>control plane number. So

01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:25.829
<v Speaker 1>I could just put in control plane number

01:12:25.829 --> 01:12:27.590
<v Speaker 1>under the right key and be able to

01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:29.110
<v Speaker 1>say I just want a single control plane

01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:31.635
<v Speaker 1>node, and that would just be overwritten or

01:12:31.635 --> 01:12:34.435
<v Speaker 1>merged together at the application

01:12:34.435 --> 01:12:35.074
<v Speaker 1>time.

01:12:36.115 --> 01:12:37.475
<v Speaker 1>And in fact, we can already see the

01:12:37.475 --> 01:12:39.395
<v Speaker 1>project and region are here too. So Yeah.

01:12:39.475 --> 01:12:40.915
<v Speaker 1>We're already doing some of that.

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:44.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the what the word

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:47.040
<v Speaker 1>is, making some of those things explicit without

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:48.000
<v Speaker 1>defaulting.

01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:51.520
<v Speaker 1>Is there a default operating system in here?

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:52.320
<v Speaker 2>No.

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:54.560
<v Speaker 2>No.

01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:56.240
<v Speaker 2>There well, I mean,

01:12:57.325 --> 01:13:00.285
<v Speaker 2>I think the default would just be Ubuntu

01:13:00.285 --> 01:13:01.085
<v Speaker 2>right now.

01:13:01.565 --> 01:13:02.445
<v Speaker 2>But if you

01:13:03.565 --> 01:13:05.565
<v Speaker 2>if you go further down again

01:13:05.805 --> 01:13:07.005
<v Speaker 1>Oh, sorry. Yeah.

01:13:07.325 --> 01:13:08.765
<v Speaker 2>Yep. Just keep on going.

01:13:09.619 --> 01:13:10.899
<v Speaker 2>See the worker

01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:15.300
<v Speaker 2>the workers workers number is two right there.

01:13:16.579 --> 01:13:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. +1 95.

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:20.739
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Yeah. Got it. So

01:13:22.659 --> 01:13:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

01:13:23.645 --> 01:13:25.405
<v Speaker 2>And that's that's what you can, you know,

01:13:25.405 --> 01:13:26.445
<v Speaker 2>you can change.

01:13:27.965 --> 01:13:29.244
<v Speaker 2>Anything that's in

01:13:29.645 --> 01:13:31.244
<v Speaker 2>the YAML files

01:13:31.245 --> 01:13:34.045
<v Speaker 2>that you would have to laboriously all edit,

01:13:34.285 --> 01:13:35.805
<v Speaker 2>you can put back in here.

01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:41.020
<v Speaker 2>Right. So if there are specialized things that

01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:42.540
<v Speaker 2>you want to do, you can.

01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:45.580
<v Speaker 1>Have you experimented

01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:48.860
<v Speaker 1>or plan on providing support for, like, queue

01:13:49.055 --> 01:13:51.615
<v Speaker 1>to make some of this, like, you know,

01:13:51.615 --> 01:13:54.335
<v Speaker 1>defined with a schema and and get autocomplete

01:13:54.335 --> 01:13:56.095
<v Speaker 1>and IDs and stuff like that. I know

01:13:56.095 --> 01:13:57.935
<v Speaker 1>that nobody's really using Q, but I'm always

01:13:57.935 --> 01:13:59.615
<v Speaker 1>trying to promote people to use Q because

01:13:59.615 --> 01:14:01.215
<v Speaker 1>I think it's such a great tool. Well,

01:14:01.215 --> 01:14:03.135
<v Speaker 2>I I I came from Weaveworks, and, you

01:14:03.135 --> 01:14:05.539
<v Speaker 2>know, everyone there was a massive fan of

01:14:05.539 --> 01:14:06.019
<v Speaker 2>it.

01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:08.979
<v Speaker 2>It's quite popular here at Marantus.

01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:10.900
<v Speaker 2>We

01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:13.300
<v Speaker 2>are talking about how do

01:14:12.179 --> 01:14:15.300
<v Speaker 2>make this even simpler,

01:14:15.539 --> 01:14:17.300
<v Speaker 2>and Q would be a way to be

01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:17.940
<v Speaker 2>able to do that.

01:14:20.355 --> 01:14:21.074
<v Speaker 2>The

01:14:21.475 --> 01:14:22.435
<v Speaker 2>once we

01:14:23.235 --> 01:14:26.435
<v Speaker 2>we've talked about, you know, KSM,

01:14:26.835 --> 01:14:27.955
<v Speaker 2>KCM,

01:14:27.955 --> 01:14:29.795
<v Speaker 2>and coordinate observability,

01:14:30.035 --> 01:14:31.715
<v Speaker 2>the the next piece

01:14:32.115 --> 01:14:34.515
<v Speaker 2>that we're gonna start developing is the

01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:37.260
<v Speaker 2>policy manager, so KPM,

01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:39.420
<v Speaker 2>and that will really

01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:41.980
<v Speaker 2>need something like Q to be able to

01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:42.780
<v Speaker 2>do it well.

01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:45.340
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:47.100
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm looking at the time.

01:14:48.055 --> 01:14:49.575
<v Speaker 1>We can wait for this cluster to come

01:14:49.575 --> 01:14:52.055
<v Speaker 1>up and carry on. However, I think this

01:14:52.055 --> 01:14:54.535
<v Speaker 1>was a good amount of chunky work that

01:14:54.535 --> 01:14:56.455
<v Speaker 1>maybe if you have something else, we could

01:14:56.455 --> 01:14:58.855
<v Speaker 1>take a look at to see the two

01:14:58.855 --> 01:15:02.455
<v Speaker 1>additional components, the service layer and the observability

01:15:02.455 --> 01:15:02.855
<v Speaker 1>layer.

01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:04.880
<v Speaker 1>It would just save us. Because, I mean,

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:07.280
<v Speaker 1>this could take twenty to thirty minutes. Yeah.

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:08.320
<v Speaker 1>So

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:11.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to see what I can do.

01:15:20.215 --> 01:15:21.655
<v Speaker 2>How much time do we have?

01:15:23.415 --> 01:15:24.935
<v Speaker 1>So

01:15:24.935 --> 01:15:26.775
<v Speaker 1>it's in for another fifteen minutes, but if

01:15:26.775 --> 01:15:28.375
<v Speaker 1>we go over, it's not a big deal.

01:15:28.615 --> 01:15:30.775
<v Speaker 1>We do actually have three control plane nodes

01:15:30.775 --> 01:15:32.615
<v Speaker 1>online and two worker nodes, but they're not,

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
<v Speaker 1>know, that's not finished the bootstrap process yet.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.199
<v Speaker 1>So maybe it won't be long as I

01:15:36.199 --> 01:15:36.839
<v Speaker 1>thought.

01:15:37.159 --> 01:15:37.959
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Because

01:15:39.239 --> 01:15:41.399
<v Speaker 2>I would like to I would like to

01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:45.880
<v Speaker 2>just in the environment, be able to

01:15:47.284 --> 01:15:48.644
<v Speaker 2>show NGINX

01:15:50.804 --> 01:15:52.485
<v Speaker 2>and actually cover a

01:15:55.764 --> 01:15:57.604
<v Speaker 2>a portion of KSM.

01:15:58.005 --> 01:15:58.485
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:01.159
<v Speaker 2>So maybe

01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:04.760
<v Speaker 2>where did you stop? Okay.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.679
<v Speaker 2>So I think what we'd want to do

01:16:06.679 --> 01:16:09.239
<v Speaker 2>is be able to look at the KSM

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:11.800
<v Speaker 2>on on your

01:16:13.035 --> 01:16:13.995
<v Speaker 2>on your cluster.

01:16:42.005 --> 01:16:42.885
<v Speaker 2>Alright.

01:16:47.605 --> 01:16:49.445
<v Speaker 1>Well, my cluster state is

01:16:50.165 --> 01:16:53.190
<v Speaker 1>flapping between unknown and false. I think the

01:16:53.190 --> 01:16:55.350
<v Speaker 1>control plane machines are ready based on this

01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:56.309
<v Speaker 1>logline.

01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So we might just be

01:16:59.670 --> 01:17:00.470
<v Speaker 1>waiting

01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:01.190
<v Speaker 1>on

01:17:03.989 --> 01:17:04.790
<v Speaker 1>the worker notes.

01:17:05.835 --> 01:17:06.954
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming

01:17:07.035 --> 01:17:09.435
<v Speaker 1>and the secrets on the management cluster. So

01:17:09.435 --> 01:17:11.034
<v Speaker 1>this is my local

01:17:11.035 --> 01:17:12.235
<v Speaker 1>kind cluster.

01:17:12.795 --> 01:17:14.235
<v Speaker 1>In fact, I can see it already. In

01:17:14.235 --> 01:17:16.875
<v Speaker 1>the KCM system, we have a KubeConfig for

01:17:16.875 --> 01:17:18.075
<v Speaker 1>the Rawkode production

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:19.320
<v Speaker 1>cluster.

01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:22.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So I can probably just do QC.

01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Production.

01:17:27.159 --> 01:17:28.920
<v Speaker 1>We want the cube config.

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:30.360
<v Speaker 2>Because you're gonna

01:17:31.165 --> 01:17:33.245
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. You're gonna control all of this on

01:17:33.245 --> 01:17:36.045
<v Speaker 2>that on that mothership. Now if the mothership

01:17:36.045 --> 01:17:38.124
<v Speaker 2>does go we call it mothership, right,

01:17:38.525 --> 01:17:40.204
<v Speaker 2>to Shikers Guide to the Galaxy.

01:17:41.324 --> 01:17:42.445
<v Speaker 2>If the controller

01:17:42.685 --> 01:17:44.684
<v Speaker 2>if if that mothership does go down,

01:17:45.725 --> 01:17:47.840
<v Speaker 2>you you will con you know, all of

01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:50.239
<v Speaker 2>the child clusters will continue to work. Right?

01:17:50.239 --> 01:17:51.760
<v Speaker 2>And that's why we have Valero, and we

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:53.360
<v Speaker 2>have different ways of recovering.

01:17:54.079 --> 01:17:54.479
<v Speaker 2>So

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:57.440
<v Speaker 2>it's it's one of the advantages we have

01:17:58.985 --> 01:18:01.385
<v Speaker 2>that, you know, you're able to

01:18:02.105 --> 01:18:05.225
<v Speaker 2>do real you can rebuild your mothership

01:18:05.465 --> 01:18:07.465
<v Speaker 2>and not impact or affect it.

01:18:08.265 --> 01:18:09.705
<v Speaker 2>Alright. So where are you?

01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:14.630
<v Speaker 2>Alright. So in the service template,

01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:16.869
<v Speaker 2>which one are you in right now?

01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:19.270
<v Speaker 2>Engine

01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:21.750
<v Speaker 2>you have the engine, Nick. What are you

01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:21.989
<v Speaker 2>doing?

01:18:24.105 --> 01:18:26.345
<v Speaker 1>So pulling out the secret, getting it to

01:18:26.345 --> 01:18:29.305
<v Speaker 1>JSON, hopefully, writing the value file, decoding it,

01:18:29.305 --> 01:18:31.065
<v Speaker 1>and putting it into a config file. Otherwise,

01:18:31.065 --> 01:18:32.665
<v Speaker 1>I realize it now says I don't have

01:18:32.665 --> 01:18:33.385
<v Speaker 1>JQ.

01:18:33.864 --> 01:18:36.185
<v Speaker 1>So I need to modify one thing before

01:18:36.185 --> 01:18:38.105
<v Speaker 1>I run that, which is just to add

01:18:38.105 --> 01:18:38.905
<v Speaker 1>JQ here.

01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:43.780
<v Speaker 1>And then in my terminal here, just reload

01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:45.860
<v Speaker 1>so that JQ pops in the environment.

01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:48.820
<v Speaker 1>It should be quick. I do use JQ

01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:49.619
<v Speaker 1>often.

01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:53.139
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

01:18:54.179 --> 01:18:54.579
<v Speaker 1>Succeeded.

01:18:59.435 --> 01:19:01.355
<v Speaker 1>Oh, okay. It didn't pop in the shell,

01:19:01.355 --> 01:19:03.114
<v Speaker 1>but, I mean, it did when I refreshed

01:19:03.114 --> 01:19:04.315
<v Speaker 1>it. Okay. So

01:19:05.034 --> 01:19:07.355
<v Speaker 1>get not found. Get see oh, I've got

01:19:07.355 --> 01:19:08.315
<v Speaker 1>two. That's why.

01:19:10.750 --> 01:19:12.830
<v Speaker 1>No. I'll iterate over null. Okay. So I

01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:14.350
<v Speaker 1>was a bit too galsh with my j

01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:16.030
<v Speaker 1>q. We do have oh, we don't have

01:19:16.030 --> 01:19:16.829
<v Speaker 1>items.

01:19:17.870 --> 01:19:19.070
<v Speaker 1>What did I see here?

01:19:21.230 --> 01:19:21.790
<v Speaker 1>Items.

01:19:28.955 --> 01:19:30.715
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I'm not getting anything back.

01:19:31.115 --> 01:19:33.275
<v Speaker 1>Oh, there there we go. So,

01:19:35.409 --> 01:19:37.010
<v Speaker 1>oh, it's just alright. Okay.

01:19:37.809 --> 01:19:39.969
<v Speaker 1>J q dot data dot value.

01:19:42.369 --> 01:19:43.650
<v Speaker 1>Base 64

01:19:43.650 --> 01:19:46.050
<v Speaker 1>dash d rate to q config.

01:19:46.849 --> 01:19:50.035
<v Speaker 1>Oh, come on. Be nice to me. Oh,

01:19:50.035 --> 01:19:52.275
<v Speaker 1>so this is just a gq thing where

01:19:52.275 --> 01:19:53.315
<v Speaker 1>it's quoted.

01:19:54.355 --> 01:19:55.074
<v Speaker 1>Nice.

01:19:57.715 --> 01:19:59.074
<v Speaker 1>And then export

01:19:59.075 --> 01:20:00.835
<v Speaker 1>kube config equals

01:20:02.755 --> 01:20:03.475
<v Speaker 1>kube config.

01:20:05.449 --> 01:20:07.610
<v Speaker 1>So now if I run get pods, this

01:20:07.610 --> 01:20:09.769
<v Speaker 1>should be the workload cluster.

01:20:11.050 --> 01:20:13.130
<v Speaker 1>We've got Calico, CoreDNS,

01:20:13.130 --> 01:20:16.570
<v Speaker 1>the CSI stuff for Google Cloud, controller managers,

01:20:16.570 --> 01:20:19.050
<v Speaker 1>proxies, metrics there. That is

01:20:19.290 --> 01:20:21.425
<v Speaker 1>a working cluster. Yeah.

01:20:22.065 --> 01:20:23.825
<v Speaker 2>And, you know, if you want, you can

01:20:23.825 --> 01:20:24.704
<v Speaker 2>look at the

01:20:25.505 --> 01:20:27.985
<v Speaker 2>you can look at the service templates.

01:20:29.345 --> 01:20:31.905
<v Speaker 1>Alright. The kubectl get

01:20:32.465 --> 01:20:33.985
<v Speaker 1>I'll do that from other shell, but I

01:20:33.985 --> 01:20:35.745
<v Speaker 1>don't speak into the management plan.

01:20:42.810 --> 01:20:43.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

01:20:47.849 --> 01:20:48.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any.

01:20:52.495 --> 01:20:54.735
<v Speaker 2>I'll go on and and on this

01:20:55.695 --> 01:20:57.375
<v Speaker 2>where are you now? Where'd you go? Oh,

01:20:57.375 --> 01:20:59.295
<v Speaker 1>sorry. I'm I'm I'm I'm trying to debug

01:20:59.295 --> 01:21:00.495
<v Speaker 1>one problem, and you're trying to help me.

01:21:00.495 --> 01:21:01.295
<v Speaker 1>I'll slow down.

01:21:01.855 --> 01:21:03.090
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to make sure I was

01:21:03.090 --> 01:21:05.170
<v Speaker 1>still speaking to them at the local kind

01:21:05.170 --> 01:21:07.170
<v Speaker 1>cluster, which I am. So we don't have

01:21:07.170 --> 01:21:09.410
<v Speaker 1>service templates, but maybe I've made a mistake.

01:21:10.450 --> 01:21:12.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. So, I mean, if you if you

01:21:12.690 --> 01:21:15.330
<v Speaker 2>look at, like, the KCM, like, KCM dash

01:21:15.330 --> 01:21:15.810
<v Speaker 2>Valero,

01:21:17.465 --> 01:21:20.344
<v Speaker 2>it's running. So on the child cluster,

01:21:20.345 --> 01:21:22.585
<v Speaker 2>try the same thing again. Do the deep

01:21:22.745 --> 01:21:23.864
<v Speaker 2>Kube CTL,

01:21:24.105 --> 01:21:26.665
<v Speaker 2>get service templates, crash n,

01:21:27.065 --> 01:21:28.105
<v Speaker 2>and then, you know,

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:32.320
<v Speaker 2>the namespace, which you called it. Which is

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:34.320
<v Speaker 1>true. Oh, yeah. Now that

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.439
<v Speaker 1>No service templates.

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:38.079
<v Speaker 2>Of course.

01:21:45.315 --> 01:21:46.755
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing it over here.

01:21:51.474 --> 01:21:54.034
<v Speaker 1>So we do have service template type on

01:21:54.034 --> 01:21:55.395
<v Speaker 1>the management cluster.

01:21:56.330 --> 01:21:58.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Do we need to deploy the service

01:21:58.250 --> 01:21:59.130
<v Speaker 1>templates,

01:21:59.210 --> 01:21:59.770
<v Speaker 1>or

01:22:00.010 --> 01:22:01.929
<v Speaker 1>are those done for us?

01:22:02.730 --> 01:22:05.050
<v Speaker 2>No. We're not we we're we we have

01:22:05.050 --> 01:22:05.770
<v Speaker 2>to

01:22:06.250 --> 01:22:06.810
<v Speaker 2>deploy it.

01:22:15.775 --> 01:22:17.215
<v Speaker 2>Let me see if there's no. There should

01:22:17.215 --> 01:22:18.815
<v Speaker 2>be one or two that are ready. It

01:22:18.975 --> 01:22:20.495
<v Speaker 2>the reason why I don't know the answer

01:22:20.495 --> 01:22:22.735
<v Speaker 2>right now is we're changing the code right

01:22:22.735 --> 01:22:23.215
<v Speaker 2>now.

01:22:24.175 --> 01:22:26.015
<v Speaker 2>And so I have to make sure.

01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:30.340
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So should I just copy this NGINX

01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:34.099
<v Speaker 1>Ingress example then and apply that to my

01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:37.380
<v Speaker 1>management cluster? I think it's a management cluster.

01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:37.619
<v Speaker 1>Right?

01:22:40.195 --> 01:22:42.755
<v Speaker 1>Yes. Alright. Okay. So service

01:22:43.555 --> 01:22:45.555
<v Speaker 1>templates dot YAML.

01:22:47.155 --> 01:22:48.755
<v Speaker 1>This is defining

01:22:48.995 --> 01:22:51.075
<v Speaker 1>just I mean, it's just an ingress one.

01:22:51.315 --> 01:22:52.835
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna leave the namespace off. I'll do

01:22:52.835 --> 01:22:53.715
<v Speaker 1>that on Kube control.

01:22:54.250 --> 01:22:56.250
<v Speaker 1>And this service template just says we want

01:22:56.250 --> 01:22:57.769
<v Speaker 1>to deploy a helm chart

01:22:59.449 --> 01:23:02.489
<v Speaker 1>with version interval. First, it's just gonna how

01:23:02.489 --> 01:23:03.769
<v Speaker 1>often to sync it with

01:23:04.409 --> 01:23:07.210
<v Speaker 1>flux, fail those Argo. Yeah. This looks like

01:23:07.210 --> 01:23:08.250
<v Speaker 1>a flux a flux one.

01:23:08.844 --> 01:23:09.564
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

01:23:10.764 --> 01:23:12.525
<v Speaker 1>Which means, I guess, that I could also

01:23:12.525 --> 01:23:14.364
<v Speaker 1>do values and then

01:23:14.844 --> 01:23:15.724
<v Speaker 1>go nuts.

01:23:15.965 --> 01:23:17.405
<v Speaker 2>You can go nuts. I mean, you can

01:23:17.405 --> 01:23:20.364
<v Speaker 2>do, like, your resources. You can do things

01:23:20.364 --> 01:23:21.005
<v Speaker 2>to, you know,

01:23:24.290 --> 01:23:26.290
<v Speaker 2>set memory, set CPU. You you could do

01:23:26.290 --> 01:23:28.370
<v Speaker 2>all of that. Yeah. I just wanna pick

01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:30.930
<v Speaker 1>one value that exists. So then, you know,

01:23:30.930 --> 01:23:32.770
<v Speaker 1>I always like to break stuff. So

01:23:33.730 --> 01:23:35.730
<v Speaker 2>Well, controller up to two.

01:23:36.850 --> 01:23:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Where's the values fail?

01:23:41.065 --> 01:23:43.065
<v Speaker 1>Oh, this isn't the helm chart. Is that

01:23:43.065 --> 01:23:43.864
<v Speaker 1>in hack?

01:23:48.025 --> 01:23:49.545
<v Speaker 1>No. Okay. This is just not the helm

01:23:49.545 --> 01:23:50.425
<v Speaker 1>chart. Alright.

01:23:51.065 --> 01:23:52.665
<v Speaker 1>Oh, it was under charts. There we go.

01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:56.260
<v Speaker 1>So let's pick one value.

01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:02.740
<v Speaker 1>There we go.

01:24:07.824 --> 01:24:08.624
<v Speaker 1>Wow.

01:24:08.864 --> 01:24:10.705
<v Speaker 1>Okay. This is the helm this is why

01:24:10.705 --> 01:24:13.665
<v Speaker 1>I don't like helm. Every single lane gets

01:24:13.665 --> 01:24:15.104
<v Speaker 1>templated and

01:24:15.185 --> 01:24:16.065
<v Speaker 1>controllable.

01:24:16.304 --> 01:24:17.264
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like, why?

01:24:21.449 --> 01:24:22.090
<v Speaker 1>So

01:24:23.449 --> 01:24:25.849
<v Speaker 1>I I can't remember. Should this

01:24:26.570 --> 01:24:28.409
<v Speaker 1>be dot notation, or should I be doing

01:24:28.409 --> 01:24:29.610
<v Speaker 1>nested YAML?

01:24:30.090 --> 01:24:32.969
<v Speaker 2>Nested YAML. Nested YAML. Yeah. Okay. So we'll

01:24:32.969 --> 01:24:34.889
<v Speaker 1>say Rawkode is

01:24:34.605 --> 01:24:36.365
<v Speaker 1>here for my label.

01:24:38.365 --> 01:24:39.645
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what happens.

01:24:41.325 --> 01:24:43.085
<v Speaker 1>Apply this. That goes to values.

01:24:49.290 --> 01:24:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh,

01:24:50.810 --> 01:24:52.969
<v Speaker 1>alright. I made an assumption. So I'm gonna

01:24:52.969 --> 01:24:54.729
<v Speaker 1>do a kubectl explain

01:24:55.130 --> 01:24:56.010
<v Speaker 1>service

01:24:58.010 --> 01:24:58.889
<v Speaker 1>shorthand,

01:24:58.889 --> 01:24:59.610
<v Speaker 1>which was

01:24:59.929 --> 01:25:01.849
<v Speaker 1>s e c t m p l

01:25:02.364 --> 01:25:03.804
<v Speaker 1>spec helm.

01:25:03.965 --> 01:25:05.724
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I put it under chart specs. That's

01:25:05.724 --> 01:25:07.885
<v Speaker 1>gonna be the maybe that's the the problem.

01:25:08.525 --> 01:25:09.804
<v Speaker 1>Value files.

01:25:12.445 --> 01:25:14.045
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So I can't do values. I have

01:25:14.045 --> 01:25:15.005
<v Speaker 1>to do value files.

01:25:20.690 --> 01:25:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Relative path of the sorcerer. Alright. Let's come

01:25:23.410 --> 01:25:25.090
<v Speaker 1>back to that. Let's not break the demo

01:25:25.090 --> 01:25:26.290
<v Speaker 1>because I was curious.

01:25:30.050 --> 01:25:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Let's just get it applied.

01:25:38.974 --> 01:25:40.094
<v Speaker 1>That's me.

01:25:42.175 --> 01:25:44.014
<v Speaker 1>Told you I need to break stuff. Yeah.

01:25:44.014 --> 01:25:44.894
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.

01:25:45.695 --> 01:25:46.014
<v Speaker 1>10

01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:51.750
<v Speaker 1>There we go. Alright. So we have a

01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:53.750
<v Speaker 1>service template. Now the thing I don't know,

01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:54.870
<v Speaker 1>and maybe I should go to the docs

01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:56.390
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you could tell me, is now

01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:59.270
<v Speaker 1>that our management layer has the concept of

01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.830
<v Speaker 1>this

01:26:00.765 --> 01:26:03.565
<v Speaker 1>project and grows NGINX service template, how would

01:26:03.565 --> 01:26:05.324
<v Speaker 1>I tell it to roll this out to

01:26:05.324 --> 01:26:06.684
<v Speaker 1>my cluster,

01:26:08.445 --> 01:26:10.045
<v Speaker 1>or does it do it automatically?

01:26:10.364 --> 01:26:11.804
<v Speaker 2>It it

01:26:12.210 --> 01:26:14.610
<v Speaker 2>depends on how you wanna set it up.

01:26:15.330 --> 01:26:16.690
<v Speaker 2>It's all around,

01:26:17.010 --> 01:26:19.969
<v Speaker 2>credentials that you would hand to people. So

01:26:20.130 --> 01:26:21.090
<v Speaker 2>you can,

01:26:21.330 --> 01:26:22.130
<v Speaker 2>as the,

01:26:24.050 --> 01:26:26.844
<v Speaker 2>you know, super, super, super user

01:26:27.485 --> 01:26:30.365
<v Speaker 2>decide to apply this at the cluster level

01:26:30.605 --> 01:26:33.085
<v Speaker 2>at the at the mother ship level, which

01:26:33.085 --> 01:26:34.605
<v Speaker 2>means you could just do it now.

01:26:35.165 --> 01:26:37.005
<v Speaker 2>Or what you can do is you could

01:26:37.005 --> 01:26:37.725
<v Speaker 2>make it available

01:26:38.690 --> 01:26:40.370
<v Speaker 2>to the DevOps engineer,

01:26:40.370 --> 01:26:42.929
<v Speaker 2>the development engineer, so they can apply it.

01:26:43.810 --> 01:26:46.690
<v Speaker 2>It's up to you. So let's assuming I'm

01:26:46.690 --> 01:26:48.850
<v Speaker 1>the platform engineer here, and I am saying

01:26:48.850 --> 01:26:51.489
<v Speaker 1>every cluster must have NGINX. So how do

01:26:51.489 --> 01:26:53.409
<v Speaker 1>I do this at the mothership level?

01:27:01.205 --> 01:27:02.965
<v Speaker 2>Wait. Let me I'm just going in my

01:27:02.965 --> 01:27:04.405
<v Speaker 2>bash history right now.

01:27:04.885 --> 01:27:06.645
<v Speaker 2>You're asking me a question that

01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:08.460
<v Speaker 2>I should know off the top of my

01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:08.940
<v Speaker 2>head.

01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:13.100
<v Speaker 1>In the docs, I found a YAML interface

01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:15.900
<v Speaker 1>for a multicluster service, which takes a cluster

01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:17.820
<v Speaker 1>selector and a service spec, but I don't

01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:20.545
<v Speaker 1>know if if that So you could do,

01:27:20.545 --> 01:27:21.344
<v Speaker 2>like, a

01:27:21.905 --> 01:27:22.465
<v Speaker 2>well,

01:27:23.825 --> 01:27:25.745
<v Speaker 2>did you do the you did the kubectl

01:27:25.745 --> 01:27:26.465
<v Speaker 2>apply.

01:27:27.185 --> 01:27:29.505
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I believe we we have a we

01:27:29.505 --> 01:27:31.105
<v Speaker 1>have a service template now.

01:27:31.505 --> 01:27:32.225
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

01:27:33.425 --> 01:27:33.745
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:35.060
<v Speaker 2>So

01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:38.500
<v Speaker 2>then I mean, kubectl apply

01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:40.340
<v Speaker 2>dash f,

01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:42.099
<v Speaker 2>the name of the thing.

01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:45.940
<v Speaker 2>I should call it out globally. Right?

01:27:48.025 --> 01:27:52.025
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. It does currently say invalid.

01:27:57.145 --> 01:27:59.865
<v Speaker 1>Describe service template. I don't know why that's

01:27:59.865 --> 01:28:01.145
<v Speaker 1>not all open for me.

01:28:03.170 --> 01:28:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Wait. Does describe work as a no. It

01:28:05.650 --> 01:28:06.369
<v Speaker 1>doesn't.

01:28:09.730 --> 01:28:12.210
<v Speaker 1>Alright. I made a mistake. It's failing to

01:28:12.210 --> 01:28:13.650
<v Speaker 1>download from the card and catalog.

01:28:22.585 --> 01:28:23.704
<v Speaker 2>I'm going there.

01:28:25.145 --> 01:28:27.465
<v Speaker 1>Was that something I can browse the Cortana

01:28:27.465 --> 01:28:29.305
<v Speaker 1>catalog? Browse it. So if you go to

01:28:29.305 --> 01:28:30.025
<v Speaker 2>GitHub

01:28:34.650 --> 01:28:36.090
<v Speaker 2>forward slash cordon.

01:28:38.170 --> 01:28:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Let's see if it finds it like

01:28:40.170 --> 01:28:42.730
<v Speaker 2>that. Catalog? Yep. Yep.

01:28:47.095 --> 01:28:49.175
<v Speaker 1>I could have picked anything. Wow. There's lots

01:28:49.175 --> 01:28:49.815
<v Speaker 1>in here. Okay.

01:28:50.455 --> 01:28:51.975
<v Speaker 1>NGINX.

01:28:53.495 --> 01:28:54.455
<v Speaker 1>Charts.

01:28:55.255 --> 01:28:58.055
<v Speaker 1>What version did I use? 4113.

01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:03.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's there. No. 4113 is there.

01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

01:29:16.284 --> 01:29:18.445
<v Speaker 1>Oh, there's a web version too. Nice. Okay.

01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:28.219
<v Speaker 2>Trying to see what

01:29:28.699 --> 01:29:31.340
<v Speaker 2>could have possibly So you're gonna deploy

01:29:32.060 --> 01:29:35.019
<v Speaker 1>the template with Helm as well. Yeah.

01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:38.620
<v Speaker 1>And then we deploy a multi cluster service.

01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:41.835
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Yeah. And you can do, like, what

01:29:41.835 --> 01:29:43.915
<v Speaker 2>I've done because I just wanted to make

01:29:43.915 --> 01:29:45.755
<v Speaker 2>it easy. I wrapped it around the shell

01:29:45.755 --> 01:29:46.474
<v Speaker 2>script

01:29:47.594 --> 01:29:49.114
<v Speaker 2>to do it. Right?

01:29:49.835 --> 01:29:50.954
<v Speaker 2>So I actually had to look at my

01:29:50.954 --> 01:29:51.994
<v Speaker 2>shell script right now.

01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:56.719
<v Speaker 1>Oh, that came back false too.

01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:01.039
<v Speaker 2>The

01:30:02.559 --> 01:30:04.879
<v Speaker 2>Is the catalog down? Is it broken?

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:06.000
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't be.

01:30:08.295 --> 01:30:08.935
<v Speaker 2>Try,

01:30:09.655 --> 01:30:10.135
<v Speaker 2>you try

01:30:10.775 --> 01:30:12.135
<v Speaker 2>what does it say? Oh, no. It's valid

01:30:12.135 --> 01:30:13.094
<v Speaker 1>now. Okay.

01:30:13.735 --> 01:30:14.454
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

01:30:15.255 --> 01:30:16.295
<v Speaker 1>This worked.

01:30:16.614 --> 01:30:19.415
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's just taking too long. No?

01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:22.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. But I'm I'm gonna go

01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:24.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna YOLO that's more of a

01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:26.179
<v Speaker 1>cluster service then and then

01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:29.380
<v Speaker 1>let's see what happens. Again, having fun. So

01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:31.060
<v Speaker 1>just going through it. But

01:30:31.780 --> 01:30:34.014
<v Speaker 2>So when I Sorry. I'm

01:30:35.535 --> 01:30:37.055
<v Speaker 2>gonna say just touching

01:30:37.055 --> 01:30:37.614
<v Speaker 2>on

01:30:38.095 --> 01:30:40.015
<v Speaker 2>the because I said I'd say vibe coding

01:30:40.015 --> 01:30:42.335
<v Speaker 2>one time. If you think about

01:30:43.615 --> 01:30:44.735
<v Speaker 2>well, why not?

01:30:44.975 --> 01:30:46.655
<v Speaker 2>If you think about

01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:49.460
<v Speaker 2>what you've done now with

01:30:49.940 --> 01:30:51.219
<v Speaker 2>creating

01:30:51.220 --> 01:30:52.420
<v Speaker 2>templates for

01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:54.980
<v Speaker 2>KCM, KSM,

01:30:56.580 --> 01:30:58.739
<v Speaker 2>the observability

01:30:58.739 --> 01:30:59.220
<v Speaker 2>as well,

01:31:00.485 --> 01:31:01.525
<v Speaker 2>you have

01:31:02.565 --> 01:31:03.284
<v Speaker 2>a

01:31:03.445 --> 01:31:04.325
<v Speaker 2>platform

01:31:04.325 --> 01:31:05.125
<v Speaker 2>that is

01:31:05.845 --> 01:31:08.085
<v Speaker 2>a lot easier for models

01:31:08.085 --> 01:31:10.725
<v Speaker 2>to learn and then actually

01:31:10.885 --> 01:31:13.220
<v Speaker 2>be able to do things with it. Right?

01:31:13.220 --> 01:31:15.540
<v Speaker 2>So that's one of the sort of the

01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:16.500
<v Speaker 2>powerful things.

01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:18.980
<v Speaker 2>We had one of the sales engineers who

01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:20.820
<v Speaker 2>was frustrated because we don't have a UI

01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:23.220
<v Speaker 2>for it yet because we're using the Kubernetes

01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:23.620
<v Speaker 2>UI,

01:31:26.505 --> 01:31:27.224
<v Speaker 2>who

01:31:28.185 --> 01:31:29.545
<v Speaker 2>created a UI

01:31:30.585 --> 01:31:32.824
<v Speaker 2>in half a day. I told it what

01:31:32.824 --> 01:31:34.105
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to do and then and then

01:31:34.105 --> 01:31:34.905
<v Speaker 2>built it.

01:31:35.385 --> 01:31:37.065
<v Speaker 2>So that's sort of the nice thing about

01:31:37.065 --> 01:31:40.050
<v Speaker 2>this where you can, you know, abstract to

01:31:40.050 --> 01:31:42.050
<v Speaker 2>the level of being able to

01:31:42.690 --> 01:31:43.329
<v Speaker 2>pick,

01:31:44.050 --> 01:31:47.729
<v Speaker 2>different things, different providers, different types of services,

01:31:47.730 --> 01:31:50.929
<v Speaker 2>and actually have a model understand it quite

01:31:50.929 --> 01:31:51.250
<v Speaker 2>easily.

01:31:53.025 --> 01:31:54.305
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying you should do that in

01:31:54.305 --> 01:31:55.425
<v Speaker 2>production environments,

01:31:55.425 --> 01:31:57.345
<v Speaker 2>but it opens up the idea of

01:31:57.825 --> 01:31:59.905
<v Speaker 2>this is easier to comprehend

01:32:00.145 --> 01:32:00.945
<v Speaker 2>than

01:32:02.705 --> 01:32:05.345
<v Speaker 2>tripping up inside of you know, for the

01:32:05.345 --> 01:32:08.580
<v Speaker 2>rest of this, tripping up inside of or

01:32:08.580 --> 01:32:09.619
<v Speaker 2>something else.

01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:13.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Definitely. I

01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:16.820
<v Speaker 1>definitely vibe good a lot, especially, you know,

01:32:16.820 --> 01:32:19.140
<v Speaker 1>ever since MCP got a lot of adoption,

01:32:19.140 --> 01:32:21.535
<v Speaker 1>and there's MCP servers for for GitHub, for

01:32:21.535 --> 01:32:22.255
<v Speaker 1>GitLab,

01:32:23.215 --> 01:32:26.095
<v Speaker 1>for Kubernetes projects, for web APIs, for anything.

01:32:26.095 --> 01:32:26.975
<v Speaker 1>Like, you just end up

01:32:28.095 --> 01:32:30.495
<v Speaker 1>the whole agentic thing just does so much

01:32:30.495 --> 01:32:32.175
<v Speaker 1>for you now. The things that would have

01:32:32.175 --> 01:32:34.015
<v Speaker 1>taken me weeks to build you're doing in

01:32:34.015 --> 01:32:36.669
<v Speaker 1>a day is just amazing. It is amazing.

01:32:36.670 --> 01:32:39.309
<v Speaker 2>We we're we're trying to determine which of

01:32:39.309 --> 01:32:41.389
<v Speaker 2>the MCP servers we're going to

01:32:41.949 --> 01:32:44.030
<v Speaker 2>build on top of. What we don't wanna

01:32:44.030 --> 01:32:47.389
<v Speaker 2>do is replicate. So the Chordant MCP

01:32:47.389 --> 01:32:47.630
<v Speaker 2>will

01:32:48.905 --> 01:32:51.385
<v Speaker 2>leverage one of the I think the the

01:32:51.385 --> 01:32:53.945
<v Speaker 2>K 0 8 you know, there's the MCP

01:32:53.945 --> 01:32:56.745
<v Speaker 2>Kubernetes server, and then there's also MCP

01:32:57.145 --> 01:32:58.505
<v Speaker 2>k zero

01:32:59.145 --> 01:32:59.625
<v Speaker 2>eight.

01:33:00.550 --> 01:33:02.469
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's the one we're using

01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:06.310
<v Speaker 2>more than likely. So we'll have this here.

01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:08.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So

01:33:09.030 --> 01:33:10.710
<v Speaker 1>while we were chatting there, I very quickly

01:33:10.710 --> 01:33:11.670
<v Speaker 1>did one thing,

01:33:12.230 --> 01:33:14.550
<v Speaker 1>which was I noticed in the multi service

01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:17.635
<v Speaker 1>cluster wanted some sort of label selector

01:33:17.635 --> 01:33:19.635
<v Speaker 1>in the cluster. Now I could have defaulted

01:33:19.635 --> 01:33:21.555
<v Speaker 1>that and assumed I assume it would do

01:33:21.555 --> 01:33:23.795
<v Speaker 1>all, but I didn't wanna make any assumptions.

01:33:23.795 --> 01:33:26.595
<v Speaker 1>So I modified our cluster deployment to add

01:33:26.595 --> 01:33:28.115
<v Speaker 1>the owner Rawkode label.

01:33:29.715 --> 01:33:30.995
<v Speaker 1>And then

01:33:31.130 --> 01:33:34.169
<v Speaker 1>Mhmm. And then updated our multicluster

01:33:34.170 --> 01:33:36.650
<v Speaker 1>service with match labels owner of Rawkode. So

01:33:36.650 --> 01:33:37.610
<v Speaker 1>this should,

01:33:39.690 --> 01:33:42.090
<v Speaker 1>I believe, just deploy the thing that I

01:33:42.090 --> 01:33:42.729
<v Speaker 2>want. Okay.

01:33:44.650 --> 01:33:46.010
<v Speaker 2>Did you update the version?

01:33:49.105 --> 01:33:51.265
<v Speaker 1>The version of what? Sorry. The version numb

01:33:51.344 --> 01:33:51.505
<v Speaker 2>it

01:33:54.705 --> 01:33:56.705
<v Speaker 2>go back into the yeah. Go back in

01:33:56.705 --> 01:33:56.945
<v Speaker 2>there.

01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:06.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't see a version. Maybe I'll just

01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:08.240
<v Speaker 1>describe it again. It's in the it'd be

01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:09.440
<v Speaker 2>in the cluster template.

01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:13.760
<v Speaker 1>I have not modified the cluster template. Okay.

01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:16.720
<v Speaker 2>Just okay. Alright. I modified the cluster deployment.

01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:17.600
<v Speaker 1>It does

01:34:17.905 --> 01:34:19.425
<v Speaker 1>does have my label.

01:34:20.145 --> 01:34:20.864
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

01:34:20.945 --> 01:34:21.825
<v Speaker 2>I mean,

01:34:23.025 --> 01:34:24.465
<v Speaker 1>it can yell at me.

01:34:27.345 --> 01:34:28.625
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what I've just done.

01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:35.640
<v Speaker 1>Alright. I'll just scrape it.

01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:39.480
<v Speaker 1>Ingress.

01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:45.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's doing it. There we go. Well,

01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:47.000
<v Speaker 1>it's also now applying

01:34:47.455 --> 01:34:48.255
<v Speaker 1>provisioning

01:34:48.255 --> 01:34:50.735
<v Speaker 1>our Helm chart on the target cluster.

01:34:52.415 --> 01:34:55.295
<v Speaker 1>So when I ran that cluster deployment wide,

01:34:55.375 --> 01:34:57.775
<v Speaker 1>it does say services zero zero. So

01:35:01.180 --> 01:35:02.860
<v Speaker 1>that looks like it's released.

01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:07.580
<v Speaker 1>Still getting zero there. However, if I pop

01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:09.340
<v Speaker 1>over to my other cluster,

01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:11.100
<v Speaker 1>to the workload cluster.

01:35:11.260 --> 01:35:13.100
<v Speaker 2>Let's see. We do have an

01:35:14.220 --> 01:35:16.675
<v Speaker 1>NGINX running. So I mean, that that's pretty

01:35:16.675 --> 01:35:17.235
<v Speaker 1>sweet.

01:35:17.635 --> 01:35:18.515
<v Speaker 1>Very cool.

01:35:19.955 --> 01:35:22.595
<v Speaker 1>And we're now an hour over an hour

01:35:22.595 --> 01:35:23.875
<v Speaker 1>and a half in, and we haven't even

01:35:23.875 --> 01:35:26.275
<v Speaker 1>touched on the observability stuff. Like, I mean,

01:35:26.275 --> 01:35:27.795
<v Speaker 1>there's just so much for us to cover

01:35:27.795 --> 01:35:28.515
<v Speaker 1>on this project.

01:35:29.550 --> 01:35:31.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean, we'd you know, happy to come

01:35:31.710 --> 01:35:34.350
<v Speaker 2>back, and and I can I can drive

01:35:34.350 --> 01:35:36.190
<v Speaker 2>a little bit so you so you can

01:35:36.190 --> 01:35:38.590
<v Speaker 2>kick back and relax? But it was a

01:35:38.590 --> 01:35:39.469
<v Speaker 2>lot of fun

01:35:40.110 --> 01:35:42.830
<v Speaker 2>seeing you dive in and getting this

01:35:44.284 --> 01:35:46.525
<v Speaker 2>up and running super quickly.

01:35:46.605 --> 01:35:47.244
<v Speaker 2>Right?

01:35:48.364 --> 01:35:49.005
<v Speaker 2>So

01:35:49.244 --> 01:35:49.804
<v Speaker 2>yeah.

01:35:50.284 --> 01:35:52.925
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Let me pop us back over to

01:35:53.885 --> 01:35:54.604
<v Speaker 1>Facebook.

01:35:56.685 --> 01:36:00.230
<v Speaker 1>So we covered a lot. Important project is

01:36:00.870 --> 01:36:03.030
<v Speaker 1>integrates with the whole ecosystem

01:36:03.030 --> 01:36:04.710
<v Speaker 1>and the cloud providers to give you a

01:36:04.710 --> 01:36:08.230
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes cluster. It allows you to define

01:36:08.230 --> 01:36:12.470
<v Speaker 1>cluster templates, cluster deployments, service templates, multicluster services,

01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:13.830
<v Speaker 1>web cluster selectors.

01:36:14.525 --> 01:36:16.445
<v Speaker 1>And now it's just scratching what I feel

01:36:16.445 --> 01:36:19.405
<v Speaker 1>is part of project. It's been just on

01:36:19.405 --> 01:36:21.564
<v Speaker 1>what you've talked about and the documentation.

01:36:21.645 --> 01:36:22.124
<v Speaker 1>So

01:36:22.764 --> 01:36:25.244
<v Speaker 1>we know there's an observability bit built in

01:36:25.244 --> 01:36:27.165
<v Speaker 1>with OpenCost as well for FinOps,

01:36:27.829 --> 01:36:29.829
<v Speaker 1>but this is also a very young open

01:36:29.829 --> 01:36:30.869
<v Speaker 1>source project.

01:36:31.269 --> 01:36:32.949
<v Speaker 1>Mhmm. I mean, there's a road map. I'm

01:36:32.949 --> 01:36:34.949
<v Speaker 1>assuming you've got a thousand ideas or maybe

01:36:34.949 --> 01:36:35.589
<v Speaker 1>more.

01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:37.829
<v Speaker 1>Can you just give us an idea about

01:36:37.989 --> 01:36:39.989
<v Speaker 1>the status of the project right now and

01:36:39.989 --> 01:36:41.510
<v Speaker 1>where you plan to take it over the

01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:44.034
<v Speaker 1>next three, six, or nine months there?

01:36:44.355 --> 01:36:44.835
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:36:46.675 --> 01:36:49.395
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. You know, we are

01:36:51.555 --> 01:36:52.594
<v Speaker 2>putting more

01:36:52.835 --> 01:36:55.955
<v Speaker 2>effort into Coordinate. So we're we're adding more,

01:36:57.890 --> 01:36:58.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,

01:36:59.170 --> 01:37:00.530
<v Speaker 2>developer engineering.

01:37:00.690 --> 01:37:02.610
<v Speaker 2>One of the big things we're doing right

01:37:02.610 --> 01:37:03.170
<v Speaker 2>now

01:37:03.490 --> 01:37:05.730
<v Speaker 2>is trying to promote this as an open

01:37:05.730 --> 01:37:07.650
<v Speaker 2>source project as well because

01:37:09.170 --> 01:37:10.770
<v Speaker 2>Cordant shouldn't be

01:37:11.090 --> 01:37:12.530
<v Speaker 2>a momentous

01:37:12.545 --> 01:37:14.784
<v Speaker 2>thing. It should be something that, you know,

01:37:14.784 --> 01:37:17.264
<v Speaker 2>the community leverages and and does.

01:37:19.105 --> 01:37:22.624
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile, road map. I sort of talked

01:37:22.945 --> 01:37:24.224
<v Speaker 2>through some of them.

01:37:24.784 --> 01:37:25.425
<v Speaker 2>KubeVirt,

01:37:26.620 --> 01:37:28.940
<v Speaker 2>cloud hypervisor for us are very, very important.

01:37:29.340 --> 01:37:31.260
<v Speaker 2>We think that you should be able to

01:37:31.739 --> 01:37:34.780
<v Speaker 2>treat those just like any other node.

01:37:35.260 --> 01:37:37.420
<v Speaker 2>So that that'll be coming out very, very

01:37:37.420 --> 01:37:38.059
<v Speaker 2>soon.

01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:42.605
<v Speaker 2>I did touch on the coordinate policy management,

01:37:43.005 --> 01:37:45.165
<v Speaker 2>same sort of thing where you want to

01:37:45.165 --> 01:37:46.445
<v Speaker 2>be able to abstract,

01:37:48.285 --> 01:37:49.085
<v Speaker 2>policy

01:37:49.165 --> 01:37:49.885
<v Speaker 2>and

01:37:50.045 --> 01:37:53.005
<v Speaker 2>use the right languages, the right policy tools

01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:56.400
<v Speaker 2>for things. Right? So it's not a converner

01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:57.439
<v Speaker 2>versus

01:37:57.520 --> 01:37:58.479
<v Speaker 2>OPA

01:37:58.960 --> 01:37:59.919
<v Speaker 2>gatekeeper.

01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:02.000
<v Speaker 2>It is some of your policy is one,

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.519
<v Speaker 2>some of your policy is another.

01:38:04.159 --> 01:38:06.320
<v Speaker 2>We'll start with those two.

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:08.559
<v Speaker 2>And then as

01:38:09.255 --> 01:38:11.495
<v Speaker 2>we build that out, then we'll look at

01:38:11.495 --> 01:38:13.335
<v Speaker 2>things like Cube Warden. So

01:38:13.575 --> 01:38:15.975
<v Speaker 2>that's a direction we're going in as well.

01:38:16.295 --> 01:38:19.015
<v Speaker 2>We're looking at how do we invest on

01:38:19.015 --> 01:38:20.615
<v Speaker 2>the networking side too.

01:38:22.050 --> 01:38:23.649
<v Speaker 2>If you start thinking about

01:38:24.770 --> 01:38:26.050
<v Speaker 2>having Cordon

01:38:26.530 --> 01:38:27.729
<v Speaker 2>able to,

01:38:28.369 --> 01:38:30.610
<v Speaker 2>you know, provision anywhere,

01:38:31.010 --> 01:38:31.649
<v Speaker 2>theoretically,

01:38:32.130 --> 01:38:34.050
<v Speaker 2>you can start looking at, well, I could

01:38:34.050 --> 01:38:34.290
<v Speaker 2>have

01:38:35.405 --> 01:38:35.885
<v Speaker 2>a cluster

01:38:36.925 --> 01:38:39.405
<v Speaker 2>manager a child cluster child

01:38:40.205 --> 01:38:42.685
<v Speaker 2>control plane on AWS,

01:38:42.685 --> 01:38:44.045
<v Speaker 2>but maybe I wanna spin the notes up

01:38:44.045 --> 01:38:46.285
<v Speaker 2>on Hertzner because they're super cheap today.

01:38:47.090 --> 01:38:48.850
<v Speaker 2>Right, and to be able to do some

01:38:48.850 --> 01:38:51.250
<v Speaker 2>of that. So we're trying to put that

01:38:51.250 --> 01:38:53.330
<v Speaker 2>together and figure out how do we do

01:38:53.330 --> 01:38:53.810
<v Speaker 2>this

01:38:54.450 --> 01:38:55.490
<v Speaker 2>so that it's seamless.

01:38:58.975 --> 01:39:01.375
<v Speaker 2>And, of course, we're going to be rolling

01:39:01.375 --> 01:39:02.735
<v Speaker 2>out a UI

01:39:03.295 --> 01:39:05.054
<v Speaker 2>in the next two or three months.

01:39:05.455 --> 01:39:06.414
<v Speaker 2>Doing that,

01:39:07.055 --> 01:39:08.815
<v Speaker 2>part of that is,

01:39:09.135 --> 01:39:11.135
<v Speaker 2>to not develop a UI

01:39:11.935 --> 01:39:15.270
<v Speaker 2>for the platform engineering teams but for their

01:39:15.270 --> 01:39:16.630
<v Speaker 2>internal customers

01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:19.909
<v Speaker 2>so that a development manager can go

01:39:20.230 --> 01:39:21.270
<v Speaker 2>and build,

01:39:21.430 --> 01:39:24.389
<v Speaker 2>you know, through through a UI, through UX,

01:39:24.710 --> 01:39:25.750
<v Speaker 2>able to build

01:39:27.645 --> 01:39:29.645
<v Speaker 2>another cluster for them to spin up for

01:39:29.645 --> 01:39:30.204
<v Speaker 2>a CID

01:39:30.525 --> 01:39:33.165
<v Speaker 2>CICD test of whatever the whatever it is

01:39:33.165 --> 01:39:36.124
<v Speaker 2>they're doing. And because of the credentials,

01:39:36.364 --> 01:39:37.724
<v Speaker 2>you can then provide

01:39:38.525 --> 01:39:41.989
<v Speaker 2>one group access to certain clusters or resources

01:39:41.989 --> 01:39:43.829
<v Speaker 2>and another group different ones.

01:39:44.230 --> 01:39:45.909
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's where it's gonna get

01:39:45.909 --> 01:39:47.909
<v Speaker 2>a lot of fun being able to show

01:39:47.909 --> 01:39:48.629
<v Speaker 2>how

01:39:49.190 --> 01:39:50.229
<v Speaker 2>you're enabling

01:39:50.550 --> 01:39:51.030
<v Speaker 2>different

01:39:51.715 --> 01:39:53.475
<v Speaker 2>teams inside of your

01:39:53.635 --> 01:39:55.555
<v Speaker 2>company to be able to or organization to

01:39:55.555 --> 01:39:57.635
<v Speaker 2>be able to do things independently.

01:39:59.075 --> 01:40:00.995
<v Speaker 1>Nice. Simplified it. Yep.

01:40:01.315 --> 01:40:02.035
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

01:40:03.395 --> 01:40:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So I think we wrap with maybe

01:40:05.970 --> 01:40:08.370
<v Speaker 3>a question from my end. You ran through

01:40:08.370 --> 01:40:11.570
<v Speaker 3>Cordent. You spent, like, an hour with Cordent

01:40:11.570 --> 01:40:12.610
<v Speaker 3>documentation

01:40:12.610 --> 01:40:13.570
<v Speaker 3>and everything.

01:40:14.690 --> 01:40:16.450
<v Speaker 3>If you had a feedback and if you

01:40:16.450 --> 01:40:19.330
<v Speaker 3>had something to comment on Cordent's future or

01:40:19.330 --> 01:40:20.450
<v Speaker 3>what would you like to see

01:40:21.105 --> 01:40:23.905
<v Speaker 3>with Gordon? What would that be? Like, this

01:40:23.905 --> 01:40:25.184
<v Speaker 3>is a question to you.

01:40:25.665 --> 01:40:28.065
<v Speaker 1>Putting me on the spot, man. Come on.

01:40:28.065 --> 01:40:29.184
<v Speaker 1>I

01:40:30.065 --> 01:40:30.704
<v Speaker 1>think

01:40:32.785 --> 01:40:34.305
<v Speaker 1>I mean, it's it's it's just one of

01:40:34.305 --> 01:40:38.510
<v Speaker 1>those spaces where Kubernetes needs more tools like

01:40:38.510 --> 01:40:38.989
<v Speaker 1>this.

01:40:39.470 --> 01:40:40.270
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes

01:40:41.070 --> 01:40:44.190
<v Speaker 1>does need to be easier. And, you know,

01:40:44.350 --> 01:40:46.350
<v Speaker 1>at KubeCon London, again,

01:40:46.670 --> 01:40:48.755
<v Speaker 1>a month ago ish, you know, I just

01:40:48.755 --> 01:40:50.595
<v Speaker 1>spent the first day running around with my

01:40:50.595 --> 01:40:52.995
<v Speaker 1>camera asking people how many Kubernetes clusters do

01:40:52.995 --> 01:40:54.595
<v Speaker 1>you have? And, you know, the majority of

01:40:54.595 --> 01:40:56.195
<v Speaker 1>them said one. And I said, because you

01:40:56.195 --> 01:40:58.915
<v Speaker 1>want one or because you can only really

01:40:58.915 --> 01:41:01.170
<v Speaker 1>run one. And a consensus, I still want

01:41:01.170 --> 01:41:02.690
<v Speaker 1>more than one cluster, but they can't be

01:41:02.690 --> 01:41:04.770
<v Speaker 1>gone in operational overhead to do that. Again,

01:41:04.770 --> 01:41:07.250
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people, their maturity of Kubernetes

01:41:07.250 --> 01:41:09.090
<v Speaker 1>is still relatively early.

01:41:09.490 --> 01:41:11.650
<v Speaker 1>So it's a big commitment to do that.

01:41:11.650 --> 01:41:13.490
<v Speaker 1>And and some of the challenges are networking

01:41:13.490 --> 01:41:15.664
<v Speaker 1>with multi cluster and routing and some of

01:41:15.664 --> 01:41:17.264
<v Speaker 1>the challenges are speed on.

01:41:18.145 --> 01:41:20.064
<v Speaker 1>Some of the challenges is just

01:41:21.025 --> 01:41:23.824
<v Speaker 1>policy across multiple clusters. And then there's the

01:41:23.824 --> 01:41:24.465
<v Speaker 1>whole

01:41:24.625 --> 01:41:27.105
<v Speaker 1>RBAC and who can access which cluster and

01:41:27.105 --> 01:41:28.224
<v Speaker 1>can they access names pages,

01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:30.070
<v Speaker 1>like multitenancies

01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:32.390
<v Speaker 1>and other big things. So all of this

01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:33.190
<v Speaker 1>is hard,

01:41:33.670 --> 01:41:35.190
<v Speaker 1>and what we need are projects that can

01:41:35.190 --> 01:41:37.430
<v Speaker 1>come along and say, okay. Look. You need

01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:38.950
<v Speaker 1>to be able to just describe your cluster

01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:41.030
<v Speaker 1>at once. You spin it up. It works.

01:41:41.574 --> 01:41:44.054
<v Speaker 1>It ships Valero. It handles the disaster recovery

01:41:44.054 --> 01:41:45.974
<v Speaker 1>aspect, and we start to remove a lot

01:41:45.974 --> 01:41:47.574
<v Speaker 1>of the toil of day two.

01:41:47.974 --> 01:41:48.534
<v Speaker 1>So

01:41:49.014 --> 01:41:51.895
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of room for improvement, and

01:41:51.895 --> 01:41:53.815
<v Speaker 1>everyone is trying to do this today because

01:41:53.815 --> 01:41:54.775
<v Speaker 1>it's still so early.

01:41:55.420 --> 01:41:57.260
<v Speaker 1>Now that's not direct feedback, just that I

01:41:57.260 --> 01:41:58.940
<v Speaker 1>think you're on the right path and the

01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:01.180
<v Speaker 1>easier you can make this for teams to

01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:03.420
<v Speaker 1>go from one huge cluster. It doesn't even

01:42:03.420 --> 01:42:04.620
<v Speaker 1>need to be it could be four nodes.

01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Right? Either way, one cluster. One. Yeah. Help

01:42:07.260 --> 01:42:09.695
<v Speaker 1>people get to have maybe two or maybe

01:42:09.695 --> 01:42:11.775
<v Speaker 1>three. Just allow them to bring them in

01:42:11.775 --> 01:42:13.375
<v Speaker 1>as they need and and spend them back

01:42:13.375 --> 01:42:15.455
<v Speaker 1>down and move the workloads around and give

01:42:15.455 --> 01:42:16.655
<v Speaker 1>them that true

01:42:17.055 --> 01:42:19.135
<v Speaker 1>control over where things run, when they run,

01:42:19.135 --> 01:42:21.135
<v Speaker 1>and for whatever. Like, that is the future,

01:42:21.135 --> 01:42:22.415
<v Speaker 1>and it's how do we get there, and

01:42:22.415 --> 01:42:23.599
<v Speaker 1>it's tools like this. So

01:42:24.639 --> 01:42:26.800
<v Speaker 2>Thank you. That's good feedback.

01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:29.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I don't know if it was feedback

01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:32.719
<v Speaker 1>or avoiding the question, but trying to

01:42:33.119 --> 01:42:35.679
<v Speaker 2>No. I think your answer I mean, that's

01:42:35.679 --> 01:42:37.360
<v Speaker 2>the that's the goal. Right? Is how do

01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:40.005
<v Speaker 2>we make take this complexity, make it simpler.

01:42:40.645 --> 01:42:41.125
<v Speaker 2>And

01:42:41.685 --> 01:42:43.605
<v Speaker 2>you know? I think, you know and and

01:42:43.605 --> 01:42:45.605
<v Speaker 1>templates are really important. I mean, I hate

01:42:45.605 --> 01:42:47.285
<v Speaker 1>that phrase. It's it's it's overused. Right? But

01:42:47.285 --> 01:42:48.565
<v Speaker 1>it is really relevant in a lot of

01:42:48.565 --> 01:42:49.845
<v Speaker 1>these projects. Is it we need to be

01:42:49.845 --> 01:42:51.525
<v Speaker 1>able to give people opinions on how to

01:42:51.525 --> 01:42:54.160
<v Speaker 1>do things. Everybody thinks the Kubernetes cluster is

01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:56.960
<v Speaker 1>bespoke and artisanal and handcrafted and all this

01:42:56.960 --> 01:42:59.360
<v Speaker 1>nonsense when really everyone just needs a CRI,

01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:00.800
<v Speaker 1>a network and implementation,

01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:02.159
<v Speaker 1>backups,

01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:03.840
<v Speaker 1>and observability.

01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:05.440
<v Speaker 1>Right? The ability to get metrics, logs, and

01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:07.120
<v Speaker 1>traces from all the workloads into a single

01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:08.824
<v Speaker 1>pane of glass. All of that stuff is

01:43:08.824 --> 01:43:09.864
<v Speaker 1>the same for everyone,

01:43:10.745 --> 01:43:13.864
<v Speaker 1>but the plumbing underneath it can be different

01:43:13.864 --> 01:43:16.344
<v Speaker 1>for everyone. GCP customers, it's the same. AWS

01:43:16.344 --> 01:43:18.505
<v Speaker 1>customers, same hybrid architectures,

01:43:18.665 --> 01:43:21.100
<v Speaker 1>multi cloud, all of this. And, like, as

01:43:21.100 --> 01:43:23.420
<v Speaker 1>this matures and these tools, like and there's

01:43:23.420 --> 01:43:24.700
<v Speaker 1>a couple of tools in this space. Right?

01:43:24.700 --> 01:43:25.739
<v Speaker 1>But as they all

01:43:26.060 --> 01:43:26.940
<v Speaker 1>work together,

01:43:27.340 --> 01:43:28.460
<v Speaker 1>have standards,

01:43:28.620 --> 01:43:30.059
<v Speaker 1>compete, progress,

01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:32.059
<v Speaker 1>like the standard dev tech

01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:34.635
<v Speaker 1>cycle of a project, This gets better for

01:43:34.635 --> 01:43:35.995
<v Speaker 1>the end user, and I think that is

01:43:35.995 --> 01:43:37.915
<v Speaker 1>really exciting. So, you know, keep up the

01:43:37.915 --> 01:43:39.675
<v Speaker 1>great work. Keep pushing us forward and trying

01:43:39.675 --> 01:43:41.435
<v Speaker 1>to make people's lives easier. I think that's

01:43:41.435 --> 01:43:42.955
<v Speaker 1>a very noble mission, and you're off to

01:43:42.955 --> 01:43:44.715
<v Speaker 1>a great start. So Well,

01:43:45.035 --> 01:43:46.395
<v Speaker 2>and we wouldn't be here if it wasn't

01:43:46.395 --> 01:43:47.515
<v Speaker 2>for all the hard work in

01:43:47.940 --> 01:43:50.100
<v Speaker 2>CAPI or or

01:43:50.100 --> 01:43:52.740
<v Speaker 2>any of these other projects that we're, you

01:43:52.740 --> 01:43:55.540
<v Speaker 2>know, taking advantage of. So yeah.

01:43:55.940 --> 01:43:56.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:43:56.820 --> 01:43:58.740
<v Speaker 1>As we say, you know, open source stands

01:43:58.740 --> 01:44:01.575
<v Speaker 1>on the shoulders of other open source giants.

01:44:01.575 --> 01:44:03.095
<v Speaker 1>So it's all built on top of Linux.

01:44:03.095 --> 01:44:04.455
<v Speaker 1>It's all built on top of c groups.

01:44:04.455 --> 01:44:06.935
<v Speaker 1>It's then built on top of OCI now.

01:44:06.935 --> 01:44:09.335
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, let's just keep innovating and pushing

01:44:09.335 --> 01:44:11.575
<v Speaker 1>things forward. That's all we can do. Alright.

01:44:14.110 --> 01:44:15.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm lower than we expected, but I had

01:44:15.630 --> 01:44:16.750
<v Speaker 1>a whole lot of fun. I really wanna

01:44:16.750 --> 01:44:18.190
<v Speaker 1>say thank you for joining me, for taking

01:44:18.190 --> 01:44:19.870
<v Speaker 1>time out of your days to set and

01:44:19.950 --> 01:44:20.510
<v Speaker 1>you know?

01:44:21.150 --> 01:44:22.830
<v Speaker 1>This is the most hands on I've been

01:44:22.830 --> 01:44:24.030
<v Speaker 1>in a while. I was set for building

01:44:24.030 --> 01:44:25.710
<v Speaker 1>my own stuff, so it was a that

01:44:25.710 --> 01:44:27.630
<v Speaker 1>was pure joy for me all the way

01:44:27.630 --> 01:44:29.295
<v Speaker 1>through. And I'll give you a moment to

01:44:29.295 --> 01:44:31.295
<v Speaker 1>say any last words for the audience before

01:44:31.295 --> 01:44:32.895
<v Speaker 1>we we we close this up?

01:44:34.895 --> 01:44:37.535
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I would just like project. Right? Yep.

01:44:37.935 --> 01:44:38.655
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.

01:44:39.535 --> 01:44:41.535
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. Just like to share that. Take a

01:44:41.535 --> 01:44:44.119
<v Speaker 3>look at the project, and we wanted to

01:44:44.119 --> 01:44:46.040
<v Speaker 3>be on the Kubernetes Slack, but that's, like,

01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:47.639
<v Speaker 3>completely stacked. So

01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:51.079
<v Speaker 3>the cordon channel is on the CNCF Slack

01:44:51.079 --> 01:44:51.800
<v Speaker 3>for now

01:44:52.199 --> 01:44:54.760
<v Speaker 3>because that's where we found the space. So

01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:57.639
<v Speaker 3>that's still up to discussion whether the project

01:44:57.639 --> 01:45:00.545
<v Speaker 3>gets donated or not, and we'll see where

01:45:00.545 --> 01:45:03.025
<v Speaker 3>things go. But, yeah, the project is developing.

01:45:03.025 --> 01:45:04.385
<v Speaker 3>We are hoping for

01:45:05.105 --> 01:45:07.585
<v Speaker 3>more new releases, more contributions.

01:45:07.665 --> 01:45:10.784
<v Speaker 3>So feel free to join the Cordon channel

01:45:10.784 --> 01:45:13.430
<v Speaker 3>on the CNCS Slack, and, yeah, put in

01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:15.510
<v Speaker 3>your feedback, your issues,

01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:19.430
<v Speaker 3>or or anything you have as a community

01:45:19.590 --> 01:45:21.830
<v Speaker 3>comment on this episode itself,

01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:26.175
<v Speaker 3>the Rawkode Academy channel, and, yeah, keep supporting

01:45:26.335 --> 01:45:28.495
<v Speaker 3>David's work as well. He's been doing a

01:45:28.495 --> 01:45:29.614
<v Speaker 3>phenomenal job.

01:45:30.655 --> 01:45:31.295
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

01:45:31.535 --> 01:45:34.095
<v Speaker 1>Awesome. I am gonna push the button to

01:45:34.095 --> 01:45:35.775
<v Speaker 1>move us to the goodbye tune. I hope

01:45:35.775 --> 01:45:37.455
<v Speaker 1>you all enjoy. I'm gonna go delete a

01:45:37.455 --> 01:45:39.695
<v Speaker 1>service account before any of your roguelikes get

01:45:39.695 --> 01:45:41.470
<v Speaker 1>onto that, and that we'll see you all

01:45:41.470 --> 01:45:42.990
<v Speaker 1>next time. Thank you so much. Have a

01:45:42.990 --> 01:45:44.030
<v Speaker 1>great day. Bye.

01:45:58.595 --> 01:46:02.275
