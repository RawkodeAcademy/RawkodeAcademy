00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.839
<v Speaker 0>Welcome to the journey

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:14.559
<v Speaker 1>so grand.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.920
<v Speaker 1>Lines of code we start to weave.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.745
<v Speaker 1>In this world, we do believe Daytona

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:20.905
<v Speaker 1>shining through the night.

00:01:21.305 --> 00:01:22.745
<v Speaker 1>Local magic,

00:01:22.745 --> 00:01:23.865
<v Speaker 1>pure delight.

00:01:24.425 --> 00:01:26.985
<v Speaker 1>Ivan's wisdom lights the path.

00:01:27.465 --> 00:01:30.265
<v Speaker 1>Steering clear of coding wrath

00:01:30.345 --> 00:01:31.625
<v Speaker 1>with this

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.410
<v Speaker 0>Hello, and welcome back to the Rawkode Academy.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.650
<v Speaker 0>I'm your host, David Flanagan, also known across

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.170
<v Speaker 0>the Internet as Rawkode.

00:03:06.825 --> 00:03:09.224
<v Speaker 0>Today, we continue our Rawkode live series where

00:03:09.224 --> 00:03:11.065
<v Speaker 0>we take a look at future facing cloud

00:03:11.065 --> 00:03:14.425
<v Speaker 0>native technologies to simplify your cloud native journey.

00:03:14.665 --> 00:03:16.905
<v Speaker 0>Today is no exception. We are joining

00:03:17.305 --> 00:03:19.944
<v Speaker 0>the well, blah. Let me try and find

00:03:19.944 --> 00:03:21.890
<v Speaker 0>the words. I am being joined by the

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.290
<v Speaker 0>Daytona team to take a look at simplifying

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.210
<v Speaker 0>your development environments.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.650
<v Speaker 0>Joining us today

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:28.530
<v Speaker 0>is

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 0>Ivan.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.210
<v Speaker 0>Hey, man. How's it going?

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.250
<v Speaker 2>Pretty good. Thank you. Great to have you.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.930
<v Speaker 2>It's always fun to have these,

00:03:37.865 --> 00:03:39.705
<v Speaker 2>what, blurbs in the video so people know

00:03:39.705 --> 00:03:41.625
<v Speaker 2>it's, like, real. It's not prerecorded. So, like,

00:03:41.625 --> 00:03:43.625
<v Speaker 2>everything that we're doing is live. Everything that

00:03:43.625 --> 00:03:44.665
<v Speaker 2>we screw up,

00:03:45.145 --> 00:03:46.985
<v Speaker 2>you know, it happens. It's like so it's

00:03:46.985 --> 00:03:48.985
<v Speaker 2>great. I was just talking when we were,

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.599
<v Speaker 2>before we got live, it's like, I do,

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:52.959
<v Speaker 2>like, a demo a day at least. And

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.400
<v Speaker 2>then I was, like, at a huge conference.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.760
<v Speaker 2>A thousand people are watching, and my demo

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.280
<v Speaker 2>broke. So, you know, it is what it

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.000
<v Speaker 2>is. So it's live. So welcome, everyone. Super

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.040
<v Speaker 2>happy to be here.

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:01.760
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:04:02.645 --> 00:04:03.765
<v Speaker 0>As as

00:04:03.765 --> 00:04:05.765
<v Speaker 0>said previously, I've done over 432

00:04:05.765 --> 00:04:07.925
<v Speaker 0>of these, and there's probably 900 errors at

00:04:07.925 --> 00:04:08.885
<v Speaker 0>least. So

00:04:09.925 --> 00:04:12.645
<v Speaker 0>those those those are really making fun. Anyway,

00:04:13.365 --> 00:04:15.365
<v Speaker 0>for anyone who's not familiar, let's start with

00:04:15.365 --> 00:04:16.690
<v Speaker 0>you. Can you give us a little bit

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.130
<v Speaker 0>of information on who you are and what

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.890
<v Speaker 0>you've been up to? Sure. My name is

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.770
<v Speaker 2>Ivan, cofounder and CEO of Daytona.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.570
<v Speaker 2>Did a bunch of things in my career.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.050
<v Speaker 2>Probably what's relevant to the conversation that we're

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.970
<v Speaker 2>having right now is that the cofounding team

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.285
<v Speaker 2>of of Daytona, which is about fifteen months

00:04:32.285 --> 00:04:33.005
<v Speaker 2>old now,

00:04:33.405 --> 00:04:36.125
<v Speaker 2>was also the cofounding team of Code Anywhere.

00:04:36.205 --> 00:04:38.925
<v Speaker 2>So Code Anywhere was the, as far as

00:04:38.925 --> 00:04:40.845
<v Speaker 2>I fact checked, I always say this a

00:04:40.845 --> 00:04:43.885
<v Speaker 2>bit, the very first browser based IDE

00:04:43.885 --> 00:04:44.925
<v Speaker 2>ever in the world.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.180
<v Speaker 2>And so we did that in 02/2009 before

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.540
<v Speaker 2>there was web two point o. Just to

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.660
<v Speaker 2>be clear, there was no, like

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.540
<v Speaker 2>there was no nothing you could really do

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.100
<v Speaker 2>in the browser then. It was basically a

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.660
<v Speaker 2>white notepad and FTP server and whatnot FTP

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.035
<v Speaker 2>connector. As WebPoint two came out, we could

00:05:01.035 --> 00:05:02.634
<v Speaker 2>do syntax highlighting and all these things in

00:05:02.634 --> 00:05:04.235
<v Speaker 2>the browser. So we

00:05:05.194 --> 00:05:07.595
<v Speaker 2>sort of were the first that started this

00:05:07.595 --> 00:05:09.835
<v Speaker 2>whole journey into bringing,

00:05:09.995 --> 00:05:11.675
<v Speaker 2>you know, dev environments

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.129
<v Speaker 2>off the local host or, let's say, at

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:18.009
<v Speaker 2>least trying to simplify them least successful before,

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:18.650
<v Speaker 2>hopefully,

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.250
<v Speaker 2>more successful this time around?

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.889
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I mean, I think that's really important.

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:24.169
<v Speaker 0>I mean, if we look at the landscape

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:26.965
<v Speaker 0>today and cloud native development with microservices

00:05:26.965 --> 00:05:29.765
<v Speaker 0>and, you know, polyglot runtimes and languages and

00:05:29.765 --> 00:05:32.085
<v Speaker 0>our services and databases

00:05:32.085 --> 00:05:34.885
<v Speaker 0>from every other new startup vendor, like,

00:05:35.285 --> 00:05:37.365
<v Speaker 0>local environments is probably in fact, they're not

00:05:37.365 --> 00:05:40.290
<v Speaker 0>possible anymore, you know, depending on what magic

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.970
<v Speaker 0>people are trying to work out. But I

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.290
<v Speaker 0>think cloud based environments are where we need

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.410
<v Speaker 0>to be, and I'm hoping that we can

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:46.770
<v Speaker 0>show people a really good way to do

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:47.490
<v Speaker 0>that today.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I mean, it so so

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.650
<v Speaker 2>I was just gonna add on that, though,

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.570
<v Speaker 2>like, I feel that history has changed quite

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.215
<v Speaker 2>a bit. I mean, back in the day

00:05:55.295 --> 00:05:56.975
<v Speaker 2>there's back back in the day. But, like,

00:05:57.215 --> 00:06:00.095
<v Speaker 2>back in my day, we used IDEs,

00:06:00.255 --> 00:06:02.255
<v Speaker 2>and the name basically meant integrated dev environment

00:06:02.255 --> 00:06:02.655
<v Speaker 2>because

00:06:03.615 --> 00:06:07.295
<v Speaker 2>you had, like, Eclipse or IntelliJ or Visual

00:06:07.295 --> 00:06:10.110
<v Speaker 2>Studio and installed everything on there. And when

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.790
<v Speaker 2>you wrote code, you hit run, it worked

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.630
<v Speaker 2>because it had all the dependencies that you

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.030
<v Speaker 2>needed there for the most part. Whereas, like,

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.510
<v Speaker 2>fast forward today, because of everything we've done,

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.390
<v Speaker 2>microservices and whatnot, like, you can't do these

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.870
<v Speaker 2>things

00:06:22.355 --> 00:06:24.115
<v Speaker 2>or you can't have a prepackaged

00:06:24.115 --> 00:06:26.355
<v Speaker 2>IDE for that. So, basically, we mostly most

00:06:26.355 --> 00:06:28.195
<v Speaker 2>of us use Versus Code, which is just

00:06:28.195 --> 00:06:29.955
<v Speaker 2>a text editor on steroids.

00:06:30.275 --> 00:06:32.595
<v Speaker 2>And now the complexities of setting up the

00:06:32.595 --> 00:06:35.315
<v Speaker 2>dev environment is off on you or us

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.460
<v Speaker 2>or me and whatnot. And so we're hoping

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.820
<v Speaker 2>with Daytona to get a bit of that

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.460
<v Speaker 2>feel and magic back where it's, like, as

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.900
<v Speaker 2>simple as it can be, and you just

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.900
<v Speaker 2>focus on the coding and let, you know,

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.660
<v Speaker 2>offset all the dependencies to someone else.

00:06:47.535 --> 00:06:49.615
<v Speaker 0>Nice. I mean, I'm sold already. But, anyway,

00:06:49.615 --> 00:06:51.295
<v Speaker 0>we should still do the demo, I think.

00:06:52.095 --> 00:06:53.695
<v Speaker 0>Now I've got some questions for you, but

00:06:53.695 --> 00:06:55.695
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna let Kanal head in first because

00:06:55.695 --> 00:06:57.935
<v Speaker 0>he beat me to the punch, and it's

00:06:57.935 --> 00:06:59.215
<v Speaker 0>relevant to what you said. He wants to

00:06:59.215 --> 00:07:00.415
<v Speaker 0>know what conference you're going to next.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.750
<v Speaker 2>So what conference? I have not booked conferences.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.750
<v Speaker 2>So to be fair, the last conference I

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.030
<v Speaker 2>was at was shift shift in Croatia because

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.550
<v Speaker 2>I found that one. It's not mine anymore,

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.070
<v Speaker 2>but I found it. So I went.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.065
<v Speaker 2>And there's so many conferences to go to,

00:07:15.065 --> 00:07:18.025
<v Speaker 2>and I'm basically a conference junkie. It's just,

00:07:18.025 --> 00:07:19.465
<v Speaker 2>like, trying to eat heads down.

00:07:21.065 --> 00:07:23.385
<v Speaker 0>That means for CubeCon, though. Come on. Right?

00:07:23.385 --> 00:07:24.825
<v Speaker 0>You go to CubeCon? Exactly. I was gonna

00:07:24.825 --> 00:07:27.385
<v Speaker 2>say, like, I'll probably show up at CubeCon.

00:07:27.545 --> 00:07:28.825
<v Speaker 2>Like, I might not we're not gonna do

00:07:28.825 --> 00:07:30.960
<v Speaker 2>anything, but I'll land and, like, hang out.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.160
<v Speaker 2>So, I'll see you at CubeCon most likely.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Nice.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.280
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:40.240
<v Speaker 0>What's your favorite programming language?

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.000
<v Speaker 0>Not to put you on the spot, but

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.335
<v Speaker 0>I'm putting you on the spot. Yeah. You're

00:07:43.335 --> 00:07:45.015
<v Speaker 2>putting me on the spot. So what I'll

00:07:45.015 --> 00:07:47.175
<v Speaker 2>answer this in a specific way. I'll say

00:07:47.735 --> 00:07:49.495
<v Speaker 2>Daytona uses Go.

00:07:50.215 --> 00:07:52.135
<v Speaker 2>And The cloud data quality is to just

00:07:52.135 --> 00:07:54.135
<v Speaker 0>give you a tick. So Yeah. So we

00:07:54.135 --> 00:07:55.015
<v Speaker 2>use Go.

00:07:55.255 --> 00:07:56.615
<v Speaker 2>This is for the open source

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.590
<v Speaker 2>product. And for now, it's just a CLI

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.349
<v Speaker 2>tool. So everything's written in Go. It's just,

00:08:01.349 --> 00:08:02.150
<v Speaker 2>one language.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:04.389
<v Speaker 2>Go is super easy or,

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.310
<v Speaker 2>you know, as can be, and it let

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:09.750
<v Speaker 2>us lets us it's a standard in or

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.190
<v Speaker 2>very commonly used in

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.789
<v Speaker 2>cloud native

00:08:13.645 --> 00:08:15.805
<v Speaker 2>products or services that you'd find. So the

00:08:15.805 --> 00:08:17.645
<v Speaker 2>type of person that will hopefully contribute or

00:08:17.645 --> 00:08:19.565
<v Speaker 2>whatnot is already very familiar, and it lets

00:08:19.565 --> 00:08:20.925
<v Speaker 2>us do a lot of things on the

00:08:20.925 --> 00:08:22.685
<v Speaker 2>hardware level, which we have to manipulate to

00:08:22.685 --> 00:08:24.205
<v Speaker 2>have these dev environments. So

00:08:24.685 --> 00:08:26.764
<v Speaker 2>that's my answer, and I'll keep it at

00:08:26.764 --> 00:08:27.085
<v Speaker 2>that.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.780
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I mean, most people are used to

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.500
<v Speaker 0>me saying Rust 15,000 times in every episode,

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.179
<v Speaker 0>and I'm a big fan. But I I've

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:36.540
<v Speaker 0>gotta be honest. I've been playing a lot

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.620
<v Speaker 0>with Zeke lately, and there's a lot there

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.660
<v Speaker 0>too. So

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean, a lot of people when when

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.540
<v Speaker 2>they ask me this is like, well, like,

00:08:42.585 --> 00:08:44.105
<v Speaker 2>Rust, like, why aren't you guys using it

00:08:44.105 --> 00:08:45.385
<v Speaker 2>and whatnot? And then it's like,

00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:46.665
<v Speaker 2>I'll

00:08:47.305 --> 00:08:48.825
<v Speaker 2>I'll go back to my old answer, but,

00:08:48.825 --> 00:08:50.505
<v Speaker 2>like, yeah, I don't wanna open up that

00:08:50.505 --> 00:08:52.905
<v Speaker 2>can. It's definitely a thousand paper cuts. I

00:08:52.905 --> 00:08:55.385
<v Speaker 0>love what Rust gives you, but I've I

00:08:55.385 --> 00:08:56.985
<v Speaker 0>always feel like I'm like, why is this

00:08:56.985 --> 00:08:58.220
<v Speaker 0>the key? Why do I need to jump

00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:59.740
<v Speaker 0>through all of these hoops just to do

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.740
<v Speaker 0>that thing? And, of course, it's because it's,

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.500
<v Speaker 0>you know, all these data risk protections and

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.220
<v Speaker 0>memory safety. Sometimes I just wanna get stuff

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.740
<v Speaker 0>done. Anyway, I'm not getting into a rant

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.500
<v Speaker 0>today. That's not that's for another time.

00:09:10.285 --> 00:09:12.365
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We've heard about you.

00:09:12.845 --> 00:09:14.925
<v Speaker 0>You're maybe gonna go to KubeCon at least

00:09:14.925 --> 00:09:16.285
<v Speaker 0>for a beer or two.

00:09:17.005 --> 00:09:18.445
<v Speaker 0>What is Daytona?

00:09:19.165 --> 00:09:20.445
<v Speaker 2>So Daytona

00:09:20.445 --> 00:09:22.765
<v Speaker 2>is a dev we call it a dev

00:09:22.765 --> 00:09:23.565
<v Speaker 2>environment manager.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.490
<v Speaker 2>Some people use the term CDE, so cloud

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:27.770
<v Speaker 2>dev environment.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.130
<v Speaker 2>But for us, specifically, when we're thinking about

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:33.610
<v Speaker 2>Daytona and how to build it and why

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.690
<v Speaker 2>we actually got that, that's a whole interesting

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.930
<v Speaker 2>story in itself, how we decided to build

00:09:38.075 --> 00:09:40.235
<v Speaker 2>this thing out. But when we did do

00:09:40.235 --> 00:09:43.435
<v Speaker 2>our research before actually forming a company, we

00:09:43.435 --> 00:09:44.315
<v Speaker 2>looked at

00:09:45.035 --> 00:09:47.515
<v Speaker 2>I researched at everyone that had mentioned remote

00:09:47.515 --> 00:09:49.195
<v Speaker 2>dev environment or CDE

00:09:49.595 --> 00:09:51.675
<v Speaker 2>on the Internet. And so there's, this huge

00:09:51.675 --> 00:09:54.154
<v Speaker 2>notion table with, like, all these people. There's,

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:56.209
<v Speaker 2>like, 500 people on the list. And from

00:09:56.209 --> 00:09:58.050
<v Speaker 2>there, you'll have, like, investors

00:09:58.050 --> 00:09:59.490
<v Speaker 2>and founders

00:09:59.569 --> 00:10:02.690
<v Speaker 2>and, you know, users, engineering managers, whatnot.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.089
<v Speaker 2>And what I also found from that is

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:06.610
<v Speaker 2>engineers

00:10:07.265 --> 00:10:09.904
<v Speaker 2>that have built or are working on a

00:10:09.904 --> 00:10:13.105
<v Speaker 2>similar product inside of their own company because

00:10:13.105 --> 00:10:15.585
<v Speaker 2>there's not people say if you search, like,

00:10:15.585 --> 00:10:17.585
<v Speaker 2>cloud development, there's a bunch of vendors. Yes.

00:10:17.585 --> 00:10:19.585
<v Speaker 2>Maybe. But actually to solve a problem for

00:10:19.585 --> 00:10:21.985
<v Speaker 2>a large enterprise are very, very few. I'd

00:10:21.985 --> 00:10:22.705
<v Speaker 2>say, like, maybe one.

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.210
<v Speaker 2>And so a lot of these companies had

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:27.130
<v Speaker 2>to build it, and that was interesting because

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:30.410
<v Speaker 2>I found that, you know, obviously, Google, Meta,

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:31.130
<v Speaker 2>Shopify,

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:33.130
<v Speaker 2>LinkedIn,

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:34.250
<v Speaker 2>Stripe,

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:37.265
<v Speaker 2>Palantir, like, all these companies have built something

00:10:37.265 --> 00:10:39.185
<v Speaker 2>similar internally, and I wanted to figure out,

00:10:39.185 --> 00:10:41.825
<v Speaker 2>like, why what's what has been the reason,

00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:44.865
<v Speaker 2>for that. And so I reach out to

00:10:44.865 --> 00:10:46.625
<v Speaker 2>these people. Half of them, like, reply, and

00:10:46.625 --> 00:10:47.825
<v Speaker 2>half of them, you know, have a call

00:10:47.825 --> 00:10:49.985
<v Speaker 2>like this with me. And I asked them,

00:10:50.065 --> 00:10:52.120
<v Speaker 2>what are you building? What is the problem

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.200
<v Speaker 2>that you're solving? How many people are building

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.880
<v Speaker 2>it? Do the developers like it? And I

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:56.840
<v Speaker 2>found that

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.800
<v Speaker 2>some companies mandate it because of security reasons.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.480
<v Speaker 2>Like, everyone has to use these

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.000
<v Speaker 2>standardized

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.880
<v Speaker 2>dev environments, be it local, remote, whatever.

00:11:06.815 --> 00:11:07.375
<v Speaker 2>And

00:11:08.815 --> 00:11:10.415
<v Speaker 2>the ones that don't,

00:11:10.654 --> 00:11:12.654
<v Speaker 2>like, it's not a it's not mandated by

00:11:12.654 --> 00:11:14.015
<v Speaker 2>the company, but you can choose to use

00:11:14.015 --> 00:11:15.455
<v Speaker 2>it and choose not to use it.

00:11:15.935 --> 00:11:18.095
<v Speaker 2>80% and this has been consistent of all

00:11:18.095 --> 00:11:20.095
<v Speaker 2>these kind 80% of developers actually use it.

00:11:20.095 --> 00:11:21.775
<v Speaker 2>So I was like, oh, this is awesome.

00:11:21.775 --> 00:11:24.940
<v Speaker 2>Like, developers like this thing, and enterprises are

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.780
<v Speaker 2>building this. The teams that are building it

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.780
<v Speaker 2>are anywhere from four people to, like, 30

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.820
<v Speaker 2>people. So it's not an insignificant amount of

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.300
<v Speaker 2>cost of headcount that's actually building these things,

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.095
<v Speaker 2>which was, like, super for us. But what

00:11:36.095 --> 00:11:37.935
<v Speaker 2>I was gonna get to is the the

00:11:37.935 --> 00:11:40.735
<v Speaker 2>most interesting one for me was Shopify.

00:11:41.135 --> 00:11:42.735
<v Speaker 2>And so the person that I talked to

00:11:42.735 --> 00:11:43.695
<v Speaker 2>at Shopify

00:11:43.855 --> 00:11:45.695
<v Speaker 2>told me the story about how they got

00:11:45.695 --> 00:11:49.454
<v Speaker 2>to these dev environment standard standardized remote dev

00:11:49.454 --> 00:11:49.855
<v Speaker 2>environments.

00:11:50.279 --> 00:11:53.079
<v Speaker 2>And so they started first with standardizing the

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:54.600
<v Speaker 2>local dev environments.

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:56.440
<v Speaker 2>And so what they would do is before

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.199
<v Speaker 2>if you were new hire,

00:11:58.199 --> 00:12:01.079
<v Speaker 2>they the engineering team or they his team

00:12:01.079 --> 00:12:03.415
<v Speaker 2>would take the laptop, and then they'd install,

00:12:03.415 --> 00:12:05.654
<v Speaker 2>configure everything for you so that when it

00:12:05.654 --> 00:12:07.014
<v Speaker 2>was your first day of work, you can

00:12:07.014 --> 00:12:08.855
<v Speaker 2>contribute to day one on day one because

00:12:08.855 --> 00:12:10.535
<v Speaker 2>everything was, like, set up for you, which

00:12:10.535 --> 00:12:12.774
<v Speaker 2>was, like, pretty cool, especially when you have

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:13.815
<v Speaker 2>lots of developers.

00:12:14.055 --> 00:12:16.855
<v Speaker 2>And what they noticed is that and this

00:12:16.855 --> 00:12:17.815
<v Speaker 2>is his words, not mine,

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:19.630
<v Speaker 2>that

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:22.270
<v Speaker 2>at one point, the cables connected to laptops

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.590
<v Speaker 2>were starting to melt because of the size

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:26.510
<v Speaker 2>of these machines that they had to now

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:28.270
<v Speaker 2>spin up and run. And so I it's

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:29.630
<v Speaker 2>in one of my pitch decks. It's like,

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:31.550
<v Speaker 2>you know, this person said that. And so

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:33.230
<v Speaker 2>they had to go out and build these

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:33.790
<v Speaker 2>remote

00:12:34.475 --> 00:12:36.875
<v Speaker 2>dev environment systems because, you know, other the

00:12:36.875 --> 00:12:37.915
<v Speaker 2>only way to do it now is, here's

00:12:37.915 --> 00:12:39.355
<v Speaker 2>an EC two and go figure out how

00:12:39.355 --> 00:12:40.635
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna get this up and running. And

00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:43.035
<v Speaker 2>so they had to rebuild this whole automation

00:12:43.035 --> 00:12:44.715
<v Speaker 2>that they had on the local machine, and

00:12:44.715 --> 00:12:46.555
<v Speaker 2>they did it for the for the remote.

00:12:46.555 --> 00:12:48.075
<v Speaker 2>And halfway building it, they figured out, oh,

00:12:48.075 --> 00:12:50.269
<v Speaker 2>we've already done this before. And, basically, what

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:50.829
<v Speaker 2>they created

00:12:51.629 --> 00:12:54.110
<v Speaker 2>the the output was what a developer sees

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:55.949
<v Speaker 2>now is they have the CLI tool,

00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:58.269
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know the exact command, so

00:12:58.269 --> 00:12:59.870
<v Speaker 2>don't don't don't hold me to this. But

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:01.709
<v Speaker 2>it's basically like create

00:13:02.185 --> 00:13:04.585
<v Speaker 2>dev environment remote or create dev dev environment

00:13:04.585 --> 00:13:07.785
<v Speaker 2>local. Like, it is the same flow for

00:13:07.785 --> 00:13:09.385
<v Speaker 2>an engineer to spin it up on their

00:13:09.385 --> 00:13:10.265
<v Speaker 2>local machine

00:13:10.745 --> 00:13:12.265
<v Speaker 2>as it is to spin it up on

00:13:12.265 --> 00:13:14.650
<v Speaker 2>the remote machine. So you as developer don't

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:16.330
<v Speaker 2>have any difference. Like, if you're doing, a

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.730
<v Speaker 2>front end app, super small, super quick, whatever,

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:20.090
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna do a local host. You don't

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:22.410
<v Speaker 2>care. But if it's, like, something large, you

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:24.090
<v Speaker 2>know, have a bunch of services or whatever

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:26.010
<v Speaker 2>it may be, or, like, I'm just trying

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:27.130
<v Speaker 2>trying to help you out, and I don't

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.165
<v Speaker 2>wanna shut off my dev environment at my

00:13:29.165 --> 00:13:31.805
<v Speaker 2>machine. I can just spin this up automatically.

00:13:31.965 --> 00:13:34.685
<v Speaker 2>And what they built was basically the foundation

00:13:34.685 --> 00:13:37.565
<v Speaker 2>of what or our first principle of Daytona.

00:13:37.565 --> 00:13:39.565
<v Speaker 2>It is a lot of these companies create

00:13:39.805 --> 00:13:42.285
<v Speaker 2>their solution is a cloud remote dev environment

00:13:42.285 --> 00:13:44.660
<v Speaker 2>for everything. Our thought process is

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.540
<v Speaker 2>we want all dev environments, and dev environments

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:49.300
<v Speaker 2>are, like, as we mentioned, being made, they're

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.380
<v Speaker 2>all over the place. People have different configurations,

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:52.740
<v Speaker 2>setups, locations.

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.820
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's on a box in their, you

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.740
<v Speaker 2>know, in their basement. Sometimes it's on an

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.100
<v Speaker 2>e c two. Sometimes it's on a laptop.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:58.740
<v Speaker 2>It can be everywhere.

00:13:59.274 --> 00:14:01.195
<v Speaker 2>Can we unify all this

00:14:01.515 --> 00:14:03.915
<v Speaker 2>so it always feels the same for you?

00:14:04.154 --> 00:14:06.075
<v Speaker 2>And that is the principle of what Daytona

00:14:06.075 --> 00:14:07.515
<v Speaker 2>is. So the idea is that you have

00:14:07.515 --> 00:14:09.515
<v Speaker 2>one command, either Daytona create or a button

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:10.315
<v Speaker 2>create.

00:14:10.875 --> 00:14:12.795
<v Speaker 2>Daytona does everything for you. We can run

00:14:12.795 --> 00:14:13.435
<v Speaker 2>through what that is,

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.880
<v Speaker 2>and you always have the same output. You

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.199
<v Speaker 2>have a dev environment that that it feels

00:14:18.199 --> 00:14:19.959
<v Speaker 2>like it's local host. It is local host.

00:14:19.959 --> 00:14:21.720
<v Speaker 2>It's proxy local host no matter where it

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.440
<v Speaker 2>actually is,

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.720
<v Speaker 2>and that is what we built out. And

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.904
<v Speaker 2>we've built it out as an open source

00:14:27.904 --> 00:14:29.665
<v Speaker 2>tool for the individual dev can, you know,

00:14:29.665 --> 00:14:31.505
<v Speaker 2>use it, runs it on local host, point

00:14:31.505 --> 00:14:33.185
<v Speaker 2>to an EC two, can do that, or

00:14:33.185 --> 00:14:35.584
<v Speaker 2>digital ocean, whatever. And there's obviously an enterprise

00:14:35.584 --> 00:14:37.185
<v Speaker 2>where, you know, you you install it. There's

00:14:37.185 --> 00:14:38.945
<v Speaker 2>a whole cluster, and, you know, it manages

00:14:38.945 --> 00:14:41.345
<v Speaker 2>all these things that enterprises are, super interested

00:14:41.345 --> 00:14:42.625
<v Speaker 2>on. Probably not the people here, but,

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.600
<v Speaker 2>so that

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.840
<v Speaker 2>is what Daytona is, and I'm happy for

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.920
<v Speaker 2>you to dig deeper into those questions because,

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.360
<v Speaker 2>obviously, I haven't answered everything.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.120
<v Speaker 0>No. That was

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.600
<v Speaker 0>that was plenty of context. I think I'm

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.760
<v Speaker 0>I'm I'm with you now. I am curious,

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.360
<v Speaker 0>though. When you say that you provision everything,

00:14:59.055 --> 00:15:01.135
<v Speaker 0>do I get to use my own IDE?

00:15:01.935 --> 00:15:04.895
<v Speaker 2>Yes. Learning number one. Learning number one of

00:15:04.895 --> 00:15:06.415
<v Speaker 2>CodeAnywhere.

00:15:06.415 --> 00:15:08.735
<v Speaker 2>So for Code, when we were building CodeAnywhere,

00:15:08.735 --> 00:15:10.415
<v Speaker 2>there was no Versus Code. Like, that didn't

00:15:10.415 --> 00:15:10.975
<v Speaker 2>exist. Right?

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.360
<v Speaker 2>And the only way that we can give

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.160
<v Speaker 2>you a dev environment or access to it

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.000
<v Speaker 2>then because there was no there was no

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.840
<v Speaker 2>Versus Code and there was no remote

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.160
<v Speaker 2>in Versus Code, which exists in Versus Code

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.640
<v Speaker 2>or also exists in JetBrains now and whatnot,

00:15:25.575 --> 00:15:27.815
<v Speaker 2>remote dev support. So we had to build

00:15:27.815 --> 00:15:30.455
<v Speaker 2>our own ID. So we've built, like, five

00:15:30.455 --> 00:15:33.495
<v Speaker 2>versions of a browser based ID, essentially, Versus

00:15:33.495 --> 00:15:35.415
<v Speaker 2>Code. It's not on the level of Versus

00:15:35.415 --> 00:15:37.255
<v Speaker 2>Code. Obviously, we're not Microsoft. It didn't have

00:15:37.255 --> 00:15:37.975
<v Speaker 2>the budget

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:40.900
<v Speaker 2>to do that and, you know, the plug

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.060
<v Speaker 2>ins and whatnot. But the learning was

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.780
<v Speaker 2>definitely as a developer, I don't want to

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.740
<v Speaker 2>use your, you know, your ID, whatever you

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.455
<v Speaker 2>built, whatever you think. No. Give me, you

00:15:51.455 --> 00:15:53.935
<v Speaker 2>know, my Versus code. Give me my JetBrains.

00:15:53.935 --> 00:15:56.735
<v Speaker 2>Give me my sorry. IntelliJ or PHP Storm.

00:15:56.735 --> 00:15:57.695
<v Speaker 2>Cursor

00:15:57.775 --> 00:15:58.895
<v Speaker 2>is all the rage now. You can use

00:15:58.895 --> 00:16:00.895
<v Speaker 2>Cursor. It doesn't matter. Whatever you feel like

00:16:00.895 --> 00:16:02.415
<v Speaker 2>using, you can use. The idea is that

00:16:02.415 --> 00:16:04.735
<v Speaker 2>there's zero learning curve. It's everything that you've

00:16:04.735 --> 00:16:07.220
<v Speaker 2>done historically would be the same, but just

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:07.860
<v Speaker 2>easier.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.019
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I mean, I I just mentioned it

00:16:10.019 --> 00:16:12.660
<v Speaker 0>because, obviously, there's two types of developers. Ones

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.180
<v Speaker 0>that just don't care what their tools are

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.060
<v Speaker 0>and then some that have spent decades handcrafted.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.819
<v Speaker 0>And I feel like I've spent decades handcrafted

00:16:18.819 --> 00:16:20.555
<v Speaker 0>my my tool chain. So what do you

00:16:20.555 --> 00:16:22.555
<v Speaker 2>use? And I I work with one enterprise.

00:16:23.275 --> 00:16:24.875
<v Speaker 0>Well, right now, I am using Versus Code

00:16:24.875 --> 00:16:26.235
<v Speaker 0>because I I just don't think you could

00:16:26.235 --> 00:16:28.635
<v Speaker 0>beat that extension ecosystem. It is

00:16:29.035 --> 00:16:29.755
<v Speaker 0>huge.

00:16:29.995 --> 00:16:33.435
<v Speaker 0>I've got one eye on zed, but I

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:34.980
<v Speaker 0>don't wanna get into the way it's attractive.

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:38.340
<v Speaker 0>I run Nexus on my desktop, and zed

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.340
<v Speaker 0>does its own plug in acquisition, which does

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.780
<v Speaker 0>not work with Nexus. So I lose all

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:42.740
<v Speaker 0>my LSPs.

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.260
<v Speaker 0>Okay. But I'm ready to jump to the

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.780
<v Speaker 0>to zed once it works.

00:16:46.665 --> 00:16:48.425
<v Speaker 0>Anyway, I I as I was saying, I

00:16:48.425 --> 00:16:50.105
<v Speaker 0>worked for one large enter I've worked for

00:16:50.105 --> 00:16:51.865
<v Speaker 0>a couple of large enterprise companies, but only

00:16:51.865 --> 00:16:53.625
<v Speaker 0>one that specified we had to use a

00:16:53.625 --> 00:16:56.425
<v Speaker 0>CDE, a common development environment. And that's what

00:16:56.425 --> 00:16:57.704
<v Speaker 0>it was back in the day. This is,

00:16:57.704 --> 00:16:58.745
<v Speaker 0>like, 2012.

00:16:59.939 --> 00:17:01.939
<v Speaker 0>A virtual machine, a vacant virtual machine that

00:17:01.939 --> 00:17:03.300
<v Speaker 0>I had to spin up on my my

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:03.940
<v Speaker 0>laptop

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:05.779
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm. In GUI mode.

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.500
<v Speaker 0>So I then got presented this fedora box

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:12.304
<v Speaker 0>with IntelliJ with its lockdown extensions and keyboard

00:17:12.304 --> 00:17:15.105
<v Speaker 0>shortcuts. I couldn't change anything, and everybody worked

00:17:15.105 --> 00:17:16.944
<v Speaker 0>that way. And I swear I quit that

00:17:16.944 --> 00:17:18.865
<v Speaker 0>job after about ten days. I was like,

00:17:18.865 --> 00:17:20.785
<v Speaker 0>no. Sorry. Because at that time, I was

00:17:20.785 --> 00:17:22.865
<v Speaker 0>a Vim fanboy. I was all over Vim.

00:17:23.665 --> 00:17:26.180
<v Speaker 0>Oh, it was horrible. Even just queries in

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.020
<v Speaker 0>a VM is not a nice experience. So

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.460
<v Speaker 2>No. It's terrible.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:31.540
<v Speaker 2>I have to I have to say one

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:33.220
<v Speaker 2>of our value props

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.620
<v Speaker 2>is and I'm saying it's very much from

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.620
<v Speaker 2>a technical perspective is that there's a lot

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.860
<v Speaker 2>of companies that use VDI, so virtual desktop

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:40.420
<v Speaker 2>interfaces,

00:17:40.774 --> 00:17:42.615
<v Speaker 2>because everything has to be, like, in lockdown

00:17:42.615 --> 00:17:45.575
<v Speaker 2>or whatever. Just just the latency

00:17:45.735 --> 00:17:46.854
<v Speaker 2>of streaming

00:17:47.174 --> 00:17:49.975
<v Speaker 2>my ID or editor, like, I'm not even

00:17:49.975 --> 00:17:52.375
<v Speaker 2>gonna talk about, like, disabling all these things,

00:17:52.375 --> 00:17:53.894
<v Speaker 2>but just that latency is enough to, you

00:17:53.894 --> 00:17:55.495
<v Speaker 2>know, wanna go kill myself. Like, it's like,

00:17:55.495 --> 00:17:58.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't wanna do that. And can we

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.110
<v Speaker 2>provide the thing is, like, can we provide

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:03.470
<v Speaker 2>that same level of of safety security

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:06.430
<v Speaker 2>while as a developer, it doesn't feel like

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:08.430
<v Speaker 2>I wanna shoot myself? Like, can can we

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:10.030
<v Speaker 2>get to that place in the world, please?

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:11.195
<v Speaker 2>And so that is also one of the

00:18:11.195 --> 00:18:12.395
<v Speaker 2>things that we try to do with all

00:18:12.395 --> 00:18:13.995
<v Speaker 2>this for sure. So that's since you brought

00:18:13.995 --> 00:18:15.435
<v Speaker 2>it up, I wanted to add on that

00:18:15.435 --> 00:18:16.475
<v Speaker 2>100%.

00:18:17.035 --> 00:18:17.755
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:18:18.475 --> 00:18:19.995
<v Speaker 0>Well, I think I'm a bit ready to

00:18:19.995 --> 00:18:21.995
<v Speaker 0>see Daytona in action, and I think you're

00:18:21.995 --> 00:18:23.755
<v Speaker 0>gonna lead us through a stellar demo today.

00:18:23.755 --> 00:18:26.040
<v Speaker 0>Right? Let's hope so. Let's let's let's kick

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.360
<v Speaker 2>it off. Yeah. Sharing

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.159
<v Speaker 2>screen.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.559
<v Speaker 2>Let's share the entire screen right here.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.080
<v Speaker 2>Do we see my screen? We see my

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:35.320
<v Speaker 2>screen.

00:18:37.235 --> 00:18:38.035
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:18:38.035 --> 00:18:40.355
<v Speaker 2>Screen is here. Great. Just like to start

00:18:40.355 --> 00:18:42.595
<v Speaker 2>up really quickly. Everything I'm gonna show you

00:18:42.595 --> 00:18:44.915
<v Speaker 2>is part of Daytona open source, which means,

00:18:44.915 --> 00:18:47.155
<v Speaker 2>like, everyone can use it, take it, fork

00:18:47.155 --> 00:18:49.075
<v Speaker 2>it, do whatever you want. It's Apache two

00:18:49.075 --> 00:18:51.090
<v Speaker 2>point o, so, like, actual open source. I

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:53.010
<v Speaker 2>know there's, like, discrepancies on what people think.

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:53.970
<v Speaker 2>So, like, you know, you can do whatever

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:55.490
<v Speaker 2>you want with it. You've not released the

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:58.289
<v Speaker 0>the Torna business source license yet. No? Yeah.

00:18:58.289 --> 00:18:59.650
<v Speaker 2>No. We haven't gone that route. Yeah. We

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:01.650
<v Speaker 2>we still I have to say that when

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:03.570
<v Speaker 2>we were built we built out the enterprise

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:05.570
<v Speaker 2>product first and then the end open source

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:06.049
<v Speaker 2>afterwards.

00:19:06.445 --> 00:19:08.845
<v Speaker 2>And we actually did it second because we

00:19:08.845 --> 00:19:10.445
<v Speaker 2>wanted to be really sure

00:19:10.765 --> 00:19:14.845
<v Speaker 2>about how to split these products

00:19:14.845 --> 00:19:16.685
<v Speaker 2>in a way that we don't have to,

00:19:16.685 --> 00:19:20.350
<v Speaker 2>like, make up licenses later on, pull back

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:22.830
<v Speaker 2>licenses later on, and and whatever. And so

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:24.590
<v Speaker 2>what we discovered and it took us about

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:26.750
<v Speaker 2>nine months of figuring the of this out.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:29.870
<v Speaker 2>And it's partially legal, partially product, partially, you

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:32.110
<v Speaker 2>know, vision, whatever. And, basically, what we decided

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:34.350
<v Speaker 2>to do is that everything that is interesting

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:35.789
<v Speaker 2>to a single developer,

00:19:36.405 --> 00:19:38.885
<v Speaker 2>all of that is part of this repository,

00:19:39.125 --> 00:19:40.805
<v Speaker 2>and, you know, it's patch two point o,

00:19:40.805 --> 00:19:42.325
<v Speaker 2>and it'll always be patch two point o.

00:19:42.405 --> 00:19:44.165
<v Speaker 2>Everything that you as a developer don't care

00:19:44.165 --> 00:19:44.725
<v Speaker 2>about,

00:19:45.045 --> 00:19:46.245
<v Speaker 2>audit logs,

00:19:46.405 --> 00:19:47.925
<v Speaker 2>spinning up clusters,

00:19:48.325 --> 00:19:49.445
<v Speaker 2>monitoring

00:19:49.445 --> 00:19:52.310
<v Speaker 2>things, disabling it. Like, all of that is

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:54.950
<v Speaker 2>in a different repository, completely proprietary, and that's

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:56.549
<v Speaker 2>what we sell to the enterprise. So,

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:58.630
<v Speaker 2>I

00:19:58.790 --> 00:19:59.429
<v Speaker 2>really

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:02.070
<v Speaker 2>strongly believe that we will never have to

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.910
<v Speaker 2>go to a point where we, you know,

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:05.910
<v Speaker 2>touch these licenses because of the way we

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:06.790
<v Speaker 2>split it up

00:20:07.615 --> 00:20:10.015
<v Speaker 2>split it up between a user and potentially

00:20:10.015 --> 00:20:12.495
<v Speaker 2>a buyer. So we're very scared of that.

00:20:12.495 --> 00:20:13.535
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of things going on in

00:20:13.535 --> 00:20:14.494
<v Speaker 2>the market right now,

00:20:14.895 --> 00:20:17.135
<v Speaker 2>or the last few days. Anyway, Daytona had

00:20:17.135 --> 00:20:19.615
<v Speaker 2>to spin it up, to install it. It's

00:20:19.615 --> 00:20:21.455
<v Speaker 2>fairly simple. There's a big read. There's this.

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:23.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm on Mac. So, basically, I'm not gonna

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:25.369
<v Speaker 2>install it. I'm gonna hold up real quick.

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:27.049
<v Speaker 0>I will say that I went through the

00:20:27.049 --> 00:20:29.850
<v Speaker 0>docs for getting started, I see next instructions,

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:31.769
<v Speaker 0>and that made me very happy. So Didn't

00:20:31.769 --> 00:20:33.210
<v Speaker 2>it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's in there. It's

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:35.210
<v Speaker 2>in there. So we're also I can explain

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:36.970
<v Speaker 2>a bit later. Basically, you just hit this.

00:20:37.505 --> 00:20:39.265
<v Speaker 2>I'll install it. I already have installed, so

00:20:39.265 --> 00:20:40.305
<v Speaker 2>I won't go through it, but it just,

00:20:40.305 --> 00:20:42.545
<v Speaker 2>like, automatically installs everything. There's something. And then

00:20:42.545 --> 00:20:44.545
<v Speaker 2>when you hit the Daytona command, you're basically

00:20:44.625 --> 00:20:45.585
<v Speaker 2>you have this little

00:20:46.145 --> 00:20:48.945
<v Speaker 2>little sort of terminal UI that can, like,

00:20:48.945 --> 00:20:50.625
<v Speaker 2>walk you through the most needed,

00:20:51.505 --> 00:20:51.825
<v Speaker 2>command.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.440
<v Speaker 2>And so to get up and running, basically,

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.399
<v Speaker 2>all you have to do is this one

00:20:55.399 --> 00:20:57.799
<v Speaker 2>command, which is Daytona create. And I've already

00:20:57.799 --> 00:20:59.639
<v Speaker 2>connected my GitHub, and I connected some providers

00:20:59.639 --> 00:21:01.960
<v Speaker 2>and whatnot. But so I'm gonna pick up

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.320
<v Speaker 2>GitHub repository.

00:21:03.399 --> 00:21:04.679
<v Speaker 2>As we said, it will be just a

00:21:04.679 --> 00:21:06.039
<v Speaker 2>hello world. Nothing too

00:21:06.845 --> 00:21:08.605
<v Speaker 2>nothing too complicated,

00:21:08.605 --> 00:21:11.805
<v Speaker 2>but it has enough for to explain everything

00:21:11.805 --> 00:21:12.684
<v Speaker 2>that's going on.

00:21:13.165 --> 00:21:13.725
<v Speaker 2>So

00:21:14.045 --> 00:21:16.285
<v Speaker 2>what I do, it's the workspace name.

00:21:16.525 --> 00:21:18.045
<v Speaker 2>So what I've done right now with when

00:21:18.045 --> 00:21:19.965
<v Speaker 2>we're building Daytona, we were actually thinking about

00:21:19.965 --> 00:21:22.285
<v Speaker 2>can we make Daytona

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:24.389
<v Speaker 2>work from a logical perspective

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:26.470
<v Speaker 2>very much like a Uber? And, like, bear

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:28.390
<v Speaker 2>with me one sec. Or even a Waymo.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:30.070
<v Speaker 2>Right? Because today,

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:32.549
<v Speaker 2>you can hit a button on your phone.

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:35.190
<v Speaker 2>It's basically where I am, where I'm going,

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:37.085
<v Speaker 2>and what car is gonna take me, and

00:21:37.085 --> 00:21:38.685
<v Speaker 2>it takes you. Right? It's like all I'm

00:21:38.845 --> 00:21:39.965
<v Speaker 2>in the real world. And even with a

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:41.645
<v Speaker 2>Waymo, there's no driver. Like, that is the

00:21:41.645 --> 00:21:42.845
<v Speaker 2>world we live in right now.

00:21:43.965 --> 00:21:47.005
<v Speaker 2>And today, like, getting a dev environment automated

00:21:47.005 --> 00:21:49.165
<v Speaker 2>seems like a harder task, which is, like,

00:21:49.165 --> 00:21:50.044
<v Speaker 2>beyond me.

00:21:50.285 --> 00:21:51.820
<v Speaker 2>And so when we're thinking about this, it's

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:52.780
<v Speaker 2>like, how do we do it in a

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:53.659
<v Speaker 2>similar fashion?

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:55.100
<v Speaker 2>So when I wanna spin up a dev

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.419
<v Speaker 2>environment, it is where is my project? So

00:21:57.419 --> 00:22:00.299
<v Speaker 2>the git repository where where it's at. Where

00:22:00.299 --> 00:22:01.980
<v Speaker 2>do I wanna run this dev environment? Like,

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:04.059
<v Speaker 2>is it on my local host, DigitalOcean,

00:22:04.059 --> 00:22:06.415
<v Speaker 2>GCP, wherever it may be? And what ID

00:22:06.415 --> 00:22:08.895
<v Speaker 2>do I wanna use? Right? So I've I've

00:22:08.895 --> 00:22:10.575
<v Speaker 2>set an a repository.

00:22:10.575 --> 00:22:12.335
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna pick right now, I'm gonna

00:22:12.335 --> 00:22:14.335
<v Speaker 2>hit local. I'll do remote later on. My

00:22:14.335 --> 00:22:16.095
<v Speaker 2>local it'll spin up a Docker.

00:22:16.415 --> 00:22:18.175
<v Speaker 2>And the ID, I've already set. So it'll

00:22:18.175 --> 00:22:19.375
<v Speaker 2>just open up Versus Code, and I can

00:22:19.375 --> 00:22:20.815
<v Speaker 2>show you a cursor afterwards if you want.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.320
<v Speaker 2>And so what Daytona does is always the

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.880
<v Speaker 2>same with a few, variations. And I'll get

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.800
<v Speaker 2>to next in one second as well. So

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.920
<v Speaker 2>what it does is it will spin up

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.520
<v Speaker 2>a if it's a remote, it'll spin up

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.279
<v Speaker 2>a VM on a cloud.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.105
<v Speaker 2>But if it's local, it's there's no read

00:22:37.105 --> 00:22:39.985
<v Speaker 2>for that. Then it spins up a container

00:22:39.985 --> 00:22:42.785
<v Speaker 2>or micro VM inside of those. So on

00:22:42.785 --> 00:22:44.144
<v Speaker 2>localhost, it's just like a docker.

00:22:44.385 --> 00:22:46.545
<v Speaker 2>It will then check out the repository inside

00:22:46.545 --> 00:22:48.305
<v Speaker 2>of that. It'll read through the repository.

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:50.990
<v Speaker 2>And if you have a configuration file, right

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:52.510
<v Speaker 2>now, it supports Dockerfile

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:53.870
<v Speaker 2>and dev container,

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:54.669
<v Speaker 2>but

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:56.990
<v Speaker 2>we have in testing. So it's already done.

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:58.350
<v Speaker 2>Just to show you that's how long it

00:22:58.350 --> 00:22:58.830
<v Speaker 2>took.

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:01.310
<v Speaker 2>We have in testing that we can also

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:03.425
<v Speaker 2>read next configuration files. And so if you

00:23:03.425 --> 00:23:04.865
<v Speaker 2>have any of these configuration files, it will

00:23:04.865 --> 00:23:07.345
<v Speaker 2>spin up everything automatically for you. And so

00:23:07.345 --> 00:23:08.705
<v Speaker 2>now that it's

00:23:09.265 --> 00:23:10.865
<v Speaker 2>up and running, I could have done dash

00:23:10.865 --> 00:23:12.544
<v Speaker 2>c to get up right away.

00:23:13.184 --> 00:23:15.505
<v Speaker 2>The project is here. It's been up for

00:23:15.505 --> 00:23:17.425
<v Speaker 2>one minute. It's gonna open Versus code, my

00:23:17.425 --> 00:23:20.570
<v Speaker 2>local Versus code, obviously, because I'm not doing

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:23.450
<v Speaker 2>anything else. So prefix number Daytona is just

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:25.849
<v Speaker 0>telling it how to open a remote

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:28.809
<v Speaker 0>dev container. Right? It's opening a remote dev.

00:23:28.809 --> 00:23:30.330
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's local, it's remote. Right? Because

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:33.195
<v Speaker 2>it's in your in your Docker. And so

00:23:33.195 --> 00:23:35.434
<v Speaker 2>what's interesting because this project

00:23:35.755 --> 00:23:36.475
<v Speaker 2>is

00:23:36.955 --> 00:23:39.835
<v Speaker 2>has a dev container configuration,

00:23:40.155 --> 00:23:40.955
<v Speaker 2>it is

00:23:41.434 --> 00:23:43.835
<v Speaker 2>off to the races right away. Sorry. I

00:23:43.835 --> 00:23:45.835
<v Speaker 2>I put yarn instead of yarn. Apologies.

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:50.770
<v Speaker 2>And so my project is

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:55.730
<v Speaker 2>up and running, hopefully. Like, demos

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:58.210
<v Speaker 2>should be working. It says hello, world.

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:00.450
<v Speaker 2>Here it is. Okay. It's up and running.

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:01.010
<v Speaker 2>So

00:24:01.335 --> 00:24:02.695
<v Speaker 2>there's more to this, and I'm just gonna

00:24:02.695 --> 00:24:04.615
<v Speaker 2>pause one second. So what it did was

00:24:04.615 --> 00:24:07.174
<v Speaker 2>it checked out repository. It read the configuration.

00:24:07.174 --> 00:24:08.534
<v Speaker 2>It built the entire

00:24:08.934 --> 00:24:10.615
<v Speaker 2>dev environment so that I can come up

00:24:10.615 --> 00:24:12.294
<v Speaker 2>and running, and I only had one sort

00:24:12.294 --> 00:24:14.215
<v Speaker 2>of command to get it up and running

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.840
<v Speaker 2>right away. Also,

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.760
<v Speaker 2>it is on local host. What's interesting if

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:19.960
<v Speaker 2>it was remote, I can show you that,

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.480
<v Speaker 2>but it'll be also local host. But one

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.400
<v Speaker 2>thing that we also have inside of Daytona,

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.999
<v Speaker 2>and this is running on my Docker.

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.759
<v Speaker 2>If I do Daytona

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:27.960
<v Speaker 2>forward,

00:24:28.845 --> 00:24:30.845
<v Speaker 2>what's the port number? I was here. Port

00:24:30.845 --> 00:24:32.205
<v Speaker 2>5173?

00:24:32.285 --> 00:24:34.524
<v Speaker 0>I think so. Yeah. 5173

00:24:34.605 --> 00:24:36.365
<v Speaker 2>Dash Dash public.

00:24:36.365 --> 00:24:37.085
<v Speaker 2>Public.

00:24:37.485 --> 00:24:38.845
<v Speaker 2>And if I do this,

00:24:39.885 --> 00:24:41.965
<v Speaker 2>basically, what you'll get is a QR code,

00:24:42.125 --> 00:24:43.520
<v Speaker 2>and you can scan it, or you can

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.040
<v Speaker 2>type the whole URL, but it should be

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.440
<v Speaker 2>the QR code here. I'm getting my scanner.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. So here you go. So get your

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.880
<v Speaker 2>scanner out and scan this QR code if

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.120
<v Speaker 2>you can. We've never had a QR scan

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.039
<v Speaker 0>before in over 400 episodes.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.120
<v Speaker 0>Holy sweet. This work. Did you open it

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.080
<v Speaker 2>up? Yeah.

00:24:58.585 --> 00:24:59.705
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. And so

00:24:59.945 --> 00:25:01.945
<v Speaker 2>so what what what happened now is it

00:25:01.945 --> 00:25:04.105
<v Speaker 2>adds a reverse proxy even if behind I'm

00:25:04.105 --> 00:25:06.184
<v Speaker 2>behind a firewall, I connect it to whatever,

00:25:06.505 --> 00:25:08.585
<v Speaker 2>and you basically have your preview environment. So

00:25:08.585 --> 00:25:09.465
<v Speaker 2>if I go

00:25:10.025 --> 00:25:11.225
<v Speaker 2>down here sorry.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:13.800
<v Speaker 2>Let's

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:14.679
<v Speaker 2>change this.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:19.080
<v Speaker 2>Let's change this real quick and say David.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.760
<v Speaker 2>And, also, everyone in the audience can do

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.120
<v Speaker 2>this if anyone was looking at it right

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.760
<v Speaker 2>now. Hey. That'll be refreshed in real time.

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.440
<v Speaker 2>It refreshed on your phone in real time.

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:26.600
<v Speaker 2>Right?

00:25:27.785 --> 00:25:30.424
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Did. Yeah. Yeah. And so what

00:25:31.145 --> 00:25:33.065
<v Speaker 2>it does so what Daytona does, it some

00:25:33.065 --> 00:25:34.265
<v Speaker 2>people ask me like, oh, don't I have

00:25:34.265 --> 00:25:36.424
<v Speaker 2>this in Docker? Well, Docker is missing some

00:25:36.424 --> 00:25:38.105
<v Speaker 2>people also called it, and I don't say

00:25:38.105 --> 00:25:39.945
<v Speaker 2>that that this is what we are, like

00:25:39.945 --> 00:25:40.585
<v Speaker 2>a

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:43.540
<v Speaker 2>a thin layer around Docker. It is all

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:45.300
<v Speaker 2>the things that you need for a dev

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.860
<v Speaker 2>environment that are that are missing from just

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.179
<v Speaker 2>having a Docker container. It actually solves Workshop

00:25:50.179 --> 00:25:53.300
<v Speaker 2>machine because it'll work for everyone everywhere. You

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:55.220
<v Speaker 2>can share it. Like, all these things are

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:55.380
<v Speaker 2>here,

00:25:56.645 --> 00:25:59.605
<v Speaker 2>and it works no matter on what infrastructure.

00:25:59.605 --> 00:26:00.965
<v Speaker 2>And so while we're this is gonna take

00:26:00.965 --> 00:26:02.565
<v Speaker 2>a bit of time, but I'll just show

00:26:02.565 --> 00:26:04.484
<v Speaker 2>you this. So this is my DigitalOcean,

00:26:05.445 --> 00:26:08.325
<v Speaker 2>my account. And so if I do Daytona

00:26:08.485 --> 00:26:10.164
<v Speaker 2>I'll do Daytona create the same repository.

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:11.690
<v Speaker 2>Daytona

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:12.730
<v Speaker 2>create

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:14.490
<v Speaker 2>GitHub.

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:15.530
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna take a bit of time so

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:16.650
<v Speaker 2>we can talk about things, but I just

00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:18.250
<v Speaker 2>want it to go load in the background.

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:20.570
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Don't worry. I've got questions.

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:22.010
<v Speaker 2>Hello?

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:23.290
<v Speaker 2>So same project,

00:26:24.005 --> 00:26:25.845
<v Speaker 2>hello world two, and I'm gonna spin it

00:26:25.845 --> 00:26:27.285
<v Speaker 2>up because we're in Europe both right now

00:26:27.285 --> 00:26:28.565
<v Speaker 2>in DigitalOcean Amsterdam.

00:26:28.885 --> 00:26:31.445
<v Speaker 2>And so what is this gonna do? It's

00:26:31.445 --> 00:26:33.125
<v Speaker 2>gonna do everything I did right now,

00:26:33.445 --> 00:26:35.685
<v Speaker 2>but it's also gonna spin up a VM

00:26:35.685 --> 00:26:36.565
<v Speaker 2>or Droplet

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:38.809
<v Speaker 2>in DigitalOcean.

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:41.690
<v Speaker 2>But I will also have the same it'll

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:43.210
<v Speaker 2>also be all local hosts. It'll be the

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:45.050
<v Speaker 2>same commands. I don't care where it is

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:46.650
<v Speaker 2>as a user. I can also share it

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:48.170
<v Speaker 2>to you. Although it's a, you know, a

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:49.610
<v Speaker 2>public, I could have done it anyway. It'd

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:51.165
<v Speaker 2>be a little bit of work. But it's,

00:26:51.165 --> 00:26:53.085
<v Speaker 2>like, out of the box, same feel, same

00:26:53.085 --> 00:26:53.805
<v Speaker 2>everything

00:26:54.045 --> 00:26:56.205
<v Speaker 2>no matter, like, where it's running. And we

00:26:56.205 --> 00:26:57.325
<v Speaker 2>have this for EC two, and we have

00:26:57.325 --> 00:26:58.605
<v Speaker 2>this for GCP, and we have this for

00:26:58.605 --> 00:27:00.525
<v Speaker 2>all these different things. And so as you

00:27:00.525 --> 00:27:02.045
<v Speaker 2>can see so it's right here. It's loading.

00:27:02.045 --> 00:27:03.005
<v Speaker 2>And so this has nothing to do with

00:27:03.005 --> 00:27:05.180
<v Speaker 2>Daytona now. It's it takes whatever time it

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:07.340
<v Speaker 2>takes for VM Yeah. To actually get up

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:08.059
<v Speaker 2>and running.

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.180
<v Speaker 2>So, yeah, I'm gonna pause here and let

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:13.420
<v Speaker 2>you now ask questions while this is sort

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:14.140
<v Speaker 2>of spinning.

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:15.740
<v Speaker 0>Good. Because I got stuff on my head.

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:17.755
<v Speaker 0>First, just because the deal stuff is right

00:27:17.755 --> 00:27:20.315
<v Speaker 0>in front of us. You mentioned earlier that

00:27:20.395 --> 00:27:23.115
<v Speaker 0>once the VM is provisioned, you're then running

00:27:23.115 --> 00:27:25.434
<v Speaker 0>a micro VM, something like Firecracker,

00:27:26.875 --> 00:27:28.875
<v Speaker 0>and then running the application inside of that.

00:27:29.389 --> 00:27:31.950
<v Speaker 0>Do I have the option to run multiple

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:34.190
<v Speaker 0>of those micro VMs inside of a single

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:36.269
<v Speaker 0>machine? Like, if or is it you get

00:27:36.269 --> 00:27:36.829
<v Speaker 0>one

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:38.190
<v Speaker 0>one

00:27:38.669 --> 00:27:40.109
<v Speaker 0>yeah. One host. Right

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:42.190
<v Speaker 2>now, the way it's created,

00:27:43.325 --> 00:27:45.405
<v Speaker 2>the the enterprise product does exactly what you

00:27:45.405 --> 00:27:47.405
<v Speaker 2>said right now. Okay. The open source sort

00:27:47.405 --> 00:27:49.165
<v Speaker 2>of we have to get to where we

00:27:49.165 --> 00:27:51.085
<v Speaker 2>have to get. So this version right now,

00:27:51.085 --> 00:27:54.205
<v Speaker 2>it's one b it's one actual Droplet per

00:27:54.205 --> 00:27:55.164
<v Speaker 2>micro VM.

00:27:55.325 --> 00:27:57.809
<v Speaker 2>Basically, the micro VM just the reason it's

00:27:57.809 --> 00:28:00.049
<v Speaker 2>there is that it abstracts all the Daytona

00:28:00.049 --> 00:28:01.650
<v Speaker 2>things that are running in that machine so

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:03.010
<v Speaker 2>that you don't see that in the workspace.

00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:04.049
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to think about that at

00:28:04.049 --> 00:28:07.410
<v Speaker 2>all. Yeah. You don't basically, you can SSH,

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:09.330
<v Speaker 2>with root access into the VM and then

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:11.475
<v Speaker 2>see that stuff. But, basically, you don't need

00:28:11.475 --> 00:28:13.075
<v Speaker 2>to see that stuff because you actually don't

00:28:13.075 --> 00:28:13.554
<v Speaker 2>care.

00:28:13.955 --> 00:28:15.955
<v Speaker 2>To answer your question, will we support to

00:28:15.955 --> 00:28:18.755
<v Speaker 2>to, you know, spin up multiple workspaces inside

00:28:18.755 --> 00:28:21.075
<v Speaker 2>of that so you can orchestrate things? Yes.

00:28:21.155 --> 00:28:23.075
<v Speaker 2>And that's something that's on, like, very much

00:28:23.075 --> 00:28:24.915
<v Speaker 2>very soon road map, but it's not there

00:28:24.915 --> 00:28:25.235
<v Speaker 2>right now.

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:26.770
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:28.530
<v Speaker 0>Also, just

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:29.650
<v Speaker 0>because that was fresh in my head. We

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:31.170
<v Speaker 0>can now go back to that first example

00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:33.810
<v Speaker 0>that you ran locally. Now I noticed that

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:36.450
<v Speaker 0>there's a dev container directory here. I'm assuming

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:38.210
<v Speaker 0>that's what Daytona is using to work out

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:41.715
<v Speaker 0>how to Exactly. This project? Exactly. The only

00:28:41.715 --> 00:28:43.874
<v Speaker 2>thing that for Daytona

00:28:44.274 --> 00:28:45.154
<v Speaker 2>is

00:28:45.235 --> 00:28:48.595
<v Speaker 2>something that doesn't happen on every single repository

00:28:48.595 --> 00:28:50.595
<v Speaker 2>is that it checks for a dev container

00:28:50.595 --> 00:28:52.760
<v Speaker 2>type configuration file. So if there's a dev

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:55.159
<v Speaker 2>container, everyone is magical. Right? But, obviously, not

00:28:55.159 --> 00:28:57.559
<v Speaker 2>all of them have that. And so, one,

00:28:57.559 --> 00:28:58.519
<v Speaker 2>we're expanding

00:28:59.559 --> 00:29:02.200
<v Speaker 2>the the types of configuration files that we

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.279
<v Speaker 2>will support. So as mentioned, dev container,

00:29:04.755 --> 00:29:07.555
<v Speaker 2>mix as well is going to be supported.

00:29:07.555 --> 00:29:09.635
<v Speaker 2>Flux because, you know, why not? Because it's

00:29:09.635 --> 00:29:10.115
<v Speaker 2>there.

00:29:10.435 --> 00:29:11.315
<v Speaker 2>Dev file

00:29:12.115 --> 00:29:12.835
<v Speaker 2>and

00:29:12.915 --> 00:29:14.515
<v Speaker 2>Docker file. So those are the ones that

00:29:14.515 --> 00:29:16.195
<v Speaker 2>we plan to support because those are all

00:29:16.195 --> 00:29:17.315
<v Speaker 2>basically open standards,

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:20.050
<v Speaker 2>which will enable us to support even more

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:20.690
<v Speaker 2>of these.

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:24.289
<v Speaker 2>What's gonna happen so very a very hint

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:27.410
<v Speaker 2>for today. It's not core to Daytona's product,

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:29.410
<v Speaker 2>but this week, we're gonna launch a open

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:31.410
<v Speaker 2>source project. Hopefully, everyone can help us contribute

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:34.105
<v Speaker 2>to this. It is a AI

00:29:34.345 --> 00:29:36.184
<v Speaker 2>well, of course, everything's AI,

00:29:36.745 --> 00:29:39.465
<v Speaker 2>tool that will create these types of files

00:29:39.465 --> 00:29:40.585
<v Speaker 2>for any repository.

00:29:40.585 --> 00:29:42.105
<v Speaker 2>There's still work to be done. It works

00:29:42.105 --> 00:29:43.784
<v Speaker 2>on a large number of them, but the

00:29:43.784 --> 00:29:44.744
<v Speaker 2>idea is that

00:29:45.065 --> 00:29:46.025
<v Speaker 2>because we

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:49.050
<v Speaker 2>depend on that heavily, we'd like that to

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:50.490
<v Speaker 2>be a solved problem in the world. So

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:52.410
<v Speaker 2>then we're creating this, and hopefully, world can

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:54.330
<v Speaker 2>help us get to a place where this

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:56.170
<v Speaker 2>is not an issue. So every single repository

00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:58.169
<v Speaker 2>in the world can be

00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:00.890
<v Speaker 2>runnable right at the start. Note that if

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:03.284
<v Speaker 2>there is not a dev container or a

00:30:03.284 --> 00:30:04.565
<v Speaker 2>mix or whatever inside,

00:30:04.725 --> 00:30:07.684
<v Speaker 2>Daytona falls back on a default

00:30:08.164 --> 00:30:08.965
<v Speaker 2>workspace,

00:30:08.965 --> 00:30:10.325
<v Speaker 2>which has everything.

00:30:10.325 --> 00:30:12.804
<v Speaker 2>Like, everything's installed in that one so that

00:30:12.804 --> 00:30:15.445
<v Speaker 2>it almost works automatically. Like, I I've had

00:30:15.445 --> 00:30:16.885
<v Speaker 2>people, like, test out and say, oh, there's

00:30:16.885 --> 00:30:19.260
<v Speaker 2>no dev container, and it works. Well, yes,

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.260
<v Speaker 2>because, like, it's a huge machine, and it's

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.020
<v Speaker 2>sort of just for the experience part for

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:24.860
<v Speaker 2>that to happen. I'm just showing you the

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.860
<v Speaker 2>screen. The meantime, the droplet finished. Now it's

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:28.540
<v Speaker 2>going through the through all the steps that

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:29.740
<v Speaker 2>it would have gone through on the local

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.500
<v Speaker 2>host as well. Back to your questions.

00:30:32.565 --> 00:30:35.445
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So I'm a I don't know if

00:30:35.445 --> 00:30:37.125
<v Speaker 0>this is gonna lean into something that Daytona

00:30:37.125 --> 00:30:38.645
<v Speaker 0>doesn't support yet, but I'll throw at you

00:30:38.645 --> 00:30:41.605
<v Speaker 0>anyway. Everything I do is in one mono

00:30:41.605 --> 00:30:42.565
<v Speaker 0>repository.

00:30:42.645 --> 00:30:45.125
<v Speaker 0>So does Daytona give me any way to

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.420
<v Speaker 0>either say I'm working in this mono repository,

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:50.500
<v Speaker 0>but just this particular service? Can it handle

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.340
<v Speaker 0>a mono repository? Like, what is the best

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:53.220
<v Speaker 0>practice there?

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.700
<v Speaker 2>So yeah. So in the sense of mono

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:58.660
<v Speaker 2>everything's one repository, that's the easiest for us.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:00.500
<v Speaker 0>Alright. The the

00:31:01.414 --> 00:31:04.294
<v Speaker 2>the issues that we come up with are

00:31:04.294 --> 00:31:06.054
<v Speaker 2>with multiple repositories.

00:31:06.054 --> 00:31:07.975
<v Speaker 2>So Daytona supports right now that you can

00:31:07.975 --> 00:31:09.335
<v Speaker 2>have multiple repositories

00:31:09.335 --> 00:31:11.254
<v Speaker 2>in the same machine,

00:31:11.654 --> 00:31:13.895
<v Speaker 2>and that works right now. What we are

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:16.140
<v Speaker 2>working on right now, that was my call

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.700
<v Speaker 2>before this this right now, is how do

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.860
<v Speaker 2>we make a world where we don't complicate

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:21.899
<v Speaker 2>this simple

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:23.179
<v Speaker 2>flow,

00:31:23.419 --> 00:31:25.019
<v Speaker 2>but that you can actually have

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:26.059
<v Speaker 2>a

00:31:26.635 --> 00:31:30.395
<v Speaker 2>workspace, a micro VM, a pod, a whatever

00:31:30.395 --> 00:31:32.395
<v Speaker 2>for every one of your repositories and that

00:31:32.395 --> 00:31:34.395
<v Speaker 2>that they're all sort of connected together so

00:31:34.395 --> 00:31:35.915
<v Speaker 2>that you can have that experience. That's something

00:31:35.915 --> 00:31:37.915
<v Speaker 2>that we're working on, like, literally right before

00:31:37.915 --> 00:31:39.115
<v Speaker 2>this call, but it's not in there.

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:42.100
<v Speaker 0>Okay. But what if the challenge with my

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.140
<v Speaker 0>mono repository mono repository is that I don't

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:47.220
<v Speaker 0>have a top level dev container, and in

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:49.460
<v Speaker 0>fact, I have nested dev containers all throughout

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:50.580
<v Speaker 0>that repository?

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:51.780
<v Speaker 0>Is that something You

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.620
<v Speaker 2>can pick which one you want to run.

00:31:54.095 --> 00:31:55.695
<v Speaker 2>Okay. That's the question. You can pick which

00:31:55.695 --> 00:31:57.135
<v Speaker 2>one. Yeah. You can pick, oh, I don't

00:31:57.135 --> 00:31:58.895
<v Speaker 2>want this. If I have multiple so let's

00:31:58.895 --> 00:32:00.975
<v Speaker 2>say ASTRO is a good repository. They have,

00:32:00.975 --> 00:32:02.735
<v Speaker 2>like, a hundred dev containers inside of that.

00:32:02.735 --> 00:32:04.175
<v Speaker 2>You can pick which one you want to

00:32:04.175 --> 00:32:05.775
<v Speaker 2>actually spin up. Which one you want to

00:32:05.775 --> 00:32:08.495
<v Speaker 2>use. Right? And is it possible, I guess,

00:32:08.495 --> 00:32:08.815
<v Speaker 0>this

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:11.090
<v Speaker 0>I I don't know how it like,

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:13.249
<v Speaker 0>okay. Let's strap in. So

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:15.809
<v Speaker 0>you've got this Firecracker virtual machine. Is it

00:32:15.809 --> 00:32:17.890
<v Speaker 0>possible for you if it's like, you've cloned

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:19.809
<v Speaker 0>my mono repository. So it's quite large. I

00:32:19.809 --> 00:32:21.330
<v Speaker 0>don't wanna clone that every single time I

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:23.809
<v Speaker 0>switch between workspaces or packages within that mono

00:32:23.809 --> 00:32:25.725
<v Speaker 0>repository. Can I say I wanna go from

00:32:25.725 --> 00:32:27.725
<v Speaker 0>my web app to my back end API

00:32:27.725 --> 00:32:29.325
<v Speaker 0>now and reload

00:32:29.325 --> 00:32:31.245
<v Speaker 0>that without shutting everything down and back up

00:32:31.245 --> 00:32:31.885
<v Speaker 0>again?

00:32:33.245 --> 00:32:34.765
<v Speaker 2>There's no

00:32:34.765 --> 00:32:36.765
<v Speaker 2>no. But but

00:32:36.925 --> 00:32:38.285
<v Speaker 2>but there's a way to do that very

00:32:38.285 --> 00:32:41.330
<v Speaker 2>fast. So we have something called prebuilds,

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:43.809
<v Speaker 2>which is essentially what it does, it caches

00:32:43.809 --> 00:32:46.450
<v Speaker 2>the build of a repository.

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:48.130
<v Speaker 2>So what that means is that you can

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:49.650
<v Speaker 2>spin up you can create a build for

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:52.210
<v Speaker 2>any of the branches or any of the

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:54.455
<v Speaker 2>dev containers or whatnot, And then you can

00:32:54.455 --> 00:32:55.655
<v Speaker 2>spin up different

00:32:55.815 --> 00:32:56.695
<v Speaker 2>workspaces

00:32:56.695 --> 00:32:58.935
<v Speaker 2>of the same with the different builds. And

00:32:58.935 --> 00:33:01.015
<v Speaker 2>because the because the build's cached, it's, like,

00:33:01.015 --> 00:33:02.695
<v Speaker 2>super fast to get up. It's way faster

00:33:02.695 --> 00:33:04.054
<v Speaker 2>than what we're doing right now.

00:33:04.775 --> 00:33:05.735
<v Speaker 0>Oh, nice. Okay.

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:08.890
<v Speaker 0>Well, let's talk about that QR code thing

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:11.369
<v Speaker 0>then. I mean, did you build your own

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:14.250
<v Speaker 0>proxy? Are you are you leveraging other open

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:16.490
<v Speaker 0>source? Like, how does Headscale. So it's an

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:18.570
<v Speaker 2>open source tail scale head scale, it's called.

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Just

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:22.455
<v Speaker 2>kudos to them for, like, making that. And

00:33:22.455 --> 00:33:24.615
<v Speaker 2>so we were using them as a reverse

00:33:24.615 --> 00:33:27.015
<v Speaker 2>proxy to be able to do this. The

00:33:27.015 --> 00:33:28.215
<v Speaker 2>reason that we wanna do this as well

00:33:28.215 --> 00:33:30.295
<v Speaker 2>is because, you know, creating code anywhere, which

00:33:30.295 --> 00:33:33.654
<v Speaker 2>are browser based SaaS cloud ID product,

00:33:34.375 --> 00:33:35.895
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of those that happen that

00:33:35.895 --> 00:33:36.615
<v Speaker 2>exist right now.

00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:40.590
<v Speaker 2>And we wanted to offer that sort of

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:44.030
<v Speaker 2>value without having any cost. So, basically, what

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:46.669
<v Speaker 2>we have here is the same feel. There's

00:33:46.669 --> 00:33:48.750
<v Speaker 2>also a will be coming soon just for

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:50.615
<v Speaker 2>some people want it. We want we did

00:33:50.615 --> 00:33:52.774
<v Speaker 2>CLI first. And so you have that same

00:33:52.774 --> 00:33:54.294
<v Speaker 2>feel as if you're going through, like, a

00:33:54.294 --> 00:33:56.774
<v Speaker 2>code spaces. So let's use GitHub. Right? It's

00:33:56.774 --> 00:33:58.455
<v Speaker 2>the same. It's like, oh, pick my repo,

00:33:58.455 --> 00:34:00.455
<v Speaker 2>pick my ID, enter. You do all these

00:34:00.455 --> 00:34:02.215
<v Speaker 2>things. You can share a URL. It's like

00:34:02.215 --> 00:34:03.575
<v Speaker 2>it's running in the cloud, but it's not.

00:34:03.575 --> 00:34:06.070
<v Speaker 2>So we wanted that whole experience to be

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:07.909
<v Speaker 2>sort of packaged inside of Daytona.

00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.830
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:12.230
<v Speaker 0>Well, it looks like your DigitalOcean one's working.

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:14.150
<v Speaker 0>Right? It is. It looks like it is.

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:16.550
<v Speaker 2>Let's do Daytona code. Let's try this out.

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:18.630
<v Speaker 2>So this is the one running on DigitalOcean.

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:20.454
<v Speaker 2>You can see that here. You can see

00:34:20.454 --> 00:34:22.054
<v Speaker 2>here this one's running local. This one's running

00:34:22.054 --> 00:34:23.094
<v Speaker 2>on DigitalOcean.

00:34:23.255 --> 00:34:24.775
<v Speaker 2>So I'm gonna open this up. It's gonna

00:34:24.775 --> 00:34:27.335
<v Speaker 2>open up a new Versus code,

00:34:27.494 --> 00:34:29.335
<v Speaker 2>and we should go through the same

00:34:29.655 --> 00:34:30.375
<v Speaker 2>flow

00:34:30.534 --> 00:34:31.574
<v Speaker 2>even though it's running,

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:34.510
<v Speaker 2>you know, in Amsterdam,

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:36.989
<v Speaker 2>which is not on my machine. Obviously, some

00:34:36.989 --> 00:34:39.550
<v Speaker 2>things might be slightly slower. We'll see. Shouldn't

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:40.030
<v Speaker 2>be.

00:34:43.069 --> 00:34:43.710
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.

00:34:47.295 --> 00:34:49.775
<v Speaker 2>Yes. Alright. Up and running.

00:34:50.015 --> 00:34:53.055
<v Speaker 2>And so same, sorry, same flow terminal.

00:34:54.015 --> 00:34:55.135
<v Speaker 2>And I'll do

00:34:55.935 --> 00:34:57.695
<v Speaker 2>this time, I won't yarn.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:03.120
<v Speaker 2>I did it right. Did I? And so

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:05.040
<v Speaker 2>what you're seeing right now is that it's

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.480
<v Speaker 2>also on my local host.

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:10.000
<v Speaker 2>So it's still running on my local host.

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.240
<v Speaker 2>And for me, all the commands I write

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.080
<v Speaker 2>are local host even though it's running on

00:35:15.315 --> 00:35:16.115
<v Speaker 2>DigitalOcean.

00:35:16.115 --> 00:35:18.115
<v Speaker 2>And, also, what you'll notice is that it

00:35:18.115 --> 00:35:19.155
<v Speaker 2>moved the port

00:35:19.315 --> 00:35:20.915
<v Speaker 2>from 5173

00:35:20.915 --> 00:35:22.595
<v Speaker 2>to 5174

00:35:22.675 --> 00:35:25.395
<v Speaker 2>because Daytona saw that the port was already

00:35:25.395 --> 00:35:27.570
<v Speaker 2>used, and it used the next one that

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:30.210
<v Speaker 2>was free. So it says 5173,

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:31.650
<v Speaker 2>but I'm already using it for my other

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:33.490
<v Speaker 2>project. So it automatically did that, so I

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:35.810
<v Speaker 2>don't have to worry as well. And then

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:37.570
<v Speaker 2>you get that same sort of I wanna

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:39.250
<v Speaker 2>do Daytona

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:40.530
<v Speaker 2>forward

00:35:41.445 --> 00:35:43.125
<v Speaker 2>five one seven

00:35:43.605 --> 00:35:44.405
<v Speaker 2>four

00:35:44.645 --> 00:35:46.885
<v Speaker 2>dash dash public. I'll get the QR code

00:35:46.885 --> 00:35:47.445
<v Speaker 2>here,

00:35:49.205 --> 00:35:50.485
<v Speaker 2>and you should be able to work as

00:35:50.485 --> 00:35:50.965
<v Speaker 2>well.

00:35:52.165 --> 00:35:53.925
<v Speaker 2>Alright. You can scan it and see if

00:35:53.925 --> 00:35:54.245
<v Speaker 2>it works.

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:57.580
<v Speaker 0>I think at this stage, I'm pretty convinced

00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:59.820
<v Speaker 0>it's gonna work. Yeah. Even if it doesn't,

00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:01.580
<v Speaker 2>I think it's good. Like, it's like yeah.

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:07.980
<v Speaker 2>Loading, not loading.

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:10.060
<v Speaker 0>Loading or at least

00:36:10.944 --> 00:36:13.105
<v Speaker 0>trying to load. To load. At least trying

00:36:13.105 --> 00:36:14.065
<v Speaker 2>to load. Yeah.

00:36:15.505 --> 00:36:16.545
<v Speaker 2>So we'll see.

00:36:19.665 --> 00:36:21.185
<v Speaker 2>Wait. Am I in the right one? No.

00:36:21.185 --> 00:36:21.825
<v Speaker 2>No. Here it is.

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:26.710
<v Speaker 2>Might not. We'll double check why that happened.

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:29.830
<v Speaker 2>But in any case but in any case,

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:32.790
<v Speaker 2>everything up until that was the same,

00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:34.470
<v Speaker 2>and that should be the same as well.

00:36:34.805 --> 00:36:36.565
<v Speaker 2>But, anyway, so what I was gonna show,

00:36:36.565 --> 00:36:38.085
<v Speaker 2>the most important part here was that it's

00:36:38.085 --> 00:36:40.245
<v Speaker 2>also proxies to local host. It moves the

00:36:40.245 --> 00:36:41.605
<v Speaker 2>port if it needs to because I was

00:36:41.605 --> 00:36:43.525
<v Speaker 2>still using the other one. If I'd killed

00:36:43.685 --> 00:36:45.525
<v Speaker 2>this service that was running on my local,

00:36:45.525 --> 00:36:46.645
<v Speaker 2>it would have been to the five one

00:36:46.645 --> 00:36:48.405
<v Speaker 2>seven three I was supposed to, not adequately

00:36:48.405 --> 00:36:49.365
<v Speaker 2>moved it. So

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:53.089
<v Speaker 2>I, as a developer, like, there's no difference

00:36:53.089 --> 00:36:55.250
<v Speaker 2>outside of, like, snag, maybe,

00:36:56.369 --> 00:36:58.289
<v Speaker 2>what happened here for a second. But other

00:36:58.289 --> 00:37:00.450
<v Speaker 2>than that, everything should feel the same no

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:01.970
<v Speaker 2>matter where it is. And so if even

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:03.170
<v Speaker 2>if I spin up now on an e

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:04.994
<v Speaker 2>c two or if I spin it up

00:37:04.994 --> 00:37:06.275
<v Speaker 2>on, like, a physical,

00:37:06.595 --> 00:37:08.035
<v Speaker 2>you know, server somewhere,

00:37:08.194 --> 00:37:09.875
<v Speaker 2>it always feels the same to me as

00:37:09.875 --> 00:37:10.595
<v Speaker 2>a developer.

00:37:13.075 --> 00:37:13.715
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:37:14.515 --> 00:37:16.115
<v Speaker 0>Very interesting. So

00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:18.610
<v Speaker 0>I like that it supports module providers.

00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:20.530
<v Speaker 0>I can work locally if I want.

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:22.450
<v Speaker 0>It seems to solve that problem that most

00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:23.970
<v Speaker 0>people have in a Mac query. I mean,

00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:26.050
<v Speaker 0>you're not syncing files across the network here

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:27.890
<v Speaker 0>because you're cloning the repository

00:37:28.475 --> 00:37:31.195
<v Speaker 0>on the the remote box, which is very

00:37:30.315 --> 00:37:30.715
<v Speaker 0>So

00:37:33.355 --> 00:37:34.795
<v Speaker 0>I'm curious to see

00:37:35.835 --> 00:37:37.435
<v Speaker 0>well, if do you have, like

00:37:38.635 --> 00:37:40.555
<v Speaker 0>let's look at that dev container dot JSON.

00:37:40.555 --> 00:37:42.395
<v Speaker 0>Is there anything interesting in there first before

00:37:42.395 --> 00:37:44.340
<v Speaker 0>I take us away from it? I mean,

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:46.420
<v Speaker 2>this one's, like, super simple. There's nothing Okay.

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:48.180
<v Speaker 0>It's just an image and

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:50.980
<v Speaker 0>install Yarn or something. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:53.140
<v Speaker 2>Install Yarn, and there's a Docker file and

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:54.500
<v Speaker 2>a Docker file. It's just like it's a

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:55.780
<v Speaker 2>very simple one. Yeah. I mean, we can

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:58.145
<v Speaker 2>spin up more complex ones, but even Versus

00:37:58.145 --> 00:38:00.385
<v Speaker 2>code itself, like, I mean, it can do

00:38:00.385 --> 00:38:02.224
<v Speaker 2>that for you. So I don't think there's

00:38:02.224 --> 00:38:04.385
<v Speaker 2>that much magic in that. But what we

00:38:04.385 --> 00:38:06.224
<v Speaker 2>do is, like, we build prebuild it for

00:38:06.224 --> 00:38:08.385
<v Speaker 2>you and sort of deliver it done.

00:38:08.865 --> 00:38:10.305
<v Speaker 2>Or we build it for you, but we

00:38:10.305 --> 00:38:12.339
<v Speaker 2>can also prebuild it afterwards for you. So

00:38:12.339 --> 00:38:13.940
<v Speaker 2>it's automatically done, and you always know that

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:16.020
<v Speaker 2>it works because that machine that it's running

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:17.780
<v Speaker 2>on is always the same. Right? It's not

00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:20.420
<v Speaker 2>on my local machine, which can sometimes it's

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:22.500
<v Speaker 2>a Mac, sometimes it's a Linux, sometimes it's,

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:23.619
<v Speaker 2>you know, whatever it might be.

00:38:25.215 --> 00:38:26.895
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I guess so. Yeah. It worked pretty

00:38:26.895 --> 00:38:28.255
<v Speaker 0>well. I mean, I definitely wanna try and

00:38:28.255 --> 00:38:29.535
<v Speaker 0>kick the tires on it with some sort

00:38:29.535 --> 00:38:31.615
<v Speaker 0>of next flake or dev env or flux

00:38:31.615 --> 00:38:33.935
<v Speaker 0>and and have it run as magic that

00:38:33.935 --> 00:38:35.855
<v Speaker 0>way. It is on our so it's on

00:38:35.855 --> 00:38:37.935
<v Speaker 2>our issues to support that. We've tried it.

00:38:37.935 --> 00:38:38.895
<v Speaker 2>It works so like

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.620
<v Speaker 2>and so when we publish it, I'd absolutely

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:43.300
<v Speaker 2>love for you to kick those tires. The

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.820
<v Speaker 2>interesting part about all of these when you

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:47.140
<v Speaker 2>look at it, the the logic behind how

00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:49.540
<v Speaker 2>Flux or Mix and

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:52.980
<v Speaker 2>dev container work, it's it it is

00:38:53.595 --> 00:38:55.835
<v Speaker 2>the logic behind them is quite similar. So

00:38:55.835 --> 00:38:57.515
<v Speaker 2>it was, like, super easy for us to

00:38:57.515 --> 00:38:59.675
<v Speaker 2>basically go out and build a version

00:39:00.155 --> 00:39:01.515
<v Speaker 2>a builder for each of these. We call

00:39:01.515 --> 00:39:02.315
<v Speaker 2>them builders.

00:39:02.635 --> 00:39:03.195
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:39:03.994 --> 00:39:05.275
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure if this is something you

00:39:05.275 --> 00:39:06.795
<v Speaker 0>use of tackle yet or something you plan

00:39:06.795 --> 00:39:08.555
<v Speaker 0>to tackle in the future, but there are

00:39:08.555 --> 00:39:09.355
<v Speaker 0>sometimes

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:12.610
<v Speaker 0>very annoying circumstances where even running in local

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:14.690
<v Speaker 0>dev requires access to some sort of secrets

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:15.730
<v Speaker 0>or credentials.

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:18.770
<v Speaker 0>Does Daytona provide any framework or hooks to

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:20.770
<v Speaker 0>be able to get those into the remote

00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:21.090
<v Speaker 0>machine?

00:39:22.065 --> 00:39:23.505
<v Speaker 2>So you can

00:39:24.945 --> 00:39:27.745
<v Speaker 2>forward secrets into the machine.

00:39:28.625 --> 00:39:31.825
<v Speaker 2>You can do that. It depends on where

00:39:31.984 --> 00:39:33.585
<v Speaker 2>you can give you more explanations. Like, you

00:39:33.585 --> 00:39:35.665
<v Speaker 2>can vary for the most simple

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.360
<v Speaker 2>problems that you have, but I don't know

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.560
<v Speaker 2>if you have anything more

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:40.640
<v Speaker 0>specific.

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.480
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I I I mean, maybe this is

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.520
<v Speaker 0>just something that,

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.440
<v Speaker 0>you know, I've had a flake. I would

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:46.960
<v Speaker 0>just have in my dependencies that I need

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.720
<v Speaker 0>the one password CLI or I need in

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.480
<v Speaker 0>physical, and I have to then, when I'm

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.855
<v Speaker 0>in the machine, provide that credential.

00:39:53.815 --> 00:39:55.495
<v Speaker 0>But maybe there's a way that because what

00:39:55.495 --> 00:39:57.335
<v Speaker 0>I'm seeing here, right, is what Daytona seem

00:39:57.335 --> 00:39:58.615
<v Speaker 0>to be doing is taking

00:39:59.335 --> 00:40:00.055
<v Speaker 0>something

00:40:00.615 --> 00:40:02.055
<v Speaker 0>that is normally

00:40:02.695 --> 00:40:03.495
<v Speaker 0>cumbersome,

00:40:03.495 --> 00:40:04.935
<v Speaker 0>finicky, annoying,

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:08.710
<v Speaker 0>and putting on a very nice developer experience

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:10.069
<v Speaker 0>to the point where it's one or two

00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:12.230
<v Speaker 0>commands and it just worked. You know? So

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:14.069
<v Speaker 0>that I'm now looking at, okay, well, what

00:40:14.069 --> 00:40:15.750
<v Speaker 0>are the other frustrations that I have when

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:17.430
<v Speaker 0>I'm trying to work with development environments? And

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:19.455
<v Speaker 0>maybe there's a, you know, you can sprinkle

00:40:19.455 --> 00:40:21.935
<v Speaker 0>some of that Daytona sauce or whatever to

00:40:21.935 --> 00:40:24.815
<v Speaker 0>make secrets acquisition easier in this remote environment.

00:40:24.815 --> 00:40:26.335
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure what that would be. But

00:40:26.495 --> 00:40:27.055
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:40:27.455 --> 00:40:28.415
<v Speaker 2>Would actually

00:40:28.735 --> 00:40:31.135
<v Speaker 2>very much invite you and everyone watching if

00:40:31.135 --> 00:40:33.215
<v Speaker 2>you have any of those ideas. Just, like,

00:40:33.215 --> 00:40:35.470
<v Speaker 2>open an issue, please, on our git repo

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:37.070
<v Speaker 2>on our GitHub repository,

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:39.630
<v Speaker 2>and we'll definitely take that out take look

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:41.630
<v Speaker 2>at those because you couldn't

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:44.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean, historically, when we started, you couldn't

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:47.870
<v Speaker 2>forward your environment variables or whatever you wanted

00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:49.795
<v Speaker 2>to inside the machines or in those other

00:40:49.795 --> 00:40:52.275
<v Speaker 2>workspaces, now you can. So, like, as we

00:40:52.835 --> 00:40:54.595
<v Speaker 2>as we progress with the product so the

00:40:54.595 --> 00:40:56.515
<v Speaker 2>open source product, we launched it in March.

00:40:56.515 --> 00:40:58.275
<v Speaker 2>It's now September, so it's still a fairly

00:40:58.275 --> 00:41:00.355
<v Speaker 2>short time. It's still not a stable version,

00:41:00.355 --> 00:41:02.195
<v Speaker 2>to be clear. Like, there's breaking changes in

00:41:02.195 --> 00:41:03.155
<v Speaker 2>the updates that we do do.

00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:05.730
<v Speaker 2>Just to be clear, like, it's still not

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:07.810
<v Speaker 2>there, and my engineering team is

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:09.810
<v Speaker 2>basically, I was saying, can we get to,

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:12.050
<v Speaker 2>like, a stable because of whatever reason? They're

00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:12.450
<v Speaker 2>like,

00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:15.330
<v Speaker 2>no. Like, we can't do that yet. We

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:16.690
<v Speaker 2>want the freedom to be able to move.

00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:18.455
<v Speaker 2>We do two launches a week on the

00:41:18.455 --> 00:41:20.295
<v Speaker 2>open source version. So it's like there's a

00:41:20.295 --> 00:41:22.455
<v Speaker 2>lot of iteration of things happening. And so,

00:41:22.455 --> 00:41:24.295
<v Speaker 2>basically, what we wanna do is take away

00:41:24.295 --> 00:41:26.455
<v Speaker 2>all of these paper cuts that you have

00:41:26.535 --> 00:41:28.455
<v Speaker 2>in a dev environment, and there's so many

00:41:28.455 --> 00:41:29.095
<v Speaker 2>of them

00:41:29.495 --> 00:41:31.255
<v Speaker 2>because there's so many different dev environments.

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.760
<v Speaker 2>And they're not probably gonna be all your

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.359
<v Speaker 2>paper cuts, but you're gonna have two of

00:41:35.359 --> 00:41:37.200
<v Speaker 2>them. I'll have two. Another will have 10,

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.880
<v Speaker 2>whatever it may be. And so can we

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.119
<v Speaker 2>sort of, like, take all these paper cuts

00:41:41.119 --> 00:41:44.080
<v Speaker 2>and remove them from the world? That is

00:41:44.319 --> 00:41:45.359
<v Speaker 2>what we want to achieve.

00:41:46.695 --> 00:41:49.495
<v Speaker 0>Okay. I like it. Is there anything else

00:41:49.495 --> 00:41:51.255
<v Speaker 0>that you think would be interesting to show

00:41:51.255 --> 00:41:52.935
<v Speaker 0>us before we jump back to big face

00:41:52.935 --> 00:41:53.495
<v Speaker 0>mode?

00:41:53.735 --> 00:41:56.375
<v Speaker 2>I think that, like, for the demo, I'd

00:41:56.375 --> 00:41:57.975
<v Speaker 2>like pause it here. I can share, like,

00:41:57.975 --> 00:41:59.575
<v Speaker 2>what the graphic interface looks like and what

00:41:59.575 --> 00:42:01.250
<v Speaker 2>other things we can do, but I feel

00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:01.810
<v Speaker 2>that

00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:03.170
<v Speaker 2>because

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:05.329
<v Speaker 2>the idea of dev environments for people is

00:42:05.329 --> 00:42:06.369
<v Speaker 2>like, why do I have to do it?

00:42:06.369 --> 00:42:07.890
<v Speaker 2>Like, I have you know, I can do

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:09.250
<v Speaker 2>it myself. I can do whatever.

00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:12.130
<v Speaker 2>I feel that this leaves the most impact,

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:12.690
<v Speaker 2>hopefully. And

00:42:13.605 --> 00:42:15.205
<v Speaker 2>it gives enough that, like, oh, can I

00:42:15.205 --> 00:42:16.565
<v Speaker 2>try it? Can I have that same experience

00:42:16.565 --> 00:42:18.725
<v Speaker 2>with my project? Right? And if you don't,

00:42:19.125 --> 00:42:21.285
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to know why, like, open an

00:42:21.285 --> 00:42:23.525
<v Speaker 2>issue, and we'll we'll basically take care of

00:42:23.525 --> 00:42:25.045
<v Speaker 2>it as soon as we can because we

00:42:25.045 --> 00:42:26.885
<v Speaker 2>wanna tackle all these issues. And the ones

00:42:26.885 --> 00:42:28.484
<v Speaker 2>that you mentioned as well, the sense of

00:42:28.484 --> 00:42:29.445
<v Speaker 2>can I have multiple

00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:32.910
<v Speaker 2>workspaces basically running inside? That's something that's probably

00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:36.110
<v Speaker 2>the most common question that we get from

00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:38.510
<v Speaker 2>people that we talk to is, like, can

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:40.670
<v Speaker 2>we get that part in there as well?

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:42.190
<v Speaker 2>And so it's not as simple. It's not

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:44.465
<v Speaker 2>straightforward, but, yes, you can, and we hope

00:42:44.465 --> 00:42:45.985
<v Speaker 2>to solve that for everyone as well.

00:42:46.545 --> 00:42:48.785
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Just like that that opens up that

00:42:48.785 --> 00:42:51.345
<v Speaker 0>interest and approach where I can either

00:42:51.505 --> 00:42:54.305
<v Speaker 0>spin up a slightly bigger box and repurpose

00:42:54.305 --> 00:42:56.465
<v Speaker 0>it and save some time from the provisioning

00:42:56.465 --> 00:42:58.065
<v Speaker 0>versus having to shut it back down and

00:42:58.065 --> 00:42:59.570
<v Speaker 0>spin it up. It's certainly not

00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:01.730
<v Speaker 0>you know, it's not a deal breaker because

00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:03.490
<v Speaker 0>what you're showing is that you can put

00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:05.890
<v Speaker 0>a nice user experience, a a good nice

00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:07.810
<v Speaker 0>developer experience on top of what is otherwise

00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:11.090
<v Speaker 0>a relatively painful problem. So But can we

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:12.825
<v Speaker 2>but still, we want to get that one

00:43:12.825 --> 00:43:15.224
<v Speaker 2>as well. Like, can there's no reason again,

00:43:15.224 --> 00:43:17.145
<v Speaker 2>I'm I'm using the the self driving car

00:43:17.145 --> 00:43:19.545
<v Speaker 2>analogy. Like, if we can get that, like,

00:43:19.625 --> 00:43:20.905
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason in the world why we

00:43:20.905 --> 00:43:22.905
<v Speaker 2>can't solve your problem. Like, there's no reason.

00:43:22.905 --> 00:43:24.825
<v Speaker 2>Right? I think. I think there's just not

00:43:24.825 --> 00:43:25.465
<v Speaker 2>enough

00:43:26.025 --> 00:43:27.145
<v Speaker 2>there was not enough

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:28.829
<v Speaker 2>of a pain

00:43:30.509 --> 00:43:32.670
<v Speaker 2>for a solution historically

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:35.630
<v Speaker 2>because dev environments were not as complicated historically

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:36.829
<v Speaker 2>as they are today.

00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:39.869
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, we have a question from someone

00:43:39.869 --> 00:43:42.345
<v Speaker 0>named thank you in the chat. Okay. Thank

00:43:42.345 --> 00:43:44.905
<v Speaker 0>you. I work with Red Hat OCP and

00:43:44.905 --> 00:43:46.345
<v Speaker 0>ARO clusters.

00:43:47.705 --> 00:43:49.225
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure what those is it OCP

00:43:49.225 --> 00:43:50.505
<v Speaker 0>that I'll come back to that in a

00:43:50.505 --> 00:43:50.985
<v Speaker 0>minute.

00:43:51.385 --> 00:43:53.545
<v Speaker 0>With observability and monitoring,

00:43:53.785 --> 00:43:56.230
<v Speaker 0>can Daytona make my life easier? So I

00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:58.070
<v Speaker 0>guess what they're curious about is

00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:00.550
<v Speaker 0>can they use

00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:02.470
<v Speaker 0>as as OCP Kubernetes?

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:04.790
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I don't even know. I don't

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:05.190
<v Speaker 0>know.

00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:07.590
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I think OCP was that project

00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:08.950
<v Speaker 0>that tried to do Kubernetes

00:44:09.255 --> 00:44:10.934
<v Speaker 0>with no worker nodes and get a control

00:44:10.934 --> 00:44:12.295
<v Speaker 0>point. Maybe, thank you, you can jump back

00:44:12.295 --> 00:44:13.734
<v Speaker 0>into the comments and let us know. I

00:44:13.734 --> 00:44:16.055
<v Speaker 0>have no idea what ARO clusters are. I'm

00:44:16.055 --> 00:44:16.775
<v Speaker 0>so sorry.

00:44:17.734 --> 00:44:19.974
<v Speaker 0>But, yeah, let's talk Let's talk more, but

00:44:19.974 --> 00:44:21.494
<v Speaker 2>if we can get more details on the

00:44:21.494 --> 00:44:22.454
<v Speaker 2>question, we'll try to answer.

00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:23.820
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:25.740
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:28.300
<v Speaker 0>Ravi is saying, so if we install Daytona

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:31.100
<v Speaker 0>with Next, does it still depend on containers?

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:34.140
<v Speaker 2>So it depends on the question.

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:36.060
<v Speaker 2>So if you

00:44:36.255 --> 00:44:38.734
<v Speaker 2>if we're talking about do we use next

00:44:39.134 --> 00:44:41.935
<v Speaker 2>next, sorry, as a as a configuration,

00:44:43.295 --> 00:44:45.454
<v Speaker 2>yes. It still uses containers.

00:44:45.535 --> 00:44:47.535
<v Speaker 2>It's just the way that we architect that

00:44:47.535 --> 00:44:50.815
<v Speaker 2>we architect these things. I know that next,

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:52.850
<v Speaker 2>the way it works, like, you don't have

00:44:52.850 --> 00:44:54.370
<v Speaker 2>to have containers on your machine.

00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:56.290
<v Speaker 2>But the way we've

00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:58.370
<v Speaker 2>done it is we create we an isolated

00:44:58.370 --> 00:45:00.690
<v Speaker 2>container every single time regardless

00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:02.450
<v Speaker 2>just to keep

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:05.010
<v Speaker 2>the product as is. You as a user

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:06.290
<v Speaker 2>don't actually see the difference.

00:45:06.905 --> 00:45:08.744
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't see the difference, but the answer

00:45:08.744 --> 00:45:10.345
<v Speaker 2>is yes. We do use that. And if

00:45:10.345 --> 00:45:11.465
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about the

00:45:11.865 --> 00:45:13.945
<v Speaker 2>VMs as well, it'll go up and spin

00:45:13.945 --> 00:45:16.265
<v Speaker 2>up VMs, specifically right now with DigitalOcean, and

00:45:16.265 --> 00:45:17.224
<v Speaker 2>then it'll it'll build

00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:21.460
<v Speaker 2>using the next configuration file, and each one

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:23.700
<v Speaker 2>will be its own separate even though I

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:25.059
<v Speaker 2>understand it could be on the same one.

00:45:25.059 --> 00:45:25.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:45:26.099 --> 00:45:26.820
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:45:27.299 --> 00:45:29.460
<v Speaker 0>Thank you, Seth. It's just a Kubernetes based

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.220
<v Speaker 0>Red Hat product. So maybe let's talk about

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:33.380
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I'm assuming Daytona could be deployed

00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:35.875
<v Speaker 0>to Kubernetes and kind of provision to Kubernetes

00:45:35.875 --> 00:45:36.835
<v Speaker 0>as a provider.

00:45:37.395 --> 00:45:40.035
<v Speaker 2>So there there's two answers to this. Yes.

00:45:40.035 --> 00:45:42.275
<v Speaker 2>We will. There's an up and coming provider

00:45:42.275 --> 00:45:43.474
<v Speaker 2>for Kubernetes.

00:45:43.474 --> 00:45:45.315
<v Speaker 2>So instead of using, like, a Docker container,

00:45:45.315 --> 00:45:47.075
<v Speaker 2>it can use Kubernetes and spin that up.

00:45:47.075 --> 00:45:48.674
<v Speaker 2>So that's up and coming, and that sort

00:45:48.674 --> 00:45:49.234
<v Speaker 2>of falls

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:52.440
<v Speaker 2>into the same, at least for us,

00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:55.560
<v Speaker 2>the same problem as how do we interface

00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:56.520
<v Speaker 2>multiple

00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:01.880
<v Speaker 2>workspaces, sandboxes, whatever inside a a dev environment.

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:03.960
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're looking at it from a

00:46:04.944 --> 00:46:06.385
<v Speaker 2>UI perspective,

00:46:06.385 --> 00:46:08.224
<v Speaker 2>it is very much similar. So you have,

00:46:08.224 --> 00:46:09.984
<v Speaker 2>like, one dev environment that has multiple of

00:46:09.984 --> 00:46:12.785
<v Speaker 2>these pods or whatever. And so, yes, there

00:46:12.785 --> 00:46:14.385
<v Speaker 2>is a Kubernetes

00:46:15.185 --> 00:46:15.744
<v Speaker 2>provider

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:18.980
<v Speaker 2>coming up, but we're just aligning how that's

00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:20.420
<v Speaker 2>gonna work with all these different things. So

00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:22.340
<v Speaker 2>that's not specific for for each of the

00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:23.220
<v Speaker 2>different providers.

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:25.300
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:28.020
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I'm gonna pop us back over here.

00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:29.540
<v Speaker 0>If anyone watching has

00:46:29.955 --> 00:46:31.955
<v Speaker 0>if anyone watching has I always forget about

00:46:31.955 --> 00:46:34.035
<v Speaker 0>those little animations. If anyone watching has any

00:46:34.035 --> 00:46:35.235
<v Speaker 0>more questions, drop them in. You've got a

00:46:35.235 --> 00:46:37.075
<v Speaker 0>few more few more minutes to sneak them

00:46:37.075 --> 00:46:38.275
<v Speaker 0>in. Let's

00:46:38.275 --> 00:46:40.435
<v Speaker 0>talk about what's next for Daytona. So you

00:46:40.435 --> 00:46:41.555
<v Speaker 0>open sourced this

00:46:42.595 --> 00:46:44.870
<v Speaker 0>a little under a year ago. Mhmm.

00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:48.950
<v Speaker 0>You're solving common developer or at least simplifying

00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:50.550
<v Speaker 0>developer experience

00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:52.470
<v Speaker 0>or getting developer environments.

00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:55.670
<v Speaker 0>What's next and what are you what's your,

00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:57.110
<v Speaker 0>like, North Star? Where do you want to

00:46:57.110 --> 00:46:57.430
<v Speaker 0>get to?

00:46:58.385 --> 00:46:59.905
<v Speaker 2>So what where we want to get to

00:46:59.905 --> 00:47:02.785
<v Speaker 2>is hopefully be a way of work because

00:47:02.785 --> 00:47:05.505
<v Speaker 2>it is an open source free tool. Hopefully,

00:47:05.505 --> 00:47:07.665
<v Speaker 2>every developer in the world, like, uses

00:47:07.825 --> 00:47:10.224
<v Speaker 2>a Daytona command versus, like, whatever they're doing

00:47:10.224 --> 00:47:12.224
<v Speaker 2>right now and all the variations of that.

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:14.800
<v Speaker 2>That is, like, what we hopefully achieve at

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.240
<v Speaker 2>one time. But even more than that and

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:17.280
<v Speaker 2>I have to sort of add on it

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:19.280
<v Speaker 2>a bit just, like, aligning where the world

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:19.760
<v Speaker 2>is.

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:22.000
<v Speaker 2>There is a lot of

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:23.920
<v Speaker 2>and I'll take a step back before that.

00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:25.600
<v Speaker 2>So we launched support for Cursor

00:47:26.105 --> 00:47:28.345
<v Speaker 2>last week or the week before that. And

00:47:28.345 --> 00:47:29.625
<v Speaker 2>so why we do that? It was, like,

00:47:29.625 --> 00:47:30.825
<v Speaker 2>actually very

00:47:31.464 --> 00:47:34.424
<v Speaker 2>interesting on how why people looked at it.

00:47:34.424 --> 00:47:35.865
<v Speaker 2>And when you look at all the launches,

00:47:35.865 --> 00:47:37.704
<v Speaker 2>it's probably one of the highest. The reason

00:47:37.704 --> 00:47:38.905
<v Speaker 2>is I don't know if you saw this,

00:47:38.905 --> 00:47:42.250
<v Speaker 2>the meme on Twitter or x, whatever,

00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:44.970
<v Speaker 2>of, like like, we don't need like, developers

00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:46.650
<v Speaker 2>are gonna, like, go away because we have

00:47:46.650 --> 00:47:47.450
<v Speaker 2>AI.

00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:49.450
<v Speaker 2>And then you have, like, new someone in

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:52.010
<v Speaker 2>a in a in an iMessage sharing, oh,

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:54.170
<v Speaker 2>I made this application, which is not developer.

00:47:54.515 --> 00:47:56.035
<v Speaker 2>They said show me, and they send local

00:47:56.035 --> 00:47:58.275
<v Speaker 2>host 3,000, basically. Like, I don't if you

00:47:58.275 --> 00:47:59.555
<v Speaker 2>saw that. It's like a meeting. It was

00:47:59.555 --> 00:48:02.195
<v Speaker 2>all over the Internet, when Cursor line raised

00:48:02.195 --> 00:48:03.155
<v Speaker 2>their last round.

00:48:03.635 --> 00:48:05.395
<v Speaker 2>And so as you saw with Daytona, there's,

00:48:05.395 --> 00:48:06.595
<v Speaker 2>a QR code, but you have to show

00:48:06.595 --> 00:48:08.970
<v Speaker 2>your thing. And so we felt that it

00:48:08.970 --> 00:48:11.770
<v Speaker 2>was really interesting that we support Cursor because

00:48:11.770 --> 00:48:14.090
<v Speaker 2>you can actually get a solution to that

00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:16.410
<v Speaker 2>problem. Like, an AI creates whatever or assists

00:48:16.410 --> 00:48:18.250
<v Speaker 2>you, and then you can preview it to

00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:18.810
<v Speaker 2>something.

00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:21.095
<v Speaker 2>And that got a bunch of interest, a

00:48:21.095 --> 00:48:22.855
<v Speaker 2>lot of people using cursor, I think it's

00:48:22.855 --> 00:48:24.375
<v Speaker 2>our number it's been out the support for

00:48:24.375 --> 00:48:26.295
<v Speaker 2>two weeks, and it's by far our number

00:48:26.295 --> 00:48:28.615
<v Speaker 2>two IDE. So it's Versus Code and cursor,

00:48:28.615 --> 00:48:30.855
<v Speaker 2>like, halfway there, which is quite interesting.

00:48:32.310 --> 00:48:34.470
<v Speaker 2>The other thing while we're thinking about all

00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:37.190
<v Speaker 2>that is what does the future look like

00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:41.270
<v Speaker 2>in general for human and AI developers,

00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:44.150
<v Speaker 2>be it fully autonomous or being just code

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.950
<v Speaker 2>assist or whatever?

00:48:45.545 --> 00:48:47.545
<v Speaker 2>And it seems I've been testing out a

00:48:47.545 --> 00:48:49.705
<v Speaker 2>lot of these. So all hands, dev and

00:48:49.705 --> 00:48:52.425
<v Speaker 2>AI, and all these others, like, autonomous ones.

00:48:52.505 --> 00:48:54.185
<v Speaker 2>And what's interesting for them is if you

00:48:54.185 --> 00:48:56.425
<v Speaker 2>have fully autonomous one, it takes some time

00:48:56.425 --> 00:48:58.985
<v Speaker 2>to do things. Like, it's not instant. Right?

00:48:58.985 --> 00:49:00.105
<v Speaker 2>If you wanna create a complex

00:49:01.119 --> 00:49:01.920
<v Speaker 2>product,

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:03.760
<v Speaker 2>whatever it might be, it's gonna take the

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:06.960
<v Speaker 2>AI time. Like, they might know, quote, unquote,

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.480
<v Speaker 2>know everything. They might not I'm not gonna

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.560
<v Speaker 2>get into that argument at all. That's a

00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:12.640
<v Speaker 2>whole conversation on its own. But it does

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:14.645
<v Speaker 2>take time to get something done. And so

00:49:14.645 --> 00:49:16.005
<v Speaker 2>if it takes time to get something done,

00:49:16.005 --> 00:49:17.765
<v Speaker 2>if you're running that on your local machine

00:49:18.085 --> 00:49:20.964
<v Speaker 2>and if that is your full compute like,

00:49:20.964 --> 00:49:22.565
<v Speaker 2>you can't do other things. You basically have

00:49:22.565 --> 00:49:24.165
<v Speaker 2>to go have coffee and wait for the

00:49:24.165 --> 00:49:25.605
<v Speaker 2>thing to do something. Yep.

00:49:25.765 --> 00:49:27.685
<v Speaker 2>For me, that doesn't make sense.

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:30.450
<v Speaker 2>Like, the the way it should work is

00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:33.490
<v Speaker 2>like, oh, like, oh, AI. Here's a digital

00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:35.410
<v Speaker 2>ocean or EC two. Like, go do your

00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:36.770
<v Speaker 2>thing. I can spin up 10 of them

00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:38.850
<v Speaker 2>because I'm doing 10 different things. And I

00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:40.370
<v Speaker 2>also wanna build something on my own because

00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:41.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing something, or I wanna check out

00:49:41.810 --> 00:49:43.665
<v Speaker 2>the repo that that the AI has built,

00:49:43.665 --> 00:49:45.905
<v Speaker 2>and I wanna do that. And so can

00:49:46.225 --> 00:49:48.545
<v Speaker 2>what does the dev environment look like, you

00:49:48.545 --> 00:49:50.465
<v Speaker 2>know, two years, five years, ten years from

00:49:50.465 --> 00:49:53.985
<v Speaker 2>now where both human and AI

00:49:53.985 --> 00:49:56.305
<v Speaker 2>are creating code? What is the overlap? What

00:49:56.305 --> 00:49:56.865
<v Speaker 2>is the difference?

00:49:57.450 --> 00:49:58.970
<v Speaker 2>And so those are things that we're testing

00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:01.050
<v Speaker 2>out and playing with. It's not an exact

00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:02.330
<v Speaker 2>answer to your question. Like, I don't know.

00:50:02.330 --> 00:50:03.530
<v Speaker 2>I was like, oh, we're gonna do this

00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:05.290
<v Speaker 2>because the whole market as we see him

00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:07.370
<v Speaker 2>is, like, fairly new and changes every day.

00:50:07.609 --> 00:50:10.085
<v Speaker 2>But I feel that there's a going to

00:50:10.085 --> 00:50:12.565
<v Speaker 2>be a even larger need for these standardized

00:50:12.565 --> 00:50:13.685
<v Speaker 2>and larger,

00:50:14.244 --> 00:50:17.924
<v Speaker 2>you know, dev environments running somewhere else because

00:50:17.924 --> 00:50:19.924
<v Speaker 2>of these sort of tailwinds of AI in

00:50:19.924 --> 00:50:21.285
<v Speaker 2>there. So there's a lot of thing. Not

00:50:21.285 --> 00:50:22.885
<v Speaker 2>saying we're not becoming an AI company per

00:50:22.885 --> 00:50:24.819
<v Speaker 2>se. We're not doing anything of that. But

00:50:24.819 --> 00:50:26.900
<v Speaker 2>what infrastructure is needed to run this stuff,

00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:27.380
<v Speaker 2>basically.

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:29.380
<v Speaker 0>Very cool.

00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:32.819
<v Speaker 0>Do you have you used Cursor? I'm just

00:50:32.819 --> 00:50:35.619
<v Speaker 0>curious now. Yeah. I have. Is it good?

00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:36.660
<v Speaker 0>I haven't.

00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:38.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean, it's here. I I mean, I've

00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:39.619
<v Speaker 2>used Cursor.

00:50:40.395 --> 00:50:42.155
<v Speaker 0>I mean, their selling point, right, is that

00:50:42.155 --> 00:50:43.995
<v Speaker 0>they scan your whole code base instead of

00:50:43.995 --> 00:50:45.355
<v Speaker 0>just being pinched

00:50:45.355 --> 00:50:46.875
<v Speaker 0>at, like, a single file, but I haven't

00:50:46.955 --> 00:50:49.035
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It does. You can do things in

00:50:49.035 --> 00:50:49.755
<v Speaker 2>English,

00:50:49.915 --> 00:50:51.595
<v Speaker 2>like, or in any other language actually, which

00:50:51.595 --> 00:50:52.555
<v Speaker 2>is interesting. Like, you can do it in

00:50:52.555 --> 00:50:54.760
<v Speaker 2>French or German or Chinese or whatever. And

00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:56.600
<v Speaker 2>it does. So, basically,

00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:58.760
<v Speaker 2>I've I've done this demo and done other

00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:00.520
<v Speaker 2>demos with Cursor as well where, basically, you

00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:02.760
<v Speaker 2>say, oh, chain find the hello world

00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:05.240
<v Speaker 2>that shows up when I run the project

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:07.605
<v Speaker 2>and change it to hello, David. It'll go

00:51:07.605 --> 00:51:09.365
<v Speaker 2>through and say, oh, it's this file. It's

00:51:09.365 --> 00:51:10.565
<v Speaker 2>on this line. Would you like me to

00:51:10.565 --> 00:51:12.005
<v Speaker 2>change it? You say yes, and it does

00:51:12.005 --> 00:51:14.485
<v Speaker 2>it. So it's like like, it's pretty cool

00:51:14.485 --> 00:51:16.885
<v Speaker 2>for those things. I very much believe that

00:51:16.885 --> 00:51:18.085
<v Speaker 2>AI is not in a place where it's

00:51:18.085 --> 00:51:19.525
<v Speaker 2>like, oh, go build me an app, and

00:51:19.525 --> 00:51:21.125
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna, like, make money off this app.

00:51:21.125 --> 00:51:23.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's even close to that

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:25.250
<v Speaker 2>there. But those types of things, like, yeah,

00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:26.770
<v Speaker 2>it's, like, super convenient. You don't have to,

00:51:26.770 --> 00:51:28.130
<v Speaker 2>like, search or do anything. It's just like,

00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:29.650
<v Speaker 2>go do it, and it does it. So

00:51:29.650 --> 00:51:31.730
<v Speaker 2>that's great. So you're not gonna be in

00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:33.730
<v Speaker 0>the business of when people open issues on

00:51:33.730 --> 00:51:35.570
<v Speaker 0>open source, it's on a project of having

00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:37.605
<v Speaker 0>Cursa then go implement it, ship a pull

00:51:37.605 --> 00:51:38.885
<v Speaker 0>request, merge it?

00:51:39.205 --> 00:51:40.165
<v Speaker 0>Not quite yet.

00:51:40.805 --> 00:51:43.125
<v Speaker 2>I don't like, maybe for the simple ones,

00:51:43.125 --> 00:51:44.885
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that the I've

00:51:44.885 --> 00:51:46.005
<v Speaker 2>talked to a lot of the a lot

00:51:46.005 --> 00:51:48.805
<v Speaker 2>of companies that are building vary variations of

00:51:48.805 --> 00:51:51.525
<v Speaker 2>AI agents, autonomous and, like, assisted.

00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:53.650
<v Speaker 2>And there's a lot of them that still

00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:56.050
<v Speaker 2>use humans, a lot of them. There are

00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:58.130
<v Speaker 2>some that also use so there's startups that

00:51:58.130 --> 00:51:59.650
<v Speaker 2>do exactly what you said. It's like, oh,

00:51:59.650 --> 00:52:01.330
<v Speaker 2>there's a pull request, then you sort of

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:03.650
<v Speaker 2>assign the AI. It goes out. It spins

00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:06.130
<v Speaker 2>up a VM somewhere. It runs. It does

00:52:06.130 --> 00:52:06.610
<v Speaker 2>all these things.

00:52:07.685 --> 00:52:09.285
<v Speaker 2>But I've also seen ones that do that,

00:52:09.285 --> 00:52:10.885
<v Speaker 2>and then a human actually looks at the

00:52:10.885 --> 00:52:13.525
<v Speaker 2>code, sort of fine tunes that, and then,

00:52:14.085 --> 00:52:17.365
<v Speaker 2>submits a PR. So I've seen those, happening

00:52:17.365 --> 00:52:19.925
<v Speaker 2>as well. Fully autonomous, they exist, but it's

00:52:19.925 --> 00:52:21.205
<v Speaker 2>also a question of, like, how good is

00:52:21.205 --> 00:52:21.685
<v Speaker 2>it. I

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:23.920
<v Speaker 2>can't use it for a lot of things

00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:24.800
<v Speaker 2>that we're doing,

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:27.200
<v Speaker 2>but it's also and you'll probably know this

00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:28.480
<v Speaker 2>as well where it's AI

00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:32.320
<v Speaker 2>does a lot of or AI. I actually

00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:34.160
<v Speaker 2>don't really like that word AI for what

00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:35.600
<v Speaker 2>what this is right now. I feel like

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:38.000
<v Speaker 2>AI is something like, AGI is more AI.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:38.240
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,

00:52:38.845 --> 00:52:39.725
<v Speaker 2>semantics.

00:52:40.605 --> 00:52:42.925
<v Speaker 2>What I was gonna say is that AI

00:52:42.925 --> 00:52:44.685
<v Speaker 2>is really good at doing things that we

00:52:44.685 --> 00:52:45.885
<v Speaker 2>have done as humans,

00:52:46.125 --> 00:52:47.805
<v Speaker 2>you know, before. So if you're gonna create

00:52:47.805 --> 00:52:50.045
<v Speaker 2>a crud app, like, that's easy. It's gonna

00:52:50.045 --> 00:52:52.160
<v Speaker 2>go do that for you. Like like, anyone

00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:53.680
<v Speaker 2>can do that. You just, you know, search

00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:55.280
<v Speaker 2>the Internet, how you do it, whatever. But

00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:57.520
<v Speaker 2>if you're doing something that has not generally

00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:59.200
<v Speaker 2>been done or not in the public, and

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:01.200
<v Speaker 2>if we're trying to fine tune and optimize,

00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:04.240
<v Speaker 2>you know, these machines and then, you know,

00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:06.240
<v Speaker 2>sticking multiple machines in one machine

00:53:06.605 --> 00:53:08.285
<v Speaker 2>in the way that we're doing, like, it's

00:53:08.285 --> 00:53:09.484
<v Speaker 2>not gonna,

00:53:09.805 --> 00:53:11.005
<v Speaker 2>give you anything

00:53:11.325 --> 00:53:12.845
<v Speaker 2>really useful in the sense of, like, an

00:53:12.845 --> 00:53:15.085
<v Speaker 2>end to end solution. Obviously, in, like, assistance

00:53:15.085 --> 00:53:16.684
<v Speaker 2>when you're, like, typing things and it's trying

00:53:16.684 --> 00:53:17.885
<v Speaker 2>to help you, it'll find it. It'll do

00:53:17.885 --> 00:53:20.605
<v Speaker 2>those. But actually making something complex that the

00:53:20.605 --> 00:53:21.085
<v Speaker 2>world

00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:23.869
<v Speaker 2>has not seen or not seen in public,

00:53:23.869 --> 00:53:25.470
<v Speaker 2>it's not gonna do that very well.

00:53:27.069 --> 00:53:28.270
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Awesome.

00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:31.069
<v Speaker 0>Well, I will say thank you, first and

00:53:31.069 --> 00:53:34.205
<v Speaker 0>foremost, for building a great open source project.

00:53:34.605 --> 00:53:37.485
<v Speaker 0>I feel like the developer management environment space

00:53:37.485 --> 00:53:39.885
<v Speaker 0>has been lettered with proprietary software for for

00:53:39.885 --> 00:53:41.565
<v Speaker 0>far too long, and it's nice to see

00:53:41.565 --> 00:53:43.645
<v Speaker 0>a bit of young fresh blood come in

00:53:43.645 --> 00:53:45.725
<v Speaker 0>and shake that up with open source. I

00:53:45.725 --> 00:53:47.805
<v Speaker 0>also appreciate the change logs, which are shipping

00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:49.829
<v Speaker 0>far quicker than I can keep up with

00:53:49.829 --> 00:53:52.069
<v Speaker 0>them. But that level of transparency into what

00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:53.589
<v Speaker 0>you're doing as a company and a product

00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:55.590
<v Speaker 0>at an open source project is

00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:57.910
<v Speaker 0>invaluable. So, again, lots of thank yous for

00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:59.670
<v Speaker 0>you and your team and what you're doing.

00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:02.615
<v Speaker 0>Any final words before we say goodbye? Just

00:54:02.615 --> 00:54:04.295
<v Speaker 2>very much a thank you. This is our

00:54:04.295 --> 00:54:06.375
<v Speaker 2>first open source project

00:54:06.535 --> 00:54:09.095
<v Speaker 2>product project. We've never done it ourselves. Obviously,

00:54:09.095 --> 00:54:12.214
<v Speaker 2>we've consumed other ones, and we're trying. So

00:54:12.214 --> 00:54:14.214
<v Speaker 2>if anyone has any comments of, like, oh,

00:54:14.214 --> 00:54:15.895
<v Speaker 2>we're supposed to show this or do this,

00:54:15.895 --> 00:54:17.335
<v Speaker 2>we're trying like, the road map is in

00:54:17.335 --> 00:54:19.070
<v Speaker 2>there. I just had a change lock is

00:54:19.070 --> 00:54:19.630
<v Speaker 2>in there.

00:54:20.110 --> 00:54:22.190
<v Speaker 2>All the issues, everything's very, very transparent, and

00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:24.190
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to do that even though, you

00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:26.030
<v Speaker 2>know, it is a company a venture backed

00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:28.430
<v Speaker 2>company trying to do something. But this section

00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:31.465
<v Speaker 2>of what we've built should be a pure

00:54:31.705 --> 00:54:33.385
<v Speaker 2>as pure as it can be open source.

00:54:33.385 --> 00:54:35.065
<v Speaker 2>And so if anyone has any, you know,

00:54:35.065 --> 00:54:37.145
<v Speaker 2>comments or suggestions, we're all there. Also in

00:54:37.145 --> 00:54:37.705
<v Speaker 2>Slack,

00:54:37.945 --> 00:54:40.105
<v Speaker 2>we have a fairly large is it, like,

00:54:40.105 --> 00:54:41.145
<v Speaker 2>2,000

00:54:41.145 --> 00:54:43.625
<v Speaker 2>people, whatever, in our Slack? Happy to have

00:54:43.625 --> 00:54:45.930
<v Speaker 2>people join that as well and share with

00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:47.369
<v Speaker 2>our comments and tell us what we're doing

00:54:47.369 --> 00:54:49.130
<v Speaker 2>wrong or what we're doing great. Like, we

00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:50.330
<v Speaker 2>welcome all comments.

00:54:50.730 --> 00:54:51.530
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:53.369
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, thank you so much for your

00:54:53.369 --> 00:54:55.290
<v Speaker 0>time and for guiding us through that demo.

00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:57.450
<v Speaker 0>And and to everyone watching, thank you for

00:54:57.450 --> 00:54:59.849
<v Speaker 0>spending your evening, morning, or afternoon with us.

00:54:59.985 --> 00:55:00.945
<v Speaker 0>We'll see you all next time.

00:55:37.265 --> 00:55:39.265
<v Speaker 1>And

<v Speaker 1>with everyone

00:55:45.329 --> 00:55:46.210
<v Speaker 1>underneath

00:55:46.210 --> 00:55:47.569
<v Speaker 1>the rising sun.
