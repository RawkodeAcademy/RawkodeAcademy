00:03:25.495 --> 00:03:26.615
<v Speaker 0>Comtrya.

00:03:26.855 --> 00:03:29.575
<v Speaker 0>Welcome back to the Rawkode Academy. I will

00:03:29.575 --> 00:03:32.135
<v Speaker 0>explain that Comtrya reference very,

00:03:32.215 --> 00:03:33.015
<v Speaker 0>very soon.

00:03:33.255 --> 00:03:35.255
<v Speaker 0>But I wanna welcome you back. Happy New

00:03:35.255 --> 00:03:36.935
<v Speaker 0>Year, and this is the first stream of

00:03:36.935 --> 00:03:37.975
<v Speaker 0>2025

00:03:37.975 --> 00:03:40.135
<v Speaker 0>and a very special one for me because

00:03:40.135 --> 00:03:41.580
<v Speaker 0>we're taking a look at a project I've

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 0>been involved with for a long time now,

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.500
<v Speaker 0>and I get to be joined by someone

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.620
<v Speaker 0>I call a friend.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:47.900
<v Speaker 0>Hey,

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.940
<v Speaker 0>Todd, man. How's it going? Not too bad.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:51.420
<v Speaker 1>Yourself?

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.820
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. All the better now. You know, at

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.100
<v Speaker 0>the end of the day, I get to

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.995
<v Speaker 0>end in a fun way, which is, you

00:03:56.995 --> 00:03:59.635
<v Speaker 0>know, with some pretty cool dev tools written

00:03:59.635 --> 00:04:00.995
<v Speaker 0>in Rust. We might as well throw that

00:04:00.995 --> 00:04:02.195
<v Speaker 0>out there pretty early.

00:04:02.435 --> 00:04:05.235
<v Speaker 0>But before we talk more about Comtrya and

00:04:05.235 --> 00:04:06.595
<v Speaker 0>what we're gonna show today, do you wanna

00:04:06.595 --> 00:04:08.035
<v Speaker 0>just give a a little bit of an

00:04:08.035 --> 00:04:09.715
<v Speaker 0>introduction to the audience at home?

00:04:10.115 --> 00:04:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Once again, Todd Martin. I'm one of

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.590
<v Speaker 1>the maintainers, I guess, now probably the primary

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:16.630
<v Speaker 1>maintainer

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.709
<v Speaker 1>since I've kinda got the free time to

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:19.670
<v Speaker 1>look after it.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.150
<v Speaker 1>Software engineer during my day job. I slinged

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.190
<v Speaker 1>C Sharp for a smaller company and then

00:04:27.565 --> 00:04:30.125
<v Speaker 1>do Comtrya during my free time. I first

00:04:30.125 --> 00:04:31.965
<v Speaker 1>came to it because of another

00:04:32.525 --> 00:04:34.365
<v Speaker 1>friend, Michael Ream,

00:04:35.245 --> 00:04:37.645
<v Speaker 1>out of Germany who actually pointed me to

00:04:37.645 --> 00:04:39.565
<v Speaker 1>Comtrya for a project we were looking at

00:04:39.565 --> 00:04:42.380
<v Speaker 1>for VSD and then ended up becoming a

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.580
<v Speaker 1>contributor and then later on a maintainer.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:48.780
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.220
<v Speaker 0>Even if there's a very annoying buzzing sound,

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.020
<v Speaker 0>I've turned off a space heater because it's

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.020
<v Speaker 0>pretty cold here. And if that doesn't fix

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.645
<v Speaker 0>it, I will pop a cable and put

00:04:58.645 --> 00:05:00.645
<v Speaker 0>it back in, which is the universal answer

00:05:00.645 --> 00:05:02.645
<v Speaker 0>to all audio issues. Mhmm. So let me

00:05:02.645 --> 00:05:04.565
<v Speaker 0>know in thirty seconds if that goes away.

00:05:05.685 --> 00:05:08.245
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Thank you for the quick introduction.

00:05:08.325 --> 00:05:09.765
<v Speaker 0>Why don't you tell us

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.150
<v Speaker 0>what Comtrya

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.550
<v Speaker 0>is, what it does, and what you were

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.310
<v Speaker 0>potentially looking to use it for?

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.669
<v Speaker 1>So,

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:19.350
<v Speaker 1>originally,

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.509
<v Speaker 1>I believe you started it as a dot

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:23.830
<v Speaker 1>file manager tool and kind of the primary

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.555
<v Speaker 1>purpose, and it's kind of grown in scope

00:05:25.555 --> 00:05:27.395
<v Speaker 1>since then to kind of include a lot

00:05:27.395 --> 00:05:27.955
<v Speaker 1>more

00:05:28.435 --> 00:05:31.634
<v Speaker 1>system management general system management and configuration

00:05:31.634 --> 00:05:34.995
<v Speaker 1>outside of just specifically managing dot files.

00:05:36.835 --> 00:05:38.675
<v Speaker 1>The future of it for me,

00:05:38.995 --> 00:05:40.595
<v Speaker 1>as I see it going, is leaning more

00:05:40.595 --> 00:05:44.180
<v Speaker 1>into the the system configuration and management portion,

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.940
<v Speaker 1>and that's actually what I use it for.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.940
<v Speaker 1>I've been using it a lot at work,

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.540
<v Speaker 1>the stand up systems,

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.020
<v Speaker 1>and have a configuration

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.180
<v Speaker 1>and ease deployment.

00:05:56.085 --> 00:05:56.885
<v Speaker 0>Thanks.

00:05:58.085 --> 00:06:00.085
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I mean, that's

00:06:00.245 --> 00:06:01.845
<v Speaker 0>I don't know the blessing or the curse

00:06:01.845 --> 00:06:05.125
<v Speaker 0>of all projects. Eventually, scope creep happens, and

00:06:05.125 --> 00:06:06.405
<v Speaker 0>it does more and more.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.699
<v Speaker 0>So, yeah, we could talk about how the

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:12.419
<v Speaker 0>project is growing. But maybe you could take

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:14.100
<v Speaker 0>what you said and condense it into, like,

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.699
<v Speaker 0>a thirty second pitch for someone who's never

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:18.259
<v Speaker 0>used Comtrya before. Why should they install it,

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:19.699
<v Speaker 0>and what is that kind of default use

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:21.620
<v Speaker 0>case? What would they use it for? Oh,

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.065
<v Speaker 1>that's a good one. I never really thought

00:06:23.065 --> 00:06:24.985
<v Speaker 1>about, like, a thirty second pitch.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:36.730
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I put you on the spot

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:37.450
<v Speaker 0>while

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:39.770
<v Speaker 0>I was, you know, fixing that cable, but

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:40.810
<v Speaker 0>apparently, I'm back.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:44.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:45.770
<v Speaker 1>I would say,

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.405
<v Speaker 1>if I had to quickly get one off

00:06:48.405 --> 00:06:49.765
<v Speaker 1>the top of my head without thinking too

00:06:49.765 --> 00:06:52.645
<v Speaker 1>deeply into it, say, dot file system configuration

00:06:52.645 --> 00:06:55.605
<v Speaker 1>management tool written in Rust with hopefully bringing

00:06:55.605 --> 00:06:57.925
<v Speaker 1>some of the safety that Rust brings, with

00:06:57.925 --> 00:06:58.725
<v Speaker 1>pooling,

00:06:59.205 --> 00:06:59.445
<v Speaker 1>really.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.199
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'm I'm gonna pay it on to

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:04.120
<v Speaker 0>that just because, obviously, I am very familiar

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.360
<v Speaker 0>with Comtrya. To anyone who doesn't know, I

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.720
<v Speaker 0>bootstrapped the project

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.880
<v Speaker 0>four, five years ago now. I think it

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.240
<v Speaker 0>was '20 late twenty nineteen.

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:13.560
<v Speaker 0>Maybe it was 2020. I should twice. I

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.040
<v Speaker 0>don't even know.

00:07:15.125 --> 00:07:16.885
<v Speaker 0>But my I was trying to scratch my

00:07:16.885 --> 00:07:18.325
<v Speaker 0>own itch. I

00:07:18.485 --> 00:07:20.805
<v Speaker 0>am a serial OS wiper.

00:07:20.885 --> 00:07:23.125
<v Speaker 0>Like, I like to format my machines pretty

00:07:23.125 --> 00:07:26.085
<v Speaker 0>much religiously every 30. Religiously might not be

00:07:26.085 --> 00:07:27.765
<v Speaker 0>the right word. But with thirty day cadence

00:07:27.765 --> 00:07:28.085
<v Speaker 0>because

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:31.010
<v Speaker 0>promotes

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:32.290
<v Speaker 0>better

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.010
<v Speaker 0>habits with my machine. I don't like clutter.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.090
<v Speaker 0>I like a fresh system. I

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.810
<v Speaker 0>don't wanna lose anything really this older than

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.330
<v Speaker 0>thirty days. It makes sure that I back

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:42.690
<v Speaker 0>stuff up where I need to back it

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.010
<v Speaker 0>up. And, also, it's just fun to distro

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:46.825
<v Speaker 0>hop. You know, I'm a Linux user. So,

00:07:46.825 --> 00:07:49.145
<v Speaker 0>you know, whether I'm running XSOS today, I

00:07:49.145 --> 00:07:51.145
<v Speaker 0>might be Arch tomorrow. Next week, I might

00:07:51.145 --> 00:07:53.225
<v Speaker 0>be in Silverblue again. Like,

00:07:53.545 --> 00:07:55.465
<v Speaker 0>I'm just insatiable when it comes to Linux,

00:07:55.465 --> 00:07:57.145
<v Speaker 0>and I'm always jumping about and experimenting and

00:07:57.145 --> 00:07:59.640
<v Speaker 0>kicking tires on things. And Comtrya is the

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.200
<v Speaker 0>reason I started a project was to, okay,

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.280
<v Speaker 0>how do I get from, oh, shit, here's

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.280
<v Speaker 0>the fresh machine to how do I get

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.600
<v Speaker 0>back to work without wasting an entire day?

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.040
<v Speaker 0>Because let's be honest, right, you get a

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:10.680
<v Speaker 0>new machine

00:08:11.175 --> 00:08:12.854
<v Speaker 0>so at least two days of just messing

00:08:12.854 --> 00:08:15.974
<v Speaker 0>about installing stuff and testing out new extensions.

00:08:15.974 --> 00:08:17.895
<v Speaker 0>I I don't know. Maybe I'm just terrible

00:08:17.895 --> 00:08:19.014
<v Speaker 0>procrastinator.

00:08:19.815 --> 00:08:22.134
<v Speaker 0>I I can't stop installing software, and Comtrya

00:08:22.134 --> 00:08:23.735
<v Speaker 0>was trying to alleviate the burden of some

00:08:23.735 --> 00:08:24.854
<v Speaker 0>of that at least anyway. Mhmm.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.790
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So how long have you been

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.510
<v Speaker 0>you know, you are the the primary and

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.190
<v Speaker 0>I think almost sole maintainer. There's a few

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.750
<v Speaker 0>external contributors that are obviously submitting patches and

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.190
<v Speaker 0>and using the project, but, know, you've been

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:39.925
<v Speaker 0>working on this. I'm I I I don't

00:08:39.925 --> 00:08:41.525
<v Speaker 0>even know. Like, a year now? Has it

00:08:41.525 --> 00:08:42.885
<v Speaker 0>been that long? Has it been less? I'm

00:08:42.885 --> 00:08:44.965
<v Speaker 0>not sure. Yeah. I think it was about

00:08:44.965 --> 00:08:46.885
<v Speaker 1>this time last year where you had brought

00:08:46.885 --> 00:08:49.125
<v Speaker 1>up that you were getting busy with

00:08:49.845 --> 00:08:51.845
<v Speaker 1>you going out and starting your own thing

00:08:52.325 --> 00:08:54.620
<v Speaker 1>and meeting one of us to kinda meet

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.779
<v Speaker 1>or Stephan, who's also in chat, kinda picking

00:08:56.779 --> 00:08:57.740
<v Speaker 1>up some of the

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.220
<v Speaker 1>some more of the deeper maintainership duties.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Actually, I think it was a little bit

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:05.820
<v Speaker 1>before that that you

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.660
<v Speaker 1>added me to the crates so that way

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.339
<v Speaker 1>I can start doing releases. Yeah.

00:09:10.055 --> 00:09:11.495
<v Speaker 1>Last year where

00:09:12.615 --> 00:09:14.375
<v Speaker 1>I think you had mentioned that you were

00:09:14.375 --> 00:09:15.894
<v Speaker 1>getting a little busy, and you need one

00:09:15.894 --> 00:09:17.415
<v Speaker 1>of us to kinda take it up more.

00:09:17.415 --> 00:09:19.654
<v Speaker 1>And then it came up over the summer,

00:09:19.815 --> 00:09:21.654
<v Speaker 1>and I kinda took it the rest of

00:09:21.654 --> 00:09:21.894
<v Speaker 1>the way.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:25.170
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. And I think you've shipped quite a

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:26.449
<v Speaker 0>lot in that time. You know? And don't

00:09:26.449 --> 00:09:28.130
<v Speaker 0>worry to the people watching going, just get

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.130
<v Speaker 0>just show me a terminal already. Right? We're

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.130
<v Speaker 0>gonna get hands on very, very soon. But,

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:33.570
<v Speaker 0>you know, for me personally,

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:36.370
<v Speaker 0>having not having not oh, that's a terrible

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:38.285
<v Speaker 0>thing. Not having the time

00:09:38.765 --> 00:09:41.165
<v Speaker 0>to work on a project like Comtrya was

00:09:41.165 --> 00:09:43.725
<v Speaker 0>really disappointing to me because

00:09:43.725 --> 00:09:45.805
<v Speaker 0>it solves an itch. It's a space that

00:09:45.805 --> 00:09:46.445
<v Speaker 0>I like.

00:09:46.925 --> 00:09:49.965
<v Speaker 0>But just seeing you deliver new features month

00:09:49.965 --> 00:09:52.220
<v Speaker 0>after month over the last year It's really

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.180
<v Speaker 0>kinda like

00:09:53.579 --> 00:09:55.660
<v Speaker 0>it's it's I could smell on the face.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:56.860
<v Speaker 0>I'd be so happy to see the project

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.100
<v Speaker 0>moving on and changing. You know, the TOML

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.100
<v Speaker 0>support, I think, was fantastic, and there's a

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.779
<v Speaker 0>whole bunch of other features, like, you know,

00:10:02.779 --> 00:10:03.740
<v Speaker 0>supporting

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.819
<v Speaker 0>run zero as a privilege elevator.

00:10:06.425 --> 00:10:08.105
<v Speaker 0>It's just so cool to see all these

00:10:08.105 --> 00:10:10.105
<v Speaker 0>things coming together. I've seen more activity on

00:10:10.105 --> 00:10:12.345
<v Speaker 0>the GitHub across issues and pull requests.

00:10:12.505 --> 00:10:14.425
<v Speaker 0>You know, that little bit of momentum that

00:10:14.425 --> 00:10:16.665
<v Speaker 0>you pushed into the project is now paying

00:10:16.665 --> 00:10:18.839
<v Speaker 0>compound dividends as far as I'm concerned. I'm

00:10:18.839 --> 00:10:19.480
<v Speaker 0>seeing

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.839
<v Speaker 0>more adoption, more interest, and more engagement. So

00:10:22.839 --> 00:10:24.520
<v Speaker 0>I I I could not be happier with

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.920
<v Speaker 0>the position of Comtrya today, and I'm excited

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.160
<v Speaker 0>for us to share that screen, get a

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.920
<v Speaker 0>terminal open, and actually show people how they

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:31.880
<v Speaker 0>can get started and

00:10:32.335 --> 00:10:34.655
<v Speaker 0>hopefully make their lives a little bit easier.

00:10:34.975 --> 00:10:36.175
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. But before,

00:10:36.895 --> 00:10:39.215
<v Speaker 0>you know, you were an early adopter of

00:10:39.215 --> 00:10:41.295
<v Speaker 0>Comtrya too. I mean, we're going back years

00:10:41.295 --> 00:10:43.455
<v Speaker 0>now. Right? Yeah. And one of the things

00:10:43.455 --> 00:10:44.975
<v Speaker 0>that I think drew use of the project

00:10:44.975 --> 00:10:47.455
<v Speaker 0>and is still very prominent today is that

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.080
<v Speaker 0>we always say Comtrya should be able to

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.760
<v Speaker 0>run anywhere. So maybe you can give a

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.839
<v Speaker 0>little bit of flavor and color on why

00:10:52.839 --> 00:10:54.440
<v Speaker 0>that's a goal and the kind of platforms

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.400
<v Speaker 0>that we support.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So guess start off with the platforms

00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.400
<v Speaker 1>we support.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Windows, Mac OS,

00:11:02.425 --> 00:11:03.385
<v Speaker 1>Linux.

00:11:04.105 --> 00:11:05.465
<v Speaker 1>There's a little bit of an asterisk to

00:11:05.465 --> 00:11:07.225
<v Speaker 1>that. The only reason I would say that

00:11:07.225 --> 00:11:09.305
<v Speaker 1>there's an asterisk to that is because of

00:11:09.305 --> 00:11:12.345
<v Speaker 1>providers, and it's like, there's hundreds of distros.

00:11:12.905 --> 00:11:15.385
<v Speaker 1>If you look for well, as

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:18.290
<v Speaker 1>viewers will see later, there's, like, a package

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.930
<v Speaker 1>installed so that way Comtrya can install packages.

00:11:22.529 --> 00:11:24.610
<v Speaker 1>We don't have every distro in there, but

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:26.690
<v Speaker 1>if we can add it, I'm more than

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:28.370
<v Speaker 1>happy to. I just need to know what

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:29.570
<v Speaker 1>the distro is so that way I can

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:31.765
<v Speaker 1>add it. But it's also impossible to add

00:11:31.765 --> 00:11:34.565
<v Speaker 1>every possible distro in existence there. But for

00:11:34.565 --> 00:11:36.565
<v Speaker 1>the most part, we can support any Linux.

00:11:36.725 --> 00:11:37.445
<v Speaker 1>And then

00:11:37.685 --> 00:11:38.645
<v Speaker 1>BSD,

00:11:40.805 --> 00:11:43.525
<v Speaker 1>but not all BSDs right now. The main

00:11:43.525 --> 00:11:45.925
<v Speaker 1>ones are free BSD and net BSD.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.800
<v Speaker 1>I think in theory, most everything should work

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.040
<v Speaker 1>except for maybe the package install on Dragonfly

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.200
<v Speaker 1>BSD, and that's just because free BSD and

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.640
<v Speaker 1>Dragonfly BSD,

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.680
<v Speaker 1>while they are two distinct projects, still share

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.120
<v Speaker 1>a lot of a lot of

00:11:59.925 --> 00:12:00.885
<v Speaker 1>similarity.

00:12:01.445 --> 00:12:02.325
<v Speaker 1>OpenBSD

00:12:02.325 --> 00:12:06.165
<v Speaker 1>has kinda been the painful redheaded stepchild, unfortunately.

00:12:06.165 --> 00:12:07.925
<v Speaker 1>Like, it's a platform I would love to

00:12:07.925 --> 00:12:10.485
<v Speaker 1>support, but there are some hurdles that have

00:12:10.485 --> 00:12:12.405
<v Speaker 1>to be overcome and not just by me

00:12:12.405 --> 00:12:13.605
<v Speaker 1>to fully

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:15.870
<v Speaker 1>confidently support OpenBSD.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.230
<v Speaker 1>We technically could today.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:20.270
<v Speaker 1>The reason I don't is because and why

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:21.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't do anything specifically

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:24.510
<v Speaker 1>is because the Rust tool chain tends to

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.910
<v Speaker 1>fall behind often in OpenBSD.

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:29.075
<v Speaker 1>Last time I looked, there's one poor soul

00:12:29.075 --> 00:12:31.315
<v Speaker 1>who's maintaining that for OpenBSD,

00:12:31.394 --> 00:12:32.995
<v Speaker 1>and, it's

00:12:32.995 --> 00:12:34.915
<v Speaker 1>kinda like a constant game of catch up

00:12:34.915 --> 00:12:35.555
<v Speaker 0>for them.

00:12:36.355 --> 00:12:37.075
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:12:37.714 --> 00:12:39.235
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I think there's still

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.260
<v Speaker 0>pretty wide support right off the bat. And

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.900
<v Speaker 0>and the Linux thing is obviously tricky because

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:45.780
<v Speaker 0>you don't wanna

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:49.300
<v Speaker 0>have to write Rust code to support a

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.540
<v Speaker 0>new package manager. And then maybe this is

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:52.820
<v Speaker 0>something we could talk about at the end,

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.085
<v Speaker 0>but, you know, just thinking about that for

00:12:54.085 --> 00:12:55.845
<v Speaker 0>all four seconds there. Like, there's no reason

00:12:55.845 --> 00:12:56.965
<v Speaker 0>Comtrya.YAML

00:12:56.965 --> 00:12:59.045
<v Speaker 0>is a config fail. It couldn't support specifying

00:12:59.045 --> 00:13:01.445
<v Speaker 0>custom installers because all you need is a

00:13:01.445 --> 00:13:03.365
<v Speaker 0>command with some arguments for each of the

00:13:03.365 --> 00:13:04.725
<v Speaker 0>different verbs. So

00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:07.525
<v Speaker 0>maybe we're maybe it just gonna turn into

00:13:07.605 --> 00:13:09.340
<v Speaker 0>let's let's fail a pull request and that's

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:10.860
<v Speaker 0>some cool functionality. But

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.260
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Yeah. We could we could we could

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.860
<v Speaker 0>make that easier for people that wanna experiment

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.540
<v Speaker 0>with different test tools that don't have hard

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:17.980
<v Speaker 0>coded support. Definitely.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:19.900
<v Speaker 1>And I guess one thing to add with

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.900
<v Speaker 1>platform support, that's probably one of the more

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.635
<v Speaker 1>difficult aspects of the project. I do get

00:13:24.635 --> 00:13:26.635
<v Speaker 1>people who hit me up on Discord and

00:13:26.635 --> 00:13:29.195
<v Speaker 1>issues where they're like, hey. I wanna do

00:13:29.195 --> 00:13:31.675
<v Speaker 1>this really cool thing. And then the battle

00:13:31.675 --> 00:13:32.635
<v Speaker 1>is always,

00:13:32.875 --> 00:13:35.435
<v Speaker 1>how can I implement a feature that doesn't

00:13:35.435 --> 00:13:36.155
<v Speaker 1>either

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:40.050
<v Speaker 1>break something on another operating system or

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:43.410
<v Speaker 1>cause massive issues? Really, the biggest one here

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:45.810
<v Speaker 1>being Windows because, you know, a

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:48.050
<v Speaker 1>lot of things, especially since we do kinda

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:50.795
<v Speaker 1>shell out, work roughly the same between macOS,

00:13:50.795 --> 00:13:53.355
<v Speaker 1>BSD, and Linux. Windows is kind of the

00:13:53.675 --> 00:13:56.154
<v Speaker 1>different one here where it's not everything is

00:13:56.154 --> 00:13:57.915
<v Speaker 1>one to one. For instance, like, a privilege

00:13:57.915 --> 00:14:01.035
<v Speaker 1>escalation works totally different on the Unix c

00:14:01.035 --> 00:14:03.035
<v Speaker 1>platforms. We can just sudo

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.160
<v Speaker 1>DoS run zero, but Windows

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.520
<v Speaker 1>apparently, we'll have sudo at some point. Last

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:10.680
<v Speaker 1>I heard that they're implementing their own sudo

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:14.360
<v Speaker 1>and Windows preview at some point, so maybe

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.800
<v Speaker 1>that'll line up. But

00:14:17.035 --> 00:14:19.195
<v Speaker 1>as far as I know, for most Windows

00:14:19.195 --> 00:14:22.635
<v Speaker 1>systems, they don't have something that's equivalent.

00:14:23.435 --> 00:14:25.035
<v Speaker 0>Hell, I mean, if they roll out schedule

00:14:25.035 --> 00:14:27.515
<v Speaker 0>support, you're looking at a future

00:14:27.515 --> 00:14:30.220
<v Speaker 0>where you could run a Comtrya apply

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.020
<v Speaker 0>and not only provision the Windows host, but

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.780
<v Speaker 0>multiple WSL

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.940
<v Speaker 0>virtual machines at the same time with one

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.220
<v Speaker 0>set of manifests.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.780
<v Speaker 0>And, you know, the variant support and manifests

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.140
<v Speaker 0>as we're gonna get to soon, I I

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.060
<v Speaker 0>think is one of the superpowers of Comtrya

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.135
<v Speaker 0>and one that I've definitely very poorly documented

00:14:47.135 --> 00:14:49.615
<v Speaker 0>early doors, and it's getting better, but I

00:14:49.615 --> 00:14:51.855
<v Speaker 0>don't even think we've tapped into

00:14:52.495 --> 00:14:54.975
<v Speaker 0>what that enables enough.

00:14:54.975 --> 00:14:56.575
<v Speaker 0>I think there's more to be done there.

00:14:56.575 --> 00:14:56.815
<v Speaker 0>However,

00:14:57.639 --> 00:14:59.560
<v Speaker 0>we have been talking now for the best

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.800
<v Speaker 0>part of fifteen minutes, and we haven't shown

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.480
<v Speaker 0>any code. And we've only said Rust once

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.320
<v Speaker 0>or twice. So Yeah. Maybe we should

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:06.920
<v Speaker 1>Before

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:07.480
<v Speaker 1>we

00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:10.279
<v Speaker 1>jump in, do we wanna just kinda show

00:15:10.279 --> 00:15:11.079
<v Speaker 1>up the documentation?

00:15:12.615 --> 00:15:14.295
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. We should. Yeah. Definitely.

00:15:14.455 --> 00:15:15.895
<v Speaker 1>K. Alright.

00:15:17.575 --> 00:15:20.375
<v Speaker 0>Let me pull up the screen share.

00:15:23.495 --> 00:15:25.900
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Your screen is up. We see the

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.660
<v Speaker 0>Comtrya man. Oh, we haven't spoke about the

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:28.140
<v Speaker 0>name.

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:31.900
<v Speaker 0>So it's a it's a total Stargate SG

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.900
<v Speaker 0>one reference. Right? Like, I don't know if

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.140
<v Speaker 0>everybody has seen this episode, but it's one

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.060
<v Speaker 0>of my favorites. And I believe this man

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.595
<v Speaker 0>is called Hanlon. Yeah. Hanlon. And he says

00:15:40.595 --> 00:15:42.995
<v Speaker 0>Comtrya, which is like their their greeting and

00:15:42.995 --> 00:15:44.115
<v Speaker 0>their welcome. So

00:15:45.875 --> 00:15:47.475
<v Speaker 0>yeah. Always makes me smile to see his

00:15:47.475 --> 00:15:48.755
<v Speaker 0>face in the bee mooch.

00:15:50.355 --> 00:15:52.515
<v Speaker 1>And it also gives the project a nice

00:15:52.515 --> 00:15:54.435
<v Speaker 1>name, I think, little bit unique too.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Don't think you said too. You Google it,

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.230
<v Speaker 0>and all you find is Stargate or

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:02.190
<v Speaker 0>or a little Rust project. So Yeah.

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:05.230
<v Speaker 1>Kinda wanna show the documentation first just in

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:07.630
<v Speaker 1>case anybody wanna follow along. And

00:16:08.405 --> 00:16:11.685
<v Speaker 1>as David had said, improvements to the documentation.

00:16:12.325 --> 00:16:14.085
<v Speaker 1>This has been rather recent in the last

00:16:14.085 --> 00:16:17.205
<v Speaker 1>year is moving it over to using MDBook,

00:16:17.205 --> 00:16:18.885
<v Speaker 1>so adding more Rust

00:16:19.205 --> 00:16:22.165
<v Speaker 1>tool chain in there. So there's another Rust

00:16:22.165 --> 00:16:22.965
<v Speaker 1>reference for you.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:26.810
<v Speaker 1>There's still some areas where it lacks, and

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:30.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping to correct that over time. But

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.650
<v Speaker 1>as you can see, it's pretty easy to

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:33.530
<v Speaker 1>navigate.

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Got our introduction, a little rundown. I think

00:16:36.945 --> 00:16:39.025
<v Speaker 1>most of this is from the older documentation

00:16:39.025 --> 00:16:40.545
<v Speaker 1>which you had on Gitbook.

00:16:41.665 --> 00:16:43.665
<v Speaker 1>We got our supported systems,

00:16:44.705 --> 00:16:47.025
<v Speaker 1>how we're gonna install it, or the different

00:16:47.025 --> 00:16:48.385
<v Speaker 1>ways to install it,

00:16:49.185 --> 00:16:50.625
<v Speaker 1>a little bit about CLI,

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:55.110
<v Speaker 1>the different commands that CLI has to offer,

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:57.910
<v Speaker 1>but the real meat of this documentation is

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:00.790
<v Speaker 1>here underneath the manifest and the actions.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:03.270
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:17:04.355 --> 00:17:06.115
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I like this format much better than

00:17:06.115 --> 00:17:07.715
<v Speaker 0>the the GetBook stuff. I mean, the GetBook

00:17:07.715 --> 00:17:09.635
<v Speaker 0>was great, and, you know, they support open

00:17:09.635 --> 00:17:11.955
<v Speaker 0>source by providing their platform for free. But

00:17:11.955 --> 00:17:14.355
<v Speaker 0>I think the entire deployment pipeline you put

00:17:14.355 --> 00:17:18.195
<v Speaker 0>together for this is is flick and quite

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:19.409
<v Speaker 0>quite nice to navigate. Yeah.

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:21.329
<v Speaker 1>That's that's kinda why I like going with

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:23.730
<v Speaker 1>this option. So now the documentation is kept

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:25.889
<v Speaker 1>in repo alongside the code.

00:17:28.049 --> 00:17:29.650
<v Speaker 1>I guess one complaint you could have is

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:31.725
<v Speaker 1>that every single time a pull request happens,

00:17:31.725 --> 00:17:34.045
<v Speaker 1>even if the documentation doesn't change, technically, they

00:17:34.045 --> 00:17:35.965
<v Speaker 1>get pipeline publishes a new version of the

00:17:35.965 --> 00:17:36.925
<v Speaker 1>documentation.

00:17:37.645 --> 00:17:39.725
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Maybe it's a little publishing when it

00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:41.245
<v Speaker 1>doesn't need to. But the

00:17:41.885 --> 00:17:44.020
<v Speaker 1>bottom line is it's, if somebody were to

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:45.940
<v Speaker 1>do a feature, they could have the code

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.780
<v Speaker 1>for the feature and the code for the

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.860
<v Speaker 1>documentation all in the same pull request. And

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.700
<v Speaker 1>once it gets pulled in, it's spam. It's

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.540
<v Speaker 1>on the main branch of Comtrya, and the

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.299
<v Speaker 1>documentation is live immediately.

00:17:56.345 --> 00:17:58.345
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I think that one or repo approach.

00:17:58.345 --> 00:18:00.665
<v Speaker 0>I mean, it's the secret sauce for these

00:18:00.665 --> 00:18:03.065
<v Speaker 0>projects because the problem we had with my

00:18:03.065 --> 00:18:05.625
<v Speaker 0>setup was people were sending really awesome pull

00:18:05.625 --> 00:18:08.025
<v Speaker 0>requests, but the documentation was a different repository.

00:18:08.025 --> 00:18:09.785
<v Speaker 0>It never got updated out of this month,

00:18:09.785 --> 00:18:11.385
<v Speaker 0>if not longer behind.

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:14.850
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm. Yeah. This is cool. I like this.

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:17.730
<v Speaker 0>So Stefan

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:19.169
<v Speaker 0>is already in the chat,

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:22.129
<v Speaker 0>sticking me on it. So

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:25.809
<v Speaker 0>Stefan is correct. There there was an example

00:18:25.809 --> 00:18:26.450
<v Speaker 0>written

00:18:26.765 --> 00:18:28.285
<v Speaker 0>by me, unfortunately,

00:18:30.045 --> 00:18:32.445
<v Speaker 0>that every time you ran the tests or

00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:34.525
<v Speaker 0>you ran against the examples directory, it would

00:18:34.525 --> 00:18:35.645
<v Speaker 0>reboot your machine.

00:18:36.045 --> 00:18:39.165
<v Speaker 0>And we thought this was a bug until

00:18:39.165 --> 00:18:41.725
<v Speaker 0>we looked in the examples and realized that

00:18:41.725 --> 00:18:45.300
<v Speaker 0>dumbass here had a special command run system

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.220
<v Speaker 0>control reboot at a

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Underneath I've never done that again.

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So so I guess some background. So

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:55.140
<v Speaker 1>it it was me coming into the Discord

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:58.020
<v Speaker 1>chat kinda like, guys, guys, I think we

00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:59.274
<v Speaker 1>have a major problem.

00:18:59.675 --> 00:19:02.235
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sitting here, and I'm like, okay.

00:19:03.195 --> 00:19:04.875
<v Speaker 1>Because I didn't look at all the examples.

00:19:04.875 --> 00:19:06.395
<v Speaker 1>I'm just running them and testing them for

00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:08.475
<v Speaker 1>whatever I was doing at the time. And

00:19:08.475 --> 00:19:10.475
<v Speaker 1>then I started going like, okay. I'm gonna

00:19:10.475 --> 00:19:11.915
<v Speaker 1>need to debug the kernel on this.

00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:14.160
<v Speaker 1>So I'm sitting here doing all this, and

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.920
<v Speaker 1>then, yes, Stefan comes up, and he's like,

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.480
<v Speaker 1>it's probably because of one of our examples.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.160
<v Speaker 1>We have a where clause where if you're

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.920
<v Speaker 1>on Linux, we just reboot the machine.

00:19:26.054 --> 00:19:28.934
<v Speaker 0>Not not the my famous moment, but oh,

00:19:28.934 --> 00:19:29.494
<v Speaker 0>well.

00:19:29.895 --> 00:19:31.495
<v Speaker 0>Clearly, I've just been like, okay. What could

00:19:31.495 --> 00:19:33.255
<v Speaker 0>a a good work clause be that's Linux

00:19:33.255 --> 00:19:35.015
<v Speaker 0>specific? And I've just been, oh, yeah. System

00:19:35.015 --> 00:19:35.735
<v Speaker 0>deep. And

00:19:36.615 --> 00:19:37.654
<v Speaker 0>yeah. One idea.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. For, for anyone,

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:41.980
<v Speaker 1>I guess a little bit of information about

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.220
<v Speaker 1>that word clause and to give some information

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.940
<v Speaker 1>about it. Here in the Comtrya documentation, you

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:48.299
<v Speaker 1>see an example of it where we can

00:19:48.299 --> 00:19:50.635
<v Speaker 1>have variants of a command. So we can

00:19:50.635 --> 00:19:53.275
<v Speaker 1>kinda change the behavior of a certain action

00:19:53.275 --> 00:19:55.355
<v Speaker 1>depending on, like, the operating system. And I

00:19:55.355 --> 00:19:57.275
<v Speaker 1>think there's some other parameters, but probably the

00:19:57.275 --> 00:19:59.195
<v Speaker 1>one that I've seen most commonly in other

00:19:59.195 --> 00:20:02.315
<v Speaker 1>people's manifest is like, oh, if on Linux,

00:20:02.315 --> 00:20:03.910
<v Speaker 1>do this. If on Oh, the repo is

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:04.630
<v Speaker 0>still there.

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:07.990
<v Speaker 1>In the example, but I believe I did

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:10.789
<v Speaker 1>actually it's just a copy and paste.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:12.710
<v Speaker 1>Let's

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:13.190
<v Speaker 1>see.

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:14.470
<v Speaker 1>Go back.

00:20:16.075 --> 00:20:17.675
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm pretty sure I changed that out.

00:20:17.675 --> 00:20:19.275
<v Speaker 1>I hope I did. Yeah. It was in

00:20:19.275 --> 00:20:19.755
<v Speaker 1>here.

00:20:20.315 --> 00:20:21.835
<v Speaker 1>I think I just changed it to a

00:20:21.915 --> 00:20:24.955
<v Speaker 1>no? It's under variance, I think. Only variance.

00:20:25.035 --> 00:20:26.235
<v Speaker 1>Only variance.

00:20:26.875 --> 00:20:28.315
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And I changed it just to do

00:20:28.315 --> 00:20:29.115
<v Speaker 1>an echo.

00:20:29.515 --> 00:20:31.729
<v Speaker 1>Just like the other ones. For some reason,

00:20:31.809 --> 00:20:33.169
<v Speaker 1>we had echo for

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:36.049
<v Speaker 1>Mac OS. But Yeah. Last came out two

00:20:36.049 --> 00:20:36.929
<v Speaker 0>years ago.

00:20:37.169 --> 00:20:38.610
<v Speaker 0>Not because I I can't even believe it

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:40.209
<v Speaker 0>was that long ago, but there you go.

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:42.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. There it is. Changed the example for

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.289
<v Speaker 1>Linux so not to cause the system reboot.

00:20:46.785 --> 00:20:48.065
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Shit happens.

00:20:49.905 --> 00:20:50.865
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.

00:20:51.105 --> 00:20:54.065
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Should we focus on the installation process

00:20:54.065 --> 00:20:56.545
<v Speaker 0>first? How can people get Comtrya on the

00:20:56.545 --> 00:20:57.345
<v Speaker 0>command line?

00:20:57.665 --> 00:21:01.665
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So we will actually pop back up

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:01.129
<v Speaker 1>to

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:02.970
<v Speaker 1>this. I already have it installed in my

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:03.690
<v Speaker 1>VM, but

00:21:05.529 --> 00:21:07.289
<v Speaker 1>and I did it through the

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:09.850
<v Speaker 1>curl way. So we have a couple of

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:12.169
<v Speaker 1>different ways. One, you could get the Rust

00:21:12.169 --> 00:21:13.850
<v Speaker 1>tool chain, and you can cargo install it

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:15.370
<v Speaker 1>because it is on Crates.io,

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:17.435
<v Speaker 1>and you can get it that way. And

00:21:17.435 --> 00:21:19.355
<v Speaker 1>that'll also give you the main branch.

00:21:19.835 --> 00:21:21.995
<v Speaker 1>We do have a shell script,

00:21:23.195 --> 00:21:25.515
<v Speaker 1>hosted at git.comtrya.dev

00:21:25.515 --> 00:21:27.275
<v Speaker 1>that you can just pipe in the shell.

00:21:28.075 --> 00:21:29.675
<v Speaker 1>With it, you can also pin a version

00:21:29.675 --> 00:21:32.080
<v Speaker 1>number, so can give an exact version number

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.679
<v Speaker 1>if you need an older version.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.720
<v Speaker 1>We also have the precompiled binaries underneath our

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.360
<v Speaker 1>releases section on GitHub. You can pull it

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:41.679
<v Speaker 1>from there.

00:21:42.945 --> 00:21:44.945
<v Speaker 1>And then we do have it available in

00:21:44.945 --> 00:21:46.464
<v Speaker 1>some package managers.

00:21:47.424 --> 00:21:49.664
<v Speaker 1>Stefan has been kind enough

00:21:50.065 --> 00:21:53.744
<v Speaker 1>to package it for the AUR on Arch

00:21:53.904 --> 00:21:55.024
<v Speaker 1>for a long time.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Michael Green, the guy I mentioned earlier who

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:02.820
<v Speaker 1>initially introduced me to Comtrya packages it for

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.059
<v Speaker 1>RavenPorch, which is a smaller

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:08.100
<v Speaker 1>porch tree kinda style package management system that's

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.140
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be cross platform.

00:22:10.995 --> 00:22:11.794
<v Speaker 1>And then

00:22:12.035 --> 00:22:14.115
<v Speaker 1>here recently over the last few months, I

00:22:14.115 --> 00:22:15.475
<v Speaker 1>added it to Homebrew.

00:22:17.715 --> 00:22:18.514
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:22:19.235 --> 00:22:21.155
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I think that Homebrew approach for Mac

00:22:21.155 --> 00:22:23.955
<v Speaker 0>people just makes it very, very simple.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.779
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Shall we write our first manifest?

00:22:31.059 --> 00:22:33.299
<v Speaker 1>Sure. May I just make a

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:36.019
<v Speaker 1>directory and call it configuration?

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:39.700
<v Speaker 0>Because there's reason you chose Debian, or is

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.860
<v Speaker 0>that just because you feel that, you know,

00:22:42.135 --> 00:22:43.975
<v Speaker 0>Tammy, you're back with us at this point?

00:22:44.855 --> 00:22:45.815
<v Speaker 1>Debian

00:22:45.815 --> 00:22:48.375
<v Speaker 1>has always kinda been I kinda consider my

00:22:48.375 --> 00:22:51.255
<v Speaker 1>home distro. Like, I distro hopped a lot,

00:22:51.255 --> 00:22:53.495
<v Speaker 1>but Debian is kinda always where I return

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:56.730
<v Speaker 1>especially as an adult because things are just

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:58.330
<v Speaker 1>nice and stable there and,

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:01.450
<v Speaker 1>rock solid. Know what's stable?

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:04.730
<v Speaker 0>I'm a bleeding edge. Yeah.

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:07.370
<v Speaker 1>It's also what I've been, using at work

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:09.745
<v Speaker 1>whenever I deploy servers. Well, at first, I

00:23:09.745 --> 00:23:11.905
<v Speaker 1>tried Ubuntu, and then I realized why I

00:23:11.905 --> 00:23:13.825
<v Speaker 1>don't deploy servers on Ubuntu.

00:23:14.065 --> 00:23:14.784
<v Speaker 1>And

00:23:16.145 --> 00:23:16.705
<v Speaker 1>then

00:23:17.985 --> 00:23:19.505
<v Speaker 1>so then I just went with Debian,

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.320
<v Speaker 1>and that's where I've mostly been using Comtrya

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.960
<v Speaker 1>is on Debian servers at work right now.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:27.480
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.640
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:30.279
<v Speaker 1>So

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.400
<v Speaker 1>what kind of saw? What kind of man

00:23:35.559 --> 00:23:36.679
<v Speaker 0>Why don't we start

00:23:36.955 --> 00:23:38.795
<v Speaker 0>with just basic you know,

00:23:40.475 --> 00:23:41.835
<v Speaker 0>I'm trying not to come out with too

00:23:41.835 --> 00:23:43.995
<v Speaker 0>much bias because I know what Comtrya can

00:23:43.995 --> 00:23:46.715
<v Speaker 0>do. But let's start with a command execution.

00:23:46.715 --> 00:23:48.635
<v Speaker 0>Let's assume people just wanted, like, a YAML

00:23:48.635 --> 00:23:50.395
<v Speaker 0>interface to some sort of bash script, which

00:23:50.395 --> 00:23:52.549
<v Speaker 0>I would never encourage anyone to do. But

00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:54.149
<v Speaker 0>command execution is

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:56.390
<v Speaker 0>probably one of the quicker and easiest ways

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:58.470
<v Speaker 0>to start doing stuff with Comtrya.

00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:59.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:01.509
<v Speaker 1>Just,

00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:02.630
<v Speaker 1>like, oh.

00:24:05.975 --> 00:24:06.854
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah.

00:24:07.975 --> 00:24:09.815
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I always forget that

00:24:10.375 --> 00:24:13.815
<v Speaker 1>even after, what, fifteen years of using Linux.

00:24:18.695 --> 00:24:19.654
<v Speaker 1>Let's call it main.

00:24:20.789 --> 00:24:22.149
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:25.750
<v Speaker 0>So this is what we call a manifest.

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:29.029
<v Speaker 0>Right? Yep. This is a a manifest,

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:30.870
<v Speaker 1>a YAML file, or it can be a

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:31.590
<v Speaker 1>TOML file.

00:24:32.434 --> 00:24:35.235
<v Speaker 1>And then just kinda follow the example here.

00:24:35.235 --> 00:24:36.355
<v Speaker 1>So every manifest

00:24:37.075 --> 00:24:39.955
<v Speaker 1>the basic manifest are is essentially just a

00:24:39.955 --> 00:24:41.634
<v Speaker 1>collection of actions.

00:24:42.115 --> 00:24:43.955
<v Speaker 1>So we prefix it at the top with

00:24:43.955 --> 00:24:46.380
<v Speaker 1>actions, and then we define each action within

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:47.020
<v Speaker 1>that.

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.540
<v Speaker 1>So we'll just start off with a simple

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:53.980
<v Speaker 1>command dot run

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.260
<v Speaker 1>and make sure I have the documentation up.

00:24:58.024 --> 00:25:00.184
<v Speaker 1>Because I usually always make sure I have

00:25:00.184 --> 00:25:02.904
<v Speaker 1>it up so I don't mess something up.

00:25:03.784 --> 00:25:05.464
<v Speaker 1>Just do a simple echo.

00:25:06.664 --> 00:25:07.945
<v Speaker 1>Do that part.

00:25:11.225 --> 00:25:11.865
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:13.249
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:25:13.409 --> 00:25:14.369
<v Speaker 1>And as

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:16.690
<v Speaker 1>David said, I mean, to me, I kinda

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:18.610
<v Speaker 1>consider the command dot run as, a catch

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:21.649
<v Speaker 1>all. If there's anything that Comtrya doesn't have

00:25:21.649 --> 00:25:23.809
<v Speaker 1>an action that it directly supports, there's usually

00:25:23.809 --> 00:25:25.409
<v Speaker 1>always a way to get it done with

00:25:25.409 --> 00:25:27.730
<v Speaker 1>the with the command dot run-in some fashion.

00:25:31.235 --> 00:25:33.635
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's especially with the variance syntax. Like,

00:25:33.635 --> 00:25:35.315
<v Speaker 0>if you need to run something differently across

00:25:35.315 --> 00:25:38.435
<v Speaker 0>Linux, BSD, Mac, Windows, whatever, it's easiest to

00:25:38.435 --> 00:25:39.795
<v Speaker 0>do that as a single action

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:42.630
<v Speaker 0>rather than, you know, the thing I really

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:44.390
<v Speaker 0>hated and tried to avoid as much as

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:47.350
<v Speaker 0>possible was crazy ginger templating within, say, Jamo

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:49.750
<v Speaker 0>because I think things just get messy and

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:51.029
<v Speaker 0>hacky pretty quick.

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Mhmm.

00:25:54.245 --> 00:25:55.765
<v Speaker 0>But, of course, you can do change of

00:25:55.765 --> 00:25:56.804
<v Speaker 0>template, but

00:25:58.645 --> 00:26:00.325
<v Speaker 0>there's always the escape patch.

00:26:00.725 --> 00:26:01.125
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So down here, I'm gonna run it,

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:12.170
<v Speaker 1>essentially, just invoking the I can try a

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.330
<v Speaker 1>binary. The dash d flag gives it the

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:16.650
<v Speaker 1>directories. We're just saying the current working directory

00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:17.530
<v Speaker 1>wherein is

00:26:18.775 --> 00:26:21.335
<v Speaker 1>essentially the root for our manifest and then

00:26:21.335 --> 00:26:22.134
<v Speaker 1>apply.

00:26:22.375 --> 00:26:25.335
<v Speaker 1>And then Comtrya also allows the ability to

00:26:25.575 --> 00:26:27.175
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to run all your manifests.

00:26:27.175 --> 00:26:29.654
<v Speaker 1>You can selectively run them by giving this

00:26:29.815 --> 00:26:30.455
<v Speaker 1>m switch.

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:35.869
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Oh, did not get any output there.

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:38.989
<v Speaker 0>You need to add dash v. Oh, yeah.

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:43.309
<v Speaker 0>More v's.

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:45.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. No? Nope.

00:26:45.795 --> 00:26:47.155
<v Speaker 0>I don't think it's running.

00:26:47.715 --> 00:26:49.555
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. I might wanna make sure.

00:26:51.555 --> 00:26:53.475
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I thought I checked this checked this

00:26:53.475 --> 00:26:54.275
<v Speaker 1>yesterday.

00:26:55.395 --> 00:26:56.355
<v Speaker 1>Uh-oh.

00:26:56.755 --> 00:26:57.475
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:26:58.995 --> 00:27:00.275
<v Speaker 1>If not, I guess I could do this

00:27:00.275 --> 00:27:01.155
<v Speaker 1>on my Mac too.

00:27:02.159 --> 00:27:04.879
<v Speaker 0>But what happens if you type type Comtrya?

00:27:04.879 --> 00:27:06.559
<v Speaker 0>What does it think it is or which

00:27:06.559 --> 00:27:08.479
<v Speaker 0>Comtrya? Do we have do we have anything?

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:09.919
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:13.120
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. It does. And let's I mean,

00:27:13.705 --> 00:27:15.545
<v Speaker 0>run type space before

00:27:15.545 --> 00:27:16.985
<v Speaker 0>we cat it just to be sure it's

00:27:16.985 --> 00:27:17.945
<v Speaker 0>a text file.

00:27:20.025 --> 00:27:21.865
<v Speaker 1>Try as hashed.

00:27:23.545 --> 00:27:24.025
<v Speaker 0>Vimit?

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:28.190
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:33.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Well, I primarily use Emacs,

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:36.030
<v Speaker 1>but Woah. Woah. Nano is just available. Oh,

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:37.950
<v Speaker 1>yeah. There we go. Yeah. That that's a

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:38.510
<v Speaker 0>problem.

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:40.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That is a problem. Now we get

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:41.870
<v Speaker 0>to show the installation.

00:27:42.615 --> 00:27:43.255
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:27:43.415 --> 00:27:45.175
<v Speaker 0>Well, you quickly grab that command. I'll say

00:27:45.175 --> 00:27:47.735
<v Speaker 0>happy New Year to Nuno as well. Hey.

00:27:47.735 --> 00:27:49.095
<v Speaker 0>Nice to see you again.

00:27:50.135 --> 00:27:51.975
<v Speaker 1>Let's see. It may we may have an

00:27:51.975 --> 00:27:53.495
<v Speaker 1>issue with the installation script,

00:27:55.289 --> 00:27:56.890
<v Speaker 1>At least on ARM,

00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:59.049
<v Speaker 1>I will say this is Is that an

00:27:59.049 --> 00:28:00.809
<v Speaker 0>ARM's what happens if you type your name

00:28:00.809 --> 00:28:02.969
<v Speaker 0>dash a? Is it AMD with

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:05.129
<v Speaker 0>or ARM?

00:28:05.289 --> 00:28:06.489
<v Speaker 0>It's dash a.

00:28:07.289 --> 00:28:09.755
<v Speaker 0>It's ARM 64. Four. Yeah. So it should

00:28:09.755 --> 00:28:10.075
<v Speaker 1>I create

00:28:12.715 --> 00:28:14.635
<v Speaker 1>Pop this over so I can read it

00:28:14.635 --> 00:28:15.755
<v Speaker 1>and type at the same time.

00:28:29.159 --> 00:28:30.679
<v Speaker 1>Version.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.120
<v Speaker 0>And you've put dev instead of dev. Oh,

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:36.440
<v Speaker 0>yeah.

00:28:37.435 --> 00:28:39.275
<v Speaker 0>That's because you're debbing mad.

00:28:42.795 --> 00:28:44.235
<v Speaker 0>Pipe it through bash.

00:28:44.715 --> 00:28:46.635
<v Speaker 0>That's that's the bash test condition.

00:28:47.035 --> 00:28:47.835
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:28:48.795 --> 00:28:51.195
<v Speaker 0>Maybe there's a docs error there. Yeah. There

00:28:51.195 --> 00:28:51.515
<v Speaker 0>we go.

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:55.540
<v Speaker 0>And it grabbed the ARM 64 version. So,

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.620
<v Speaker 0>I mean, that works fine. It's just the

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.380
<v Speaker 0>sweet. There we go. There

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:03.540
<v Speaker 1>we go. Alright.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:05.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I'm also hoping we don't have any

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:06.180
<v Speaker 1>issues with,

00:29:08.715 --> 00:29:10.475
<v Speaker 1>what was it, ganulib c

00:29:10.715 --> 00:29:13.755
<v Speaker 1>that has been a rather recent issue that,

00:29:13.755 --> 00:29:14.715
<v Speaker 1>at least on

00:29:15.035 --> 00:29:17.435
<v Speaker 1>AMD sixty four, has kinda gotten solved.

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:25.690
<v Speaker 1>There we go.

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:28.970
<v Speaker 0>It's running Alright. Let's Comtrya. I'll see you

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:30.010
<v Speaker 0>all later. I'm going home.

00:29:32.615 --> 00:29:34.615
<v Speaker 0>Do you wanna pump a dash v onto

00:29:34.615 --> 00:29:36.055
<v Speaker 0>that just so we can see the actual

00:29:36.055 --> 00:29:38.375
<v Speaker 0>echo statement as well? So Comtrya tries to

00:29:38.375 --> 00:29:39.015
<v Speaker 0>hide

00:29:39.335 --> 00:29:41.015
<v Speaker 0>output, but it doesn't need to show you

00:29:41.015 --> 00:29:41.575
<v Speaker 0>it.

00:29:42.295 --> 00:29:43.975
<v Speaker 0>But you can enable

00:29:44.215 --> 00:29:45.495
<v Speaker 0>deeper verbosity

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:47.100
<v Speaker 0>as you can see there.

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:49.260
<v Speaker 0>Yep. So as we can see, we have

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:51.180
<v Speaker 1>a to standard out, we have hello just

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:52.940
<v Speaker 1>as defined in our manifest.

00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:56.140
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:57.179
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:59.900
<v Speaker 0>Let's push our luck. Let's install

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:00.700
<v Speaker 0>NeoVim.

00:30:01.415 --> 00:30:02.294
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:30:03.735 --> 00:30:04.855
<v Speaker 0>Let's just

00:30:05.255 --> 00:30:06.934
<v Speaker 0>I I I just pecked NeoVim because you

00:30:06.934 --> 00:30:08.294
<v Speaker 0>said you like Emacs, and I feel like

00:30:08.294 --> 00:30:09.815
<v Speaker 0>I have to make you do the devil's

00:30:09.815 --> 00:30:10.374
<v Speaker 0>work.

00:30:11.975 --> 00:30:13.494
<v Speaker 1>Let's keep it here.

00:30:14.215 --> 00:30:14.934
<v Speaker 1>Action

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:18.149
<v Speaker 1>package dot install

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:19.429
<v Speaker 1>and

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:23.190
<v Speaker 1>make sure it's the only thing about YAML.

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:24.870
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of times also mess up

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:25.430
<v Speaker 1>the spacing.

00:30:29.205 --> 00:30:29.845
<v Speaker 1>What?

00:30:30.245 --> 00:30:32.004
<v Speaker 1>What's the package name?

00:30:32.725 --> 00:30:36.485
<v Speaker 1>NeoVent.

00:30:36.485 --> 00:30:38.004
<v Speaker 1>Oh, double check that

00:30:38.965 --> 00:30:41.285
<v Speaker 1>because I never installed it. Just NeoVent.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.039
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:54.799
<v Speaker 0>Can

00:30:55.679 --> 00:30:56.480
<v Speaker 0>you just run

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:57.919
<v Speaker 1>Uh-oh.

00:30:58.475 --> 00:30:59.995
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's your indentation.

00:31:00.235 --> 00:31:01.115
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah.

00:31:01.595 --> 00:31:03.595
<v Speaker 0>Can you try and run nVim just so

00:31:03.595 --> 00:31:05.195
<v Speaker 0>we know it's not on the machine first

00:31:05.195 --> 00:31:06.075
<v Speaker 0>as well?

00:31:06.635 --> 00:31:07.275
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:31:07.675 --> 00:31:10.235
<v Speaker 0>So your second action needs to be one

00:31:10.235 --> 00:31:11.434
<v Speaker 0>space less.

00:31:12.475 --> 00:31:13.755
<v Speaker 0>I think that's

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:16.370
<v Speaker 0>three in.

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:19.010
<v Speaker 0>No. Up two lanes?

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:21.410
<v Speaker 0>I think there's three spaces at the start.

00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:21.970
<v Speaker 0>Right?

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:25.730
<v Speaker 1>I believe so. One, two, three. Or is

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:28.275
<v Speaker 1>it two? There's two, but two lanes up.

00:31:28.275 --> 00:31:30.115
<v Speaker 0>The package install lane, I think, is three

00:31:30.115 --> 00:31:30.835
<v Speaker 0>spaces

00:31:30.915 --> 00:31:31.955
<v Speaker 0>at the start.

00:31:33.395 --> 00:31:34.595
<v Speaker 0>Three spaces.

00:31:34.674 --> 00:31:37.315
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. At the start of that lane. Oh,

00:31:37.875 --> 00:31:40.880
<v Speaker 0>here? Yeah. We'll go back one. Yeah. There

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.880
<v Speaker 0>we go. Okay. And then fix list and

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.479
<v Speaker 0>then fix the yeah.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.039
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. No YAML mode here to help me.

00:31:49.679 --> 00:31:52.159
<v Speaker 0>But your NeoVem is still one, two, two

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:52.720
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah.

00:31:54.215 --> 00:31:55.815
<v Speaker 0>If you were just in Venn, this wouldn't

00:31:55.815 --> 00:31:56.695
<v Speaker 0>be an issue.

00:31:57.895 --> 00:32:00.135
<v Speaker 1>Or Emacs because I we just have YAML

00:32:00.135 --> 00:32:00.455
<v Speaker 1>mode.

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:06.340
<v Speaker 1>Sweet.

00:32:07.059 --> 00:32:09.220
<v Speaker 1>Yep. And that'll take a minute. I do

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:10.179
<v Speaker 1>kinda wanna

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:12.340
<v Speaker 1>eventually solve that. This seems to always be

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:14.100
<v Speaker 1>the first time it runs on Debian. It

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:16.340
<v Speaker 1>always does that where it complains about the

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.100
<v Speaker 1>the ad repository. It's like, well, we're not

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:19.620
<v Speaker 1>mean to do anything with ad in a

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:20.260
<v Speaker 1>repository.

00:32:21.005 --> 00:32:23.724
<v Speaker 1>So something I eventually wanna dig down into.

00:32:24.924 --> 00:32:25.404
<v Speaker 1>But

00:32:25.884 --> 00:32:28.044
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I was curious about that too, but

00:32:28.044 --> 00:32:29.804
<v Speaker 0>we do have NeoVim, so that's a pretty

00:32:29.804 --> 00:32:30.524
<v Speaker 0>solid start.

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:36.679
<v Speaker 1>Clear that out.

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:41.799
<v Speaker 1>See what should we play around with.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.160
<v Speaker 0>Well, I think we've got two

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.400
<v Speaker 0>opt I mean, we can go into whatever

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.280
<v Speaker 0>you want, but,

00:32:48.985 --> 00:32:50.985
<v Speaker 0>you know, right now, we have a single

00:32:50.985 --> 00:32:54.265
<v Speaker 0>manifest. Can you list the commands directory? What

00:32:54.265 --> 00:32:55.384
<v Speaker 0>did you put in there?

00:32:56.905 --> 00:32:58.504
<v Speaker 1>Oh, what did I put in there?

00:33:01.784 --> 00:33:05.519
<v Speaker 1>Just main dot YAML and Yeah. You know,

00:33:05.519 --> 00:33:07.519
<v Speaker 0>main dot YAML is a special name in

00:33:07.519 --> 00:33:09.679
<v Speaker 0>Comtrya. It just means you can reference that

00:33:09.679 --> 00:33:12.639
<v Speaker 0>manifest by the parent directory, which is commands

00:33:12.639 --> 00:33:15.039
<v Speaker 0>in this case. So why don't we

00:33:17.065 --> 00:33:19.625
<v Speaker 0>move the NeoVim package installed to its own

00:33:19.625 --> 00:33:21.385
<v Speaker 0>manifest and then show us some sort of

00:33:21.385 --> 00:33:23.225
<v Speaker 0>dependency management as well?

00:33:24.025 --> 00:33:25.545
<v Speaker 1>Will do. So

00:33:27.625 --> 00:33:29.865
<v Speaker 0>let's see. Directory.

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:32.690
<v Speaker 0>Because one of the really cool things about

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:35.169
<v Speaker 0>Comtrya is that under the hood, it's processing

00:33:35.169 --> 00:33:38.529
<v Speaker 0>and parsing all of this YAML or TOML

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:40.209
<v Speaker 0>and and building a

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:41.809
<v Speaker 0>directed graph.

00:33:42.129 --> 00:33:43.490
<v Speaker 0>So you can actually have

00:33:44.215 --> 00:33:47.414
<v Speaker 0>whatever dependency structure you need across multiple manifests,

00:33:47.414 --> 00:33:49.014
<v Speaker 0>and it handles it

00:33:49.255 --> 00:33:50.134
<v Speaker 0>really well.

00:33:55.015 --> 00:33:57.414
<v Speaker 0>Is typing YAML why you added TOML support?

00:34:00.039 --> 00:34:00.679
<v Speaker 1>No.

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:02.919
<v Speaker 1>Somebody had asked for it. I'm

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.240
<v Speaker 1>kinda like you. I'm not too big of

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:06.359
<v Speaker 1>a fan of

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:09.480
<v Speaker 1>TOML, but it was kinda easy enough, and

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.760
<v Speaker 1>somebody had asked for it. And I was

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.285
<v Speaker 1>like, oh, that's that's also what at at

00:34:13.285 --> 00:34:14.965
<v Speaker 1>the time, it was something different

00:34:15.125 --> 00:34:16.725
<v Speaker 1>for me to do. Like, I think at

00:34:16.725 --> 00:34:19.605
<v Speaker 1>that point, most everything I had done was

00:34:19.605 --> 00:34:21.445
<v Speaker 1>just in the actions themselves.

00:34:23.605 --> 00:34:25.765
<v Speaker 1>And I haven't really messed with anything as

00:34:25.765 --> 00:34:27.300
<v Speaker 1>far as, like, how we walk through the

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.140
<v Speaker 1>manifest or any of the other parts of

00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:30.739
<v Speaker 1>Comtrya. I was kind of just in the

00:34:30.739 --> 00:34:31.540
<v Speaker 1>actions.

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:34.260
<v Speaker 1>Hadn't messed with Adams yet, really.

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:36.180
<v Speaker 1>So I was like, well, this will get

00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:37.460
<v Speaker 1>me into a different part of it, and

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:39.060
<v Speaker 1>I can kinda look at it. And

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:41.815
<v Speaker 1>because Surday makes it so easy to support

00:34:41.815 --> 00:34:43.815
<v Speaker 1>multiple different file formats, I was like, it's

00:34:43.815 --> 00:34:45.574
<v Speaker 1>not gonna be hard. Get me into a

00:34:45.574 --> 00:34:47.015
<v Speaker 1>part that I'm not used to.

00:34:49.015 --> 00:34:49.655
<v Speaker 0>So

00:34:50.614 --> 00:34:53.015
<v Speaker 0>That NVM should be NeoVim before you save

00:34:53.015 --> 00:34:53.175
<v Speaker 0>it.

00:34:56.049 --> 00:34:56.849
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:34:56.849 --> 00:34:57.650
<v Speaker 0>Saved.

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:01.089
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So now we've got is that software

00:35:01.089 --> 00:35:02.530
<v Speaker 0>main and commands main?

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:06.290
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Or Okay. I did it as

00:35:09.225 --> 00:35:10.825
<v Speaker 1>as in Okay.

00:35:11.305 --> 00:35:12.745
<v Speaker 1>I can change that if we want. No.

00:35:12.745 --> 00:35:14.345
<v Speaker 0>No. No. I think that that that works

00:35:14.345 --> 00:35:16.185
<v Speaker 0>just fine. So why don't we update commands

00:35:16.185 --> 00:35:18.105
<v Speaker 0>to depend on software?

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:25.750
<v Speaker 0>Remember, if you're watching and you have any

00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:28.630
<v Speaker 0>questions and or you want some examples about

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:30.470
<v Speaker 0>some of the things Comtrya can do, now

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:31.830
<v Speaker 0>would be a good time to throw them

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:33.270
<v Speaker 0>into the chat so that we can,

00:35:34.125 --> 00:35:36.365
<v Speaker 0>you know, hopefully show you something interesting.

00:35:39.485 --> 00:35:40.845
<v Speaker 1>And dependencies.

00:35:40.925 --> 00:35:42.765
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I haven't had to do too much

00:35:42.765 --> 00:35:44.285
<v Speaker 1>with the dependencies yet.

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:49.369
<v Speaker 1>Would it be Software.envim.

00:35:49.369 --> 00:35:51.690
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I mean, I could talk because I

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:53.130
<v Speaker 0>wrote this code, I could talk about how

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:55.290
<v Speaker 0>this works and where the inspiration came from

00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:57.290
<v Speaker 0>as well. Because some people may hate the

00:35:57.290 --> 00:35:59.609
<v Speaker 0>syntax, but it's actually something I stole from

00:35:59.609 --> 00:36:00.410
<v Speaker 0>SaltStack.

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:00.650
<v Speaker 0>So

00:36:03.585 --> 00:36:05.025
<v Speaker 1>Should

00:36:07.825 --> 00:36:08.385
<v Speaker 1>we

00:36:08.865 --> 00:36:10.385
<v Speaker 1>uninstall NeoVim?

00:36:11.025 --> 00:36:12.785
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Let's do it. Alright.

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:20.750
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So now we're just gonna run and

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:22.270
<v Speaker 0>try, apply

00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:23.310
<v Speaker 0>commands.

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:23.870
<v Speaker 0>Right?

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:25.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:36:31.305 --> 00:36:32.345
<v Speaker 0>Alright. And

00:36:32.585 --> 00:36:34.905
<v Speaker 1>there we go. Yep. See where we did

00:36:34.905 --> 00:36:37.305
<v Speaker 1>the, software dot invim action first.

00:36:37.385 --> 00:36:40.425
<v Speaker 1>Actually, did not know, was a dot. I

00:36:40.425 --> 00:36:41.945
<v Speaker 1>guess if you could talk a little bit

00:36:41.945 --> 00:36:44.320
<v Speaker 1>about that. I I would have assumed a

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.080
<v Speaker 1>forward slash. I haven't had to do too

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.400
<v Speaker 1>much with, dependencies yet, but I need to

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.160
<v Speaker 1>get better at using those.

00:36:51.119 --> 00:36:53.040
<v Speaker 0>No. I I need to get better at

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.000
<v Speaker 0>documenting.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:54.400
<v Speaker 0>However,

00:36:55.865 --> 00:36:57.625
<v Speaker 0>yeah, so there's a couple of things that

00:36:57.625 --> 00:36:59.704
<v Speaker 0>are actually happening here, but Comtrya. The first

00:36:59.704 --> 00:37:01.465
<v Speaker 0>one being, you know, the

00:37:01.625 --> 00:37:03.944
<v Speaker 0>manifest name is the filename, except for the

00:37:03.944 --> 00:37:05.945
<v Speaker 0>special case where it's main dot yaml,

00:37:06.265 --> 00:37:08.025
<v Speaker 0>and then it uses a paired directory. This

00:37:08.025 --> 00:37:10.665
<v Speaker 0>was also stolen. I was a huge SaltStack

00:37:10.665 --> 00:37:10.984
<v Speaker 0>fan.

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:13.720
<v Speaker 0>I used SaltStack for a decade,

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.079
<v Speaker 0>and it's what I used for my own

00:37:15.079 --> 00:37:17.160
<v Speaker 0>dot files until I got fed up of

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:17.640
<v Speaker 0>it.

00:37:18.039 --> 00:37:19.400
<v Speaker 0>SaltStack

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:21.559
<v Speaker 0>isn't really meant to run on local host,

00:37:21.559 --> 00:37:22.520
<v Speaker 0>well, it can.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.520
<v Speaker 0>So it doesn't do a status report and

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.039
<v Speaker 0>a progress report and stuff like that, things

00:37:26.039 --> 00:37:27.715
<v Speaker 0>I wanted to fix Comtrya.

00:37:27.955 --> 00:37:29.155
<v Speaker 0>So I stole some of the things I

00:37:29.155 --> 00:37:29.795
<v Speaker 0>liked,

00:37:30.195 --> 00:37:32.115
<v Speaker 0>which is the naming convention and the dependency

00:37:32.115 --> 00:37:32.915
<v Speaker 0>syntax.

00:37:32.915 --> 00:37:35.955
<v Speaker 0>So, you know, Comtrya supports dependency resolution

00:37:36.035 --> 00:37:36.595
<v Speaker 0>from

00:37:37.234 --> 00:37:39.714
<v Speaker 0>the current working directory where you run Comtrya

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:42.450
<v Speaker 0>or from wherever it finds a Comtrya dot

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:43.810
<v Speaker 0>YAML if you have one.

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:46.690
<v Speaker 0>So you can always do absolute with software

00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:47.810
<v Speaker 0>dot and then,

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:49.810
<v Speaker 0>you know, as many dot directories as you

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:51.490
<v Speaker 0>need to get to your manifest name.

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:53.570
<v Speaker 0>But you can also do local

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:55.490
<v Speaker 0>dependencies, which are

00:37:56.424 --> 00:37:57.145
<v Speaker 0>dot

00:37:57.625 --> 00:37:58.984
<v Speaker 0>and then if you were doing it from

00:37:58.984 --> 00:38:01.545
<v Speaker 0>an the software, which again is lifted straight

00:38:01.545 --> 00:38:04.105
<v Speaker 0>from SaltStack. So it's supposed to be familiar

00:38:04.105 --> 00:38:05.945
<v Speaker 0>and just the syntax that I like.

00:38:07.305 --> 00:38:07.945
<v Speaker 0>The

00:38:08.184 --> 00:38:10.744
<v Speaker 0>manifest loader loads all of the manifests

00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:14.220
<v Speaker 0>and scans for dependencies that builds that DAGs

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:16.220
<v Speaker 0>that I kinda mentioned earlier, and then they

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:17.180
<v Speaker 0>get executed

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:19.580
<v Speaker 0>in reverse order, making sure dependencies are always

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:21.260
<v Speaker 0>satisfied before anything else.

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:22.860
<v Speaker 0>You can't do

00:38:23.155 --> 00:38:24.515
<v Speaker 0>action dependencies.

00:38:24.515 --> 00:38:26.355
<v Speaker 0>Manifests always run top to bottom in a

00:38:26.355 --> 00:38:27.715
<v Speaker 0>linear serial order,

00:38:28.595 --> 00:38:30.275
<v Speaker 0>and that's gonna make asynchronous

00:38:30.275 --> 00:38:32.755
<v Speaker 0>run times in the future much easier without

00:38:32.755 --> 00:38:34.755
<v Speaker 0>the DAG again too convoluted.

00:38:34.755 --> 00:38:36.515
<v Speaker 0>Something that SALT stack allows

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:40.849
<v Speaker 0>is every single task within any state file

00:38:40.849 --> 00:38:42.450
<v Speaker 0>can have a dependency

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:45.010
<v Speaker 0>or reference to other ones, and then you

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:47.250
<v Speaker 0>never actually know the execution order.

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:49.650
<v Speaker 0>And I wanted some degree of

00:38:51.315 --> 00:38:53.635
<v Speaker 0>comprehension from just reading the manifest without going

00:38:53.635 --> 00:38:55.155
<v Speaker 0>too deep. So that's why some of these

00:38:55.155 --> 00:38:56.915
<v Speaker 0>trade offs were made. And, hopefully, it just

00:38:56.915 --> 00:38:58.675
<v Speaker 0>makes it a bit easier to work with

00:38:58.675 --> 00:38:59.635
<v Speaker 0>as as well.

00:39:00.035 --> 00:39:02.435
<v Speaker 0>We could also run Comtrya without the dash

00:39:02.435 --> 00:39:04.115
<v Speaker 0>d and without the dash m. So do

00:39:04.115 --> 00:39:05.795
<v Speaker 0>you wanna just run Comtrya apply?

00:39:05.955 --> 00:39:06.515
<v Speaker 0>Because,

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:08.650
<v Speaker 0>you know, the dash d is the default

00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:09.690
<v Speaker 0>out of the box,

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:11.290
<v Speaker 0>and you don't need dash m at all.

00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:12.970
<v Speaker 0>It just run everything. Oh, yeah.

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:16.650
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:18.890
<v Speaker 0>I've lied to you.

00:39:21.915 --> 00:39:24.075
<v Speaker 0>What's in this directory? Do a l s?

00:39:24.795 --> 00:39:26.635
<v Speaker 1>Just the, two folders.

00:39:26.795 --> 00:39:28.075
<v Speaker 0>Oh, that should work.

00:39:29.115 --> 00:39:31.275
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I guess dash d is required. I'm

00:39:31.275 --> 00:39:33.115
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure when that changed. But just

00:39:33.115 --> 00:39:35.515
<v Speaker 0>to Comtrya dash d. Apply

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.720
<v Speaker 0>and see if that fixes it.

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.800
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you need to No. Path. Yeah.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:45.200
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Yep. Yeah. So that runs everything with

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.880
<v Speaker 0>depends on the resolution. So

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:47.600
<v Speaker 0>yeah.

00:39:48.654 --> 00:39:50.414
<v Speaker 0>There's a really cool PR, and we'll talk

00:39:50.414 --> 00:39:51.454
<v Speaker 0>about this at the end. I don't wanna

00:39:51.454 --> 00:39:52.734
<v Speaker 0>get into it deep now. But I I

00:39:52.734 --> 00:39:54.654
<v Speaker 0>don't think any of us are particularly happy

00:39:54.654 --> 00:39:56.734
<v Speaker 0>with the output of Comtrya. We'd love to

00:39:56.734 --> 00:39:57.135
<v Speaker 0>see that

00:39:58.414 --> 00:40:00.880
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Made a little better. So

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.400
<v Speaker 1>There's a

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:08.000
<v Speaker 1>for debugging, it's not too bad, and how

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.240
<v Speaker 1>we have the output has come in handy

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.840
<v Speaker 1>lots of times. But

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:12.640
<v Speaker 1>there's

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.895
<v Speaker 1>it's not always,

00:40:15.055 --> 00:40:16.655
<v Speaker 1>the best, especially,

00:40:17.695 --> 00:40:19.855
<v Speaker 1>like, this portion of it. We do have

00:40:19.855 --> 00:40:21.935
<v Speaker 1>somebody who's working on progress bars.

00:40:22.895 --> 00:40:24.335
<v Speaker 1>I think we also do have some places

00:40:24.335 --> 00:40:27.020
<v Speaker 1>in Comtrya where we probably aren't tracing like

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:29.100
<v Speaker 1>we should. Like, sometimes we have something that's

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:30.940
<v Speaker 1>tracing as a warning when it should be

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:33.740
<v Speaker 1>tracing as information. I've kinda slowly been going

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:35.820
<v Speaker 1>through and clean up what I thought

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.300
<v Speaker 1>what bucket it better fit in.

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:41.660
<v Speaker 1>That's probably another

00:40:42.275 --> 00:40:44.275
<v Speaker 1>little bit of a sore with the

00:40:44.835 --> 00:40:46.995
<v Speaker 1>output of Comtrya is that we do have

00:40:46.995 --> 00:40:48.755
<v Speaker 1>some things that I don't think get traced

00:40:48.755 --> 00:40:49.555
<v Speaker 1>correctly.

00:40:50.835 --> 00:40:53.235
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Well, come on. Let's cut some slack.

00:40:53.235 --> 00:40:54.810
<v Speaker 0>It's a 0.9

00:40:54.810 --> 00:40:57.930
<v Speaker 0>project. Oh, yeah. Well well, also, some of

00:40:57.930 --> 00:40:59.770
<v Speaker 1>it is just kinda difficult. Like like, there's

00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:01.370
<v Speaker 1>been some that I've changed where I'm like,

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:03.210
<v Speaker 1>I kinda could go either way, but for

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:05.770
<v Speaker 1>some reason, my gut's just telling me info

00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:07.865
<v Speaker 1>is correct or a warrant is correct.

00:41:08.265 --> 00:41:09.865
<v Speaker 1>And there and there have been a lot

00:41:09.865 --> 00:41:10.585
<v Speaker 1>of those.

00:41:12.105 --> 00:41:12.745
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:41:14.345 --> 00:41:15.065
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:41:15.224 --> 00:41:17.224
<v Speaker 0>Let's show a couple more examples.

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:20.420
<v Speaker 0>I've got loads in my head. I don't

00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:21.619
<v Speaker 0>know if there's something you want to show,

00:41:21.619 --> 00:41:22.980
<v Speaker 0>but I can keep throwing things at you

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:23.700
<v Speaker 0>if you want.

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:26.420
<v Speaker 1>One thing real quick.

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:28.579
<v Speaker 1>Probably won't necessarily be able to run an

00:41:28.579 --> 00:41:30.900
<v Speaker 1>action, but one mentioned since we were messing

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:33.075
<v Speaker 1>with the package.install

00:41:33.075 --> 00:41:34.035
<v Speaker 1>is that

00:41:34.275 --> 00:41:36.755
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned the term earlier was

00:41:36.835 --> 00:41:37.795
<v Speaker 1>provider.

00:41:38.995 --> 00:41:41.795
<v Speaker 1>Comtrya does have this concept of, like, providers,

00:41:41.795 --> 00:41:43.395
<v Speaker 1>and it's not just in the package install

00:41:43.395 --> 00:41:45.075
<v Speaker 1>while we use it a few other places.

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:47.870
<v Speaker 1>But the idea with the

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:51.070
<v Speaker 1>in the context of package install is

00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:54.510
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you have a platform that can support

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:56.190
<v Speaker 1>multiple package managers,

00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:56.830
<v Speaker 1>or

00:41:57.870 --> 00:41:58.590
<v Speaker 1>maybe

00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:00.430
<v Speaker 1>you run

00:42:00.085 --> 00:42:01.925
<v Speaker 1>Arch, but for some reason, you want to

00:42:01.925 --> 00:42:04.645
<v Speaker 1>use apps. Like, that is a possible thing

00:42:04.645 --> 00:42:05.285
<v Speaker 1>to do.

00:42:05.685 --> 00:42:08.005
<v Speaker 1>You can override the default

00:42:08.005 --> 00:42:08.885
<v Speaker 1>selection

00:42:08.885 --> 00:42:11.605
<v Speaker 1>of package manager with the provider.

00:42:11.925 --> 00:42:12.725
<v Speaker 1>Actually, really

00:42:13.599 --> 00:42:16.319
<v Speaker 1>two really good examples of why this might

00:42:16.319 --> 00:42:17.920
<v Speaker 1>be necessary.

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Actually, a few.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:21.920
<v Speaker 1>For macOS,

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:24.560
<v Speaker 1>there's two primary package managers that people use.

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:26.560
<v Speaker 1>There's brew and mac ports.

00:42:27.525 --> 00:42:30.645
<v Speaker 1>Brew is what Comtrya defaults to. But if

00:42:30.645 --> 00:42:32.085
<v Speaker 1>you don't like Brew and you like Mac

00:42:32.085 --> 00:42:32.725
<v Speaker 1>ports,

00:42:33.125 --> 00:42:35.444
<v Speaker 1>which I've used, I've kinda gotten more into

00:42:35.444 --> 00:42:37.125
<v Speaker 1>Brew, but I used to use Mac ports

00:42:37.125 --> 00:42:39.680
<v Speaker 1>a lot. You can specify specifically to use

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:41.280
<v Speaker 1>Mac ports over Brew.

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.359
<v Speaker 1>As you can see, this has been new

00:42:43.359 --> 00:42:45.599
<v Speaker 1>and was actually contributed by a coworker of

00:42:45.599 --> 00:42:46.079
<v Speaker 1>mine,

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.839
<v Speaker 1>support for SnapCraft. So being able to use

00:42:49.839 --> 00:42:51.839
<v Speaker 1>Snap packages. So if you're on, like, Ubuntu

00:42:51.839 --> 00:42:53.680
<v Speaker 1>or a Linux system that has Snap and

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.335
<v Speaker 1>you would rather your package come from Snap

00:42:55.335 --> 00:42:56.615
<v Speaker 1>than from apps,

00:42:57.575 --> 00:42:58.855
<v Speaker 1>that's possible.

00:42:58.935 --> 00:42:59.655
<v Speaker 1>And then

00:43:00.935 --> 00:43:03.335
<v Speaker 1>package in here from the NetBSD team is

00:43:03.335 --> 00:43:05.255
<v Speaker 1>a cross platform. So you can use Package

00:43:05.255 --> 00:43:06.295
<v Speaker 1>in on Linux.

00:43:06.375 --> 00:43:07.975
<v Speaker 1>You can use on macOS. You can use

00:43:07.975 --> 00:43:09.734
<v Speaker 1>it on free BSD, NetBSD.

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:13.670
<v Speaker 1>If you wanna use Packagen on macOS,

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:15.910
<v Speaker 1>your Comtrya will allow you to do that.

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:17.830
<v Speaker 1>You just have to specify the provider, and

00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:20.150
<v Speaker 1>you gotta you gotta bootstrap

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Packagen on your own on macOS.

00:43:23.945 --> 00:43:26.105
<v Speaker 0>Nice. I had no idea someone had to

00:43:26.105 --> 00:43:28.665
<v Speaker 0>snap, but now the feudies inside me where

00:43:28.665 --> 00:43:30.185
<v Speaker 0>I have to go add Flatpak and make

00:43:30.185 --> 00:43:31.945
<v Speaker 0>it better. So Yeah.

00:43:32.345 --> 00:43:34.585
<v Speaker 1>That was kinda because he asked me, what

00:43:34.585 --> 00:43:35.945
<v Speaker 1>was the next thing he should work on?

00:43:35.945 --> 00:43:38.105
<v Speaker 1>Because, he's he's a coworker who wanted to

00:43:38.105 --> 00:43:40.020
<v Speaker 1>get into open source. I'm like, well,

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:42.980
<v Speaker 1>I've got a you know, I kinda maintain

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:45.380
<v Speaker 1>a Rust project, and I can help you.

00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:46.980
<v Speaker 1>So he did snap, and he did a

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:49.380
<v Speaker 1>couple of other things. I could probably stick

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:50.260
<v Speaker 1>him on flat pack.

00:43:52.545 --> 00:43:53.185
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:43:53.345 --> 00:43:53.985
<v Speaker 0>So

00:43:54.545 --> 00:43:55.345
<v Speaker 0>let's

00:43:55.585 --> 00:43:57.425
<v Speaker 0>let's show show off something cool, and we

00:43:57.425 --> 00:43:59.345
<v Speaker 0>can integrate it to the the providers or

00:43:59.345 --> 00:44:01.025
<v Speaker 0>we could do something slightly different. But let's

00:44:01.025 --> 00:44:02.945
<v Speaker 0>modify our NVIM manifest.

00:44:03.425 --> 00:44:03.825
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:05.570
<v Speaker 0>Because I think

00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:09.330
<v Speaker 0>the conditional syntax and the variance are really

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:11.010
<v Speaker 0>I don't think

00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:13.730
<v Speaker 0>this is nice in other tools like this.

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:15.170
<v Speaker 0>So

00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:17.410
<v Speaker 0>let's assume right. So

00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:19.115
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna take us on a round of

00:44:19.115 --> 00:44:21.195
<v Speaker 0>a a weird tour here, and this doesn't

00:44:21.195 --> 00:44:22.795
<v Speaker 0>make a lot of sense if you're familiar

00:44:22.795 --> 00:44:24.635
<v Speaker 0>with Comtrya. So Todd's gonna be like, why

00:44:24.635 --> 00:44:25.835
<v Speaker 0>are we doing it this way?

00:44:26.234 --> 00:44:28.955
<v Speaker 0>Right. But we have where conditions on the

00:44:28.955 --> 00:44:29.835
<v Speaker 0>manifest

00:44:29.835 --> 00:44:32.395
<v Speaker 0>and on actions. Right? So

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:35.630
<v Speaker 0>let's add a where condition to this manifest

00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:38.110
<v Speaker 0>that says only run on Linux,

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:40.670
<v Speaker 0>which we just do at the the top.

00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Where if I remember was it? You just

00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:46.430
<v Speaker 0>do

00:44:46.914 --> 00:44:49.234
<v Speaker 0>o s dot name equal equals,

00:44:50.994 --> 00:44:51.795
<v Speaker 0>I think.

00:44:52.035 --> 00:44:53.394
<v Speaker 0>But we can show people how to list

00:44:53.394 --> 00:44:54.755
<v Speaker 0>that as well. So

00:44:55.154 --> 00:44:57.394
<v Speaker 0>if you run Comtrya context

00:44:57.394 --> 00:44:59.700
<v Speaker 0>on the command line, it'll list all of

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:01.540
<v Speaker 0>these variables that we have access to.

00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. And I guess, while we're showing

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.500
<v Speaker 1>this, something else that was added, and I

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:11.460
<v Speaker 1>believe it's now available in version zero dot

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:12.260
<v Speaker 1>nine dot one.

00:45:13.235 --> 00:45:14.835
<v Speaker 1>We'll give you this list, but I don't

00:45:14.835 --> 00:45:16.675
<v Speaker 1>think we ever necessarily showed you the values.

00:45:16.675 --> 00:45:18.755
<v Speaker 1>I think, actually, Stefan implemented part of this,

00:45:18.755 --> 00:45:20.115
<v Speaker 1>and I think I just surfaced it up

00:45:20.115 --> 00:45:21.955
<v Speaker 1>through a command line option maybe. I may

00:45:21.955 --> 00:45:24.035
<v Speaker 1>also be just remembering, but

00:45:24.195 --> 00:45:26.035
<v Speaker 1>should be able to do show values.

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:28.660
<v Speaker 1>So if you're confused, you can see

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:30.580
<v Speaker 1>what the values are.

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:32.820
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. And we have always named dot Linux.

00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:33.860
<v Speaker 0>So Mhmm.

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:35.300
<v Speaker 0>Just

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:38.100
<v Speaker 0>because Stefan is watching,

00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:40.185
<v Speaker 0>can we pull up one of the examples,

00:45:40.185 --> 00:45:42.105
<v Speaker 0>which I think is absolutely ridiculous,

00:45:42.105 --> 00:45:43.705
<v Speaker 0>but so much fun at the same time?

00:45:44.905 --> 00:45:45.545
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:45:45.705 --> 00:45:47.145
<v Speaker 0>It's the DNS

00:45:47.625 --> 00:45:48.585
<v Speaker 0>variables.

00:45:49.225 --> 00:45:49.945
<v Speaker 0>I

00:45:50.905 --> 00:45:52.105
<v Speaker 0>think it's under

00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:55.470
<v Speaker 0>there's no context. So it must be under

00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:56.510
<v Speaker 0>where maybe?

00:45:58.270 --> 00:45:59.630
<v Speaker 1>Wait. If they're for

00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:03.390
<v Speaker 0>No. I don't know. Search repository for

00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:07.070
<v Speaker 0>text, TXT.

00:46:08.975 --> 00:46:10.735
<v Speaker 0>Maybe Stefan don't know what it is. It's

00:46:10.735 --> 00:46:11.855
<v Speaker 0>just so

00:46:12.495 --> 00:46:14.015
<v Speaker 0>silly but fun.

00:46:15.615 --> 00:46:17.775
<v Speaker 1>Oh, that's searching. I already just did a

00:46:17.775 --> 00:46:19.980
<v Speaker 0>code search rather than a file search. Oh,

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:21.500
<v Speaker 1>yeah. Shoot.

00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:23.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't do that too often. At the

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:24.060
<v Speaker 0>top?

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:26.060
<v Speaker 0>Slash?

00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:27.260
<v Speaker 0>Forward slash?

00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:29.660
<v Speaker 0>No. But you have to be able to

00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:31.660
<v Speaker 0>say dot text box. Sorry. Oh. I'm setting

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:33.180
<v Speaker 0>up a failure now. Yeah. Just click anywhere

00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:34.860
<v Speaker 0>and then do slash and then type TXT.

00:46:37.795 --> 00:46:38.515
<v Speaker 1>Is this

00:46:39.235 --> 00:46:42.115
<v Speaker 1>yeah. I think variable include DNS. Well, that's

00:46:42.115 --> 00:46:44.035
<v Speaker 0>a code. Yeah. That's code.

00:46:45.155 --> 00:46:46.915
<v Speaker 0>But, yeah, if you just do a proper

00:46:47.395 --> 00:46:49.875
<v Speaker 0>yeah. That first one there, an examples directory.

00:46:51.119 --> 00:46:52.320
<v Speaker 0>TXT.

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:53.119
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:00.080
<v Speaker 0>And then add TXT to the search.

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:05.200
<v Speaker 0>Sorry. I'm I'm detracting now from anything useful,

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:05.920
<v Speaker 0>but this is fun.

00:47:06.575 --> 00:47:08.734
<v Speaker 0>Just to type TXT and hit return.

00:47:10.894 --> 00:47:11.694
<v Speaker 1>There

00:47:11.694 --> 00:47:12.415
<v Speaker 1>you go.

00:47:13.535 --> 00:47:15.375
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And I can try

00:47:15.375 --> 00:47:16.335
<v Speaker 1>that. Yeah.

00:47:18.255 --> 00:47:21.375
<v Speaker 0>So that actually does a DNS text record

00:47:21.375 --> 00:47:22.575
<v Speaker 0>lookup

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:23.670
<v Speaker 0>for his domain.

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:25.510
<v Speaker 0>And so, like, if it's one of those

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:27.190
<v Speaker 0>use cases where if you want to run

00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:29.830
<v Speaker 0>Comtrya in the cloud, you could actually access

00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:32.310
<v Speaker 0>the, you know, the metadata on the AWS

00:47:32.310 --> 00:47:34.790
<v Speaker 0>EC two instance or DNS text records to

00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:37.205
<v Speaker 0>do some sort of IP address resolution or

00:47:37.205 --> 00:47:39.205
<v Speaker 0>even just pass down properties, and the machines

00:47:39.205 --> 00:47:41.285
<v Speaker 0>could pick them up. And it just opened

00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:43.685
<v Speaker 0>up some really weird use cases. So we've

00:47:43.685 --> 00:47:46.005
<v Speaker 0>never pushed or explored, but I just think

00:47:46.005 --> 00:47:48.165
<v Speaker 0>it's really it's it's just good fun. So

00:47:48.245 --> 00:47:50.245
<v Speaker 0>yeah. I don't even know if his text

00:47:50.245 --> 00:47:52.080
<v Speaker 0>records still exist, but it it was definitely

00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:53.200
<v Speaker 0>fun when he did it.

00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:56.000
<v Speaker 0>Sorry. Anyway, I I took it away from

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.600
<v Speaker 0>what we're actually gonna show there. So let's

00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:59.280
<v Speaker 0>jump back to our terminal.

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:01.040
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that loads of times, and I've

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:02.560
<v Speaker 1>and I've always wondered. I'm like,

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:04.720
<v Speaker 1>what what's going on there?

00:48:05.475 --> 00:48:07.315
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's the the idea being that, you

00:48:07.315 --> 00:48:09.635
<v Speaker 0>know, when you can include remote variables, this

00:48:09.635 --> 00:48:11.875
<v Speaker 0>is like salt pillars for anyone that is

00:48:11.875 --> 00:48:13.235
<v Speaker 0>familiar with SaltStack,

00:48:14.355 --> 00:48:16.435
<v Speaker 0>and we support DNS. It could be easy

00:48:16.435 --> 00:48:18.355
<v Speaker 0>to metadata. It could be

00:48:18.995 --> 00:48:21.290
<v Speaker 0>postgres lookups. Like, you know, we can make

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:22.650
<v Speaker 0>anything supportive,

00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:25.130
<v Speaker 0>but we just don't have the request. And

00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:27.050
<v Speaker 0>I think, again, it comes down to documentation.

00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:28.810
<v Speaker 0>Like, unless, you know, to go and find

00:48:28.810 --> 00:48:30.330
<v Speaker 0>that that piece of code or look at

00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:32.410
<v Speaker 0>that example, you wouldn't even know you could

00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:33.450
<v Speaker 0>do DNS

00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:36.945
<v Speaker 0>lookups within the variable context. So. Yeah. Yeah.

00:48:36.945 --> 00:48:38.785
<v Speaker 0>Well, also, that like, yeah. Of course, they

00:48:38.785 --> 00:48:39.505
<v Speaker 0>exist. So

00:48:40.705 --> 00:48:41.345
<v Speaker 1>And

00:48:41.585 --> 00:48:42.545
<v Speaker 1>yeah. So

00:48:42.785 --> 00:48:44.465
<v Speaker 1>I guess seeing that, if you notice, it

00:48:44.465 --> 00:48:45.985
<v Speaker 1>says Comtrya.YAML.

00:48:46.225 --> 00:48:48.065
<v Speaker 1>For people watching this, this is almost kinda

00:48:48.065 --> 00:48:50.550
<v Speaker 1>like a configuration file for Comtrya.

00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:52.710
<v Speaker 1>There has been kind of a cool change

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:55.830
<v Speaker 1>here. Before, I believe it's always ever looked

00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:58.950
<v Speaker 1>at, like, the roots of your manifest directory.

00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:01.430
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's maybe, like, one other

00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:02.470
<v Speaker 1>place, but you could never

00:49:03.455 --> 00:49:04.255
<v Speaker 1>specify,

00:49:04.255 --> 00:49:05.695
<v Speaker 1>like, a specific like, you could have a

00:49:05.695 --> 00:49:07.615
<v Speaker 1>config file just in a random place.

00:49:07.935 --> 00:49:08.735
<v Speaker 1>Now

00:49:08.735 --> 00:49:11.295
<v Speaker 1>as a version zero dot nine dot one,

00:49:11.295 --> 00:49:12.895
<v Speaker 1>there should be a command line option that

00:49:12.895 --> 00:49:15.375
<v Speaker 1>allow you to say, hey. Use this specific

00:49:15.375 --> 00:49:15.615
<v Speaker 1>one.

00:49:16.569 --> 00:49:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Don't know if anybody will use it, but

00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:20.569
<v Speaker 1>it's there if somebody needs it for some

00:49:20.569 --> 00:49:22.890
<v Speaker 1>reason. If they have multiple different manifests, but

00:49:23.049 --> 00:49:25.849
<v Speaker 1>or, maybe multiple different directories for some reason

00:49:25.849 --> 00:49:27.690
<v Speaker 1>and but they wanna have, like, a shared

00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:28.490
<v Speaker 1>config.

00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:30.569
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:49:34.815 --> 00:49:36.575
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Where were we? Oh, yeah.

00:49:36.895 --> 00:49:39.615
<v Speaker 0>Where's the Linux? Let's change it to Mac

00:49:39.615 --> 00:49:41.135
<v Speaker 0>OS and then just show that it doesn't

00:49:41.135 --> 00:49:43.135
<v Speaker 0>run first and foremost. And that'll make sure

00:49:43.135 --> 00:49:44.975
<v Speaker 0>we haven't make any mistakes.

00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:48.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm showing macOS is all lowercase.

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:51.040
<v Speaker 0>It is all lower everything gets lowercase in

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:51.600
<v Speaker 0>the

00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:53.440
<v Speaker 0>context, I believe.

00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:58.480
<v Speaker 0>So apply. So here we see what what

00:49:58.480 --> 00:49:59.440
<v Speaker 0>partition failed.

00:50:01.865 --> 00:50:03.145
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So now if we change this to

00:50:03.145 --> 00:50:04.665
<v Speaker 0>Linux, it should run again.

00:50:10.105 --> 00:50:12.265
<v Speaker 0>What have we got wrong on that? Oh,

00:50:12.265 --> 00:50:13.785
<v Speaker 0>I have wrapped Linux in Quartz.

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:15.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah.

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:21.640
<v Speaker 0>It's looking for a variable called Linux, is

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:22.920
<v Speaker 0>probably an empty string.

00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:26.520
<v Speaker 1>And there we go.

00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:29.385
<v Speaker 0>Okay. One more change for me, please. Let's

00:50:29.385 --> 00:50:32.025
<v Speaker 0>add to say a similar where condition to

00:50:32.025 --> 00:50:33.945
<v Speaker 0>our first action. So we're saying always run

00:50:33.945 --> 00:50:36.265
<v Speaker 0>this manifest for Linux machines, but now let's

00:50:36.265 --> 00:50:38.265
<v Speaker 0>only run it on Arch.

00:50:39.065 --> 00:50:39.465
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:42.600
<v Speaker 0>Where is that? .Family.

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:44.680
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:54.280
<v Speaker 1>we probably do need some documents. Is that

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:55.560
<v Speaker 0>is that variance, I think?

00:50:56.805 --> 00:50:57.765
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah.

00:50:58.165 --> 00:50:59.045
<v Speaker 0>Variance.

00:51:00.405 --> 00:51:02.565
<v Speaker 0>I mean, variance and wear conditions. I mean,

00:51:02.565 --> 00:51:04.165
<v Speaker 0>I'll we'll need to get into that too,

00:51:04.165 --> 00:51:05.365
<v Speaker 0>but you can see the example at the

00:51:05.365 --> 00:51:08.325
<v Speaker 0>bottom there. Yeah. Standard wear condition without variance,

00:51:08.325 --> 00:51:10.485
<v Speaker 0>and then I'll talk about variance as well.

00:51:10.724 --> 00:51:11.125
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:51:11.970 --> 00:51:12.610
<v Speaker 0>So

00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:18.050
<v Speaker 0>No. You don't need variants for this example.

00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:21.490
<v Speaker 1>Where

00:51:21.730 --> 00:51:23.890
<v Speaker 1>and then was it just OS.fan?

00:51:24.565 --> 00:51:25.925
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. 0s.fam.

00:51:27.525 --> 00:51:29.285
<v Speaker 0>Or may I can't remember. We may have

00:51:29.285 --> 00:51:30.405
<v Speaker 0>to check the context.

00:51:35.205 --> 00:51:37.765
<v Speaker 0>Okay. And, I mean, that shouldn't run now,

00:51:37.765 --> 00:51:39.020
<v Speaker 0>so let's run it.

00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Nothing to be done reconciling

00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:45.260
<v Speaker 1>action.

00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:47.740
<v Speaker 0>Ah, yeah. We haven't spoke about the plan

00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:48.540
<v Speaker 0>stage.

00:51:49.099 --> 00:51:50.700
<v Speaker 0>You wanna talk about that?

00:51:58.415 --> 00:52:01.055
<v Speaker 1>The plan stage, if I recall correctly,

00:52:01.935 --> 00:52:05.135
<v Speaker 1>essentially, the plan stage will take a look

00:52:05.135 --> 00:52:08.095
<v Speaker 1>at the action and will determine if it

00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:10.020
<v Speaker 1>can run or not, if I recall correctly.

00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:11.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm I'm usually

00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:13.620
<v Speaker 1>too deep into the code, not too much

00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:15.540
<v Speaker 1>into the, interfaces.

00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:18.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. We'll pop up in the manifest, and

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:19.380
<v Speaker 0>we can talk about it.

00:52:22.985 --> 00:52:24.025
<v Speaker 0>Yes. So

00:52:24.345 --> 00:52:27.705
<v Speaker 0>the manifest where clauses are executed before any

00:52:27.705 --> 00:52:30.105
<v Speaker 0>actions are are parsed. So that says, you

00:52:30.105 --> 00:52:31.625
<v Speaker 0>know, do we even need to understand these

00:52:31.625 --> 00:52:32.265
<v Speaker 0>actions?

00:52:32.505 --> 00:52:34.345
<v Speaker 0>And the actions themselves,

00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:38.280
<v Speaker 0>I mean, actions within Comtrya

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:40.359
<v Speaker 0>have something called a plan, which tries to

00:52:40.359 --> 00:52:42.280
<v Speaker 0>determine if any of the steps need to

00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:45.400
<v Speaker 0>run. Actions are actually composites of atoms. I

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:46.520
<v Speaker 0>don't know if we need to get into

00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:50.244
<v Speaker 0>that, but it's a cool subsystem for building

00:52:50.244 --> 00:52:51.365
<v Speaker 0>your own actions.

00:52:51.925 --> 00:52:54.565
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. But this work condition actually never has

00:52:54.565 --> 00:52:55.125
<v Speaker 0>to

00:52:55.765 --> 00:52:59.205
<v Speaker 0>be executed because the package is already installed,

00:52:59.205 --> 00:53:00.565
<v Speaker 0>and this action doesn't need to go any

00:53:00.565 --> 00:53:03.300
<v Speaker 0>deeper. So it just says NeoVim exists. So

00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:05.860
<v Speaker 0>we'd need to remove NeoVim again and then

00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:08.180
<v Speaker 0>run it and hopefully see that the action

00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:08.820
<v Speaker 0>is

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:09.700
<v Speaker 0>skipped.

00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:14.660
<v Speaker 0>Sorry. I'm I'm pushing you into parts like

00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:16.285
<v Speaker 0>Comtrya. You have not explored before now. I

00:53:16.285 --> 00:53:18.845
<v Speaker 0>feel bad. Oh, it's all good. Yeah. It's

00:53:18.845 --> 00:53:20.525
<v Speaker 1>mostly just a lot of, like, the, wear

00:53:20.525 --> 00:53:22.765
<v Speaker 1>conditions and variants. I haven't dealt too much

00:53:22.765 --> 00:53:25.085
<v Speaker 1>into it. Although, I really should because

00:53:25.645 --> 00:53:27.805
<v Speaker 1>the documentation probably does need to be updated.

00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:29.660
<v Speaker 1>Or Oh, yeah. For sure. Like like, I

00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:31.339
<v Speaker 1>think there's things like the variables we don't

00:53:31.339 --> 00:53:32.540
<v Speaker 1>really have documented.

00:53:34.859 --> 00:53:37.420
<v Speaker 1>So I removed it. Nothing to be done.

00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:39.020
<v Speaker 0>Too much stuff. I mean,

00:53:40.645 --> 00:53:42.485
<v Speaker 0>did we remove the event? We did.

00:53:43.445 --> 00:53:44.245
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:53:45.765 --> 00:53:47.205
<v Speaker 0>I wonder if it's just because the where

00:53:47.205 --> 00:53:49.125
<v Speaker 0>condition failed, and it just says nothing to

00:53:49.125 --> 00:53:51.125
<v Speaker 0>be done. Maybe we don't actually specifically call

00:53:51.125 --> 00:53:51.925
<v Speaker 0>it the

00:53:52.405 --> 00:53:54.565
<v Speaker 0>conditional, which is an improvement. I think we

00:53:54.565 --> 00:53:56.170
<v Speaker 0>should make it. That's correct.

00:53:56.570 --> 00:53:57.050
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm.

00:53:57.770 --> 00:54:00.490
<v Speaker 0>Let's run Comtrya context to make sure that

00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:02.330
<v Speaker 0>value is what we expect, and then we

00:54:02.330 --> 00:54:03.930
<v Speaker 0>can update it so that it does run.

00:54:08.615 --> 00:54:09.655
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

00:54:10.295 --> 00:54:11.975
<v Speaker 0>You don't need show values.

00:54:12.214 --> 00:54:13.175
<v Speaker 0>Family.

00:54:13.175 --> 00:54:14.455
<v Speaker 0>Year near future.

00:54:17.815 --> 00:54:19.974
<v Speaker 0>A family is your unit. Oh, distribution. Oh,

00:54:19.974 --> 00:54:21.095
<v Speaker 1>yeah. Distribution.

00:54:22.454 --> 00:54:24.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That I wonder where we pull the

00:54:24.830 --> 00:54:27.390
<v Speaker 1>family from. So I've also done some work

00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:29.790
<v Speaker 1>on the one of our dependencies,

00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:31.070
<v Speaker 1>the OS info.

00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:34.110
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know if that comes from

00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:36.865
<v Speaker 1>OS info or not. I don't think so.

00:54:36.865 --> 00:54:38.465
<v Speaker 1>Because I tried to introduce a concept to

00:54:38.465 --> 00:54:40.225
<v Speaker 1>families to solve a problem. I can try

00:54:40.225 --> 00:54:42.145
<v Speaker 1>it, but it's been an open pull request

00:54:42.145 --> 00:54:44.065
<v Speaker 1>for, like, two years with 30 comments on

00:54:44.065 --> 00:54:44.545
<v Speaker 1>it.

00:54:46.545 --> 00:54:48.385
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. We should probably just fork factory at

00:54:48.385 --> 00:54:48.865
<v Speaker 0>some point.

00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:51.839
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. The problem I was trying to solve

00:54:51.839 --> 00:54:55.760
<v Speaker 1>there was because OS info, it also gets

00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:57.840
<v Speaker 1>used by cargo itself.

00:54:59.119 --> 00:55:01.040
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to double check the name of

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.800
<v Speaker 1>that because I started talking and forgot it.

00:55:03.945 --> 00:55:04.745
<v Speaker 1>Distribution.

00:55:04.745 --> 00:55:06.585
<v Speaker 1>Okay. I wanna make sure it wasn't short

00:55:06.585 --> 00:55:07.625
<v Speaker 1>for distro.

00:55:10.665 --> 00:55:12.425
<v Speaker 1>Some of the problem is with, like

00:55:13.305 --> 00:55:15.065
<v Speaker 1>so in the package provider,

00:55:15.065 --> 00:55:18.599
<v Speaker 1>it's how we determine which package provider we

00:55:18.599 --> 00:55:21.319
<v Speaker 1>use. It's just this long match statement that

00:55:21.319 --> 00:55:24.119
<v Speaker 1>will the more distributions we add, the longer

00:55:24.119 --> 00:55:25.960
<v Speaker 1>and longer it'll be. And I was hoping

00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:27.880
<v Speaker 1>to kind of shortcut it

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:31.434
<v Speaker 1>with kinda, like, this idea of, like, operating

00:55:31.434 --> 00:55:33.755
<v Speaker 1>system families. Right? So we know, like,

00:55:34.714 --> 00:55:36.954
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty good heuristic to say any

00:55:36.954 --> 00:55:39.435
<v Speaker 1>Debian or Debian based distribution

00:55:39.595 --> 00:55:40.475
<v Speaker 1>has that.

00:55:40.714 --> 00:55:43.515
<v Speaker 1>Any Arch and Arch based distribution

00:55:43.675 --> 00:55:45.755
<v Speaker 1>has the ability to use

00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:49.320
<v Speaker 1>Paru or Ye or Pacman.

00:55:50.599 --> 00:55:52.280
<v Speaker 1>But that kinda came a little bit of

00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:54.359
<v Speaker 1>a debate, and it ended up not going

00:55:54.359 --> 00:55:55.160
<v Speaker 1>anywhere.

00:55:57.400 --> 00:55:59.800
<v Speaker 0>But And set it to Debian, capital d,

00:55:59.895 --> 00:56:01.495
<v Speaker 0>as we want it to run this time.

00:56:01.495 --> 00:56:03.495
<v Speaker 0>Debian.

00:56:10.695 --> 00:56:12.455
<v Speaker 0>That was good. Installed.

00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:16.220
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I'll say one more thing about that

00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:18.460
<v Speaker 0>manifest, and then you

00:56:19.099 --> 00:56:20.940
<v Speaker 0>can pick something else to show. But the

00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:22.619
<v Speaker 0>reason variance exist

00:56:22.619 --> 00:56:24.780
<v Speaker 0>is, you know, if we wanted to change

00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:26.619
<v Speaker 0>the name of this package from Debbie and

00:56:26.619 --> 00:56:29.525
<v Speaker 0>then Arch, say Arch is NVIM or whatever.

00:56:30.405 --> 00:56:32.484
<v Speaker 0>Having two actions to me felt dirty. And,

00:56:32.484 --> 00:56:34.484
<v Speaker 0>you know, that's how that's how it exists

00:56:34.484 --> 00:56:35.685
<v Speaker 0>in other systems.

00:56:36.964 --> 00:56:39.365
<v Speaker 0>And while we can use Jinja, and hopefully,

00:56:39.365 --> 00:56:40.805
<v Speaker 0>we never show anyone how to do Jinja

00:56:40.805 --> 00:56:42.724
<v Speaker 0>and Comtrya, is that I'd also don't want

00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:44.990
<v Speaker 0>that that templating approach to be how we

00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:46.590
<v Speaker 0>do it. It should be more declarative.

00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:48.830
<v Speaker 0>So the variance in taxes, okay, we have

00:56:48.830 --> 00:56:51.870
<v Speaker 0>one multiple variance of this single action

00:56:52.350 --> 00:56:54.910
<v Speaker 0>where you can have the where guard clauses,

00:56:55.164 --> 00:56:56.925
<v Speaker 0>and then you can override

00:56:57.005 --> 00:56:58.125
<v Speaker 0>any property

00:56:58.125 --> 00:56:59.565
<v Speaker 0>on the action

00:56:59.805 --> 00:57:01.805
<v Speaker 0>with the variant syntax,

00:57:01.805 --> 00:57:03.164
<v Speaker 0>which is also great. You don't need to

00:57:03.164 --> 00:57:04.525
<v Speaker 0>type it. We can just show it from

00:57:04.525 --> 00:57:06.444
<v Speaker 0>the on the docs. I think the example

00:57:06.444 --> 00:57:07.724
<v Speaker 0>there is pretty

00:57:07.724 --> 00:57:07.964
<v Speaker 0>good.

00:57:12.079 --> 00:57:12.800
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:57:13.279 --> 00:57:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.

00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:18.320
<v Speaker 1>The the

00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:21.920
<v Speaker 1>users ones might be pretty cool.

00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:22.880
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:57:26.655 --> 00:57:27.694
<v Speaker 0>Users.

00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:51.859
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So

00:57:52.595 --> 00:57:55.635
<v Speaker 1>something I believe it was new early

00:57:55.795 --> 00:57:57.635
<v Speaker 1>last year maybe

00:57:58.674 --> 00:58:00.434
<v Speaker 1>was the ability to have can try to

00:58:00.434 --> 00:58:02.194
<v Speaker 1>create users. Now granted, I do not believe

00:58:02.194 --> 00:58:03.714
<v Speaker 1>this works on Windows. So we do have

00:58:03.714 --> 00:58:05.075
<v Speaker 1>some functionality where it's

00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:08.160
<v Speaker 1>it should work on most Unix systems, but

00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:11.040
<v Speaker 1>on Windows, it probably doesn't work. I believe

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:12.400
<v Speaker 1>we have this surrounded

00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:13.040
<v Speaker 1>with

00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:16.320
<v Speaker 1>compilation flags. But if you know you need

00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:18.160
<v Speaker 1>to set up specific users

00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:20.345
<v Speaker 1>or and groups to and you need to

00:58:20.345 --> 00:58:22.265
<v Speaker 1>add users to groups, Comtrya

00:58:22.265 --> 00:58:24.505
<v Speaker 1>has manifest actions to do that.

00:58:24.984 --> 00:58:28.345
<v Speaker 1>One caveat about this is it's not tested

00:58:28.665 --> 00:58:30.825
<v Speaker 1>necessarily on everything. So

00:58:31.224 --> 00:58:33.625
<v Speaker 1>if you come across, like, a Linux distribution

00:58:33.625 --> 00:58:34.345
<v Speaker 1>where

00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:36.840
<v Speaker 1>adding users is slightly different

00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:40.440
<v Speaker 1>or a BSD or macOS,

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.240
<v Speaker 1>just drop an issue, and I can investigate

00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:44.360
<v Speaker 1>it and fix it.

00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Because some distros do do it a little

00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:48.280
<v Speaker 1>differently,

00:58:51.464 --> 00:58:52.105
<v Speaker 1>But

00:58:54.265 --> 00:58:55.625
<v Speaker 1>yeah. Let's see.

00:58:56.744 --> 00:58:58.984
<v Speaker 1>So let's start off by

00:58:59.305 --> 00:59:02.585
<v Speaker 1>creating a group. So do

00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:03.640
<v Speaker 1>group.add,

00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:06.840
<v Speaker 1>and we'll just call the skip the group

00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:08.760
<v Speaker 1>name of test.

00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:12.280
<v Speaker 0>So

00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:13.160
<v Speaker 0>try

00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:14.760
<v Speaker 0>You've done a table.

00:59:15.325 --> 00:59:16.525
<v Speaker 0>Good. Yeah.

00:59:17.725 --> 00:59:18.285
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

00:59:19.645 --> 00:59:21.885
<v Speaker 0>It's a universal law of people watching you

00:59:21.885 --> 00:59:22.605
<v Speaker 0>type.

00:59:23.245 --> 00:59:24.285
<v Speaker 0>No kidding.

00:59:26.045 --> 00:59:28.365
<v Speaker 1>It happens at work too. Like, whenever I'm

00:59:28.365 --> 00:59:30.450
<v Speaker 1>pair programming at work, it's like, I can

00:59:30.450 --> 00:59:31.970
<v Speaker 1>type just fine when I'm at my desk

00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:33.730
<v Speaker 1>alone. As soon as I'm pair programming and

00:59:33.730 --> 00:59:35.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the keyboard, it's like I can't

00:59:35.410 --> 00:59:36.370
<v Speaker 1>type anything.

00:59:36.609 --> 00:59:37.330
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:41.170
<v Speaker 1>I believe when I developed this, I was

00:59:41.170 --> 00:59:43.810
<v Speaker 1>using Debian, so it should work.

00:59:51.585 --> 00:59:52.305
<v Speaker 1>That

00:59:53.185 --> 00:59:54.225
<v Speaker 1>actually go through.

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:08.180
<v Speaker 0>What's your fail code and users?

01:00:10.635 --> 01:00:12.555
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. That might be it.

01:00:13.115 --> 01:00:14.635
<v Speaker 1>It's user.

01:00:16.715 --> 01:00:19.435
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Probably why. So you need to do

01:00:19.835 --> 01:00:20.555
<v Speaker 0>users

01:00:21.755 --> 01:00:22.955
<v Speaker 0>dot user.

01:00:25.755 --> 01:00:26.555
<v Speaker 1>There you go. Alright.

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:27.880
<v Speaker 1>So

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:29.960
<v Speaker 1>oh, I need to look this up. It's

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.400
<v Speaker 1>been a while. You can type

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.480
<v Speaker 0>ID in the group name, or you can

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.480
<v Speaker 0>just cat slash Etsy slash

01:00:39.945 --> 01:00:42.265
<v Speaker 1>So there we have our test group down

01:00:42.265 --> 01:00:42.825
<v Speaker 1>there.

01:00:46.185 --> 01:00:46.905
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.

01:00:57.410 --> 01:00:58.290
<v Speaker 1>Nano

01:00:58.690 --> 01:00:59.490
<v Speaker 1>action

01:01:00.450 --> 01:01:02.530
<v Speaker 1>user dot add

01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:05.410
<v Speaker 1>the parameters for this guy.

01:01:09.795 --> 01:01:11.395
<v Speaker 1>Get my focus back.

01:01:13.315 --> 01:01:14.835
<v Speaker 1>Full name, test

01:01:15.155 --> 01:01:15.955
<v Speaker 1>user,

01:01:19.075 --> 01:01:20.275
<v Speaker 1>slash

01:01:20.435 --> 01:01:21.954
<v Speaker 1>home slash test,

01:01:23.769 --> 01:01:24.730
<v Speaker 1>username,

01:01:25.930 --> 01:01:26.809
<v Speaker 1>test,

01:01:26.809 --> 01:01:29.050
<v Speaker 1>and then go to shell

01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:32.330
<v Speaker 1>s h.

01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:34.010
<v Speaker 1>And

01:01:34.329 --> 01:01:36.730
<v Speaker 1>you should also be able to

01:01:37.434 --> 01:01:39.515
<v Speaker 1>use a dot group, add it in a

01:01:39.515 --> 01:01:40.635
<v Speaker 1>follow-up action.

01:01:41.994 --> 01:01:42.955
<v Speaker 1>Username

01:01:43.115 --> 01:01:43.915
<v Speaker 1>test

01:01:44.875 --> 01:01:45.755
<v Speaker 1>group

01:01:47.115 --> 01:01:47.994
<v Speaker 1>test.

01:01:49.914 --> 01:01:52.880
<v Speaker 1>So we've already created our group, so should

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:54.400
<v Speaker 1>just kinda skip over that because that's already

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.960
<v Speaker 1>done. Then we'll add a test user, set

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.400
<v Speaker 1>its values,

01:01:58.400 --> 01:01:59.600
<v Speaker 1>and then we should be able to add

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:00.720
<v Speaker 1>it to the user group.

01:02:07.035 --> 01:02:09.835
<v Speaker 1>Oh, and we did have a failure. Alright.

01:02:13.755 --> 01:02:15.595
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I wonder

01:02:16.770 --> 01:02:17.570
<v Speaker 1>okay.

01:02:17.570 --> 01:02:18.690
<v Speaker 1>This might be something I need to go

01:02:18.690 --> 01:02:20.050
<v Speaker 1>back to fix. I think I made

01:02:20.930 --> 01:02:22.370
<v Speaker 1>I think it has something to do maybe

01:02:22.370 --> 01:02:23.490
<v Speaker 1>with the summarize.

01:02:24.610 --> 01:02:26.130
<v Speaker 0>Well, I mean, the summarize is just saying

01:02:26.130 --> 01:02:28.290
<v Speaker 0>it doesn't know how to describe what action

01:02:28.290 --> 01:02:29.010
<v Speaker 0>it performed.

01:02:29.755 --> 01:02:31.915
<v Speaker 0>I attached a few dash v's onto that,

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:33.835
<v Speaker 0>and we'll probably see an error message.

01:02:39.595 --> 01:02:41.515
<v Speaker 0>User mod Okay. So it's your user mod

01:02:41.515 --> 01:02:42.715
<v Speaker 0>command doesn't exist.

01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh, okay.

01:02:51.350 --> 01:02:53.190
<v Speaker 0>That makes Is user mod installed?

01:02:53.350 --> 01:02:55.190
<v Speaker 0>Because on Debian, I don't think that's a

01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.510
<v Speaker 0>default.

01:02:56.055 --> 01:02:56.775
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:02:57.575 --> 01:02:58.375
<v Speaker 1>It's

01:03:00.135 --> 01:03:01.975
<v Speaker 0>Oh, it is. Yeah. It is.

01:03:02.295 --> 01:03:04.055
<v Speaker 1>It might Scroll up again.

01:03:05.175 --> 01:03:05.575
<v Speaker 1>Or

01:03:07.415 --> 01:03:09.095
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'll just run it. Yeah.

01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:12.500
<v Speaker 0>Oh, user

01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:15.540
<v Speaker 0>yeah. Debian is add user instead of user

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:17.860
<v Speaker 0>oh, no. Invalid shell.

01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:19.940
<v Speaker 0>See, with Linux, it's weird because you get

01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:21.860
<v Speaker 0>user add or add user depending on the

01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:22.340
<v Speaker 0>distro.

01:03:22.835 --> 01:03:25.635
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. But that's actually complaining about invalid shell

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:26.435
<v Speaker 0>SH.

01:03:26.674 --> 01:03:28.914
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if I just come here and

01:03:28.914 --> 01:03:30.195
<v Speaker 1>fully path it.

01:03:30.674 --> 01:03:32.115
<v Speaker 0>Why do you need to provide the shell

01:03:32.115 --> 01:03:32.914
<v Speaker 0>for user add?

01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:37.670
<v Speaker 1>You actually might not need to. I need

01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:39.430
<v Speaker 1>to double Oh, this is for the user

01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:42.470
<v Speaker 0>shell. Right? Not the location shell. Okay. Okay.

01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:43.110
<v Speaker 0>Gotcha.

01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:45.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And this may also be something of

01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:47.910
<v Speaker 1>I I implement I think the first system

01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:49.030
<v Speaker 1>I did was

01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:50.390
<v Speaker 1>FreeBSD.

01:03:50.549 --> 01:03:51.990
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of this might have come

01:03:51.645 --> 01:03:52.445
<v Speaker 1>FreeBSD

01:03:52.445 --> 01:03:54.365
<v Speaker 1>where whenever you add a user and it

01:03:54.365 --> 01:03:56.125
<v Speaker 1>walks you through, like, its user ad script

01:03:56.125 --> 01:03:57.885
<v Speaker 1>or the options, you do have to specify

01:03:57.885 --> 01:03:58.685
<v Speaker 1>a shell.

01:03:58.845 --> 01:04:00.525
<v Speaker 1>That kinda comes back to some of the

01:04:00.525 --> 01:04:03.245
<v Speaker 1>difficulty with supporting multiple platforms is

01:04:04.530 --> 01:04:06.770
<v Speaker 1>my general philosophy is try to think of,

01:04:06.770 --> 01:04:08.450
<v Speaker 1>like, a base set of functionality that goes

01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:09.970
<v Speaker 1>across all the platforms.

01:04:11.970 --> 01:04:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't.

01:04:14.690 --> 01:04:17.890
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So it still failed. So

01:04:17.515 --> 01:04:19.835
<v Speaker 1>it might just be, something I need to

01:04:19.835 --> 01:04:21.595
<v Speaker 1>dig deeper in. Exists.

01:04:22.715 --> 01:04:23.355
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:04:25.435 --> 01:04:26.955
<v Speaker 1>You want to add a user to this

01:04:26.955 --> 01:04:27.275
<v Speaker 1>group,

01:04:27.994 --> 01:04:29.275
<v Speaker 1>So it might just be the way it's

01:04:29.275 --> 01:04:30.810
<v Speaker 1>get assembled on Debian.

01:04:32.170 --> 01:04:34.650
<v Speaker 0>Maybe the plan step doesn't

01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:36.890
<v Speaker 0>check the group properly.

01:04:37.930 --> 01:04:38.730
<v Speaker 1>Possibly.

01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:40.810
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if I take the group out.

01:04:48.705 --> 01:04:50.625
<v Speaker 1>Nope. Still fails.

01:04:51.025 --> 01:04:53.425
<v Speaker 0>User add group test exists if you want

01:04:53.425 --> 01:04:55.025
<v Speaker 0>to add this user to the group test.

01:04:55.025 --> 01:04:58.030
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. We can fix that later. Yeah.

01:05:00.589 --> 01:05:02.190
<v Speaker 0>Although, I've got a feature request for you

01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:03.790
<v Speaker 0>now based on that manifest.

01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:04.910
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:06.910
<v Speaker 0>We'll pop it back over again.

01:05:07.150 --> 01:05:09.150
<v Speaker 0>Something that would be really cool. You know

01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:10.910
<v Speaker 0>how we like, we we define the user

01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:11.470
<v Speaker 0>dot group,

01:05:12.405 --> 01:05:14.085
<v Speaker 0>whereas that was a test group, and then

01:05:14.085 --> 01:05:16.165
<v Speaker 0>we define the user username. But then we

01:05:16.165 --> 01:05:18.245
<v Speaker 0>have the user group action, which actually consumes

01:05:18.245 --> 01:05:19.605
<v Speaker 0>both of those properties.

01:05:19.845 --> 01:05:22.245
<v Speaker 0>Instead of duplicating the test username with the

01:05:22.245 --> 01:05:23.525
<v Speaker 0>test group name, it'd be good if we

01:05:23.525 --> 01:05:25.925
<v Speaker 0>could reference other actions within the manifest and

01:05:25.925 --> 01:05:26.805
<v Speaker 0>pull out outputs.

01:05:27.339 --> 01:05:28.940
<v Speaker 0>That'd be a really cool feature.

01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:30.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. It would.

01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:35.020
<v Speaker 0>There's something to get you thinking about, you

01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:37.420
<v Speaker 0>know, as you ease into 2025.

01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:40.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah.

01:05:43.099 --> 01:05:45.075
<v Speaker 1>Just as another mention because earlier, we had

01:05:45.075 --> 01:05:46.195
<v Speaker 1>talked about providers,

01:05:46.195 --> 01:05:49.395
<v Speaker 1>user users also use kinda like and groups

01:05:49.395 --> 01:05:51.795
<v Speaker 1>use the same, like, provider syntax,

01:05:51.795 --> 01:05:53.395
<v Speaker 1>and that actually may be some of the

01:05:53.395 --> 01:05:55.235
<v Speaker 1>problem we're facing here is because

01:05:55.890 --> 01:05:58.369
<v Speaker 1>I believe I originally wrote this on Debian,

01:05:58.369 --> 01:05:59.490
<v Speaker 1>but it might have been

01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:02.609
<v Speaker 1>Arch. I might have been running Arch when

01:06:02.609 --> 01:06:03.250
<v Speaker 1>I did.

01:06:04.369 --> 01:06:06.690
<v Speaker 1>But we just have one overarching Linux user

01:06:06.690 --> 01:06:09.055
<v Speaker 1>provider, which probably is not

01:06:09.215 --> 01:06:11.375
<v Speaker 1>what we should do. We should probably find

01:06:11.375 --> 01:06:13.375
<v Speaker 1>a way to better separate that because some

01:06:13.375 --> 01:06:15.615
<v Speaker 1>are user ads, some are user mod,

01:06:16.015 --> 01:06:18.175
<v Speaker 1>try to use whatever is available on the

01:06:18.175 --> 01:06:20.630
<v Speaker 1>base system, which is another thing where it

01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:23.190
<v Speaker 1>comes into the struggle of supporting multiple platforms

01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:23.910
<v Speaker 1>is

01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:27.350
<v Speaker 1>also wanna make sure whatever we use is

01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:29.350
<v Speaker 1>available on the base system on a fresh

01:06:29.350 --> 01:06:31.510
<v Speaker 1>installation because of, like, David's use case of

01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:32.870
<v Speaker 1>he refreshes a laptop.

01:06:38.795 --> 01:06:41.435
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So we've showed packages,

01:06:41.755 --> 01:06:42.635
<v Speaker 0>users,

01:06:42.635 --> 01:06:43.355
<v Speaker 0>groups,

01:06:43.915 --> 01:06:44.875
<v Speaker 0>variants,

01:06:44.875 --> 01:06:47.530
<v Speaker 0>where clauses. I mean, we're still only scratching

01:06:47.530 --> 01:06:49.690
<v Speaker 0>the surface of things Comtrya could do.

01:06:50.410 --> 01:06:53.050
<v Speaker 0>You know, you can do pulling GET repositories,

01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:54.490
<v Speaker 0>binaries from Github.

01:06:54.970 --> 01:06:56.490
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I think maybe we could just go

01:06:56.490 --> 01:06:58.490
<v Speaker 0>over the documentation for files, and then we

01:06:58.490 --> 01:07:00.250
<v Speaker 0>could have a better chat about the future

01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:01.210
<v Speaker 0>of of Comtrya.

01:07:01.635 --> 01:07:03.315
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I think we should also talk about

01:07:03.315 --> 01:07:05.715
<v Speaker 1>the git too. The the git integration, especially

01:07:05.715 --> 01:07:07.475
<v Speaker 1>since that has kinda changed.

01:07:08.275 --> 01:07:10.355
<v Speaker 1>We'll start with files and directories.

01:07:10.435 --> 01:07:10.995
<v Speaker 1>So,

01:07:12.995 --> 01:07:15.315
<v Speaker 1>this is actually missing some documentation that I

01:07:15.315 --> 01:07:17.010
<v Speaker 1>just discovered about a week or two ago,

01:07:17.010 --> 01:07:18.450
<v Speaker 1>and I've opened up an issue.

01:07:18.770 --> 01:07:21.170
<v Speaker 1>We do have more stuff available for directories

01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:23.170
<v Speaker 1>that is implemented. It's just not in the

01:07:23.170 --> 01:07:24.050
<v Speaker 1>documentation.

01:07:24.610 --> 01:07:26.770
<v Speaker 1>But we have these file and directory options.

01:07:26.770 --> 01:07:28.850
<v Speaker 1>We can do file copies,

01:07:28.850 --> 01:07:31.330
<v Speaker 1>download link, remove. Unarchive

01:07:31.865 --> 01:07:33.705
<v Speaker 1>is a rather newer one.

01:07:34.425 --> 01:07:36.025
<v Speaker 1>We have some of the same functionality with

01:07:36.025 --> 01:07:38.585
<v Speaker 1>directories. We can create a directory. We we

01:07:38.585 --> 01:07:39.785
<v Speaker 1>can copy. We can delete.

01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:44.920
<v Speaker 1>And we have the listing.

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:46.120
<v Speaker 1>One

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:48.360
<v Speaker 1>special thing, and David will correct me if

01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:49.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm wrong here.

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:52.280
<v Speaker 1>With these file actions, you need to have,

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:54.120
<v Speaker 1>like, a files directory

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:54.920
<v Speaker 1>colocated

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:56.040
<v Speaker 1>with your manifest.

01:07:57.355 --> 01:07:58.795
<v Speaker 0>I hate it so much.

01:07:59.275 --> 01:08:01.755
<v Speaker 0>But, yes, that is a current restriction

01:08:01.995 --> 01:08:03.195
<v Speaker 0>or constraint.

01:08:03.195 --> 01:08:05.435
<v Speaker 0>And the reason was is that we

01:08:05.995 --> 01:08:09.675
<v Speaker 0>Comtrya will find every TOML and YAML file

01:08:10.270 --> 01:08:13.710
<v Speaker 0>nested in any arbitrary depth of directories to

01:08:13.710 --> 01:08:16.110
<v Speaker 0>the point where if you have YAML configurations

01:08:16.110 --> 01:08:19.149
<v Speaker 0>for any other project, those couldn't be parsed

01:08:19.149 --> 01:08:20.989
<v Speaker 0>and would fail the invocation.

01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:23.550
<v Speaker 0>So instead, we block them out or wrap

01:08:23.550 --> 01:08:25.465
<v Speaker 0>them in a files directory. I would love

01:08:25.465 --> 01:08:27.225
<v Speaker 0>to see that constraint lifted.

01:08:27.865 --> 01:08:29.065
<v Speaker 0>It's just how do we do it in

01:08:29.065 --> 01:08:31.145
<v Speaker 0>a way that a Comtrya manifest can be

01:08:31.145 --> 01:08:31.944
<v Speaker 0>identified

01:08:32.425 --> 01:08:35.305
<v Speaker 0>differently from any other random configuration because we

01:08:35.305 --> 01:08:36.905
<v Speaker 0>do not have any discriminators

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:39.800
<v Speaker 0>that say, hey. I'm a Comtrya manifest in

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:42.119
<v Speaker 0>that YAML, which maybe we have to

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:44.840
<v Speaker 0>admit defeat at some point and make a

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:46.279
<v Speaker 0>breaking change. But

01:08:47.159 --> 01:08:49.159
<v Speaker 0>who knows? I I again, I'd love to

01:08:49.159 --> 01:08:51.534
<v Speaker 0>see that not be a constraint, but it

01:08:51.534 --> 01:08:53.694
<v Speaker 0>is for now. Yeah. I I see where

01:08:53.694 --> 01:08:56.175
<v Speaker 1>it's a pain for people. Me, personally, I

01:08:56.175 --> 01:08:58.094
<v Speaker 1>haven't minded it. I've actually kinda liked it

01:08:58.094 --> 01:08:59.215
<v Speaker 1>where I can separate,

01:08:59.614 --> 01:09:01.694
<v Speaker 1>like, using it at work. One of the

01:09:01.694 --> 01:09:03.854
<v Speaker 1>big things I've really used that files directory

01:09:03.854 --> 01:09:05.135
<v Speaker 1>for is

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:08.439
<v Speaker 1>Stefan,

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:12.520
<v Speaker 1>You know, like, I'll have, like, a Postgres

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:13.320
<v Speaker 1>configuration

01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:15.080
<v Speaker 1>file, or I'll have a

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:18.520
<v Speaker 1>a net plan or one of those files.

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:19.975
<v Speaker 1>And it's like, it's just nice to be

01:09:19.975 --> 01:09:21.815
<v Speaker 1>able to say, okay. Where are those files?

01:09:21.815 --> 01:09:23.895
<v Speaker 1>Oh, they're in the files directory

01:09:23.975 --> 01:09:26.615
<v Speaker 1>with where the manifest are. For me, I

01:09:26.615 --> 01:09:28.775
<v Speaker 1>kinda do like it from an organizational aspect,

01:09:28.775 --> 01:09:30.135
<v Speaker 1>but I see where some of the pain

01:09:30.135 --> 01:09:31.335
<v Speaker 1>is. A

01:09:31.735 --> 01:09:33.975
<v Speaker 1>nice separation between what are Comtrya files and

01:09:33.975 --> 01:09:34.455
<v Speaker 1>what are not.

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:36.840
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:40.520
<v Speaker 0>It's it's it's it's not an immediate problem

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:41.800
<v Speaker 0>and not something I think we have to

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:42.359
<v Speaker 0>solve

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:44.600
<v Speaker 0>until we get more complaints. You know, I

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.040
<v Speaker 0>think there's only been one or two complaints

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:47.880
<v Speaker 0>about that directory needing to be a thing.

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:48.040
<v Speaker 0>But

01:09:48.715 --> 01:09:50.475
<v Speaker 0>one other thing I'll call out about fails

01:09:50.475 --> 01:09:53.274
<v Speaker 0>because it's pertinent to some discussions that we've

01:09:53.274 --> 01:09:54.315
<v Speaker 0>been having recently.

01:09:55.594 --> 01:09:57.515
<v Speaker 0>With Comtrya, we do a lot of command

01:09:57.515 --> 01:09:58.394
<v Speaker 0>execution,

01:09:58.555 --> 01:10:00.635
<v Speaker 0>which we do because it's very easy to,

01:10:00.875 --> 01:10:02.155
<v Speaker 0>you know, elevate privileges.

01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:06.140
<v Speaker 0>All file actions across Windows, Mac, Linux, and

01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:08.539
<v Speaker 0>PSD are actual syscalls,

01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:12.460
<v Speaker 0>which means we can't elevate privileges, which means

01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:14.300
<v Speaker 0>eventually you're gonna wanna put something that doesn't

01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:15.420
<v Speaker 0>live in your home directory

01:10:15.995 --> 01:10:17.835
<v Speaker 0>and Comtrya can't handle that unless you run

01:10:17.835 --> 01:10:18.715
<v Speaker 0>it as root.

01:10:18.955 --> 01:10:21.195
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I don't know what the solution

01:10:21.195 --> 01:10:23.195
<v Speaker 0>is there. I know we've talked about I

01:10:23.115 --> 01:10:25.275
<v Speaker 0>suggested maybe going down the pool cat root.

01:10:25.515 --> 01:10:26.955
<v Speaker 0>You know, we could just cheat and set

01:10:26.955 --> 01:10:28.955
<v Speaker 0>UID one, the the binary, which, of course,

01:10:28.955 --> 01:10:31.309
<v Speaker 0>I would never encourage anyone to do. Yeah.

01:10:31.389 --> 01:10:32.750
<v Speaker 0>But there there I think there needs to

01:10:32.829 --> 01:10:35.230
<v Speaker 0>like, if we're gonna say Comtrya has progressed

01:10:35.230 --> 01:10:38.909
<v Speaker 0>beyond dot files to do actual system administration,

01:10:38.909 --> 01:10:40.669
<v Speaker 0>at some point, we need to I mean,

01:10:41.550 --> 01:10:43.550
<v Speaker 1>I would say the simple dump solution would

01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:44.829
<v Speaker 1>be we shell out. I mean,

01:10:46.525 --> 01:10:48.125
<v Speaker 1>that's that's kinda, like, the fallback because we

01:10:48.125 --> 01:10:51.245
<v Speaker 1>can always elevate whenever we shell out, which

01:10:51.245 --> 01:10:52.845
<v Speaker 1>we did not show, but we can also

01:10:52.845 --> 01:10:54.844
<v Speaker 1>show that too real quick.

01:10:55.405 --> 01:10:58.205
<v Speaker 1>What we mean by elevate is

01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:01.080
<v Speaker 1>here in command dot run, as an example,

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:03.400
<v Speaker 1>we have this, like, privileged

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:05.160
<v Speaker 1>key that you can put, and it's a

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:07.160
<v Speaker 1>true or false. It's defaulted false. But if

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:08.280
<v Speaker 1>you set it to true,

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.320
<v Speaker 1>we'll essentially throw a sudo or do s

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:13.640
<v Speaker 1>or run zero in front of your command

01:11:13.985 --> 01:11:16.545
<v Speaker 1>So that way we can elevate privileges

01:11:16.545 --> 01:11:18.145
<v Speaker 1>as that command runs.

01:11:19.585 --> 01:11:21.905
<v Speaker 1>The pull kit one is interesting. The only

01:11:21.905 --> 01:11:23.905
<v Speaker 1>thing I think that's kinda difficult is, like,

01:11:23.905 --> 01:11:26.225
<v Speaker 1>pull kit is not, in my understanding, is

01:11:26.225 --> 01:11:28.429
<v Speaker 1>not available in the base of macOS. So,

01:11:28.429 --> 01:11:29.630
<v Speaker 1>like, if you were to go back to

01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:31.790
<v Speaker 1>macOS and try to stand up a machine

01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:35.070
<v Speaker 1>from scratch from refresh install purely using Comtrya,

01:11:35.389 --> 01:11:36.989
<v Speaker 1>you'll probably hit issues,

01:11:38.909 --> 01:11:41.150
<v Speaker 1>which means to get around that, you would

01:11:41.150 --> 01:11:42.670
<v Speaker 1>have to bootstrap Homebrew yourself.

01:11:43.465 --> 01:11:45.225
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing we didn't mention.

01:11:45.385 --> 01:11:47.065
<v Speaker 1>Some of the package managers,

01:11:47.705 --> 01:11:49.625
<v Speaker 1>Comtrya has the logic to build a bootstrap

01:11:49.625 --> 01:11:51.945
<v Speaker 1>itself. So from from a clean system, whenever

01:11:51.945 --> 01:11:53.465
<v Speaker 1>you do a package install,

01:11:54.745 --> 01:11:58.239
<v Speaker 1>Comtrya will run a bootstrap process for Homebrew

01:11:58.239 --> 01:12:01.119
<v Speaker 1>on macOS, and it should automatically configure Homebrew

01:12:01.119 --> 01:12:02.320
<v Speaker 1>for you so you don't need to do

01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:03.119
<v Speaker 1>that yourself.

01:12:04.159 --> 01:12:05.840
<v Speaker 1>In the case of pull kit, you would

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:06.559
<v Speaker 1>have to

01:12:07.119 --> 01:12:09.840
<v Speaker 1>you kinda lose that functionality to bootstrap Homebrew

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:11.199
<v Speaker 1>yourself

01:12:10.665 --> 01:12:13.784
<v Speaker 1>potentially and pull pull kit because pull kit

01:12:13.784 --> 01:12:16.425
<v Speaker 1>is available in homebrew or some variant of

01:12:16.425 --> 01:12:17.224
<v Speaker 1>pull kit.

01:12:19.545 --> 01:12:22.025
<v Speaker 0>Tricky. Right? There's never an easy solution when

01:12:22.025 --> 01:12:24.810
<v Speaker 0>we start getting into these, you know, expanding

01:12:24.810 --> 01:12:26.969
<v Speaker 0>the scope use cases. But they they are

01:12:26.969 --> 01:12:29.130
<v Speaker 0>things, I think, you know, you and other

01:12:29.130 --> 01:12:30.650
<v Speaker 0>people that use Comtrya would like to see

01:12:30.650 --> 01:12:32.170
<v Speaker 0>solved. But I I don't think there's a

01:12:32.170 --> 01:12:34.969
<v Speaker 0>great answer. No. Other than running it, you

01:12:34.969 --> 01:12:37.835
<v Speaker 0>just sudo it. Just sudo Comtrya. Right? Yeah.

01:12:37.835 --> 01:12:39.114
<v Speaker 1>We just shell out.

01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:41.195
<v Speaker 0>Or we shell out. Yeah. I mean Yeah.

01:12:41.195 --> 01:12:42.475
<v Speaker 0>Maybe that is the answer. I mean, the

01:12:42.475 --> 01:12:43.995
<v Speaker 0>fails are the only time we ever use

01:12:43.995 --> 01:12:46.075
<v Speaker 0>Cisco. Maybe we should just rip it out.

01:12:46.395 --> 01:12:49.195
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Just get rid of the atoms and

01:12:49.195 --> 01:12:51.595
<v Speaker 1>just have it really run the command dot

01:12:51.595 --> 01:12:52.075
<v Speaker 1>execute.

01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:55.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Had a an underneath the hood. And,

01:12:56.950 --> 01:12:58.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean, the good thing is is, right,

01:12:58.790 --> 01:13:01.110
<v Speaker 1>for all these actions, there is an equivalent

01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:03.590
<v Speaker 1>command line program that does it. So

01:13:05.555 --> 01:13:07.074
<v Speaker 0>True. True.

01:13:07.475 --> 01:13:09.795
<v Speaker 0>And I'll make you start Go

01:13:10.115 --> 01:13:12.995
<v Speaker 1>ahead. Alright. So the file and archive, that

01:13:12.995 --> 01:13:14.114
<v Speaker 1>one is rather new.

01:13:14.835 --> 01:13:16.195
<v Speaker 1>This one should allow you to be able

01:13:16.195 --> 01:13:18.114
<v Speaker 1>to pull, like, a tar dot g z,

01:13:18.195 --> 01:13:20.090
<v Speaker 1>and we can uncompress it for you. And

01:13:20.090 --> 01:13:21.369
<v Speaker 1>I believe we can also run it as

01:13:21.369 --> 01:13:23.929
<v Speaker 1>a finalizer on file dot download. I think

01:13:23.929 --> 01:13:26.010
<v Speaker 1>it might be one of the few, like,

01:13:26.010 --> 01:13:27.849
<v Speaker 1>legitimate finalizers we have,

01:13:28.969 --> 01:13:31.290
<v Speaker 1>which something we haven't talked about initializers and

01:13:31.290 --> 01:13:32.570
<v Speaker 1>finalizers. But

01:13:34.575 --> 01:13:36.255
<v Speaker 1>but we should definitely make more use of

01:13:36.255 --> 01:13:36.735
<v Speaker 1>them.

01:13:37.535 --> 01:13:38.415
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. They were

01:13:39.375 --> 01:13:40.815
<v Speaker 0>I don't know. I don't know if it

01:13:40.815 --> 01:13:42.735
<v Speaker 0>was me getting into over engineering land, which

01:13:42.735 --> 01:13:44.575
<v Speaker 0>I am guilty of a lot. You know?

01:13:44.575 --> 01:13:45.935
<v Speaker 0>I was like, I'll try

01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:49.100
<v Speaker 0>it's engineered in a way that it's supposed

01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:50.940
<v Speaker 0>to be easy to add actions and atoms

01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:53.580
<v Speaker 0>and they're separate things and initialize some final

01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:55.739
<v Speaker 0>edges with a way to modify the execution

01:13:55.739 --> 01:13:57.499
<v Speaker 0>chain of the DAG that

01:13:57.739 --> 01:14:00.140
<v Speaker 0>we never really built too much into,

01:14:00.994 --> 01:14:03.474
<v Speaker 0>but maybe in the future. Right? I mean,

01:14:03.474 --> 01:14:05.635
<v Speaker 0>if people don't know they exist, that's okay.

01:14:05.715 --> 01:14:07.395
<v Speaker 0>It's only when you come to build actions

01:14:07.395 --> 01:14:09.635
<v Speaker 0>that those really become more important.

01:14:09.875 --> 01:14:11.235
<v Speaker 0>So Yeah. We'll see.

01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:14.420
<v Speaker 0>But what I'm hoping you know, we can

01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:15.780
<v Speaker 0>talk about get as well. What I'm hoping

01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:17.860
<v Speaker 0>that people see from all of this stuff

01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:20.020
<v Speaker 0>is that, you know, Comtrya is a pretty

01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:22.100
<v Speaker 0>powerful tool, and I'd love to see more

01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:24.580
<v Speaker 0>people helping you out and adding actions and

01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:26.739
<v Speaker 0>opening issues and stuff like that. So but

01:14:26.739 --> 01:14:28.744
<v Speaker 0>before we dive into that more, why don't

01:14:28.744 --> 01:14:30.264
<v Speaker 0>you go through the the Git stuff?

01:14:30.665 --> 01:14:31.385
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

01:14:31.864 --> 01:14:34.105
<v Speaker 1>So I guess the Git stuff needs a

01:14:34.105 --> 01:14:35.864
<v Speaker 1>little bit of history.

01:14:35.864 --> 01:14:38.585
<v Speaker 1>We used to use Git to RS and

01:14:38.585 --> 01:14:39.224
<v Speaker 1>Git sync,

01:14:39.850 --> 01:14:42.489
<v Speaker 1>but it was always a problem child. A

01:14:42.489 --> 01:14:44.730
<v Speaker 1>lot of it was because of OpenSSL.

01:14:45.610 --> 01:14:47.770
<v Speaker 1>We would have people opening up issues, like,

01:14:47.770 --> 01:14:49.930
<v Speaker 1>every few months of saying, hey. I pulled

01:14:49.930 --> 01:14:52.410
<v Speaker 1>down the project, and I can't compile, Comtrya.

01:14:52.410 --> 01:14:54.410
<v Speaker 1>Something's broken. Something's wrong. And it's like,

01:14:55.185 --> 01:14:57.744
<v Speaker 1>do you have the open SSL development dependencies

01:14:57.744 --> 01:14:59.104
<v Speaker 1>installed on your machine?

01:15:02.385 --> 01:15:03.985
<v Speaker 1>No. They don't. And,

01:15:04.945 --> 01:15:06.864
<v Speaker 1>yeah, and I've tried to solve it a

01:15:06.864 --> 01:15:08.224
<v Speaker 1>couple of different ways. But,

01:15:08.989 --> 01:15:09.789
<v Speaker 1>ultimately,

01:15:09.790 --> 01:15:12.269
<v Speaker 1>earlier this year, I came down to

01:15:12.750 --> 01:15:14.750
<v Speaker 1>it's a constant headache for us. Let's just

01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:16.269
<v Speaker 1>rip out git completely,

01:15:16.350 --> 01:15:19.070
<v Speaker 1>and there are some potential avenues.

01:15:19.790 --> 01:15:20.349
<v Speaker 1>But

01:15:20.670 --> 01:15:22.510
<v Speaker 1>at least at the time when I was

01:15:22.275 --> 01:15:23.955
<v Speaker 1>at it, it's like they're not ready yet.

01:15:23.955 --> 01:15:25.955
<v Speaker 1>The big one was another one we would

01:15:25.955 --> 01:15:28.755
<v Speaker 1>also get issues opened up for was how

01:15:28.755 --> 01:15:30.434
<v Speaker 1>come you guys aren't using anything?

01:15:30.515 --> 01:15:32.355
<v Speaker 1>You know, how come you guys aren't using

01:15:32.355 --> 01:15:33.715
<v Speaker 1>Rust TLS? Well,

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:39.239
<v Speaker 1>OpenSSL is a transitive dependency. Like, Comtrya doesn't

01:15:39.239 --> 01:15:41.160
<v Speaker 1>directly pull it in. It's because of the

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Git stuff for the most part is why

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.679
<v Speaker 1>we have OpenSSL.

01:15:44.679 --> 01:15:45.400
<v Speaker 1>And

01:15:45.719 --> 01:15:47.320
<v Speaker 1>so we would mention that, and then they

01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:49.320
<v Speaker 1>would say, alright. Well, why don't you use

01:15:51.145 --> 01:15:54.105
<v Speaker 1>GitOxide or Geeks, which are really kinda two

01:15:54.105 --> 01:15:56.025
<v Speaker 1>two of the same. One is like a

01:15:56.025 --> 01:15:57.945
<v Speaker 1>library. One is the front end,

01:15:58.344 --> 01:16:00.185
<v Speaker 1>which is, for those who don't know, it's

01:16:00.185 --> 01:16:01.305
<v Speaker 1>like a reimplementation

01:16:01.305 --> 01:16:02.265
<v Speaker 1>of Git and Rust.

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:06.400
<v Speaker 1>And I've been tracking that for close to,

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.480
<v Speaker 1>like, two years. I think David has too.

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:11.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like for two years, it was just

01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:15.200
<v Speaker 1>never fully there. Right? It's kinda like one

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:16.000
<v Speaker 1>of those things where,

01:16:16.725 --> 01:16:20.325
<v Speaker 1>from my perspective, the GetOxite project got 85%

01:16:20.325 --> 01:16:22.005
<v Speaker 1>of the way there, but it's that last

01:16:22.005 --> 01:16:22.885
<v Speaker 1>15%

01:16:22.885 --> 01:16:23.765
<v Speaker 1>that's, like,

01:16:24.245 --> 01:16:26.085
<v Speaker 1>where the real hard work comes in.

01:16:26.485 --> 01:16:29.045
<v Speaker 1>It's like my manager says from his days

01:16:29.045 --> 01:16:32.085
<v Speaker 1>working at Microsoft. You know, it's it's

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:34.920
<v Speaker 1>was it the first ninety percent is 10%

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:36.840
<v Speaker 1>of your time, and that last 10 is

01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:38.439
<v Speaker 1>the 90% of your time

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.919
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to software development?

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:41.959
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:44.439
<v Speaker 1>But over

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:45.559
<v Speaker 1>this last fall,

01:16:46.735 --> 01:16:48.495
<v Speaker 1>I went ahead and gave it a shot

01:16:48.495 --> 01:16:51.455
<v Speaker 1>again with Geeks and GitOxide, and I was

01:16:51.455 --> 01:16:53.855
<v Speaker 1>able to kinda bring back some of the

01:16:53.855 --> 01:16:56.095
<v Speaker 1>Git functionality that we had. I don't think

01:16:56.095 --> 01:16:58.735
<v Speaker 1>it's complete one to one, but at least

01:16:58.735 --> 01:16:59.455
<v Speaker 1>we have something.

01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:03.460
<v Speaker 1>The functionality here, you see we have actions

01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:05.220
<v Speaker 1>where you can have an action to call

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:06.180
<v Speaker 1>a git clone.

01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:09.700
<v Speaker 1>This one probably isn't the biggest use of

01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:10.900
<v Speaker 1>the git functionality.

01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:12.954
<v Speaker 1>The biggest one is

01:17:14.235 --> 01:17:16.715
<v Speaker 1>this may break on my machine, but I

01:17:16.715 --> 01:17:19.114
<v Speaker 1>do have a little bit of an example.

01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:30.310
<v Speaker 1>.Com/tc/double

01:17:30.310 --> 01:17:31.430
<v Speaker 1>files.

01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Apply.

01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:35.830
<v Speaker 1>Let me

01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:38.635
<v Speaker 1>take a look at that because this was

01:17:38.635 --> 01:17:40.635
<v Speaker 1>just an experimentation of mine.

01:17:45.915 --> 01:17:47.515
<v Speaker 1>Find something to apply.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I love that functionality. I was sad

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.760
<v Speaker 0>to see it be taken out, but I'm

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:02.200
<v Speaker 0>glad it's back because,

01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:04.680
<v Speaker 0>you know, if you wanna run Comtrya

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:06.680
<v Speaker 0>as a cloud config scrap on a cloud

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:07.160
<v Speaker 0>server,

01:18:07.645 --> 01:18:09.485
<v Speaker 0>You you don't really need to do anything

01:18:09.485 --> 01:18:10.845
<v Speaker 0>except just tell it to run, and I

01:18:10.845 --> 01:18:12.925
<v Speaker 0>can pull all the manifest then, which is

01:18:12.925 --> 01:18:15.565
<v Speaker 0>nice. Yep. Point it to a GitHub registry

01:18:15.565 --> 01:18:18.205
<v Speaker 1>or GitHub repository that has it. Well, not

01:18:18.205 --> 01:18:20.205
<v Speaker 1>just the cloud, but also, I imagine, for

01:18:20.205 --> 01:18:22.125
<v Speaker 1>your personal machines. Right? Like Yep.

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:24.600
<v Speaker 1>You get Git, and then you just point

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:26.360
<v Speaker 1>it, and bam, you have everything.

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:31.640
<v Speaker 0>Nice. And, yeah, it'll pull it if you

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:33.480
<v Speaker 1>have it as a public repository.

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:35.720
<v Speaker 1>I haven't dived too much into what we

01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:38.175
<v Speaker 1>had with GitSync, but I think GitSync handled

01:18:38.175 --> 01:18:39.854
<v Speaker 1>some stuff with credentialing.

01:18:40.175 --> 01:18:43.294
<v Speaker 0>So Handled, yeah, using credentials. It handled,

01:18:44.175 --> 01:18:45.375
<v Speaker 0>pulling branches,

01:18:45.375 --> 01:18:48.735
<v Speaker 0>revisions, tags, a whole bunch of interesting stuff.

01:18:48.735 --> 01:18:51.054
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So we don't have that yet. I

01:18:51.054 --> 01:18:52.335
<v Speaker 1>do plan to get back there.

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:55.440
<v Speaker 1>Right now, it's just a dumb clone on

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:57.679
<v Speaker 1>a public repo is pretty much what you're

01:18:57.679 --> 01:18:59.760
<v Speaker 1>limited to. But at least we have it

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:01.360
<v Speaker 1>back, and we don't have the issues with

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:02.559
<v Speaker 1>OpenSSL.

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:05.440
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I need to ask a question now

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:07.324
<v Speaker 0>because it's staring me in the face, and

01:19:07.324 --> 01:19:09.165
<v Speaker 0>it's annoying me. But can you go back

01:19:09.165 --> 01:19:10.284
<v Speaker 0>to the documentation?

01:19:10.844 --> 01:19:11.565
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:19:11.725 --> 01:19:14.285
<v Speaker 0>You've got pre zero eight seven and then

01:19:14.285 --> 01:19:16.205
<v Speaker 0>post, but the only thing that's different is

01:19:16.205 --> 01:19:18.764
<v Speaker 0>you changed repository to repo URL.

01:19:18.765 --> 01:19:19.485
<v Speaker 0>Why was that?

01:19:21.970 --> 01:19:23.250
<v Speaker 1>To be honest, I think it was just

01:19:23.250 --> 01:19:26.930
<v Speaker 1>as I was bringing back the actions. I

01:19:28.210 --> 01:19:30.050
<v Speaker 1>it was just how I wrote it. I

01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:32.530
<v Speaker 1>could change it now. But but it was

01:19:32.530 --> 01:19:34.850
<v Speaker 1>like, oh oh, I also

01:19:37.175 --> 01:19:39.255
<v Speaker 1>kind of at least at the time when

01:19:39.255 --> 01:19:40.855
<v Speaker 1>I was writing it, yeah, it was just

01:19:40.855 --> 01:19:43.175
<v Speaker 1>something I just did at at the at

01:19:43.175 --> 01:19:44.614
<v Speaker 1>the moment. I wasn't

01:19:45.095 --> 01:19:46.935
<v Speaker 1>really looking at how the prior struct was

01:19:46.935 --> 01:19:47.255
<v Speaker 1>written.

01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:50.989
<v Speaker 1>Also, kinda want a clear differentiator between the

01:19:50.989 --> 01:19:51.550
<v Speaker 1>two.

01:19:53.710 --> 01:19:55.630
<v Speaker 1>And, also, I think one of the things

01:19:55.630 --> 01:19:58.429
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to kinda capture was,

01:19:59.309 --> 01:20:01.309
<v Speaker 1>to me, with how it was before, it

01:20:01.309 --> 01:20:03.934
<v Speaker 1>kinda seemed a little bit GitHub centric.

01:20:04.335 --> 01:20:05.855
<v Speaker 1>And I think it actually did. Like, if

01:20:05.855 --> 01:20:07.934
<v Speaker 1>you didn't provide a a full URL, it

01:20:07.934 --> 01:20:10.255
<v Speaker 1>would just automatically assume GitHub. And it's like,

01:20:10.255 --> 01:20:11.775
<v Speaker 1>I kinda want it to seem a little

01:20:11.775 --> 01:20:13.215
<v Speaker 1>bit more universal if you have, like, a

01:20:13.215 --> 01:20:16.014
<v Speaker 1>public repository on, like, Bitbucket or GitLab or

01:20:16.014 --> 01:20:16.255
<v Speaker 1>something.

01:20:17.790 --> 01:20:19.310
<v Speaker 1>And to me, I thought that that just

01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:21.229
<v Speaker 1>kinda defined it a little bit better.

01:20:22.830 --> 01:20:25.389
<v Speaker 0>Nice. And, yeah, we don't append GitHub.

01:20:25.389 --> 01:20:27.630
<v Speaker 1>So if you do this, it'll probably fail

01:20:27.630 --> 01:20:29.630
<v Speaker 1>because it won't know to default to GitHub.

01:20:29.975 --> 01:20:31.175
<v Speaker 1>So you do have to give it the

01:20:31.175 --> 01:20:33.094
<v Speaker 1>fully qualified, like, URL.

01:20:35.175 --> 01:20:36.534
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Makes sense.

01:20:38.215 --> 01:20:40.615
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I think we've covered most of the

01:20:40.615 --> 01:20:42.615
<v Speaker 0>use cases. I'm gonna pop us back to

01:20:42.615 --> 01:20:44.949
<v Speaker 0>biggie face mode, and we can talk about

01:20:44.949 --> 01:20:46.150
<v Speaker 0>what comes next.

01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:48.469
<v Speaker 0>So

01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:50.309
<v Speaker 0>Comtrya's cool.

01:20:50.710 --> 01:20:52.469
<v Speaker 0>There are lots of things with it. Make

01:20:52.469 --> 01:20:54.550
<v Speaker 0>it a little bit easier. Yep. Try to

01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:56.389
<v Speaker 0>be able to toggle to play more options.

01:20:57.034 --> 01:20:57.675
<v Speaker 0>But

01:20:58.155 --> 01:20:59.755
<v Speaker 0>why don't you tell us, like,

01:21:01.034 --> 01:21:03.755
<v Speaker 0>do you think you will be adding or

01:21:03.755 --> 01:21:05.594
<v Speaker 0>changing that and try over the next three,

01:21:05.594 --> 01:21:06.954
<v Speaker 0>nine, twelve months?

01:21:07.195 --> 01:21:08.875
<v Speaker 0>And what issues do you see people talking

01:21:08.875 --> 01:21:10.395
<v Speaker 0>about? What changes are people looking for?

01:21:11.530 --> 01:21:14.250
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So I haven't really thought far enough

01:21:14.250 --> 01:21:16.090
<v Speaker 1>out for twelve months. I guess I should

01:21:16.090 --> 01:21:18.730
<v Speaker 1>probably talk about kinda how I imagine releases

01:21:18.730 --> 01:21:20.090
<v Speaker 1>going forward first.

01:21:22.409 --> 01:21:24.935
<v Speaker 1>So in the past with Comtrya, we've kind

01:21:24.935 --> 01:21:26.695
<v Speaker 1>of always just released whenever we felt it

01:21:26.695 --> 01:21:28.855
<v Speaker 1>it it was kinda like the Linux kernel.

01:21:28.855 --> 01:21:30.855
<v Speaker 1>Right? You know, Linus Torvald is famous for,

01:21:30.855 --> 01:21:33.975
<v Speaker 1>like, version numbers don't necessarily mean anything special.

01:21:33.975 --> 01:21:35.575
<v Speaker 1>He just cuts a new release whenever he

01:21:35.575 --> 01:21:36.695
<v Speaker 1>feels it's ready. Right?

01:21:37.270 --> 01:21:38.230
<v Speaker 1>There's

01:21:38.230 --> 01:21:39.910
<v Speaker 1>no, like, strict standards. And that's kinda how

01:21:39.910 --> 01:21:41.590
<v Speaker 1>Comtrya was for a while. A lot of

01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:43.030
<v Speaker 1>that was because, you know, we would get

01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:45.110
<v Speaker 1>busy, and we'd go months without doing anything,

01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:46.790
<v Speaker 1>and then we would come back, implement a

01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:47.270
<v Speaker 0>lot of stuff.

01:21:50.205 --> 01:21:52.845
<v Speaker 1>And that can kinda present some problems where

01:21:52.845 --> 01:21:54.525
<v Speaker 1>if it doesn't look like work is getting

01:21:54.525 --> 01:21:55.085
<v Speaker 1>done,

01:21:55.725 --> 01:21:58.045
<v Speaker 1>the project can look dead even though maybe

01:21:58.045 --> 01:21:58.844
<v Speaker 1>it's not.

01:21:59.805 --> 01:22:03.085
<v Speaker 1>So with having kinda taken over more responsibility

01:22:03.085 --> 01:22:05.110
<v Speaker 1>for the project, my goal is to try

01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:07.429
<v Speaker 1>to do a release every quarter.

01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:10.230
<v Speaker 1>So I just recently, last week or the

01:22:10.230 --> 01:22:11.590
<v Speaker 1>week before, did the

01:22:12.870 --> 01:22:14.950
<v Speaker 1>zero point nine point one release, and I'm

01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:16.950
<v Speaker 1>looking for the next release to be sometime

01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:18.390
<v Speaker 1>in spring. I'm trying to line it up

01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:19.030
<v Speaker 1>with the seasons.

01:22:20.725 --> 01:22:22.324
<v Speaker 1>Reason for that is,

01:22:22.565 --> 01:22:24.165
<v Speaker 1>one, it gives me a goal. If it's

01:22:24.165 --> 01:22:26.405
<v Speaker 1>open ended, I'll just go months and months

01:22:26.405 --> 01:22:28.645
<v Speaker 1>without thinking about it. Whereas if I kinda

01:22:28.645 --> 01:22:29.764
<v Speaker 1>set a deadline,

01:22:30.885 --> 01:22:32.965
<v Speaker 1>at least I have I I set a

01:22:32.965 --> 01:22:33.684
<v Speaker 1>deadline,

01:22:33.925 --> 01:22:35.770
<v Speaker 1>for myself, then I have something to work

01:22:35.770 --> 01:22:36.330
<v Speaker 1>towards.

01:22:36.890 --> 01:22:38.570
<v Speaker 1>And right now, I'm only kinda thinking one

01:22:38.570 --> 01:22:39.530
<v Speaker 1>release ahead.

01:22:40.890 --> 01:22:41.770
<v Speaker 1>But the

01:22:42.170 --> 01:22:44.170
<v Speaker 1>big things I'm hoping to get done within

01:22:44.170 --> 01:22:45.690
<v Speaker 1>the next release is,

01:22:46.650 --> 01:22:48.330
<v Speaker 1>I have quite a few issues here, and

01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:51.805
<v Speaker 1>I've been organizing them by stones. And for

01:22:51.805 --> 01:22:53.645
<v Speaker 1>anybody who wants to contribute, you don't need

01:22:53.645 --> 01:22:55.405
<v Speaker 1>to worry about that. That's just me organizing

01:22:55.405 --> 01:22:57.005
<v Speaker 1>what I think I can get done in

01:22:57.005 --> 01:22:58.525
<v Speaker 1>a three month period or hope to get

01:22:58.525 --> 01:23:00.445
<v Speaker 1>done, and some of it'll change because I

01:23:00.445 --> 01:23:02.525
<v Speaker 1>haven't groomed it. I may have added too

01:23:02.525 --> 01:23:02.925
<v Speaker 1>much stuff.

01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:06.230
<v Speaker 1>But the big one is service management, which

01:23:06.230 --> 01:23:08.070
<v Speaker 1>has been a topic we have talked about

01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:09.510
<v Speaker 1>a lot on and off over the last

01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:10.389
<v Speaker 1>two years.

01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:15.590
<v Speaker 1>For those who aren't familiar, that'd be like

01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:17.829
<v Speaker 1>on Linux, you're a system CTL with system

01:23:17.829 --> 01:23:18.150
<v Speaker 1>d.

01:23:19.665 --> 01:23:22.385
<v Speaker 1>MacOS, I'll probably do brew because brew does

01:23:22.385 --> 01:23:23.744
<v Speaker 1>do service management,

01:23:24.945 --> 01:23:27.264
<v Speaker 1>but could do launch d directly. But I

01:23:27.264 --> 01:23:28.864
<v Speaker 1>don't see that being too

01:23:28.945 --> 01:23:31.184
<v Speaker 1>of or done too often. And then, of

01:23:31.184 --> 01:23:32.784
<v Speaker 1>course, for the BSDs,

01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:35.800
<v Speaker 1>That's probably gonna be the biggest one I

01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:37.720
<v Speaker 1>plan to do during the next release, but

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:40.280
<v Speaker 1>we do have some cool issues that I'm

01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:42.840
<v Speaker 1>hoping we can also get to also.

01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:45.160
<v Speaker 1>There's a feature for

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:48.200
<v Speaker 1>downloading binaries directly from GitHub that I think

01:23:48.135 --> 01:23:49.334
<v Speaker 1>could be useful.

01:23:51.335 --> 01:23:51.734
<v Speaker 1>There

01:23:53.335 --> 01:23:55.494
<v Speaker 1>was an interesting one brought up of

01:23:55.735 --> 01:23:58.375
<v Speaker 1>having Comtrya be able to kinda modify and

01:23:58.375 --> 01:23:59.574
<v Speaker 1>manage CronTab.

01:24:00.054 --> 01:24:00.934
<v Speaker 0>Oh, nice. Yeah.

01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:03.220
<v Speaker 1>That would be a pretty cool one to

01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:05.780
<v Speaker 0>do. One I do hope to do so

01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:07.860
<v Speaker 1>as we talked about providers earlier,

01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:11.380
<v Speaker 1>if you have different package install actions,

01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:12.900
<v Speaker 1>you would have to

01:24:14.475 --> 01:24:16.795
<v Speaker 1>specify that provider in each one. I would

01:24:16.795 --> 01:24:19.114
<v Speaker 1>like to do something with the configuration file

01:24:19.114 --> 01:24:21.275
<v Speaker 1>to kinda do, like, an overarching context so

01:24:21.275 --> 01:24:23.435
<v Speaker 1>that way you could have a configuration file

01:24:23.435 --> 01:24:25.914
<v Speaker 1>and say, hey. Whenever you see package install,

01:24:26.155 --> 01:24:26.635
<v Speaker 1>let's

01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:28.790
<v Speaker 1>go ahead and override it so we don't

01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:30.469
<v Speaker 1>have to do it in every single action.

01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:33.270
<v Speaker 1>Kinda like what we do with privilege

01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:35.989
<v Speaker 1>escalation,

01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:37.990
<v Speaker 1>which we could go back and talk on

01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:39.430
<v Speaker 1>that if you want to because that's kind

01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:39.990
<v Speaker 1>of interesting.

01:24:43.225 --> 01:24:45.705
<v Speaker 1>Another one that I would like I don't

01:24:45.705 --> 01:24:47.065
<v Speaker 1>know if I'll get it done this next

01:24:47.065 --> 01:24:48.585
<v Speaker 1>release, but I like to do some more

01:24:48.585 --> 01:24:49.224
<v Speaker 1>research.

01:24:49.465 --> 01:24:51.465
<v Speaker 1>It's an old issue that we've had for

01:24:51.465 --> 01:24:52.985
<v Speaker 1>a while, and we have talked about it

01:24:52.985 --> 01:24:55.145
<v Speaker 1>a little bit was adding an update flag

01:24:55.145 --> 01:24:56.185
<v Speaker 1>to package install.

01:24:56.940 --> 01:24:57.980
<v Speaker 1>And

01:24:58.060 --> 01:24:59.820
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of that boils down

01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:02.540
<v Speaker 1>to the name is somewhat incorrect.

01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:04.300
<v Speaker 1>It's not so much update. It seemed more

01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:05.579
<v Speaker 1>like version pending.

01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:08.300
<v Speaker 1>But that's an interesting one because

01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:10.060
<v Speaker 1>this kinda goes back to

01:25:10.655 --> 01:25:13.775
<v Speaker 1>kinda like not all platforms support everything. Same

01:25:13.775 --> 01:25:16.095
<v Speaker 1>thing with, like, package providers. Right? Not every

01:25:16.095 --> 01:25:19.615
<v Speaker 1>package not every package manager necessarily has version

01:25:19.615 --> 01:25:20.015
<v Speaker 1>pending.

01:25:23.489 --> 01:25:24.689
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I mean,

01:25:25.889 --> 01:25:27.889
<v Speaker 0>like, there's been a lot of requests like

01:25:27.889 --> 01:25:29.889
<v Speaker 0>that over the years. But in my head,

01:25:29.889 --> 01:25:30.210
<v Speaker 0>it doesn't

01:25:30.929 --> 01:25:32.369
<v Speaker 0>I could be convinced, but it doesn't make

01:25:32.369 --> 01:25:33.889
<v Speaker 0>sense because I always feel like once you've

01:25:33.889 --> 01:25:35.010
<v Speaker 0>run Comtrya,

01:25:35.010 --> 01:25:36.885
<v Speaker 0>you know, at Pacman,

01:25:37.925 --> 01:25:40.085
<v Speaker 0>you know, ports, whatever, they already then

01:25:40.565 --> 01:25:42.244
<v Speaker 0>it's their job to maintain that state going

01:25:42.244 --> 01:25:44.565
<v Speaker 0>forward. Comtrya is stateless. So it's like, why

01:25:44.565 --> 01:25:47.125
<v Speaker 0>would you not just run at upgrade? Yeah.

01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:51.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And I can kinda see that too.

01:25:51.060 --> 01:25:52.420
<v Speaker 1>Or then, like, yeah,

01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:55.620
<v Speaker 1>we're using deviant on set postgres servers on

01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:56.500
<v Speaker 1>deviant.

01:25:57.540 --> 01:25:59.780
<v Speaker 1>They do offer different versions of postgres. Like,

01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:00.980
<v Speaker 1>postgres. Right? And

01:26:02.415 --> 01:26:05.055
<v Speaker 1>you do that by it's like PostgresQL

01:26:05.055 --> 01:26:07.615
<v Speaker 1>tag 15, and that's Postgres 15. But if

01:26:07.615 --> 01:26:08.655
<v Speaker 1>you want 16,

01:26:09.455 --> 01:26:11.455
<v Speaker 1>you can do tag 16. But if you

01:26:11.455 --> 01:26:12.975
<v Speaker 1>just do PostgresQL,

01:26:12.975 --> 01:26:13.935
<v Speaker 1>that'll pull 16.

01:26:14.650 --> 01:26:17.050
<v Speaker 1>There's tech 14 for version 14.

01:26:17.450 --> 01:26:18.090
<v Speaker 1>So

01:26:18.650 --> 01:26:20.730
<v Speaker 1>some package managers, you you can just control

01:26:20.730 --> 01:26:21.449
<v Speaker 1>it by

01:26:22.330 --> 01:26:24.010
<v Speaker 1>the package name functionally. So

01:26:26.595 --> 01:26:28.195
<v Speaker 1>like I said, I don't know if there'll

01:26:28.195 --> 01:26:29.955
<v Speaker 1>be any movement on that one, but something

01:26:29.955 --> 01:26:31.155
<v Speaker 1>I like to do a little bit more

01:26:31.155 --> 01:26:33.235
<v Speaker 1>research to see if there is something. Like,

01:26:33.235 --> 01:26:36.995
<v Speaker 1>I know with Homebrew having recently put Comtrya

01:26:36.995 --> 01:26:37.475
<v Speaker 1>Brew,

01:26:40.630 --> 01:26:44.230
<v Speaker 1>Brew formula and core can also build masters.

01:26:44.230 --> 01:26:45.990
<v Speaker 1>So instead of being tagged to a version,

01:26:45.990 --> 01:26:48.230
<v Speaker 1>it could also do, like, the head. K.

01:26:48.230 --> 01:26:51.110
<v Speaker 1>That might be kinda useful, especially for something

01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:53.910
<v Speaker 1>like Comtrya where three months between releases.

01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:56.355
<v Speaker 1>Right? There's stuff that may be in the

01:26:56.355 --> 01:26:57.155
<v Speaker 1>documentation

01:26:57.155 --> 01:26:58.995
<v Speaker 1>or stuff that's available in the main branch

01:26:58.995 --> 01:27:00.995
<v Speaker 1>that just isn't released yet into a formal

01:27:00.995 --> 01:27:01.715
<v Speaker 1>release.

01:27:03.955 --> 01:27:04.675
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

01:27:06.195 --> 01:27:08.115
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I mean, we're now at an hour

01:27:08.115 --> 01:27:10.020
<v Speaker 0>and a half, So I think it's about

01:27:10.020 --> 01:27:11.380
<v Speaker 0>time to wrap this up.

01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:15.300
<v Speaker 0>But being that Comtrya is such a cool

01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:16.820
<v Speaker 0>project and there is a bit of momentum

01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:17.940
<v Speaker 0>now, you know, I'd love for us to

01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:19.300
<v Speaker 0>be able to get back together in three

01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:21.585
<v Speaker 0>months and, you know, just go over the

01:27:21.585 --> 01:27:23.745
<v Speaker 0>the new features and, again, talk about what's

01:27:23.745 --> 01:27:25.585
<v Speaker 0>coming next so people can stay up to

01:27:25.585 --> 01:27:27.425
<v Speaker 0>date with things. But, you know, before

01:27:27.905 --> 01:27:29.905
<v Speaker 0>I'd just say thanks for, you know, taking

01:27:29.905 --> 01:27:30.865
<v Speaker 0>a good chunk of time out of your

01:27:30.865 --> 01:27:32.705
<v Speaker 0>day to sit here and, you know, check

01:27:32.705 --> 01:27:33.905
<v Speaker 0>and try it with me. It's been a

01:27:33.905 --> 01:27:35.869
<v Speaker 0>whole lot of fun. Uh-huh. It's no problem.

01:27:35.869 --> 01:27:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's been fun. I also got to

01:27:37.710 --> 01:27:39.229
<v Speaker 1>learn a couple new things.

01:27:40.429 --> 01:27:41.789
<v Speaker 1>It's always good.

01:27:42.110 --> 01:27:44.349
<v Speaker 1>I said, one one thing that's been really

01:27:44.349 --> 01:27:46.349
<v Speaker 1>good is that, yeah, while while you've been

01:27:46.349 --> 01:27:48.594
<v Speaker 1>busy, David and Stefan

01:27:48.915 --> 01:27:51.874
<v Speaker 1>still are pretty instrumental because there's parts

01:27:52.195 --> 01:27:53.955
<v Speaker 1>there's parts that I still have questions about.

01:27:53.955 --> 01:27:55.155
<v Speaker 1>Like, I've been all over the code base

01:27:55.155 --> 01:27:56.755
<v Speaker 1>now, but there's still things I don't quite

01:27:56.755 --> 01:27:58.675
<v Speaker 1>understand. And the fact that you and Stefan

01:27:58.675 --> 01:28:01.150
<v Speaker 1>are kinda always there whenever I have a

01:28:01.150 --> 01:28:03.389
<v Speaker 1>question and being able to answer it and

01:28:03.389 --> 01:28:04.989
<v Speaker 1>help point me in the right direction has

01:28:04.989 --> 01:28:06.670
<v Speaker 1>been a huge help over the past few

01:28:06.670 --> 01:28:07.789
<v Speaker 1>months, especially.

01:28:08.829 --> 01:28:09.550
