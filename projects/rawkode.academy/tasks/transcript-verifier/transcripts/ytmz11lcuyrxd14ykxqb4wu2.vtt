00:02:08.305 --> 00:02:11.025
<v Speaker 0>Hello, and welcome back to the Rawkode Academy.

00:02:11.025 --> 00:02:13.025
<v Speaker 0>I'm your host, David Flanagan,

00:02:13.025 --> 00:02:15.025
<v Speaker 0>also known as Rawkode across the Internet.

00:02:15.425 --> 00:02:17.825
<v Speaker 0>Today, we are taking a look at an

00:02:17.825 --> 00:02:20.465
<v Speaker 0>open source, painless, self hosted Gitea.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.080
<v Speaker 0>Now as always,

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.640
<v Speaker 0>there are important rules. If I suddenly come

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.360
<v Speaker 0>underwater,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.360
<v Speaker 0>tell me early. Do not wait till the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.080
<v Speaker 0>end of the stream. Alright? So give me

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.520
<v Speaker 0>a thumbs up and a chat. Make sure

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.520
<v Speaker 0>that I sound alright. And then today's session

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.560
<v Speaker 0>will just be a whole lot better.

00:02:38.185 --> 00:02:40.825
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's pop over here. I am joined

00:02:40.825 --> 00:02:43.225
<v Speaker 0>by the project lead and founder of Gitea,

00:02:43.225 --> 00:02:44.905
<v Speaker 0>Matty. Hey, man. How's it going?

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:47.545
<v Speaker 1>Hey. It's going really well. Thanks for having

00:02:47.545 --> 00:02:49.385
<v Speaker 1>me. Oh, it's my pleasure.

00:02:49.545 --> 00:02:51.600
<v Speaker 0>It is always the highlight of my week

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.800
<v Speaker 0>when I get to sit down and take

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.240
<v Speaker 0>a look at a really cool open source

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.560
<v Speaker 0>project. So today, it's going to be a

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.520
<v Speaker 0>whole lot of fun.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 0>Can you please just give us a little

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.240
<v Speaker 0>bit of an introduction to who you are,

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.400
<v Speaker 0>please?

00:03:03.295 --> 00:03:06.334
<v Speaker 1>Of course. I'm Maddie, also known as tech

00:03:06.334 --> 00:03:09.455
<v Speaker 1>or Technologic in the Gitea community and a

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:12.095
<v Speaker 1>broader open source community as well.

00:03:12.655 --> 00:03:15.535
<v Speaker 1>And I joined Gitea. I was looking at

00:03:15.535 --> 00:03:17.455
<v Speaker 1>my commit history just the other day, and

00:03:17.455 --> 00:03:18.175
<v Speaker 1>I joined in

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.890
<v Speaker 1>2017.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.810
<v Speaker 1>The project started in

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.410
<v Speaker 1>late twenty sixteen.

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.770
<v Speaker 1>And

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.130
<v Speaker 1>we're

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.250
<v Speaker 1>just

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.330
<v Speaker 1>making a way for developers to be able

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.209
<v Speaker 1>to post their own source codes so they

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:32.690
<v Speaker 1>don't have to

00:03:33.435 --> 00:03:36.075
<v Speaker 1>rely on a centralized service or

00:03:36.955 --> 00:03:39.435
<v Speaker 1>be able to self host on something as

00:03:39.435 --> 00:03:41.115
<v Speaker 1>small as a Raspberry Pi.

00:03:41.755 --> 00:03:43.115
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Very, very cool.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.599
<v Speaker 0>Awkward timing, but the building manager was checking

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.599
<v Speaker 0>my door right there. And I've also got

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:52.040
<v Speaker 0>Russell in the chat telling me that the

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.200
<v Speaker 0>sound is okay, but not amazing. Thanks,

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.840
<v Speaker 0>Russell. That that's really helpful.

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.000
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna pop a cable very, very quickly.

00:04:11.215 --> 00:04:13.455
<v Speaker 0>Honestly, audio is the worst thing. I have

00:04:13.455 --> 00:04:14.894
<v Speaker 0>nothing but a hard time trying to get

00:04:14.894 --> 00:04:16.820
<v Speaker 0>right. Russell, let me know if that is

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:17.620
<v Speaker 0>any better.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.940
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Cool. So thank you for introducing yourself

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.740
<v Speaker 0>and telling us a little bit about Gitea.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.220
<v Speaker 0>It's I think it's really cool that we

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.595
<v Speaker 0>have choice when it comes to hosting our

00:04:29.595 --> 00:04:31.354
<v Speaker 0>own get. It's something that I've, you know,

00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:32.794
<v Speaker 0>I've done a few times.

00:04:33.675 --> 00:04:34.875
<v Speaker 0>And it's just nice to be able to

00:04:35.115 --> 00:04:36.875
<v Speaker 0>I'm just not a complete magpie when it

00:04:36.875 --> 00:04:38.155
<v Speaker 0>comes to this stuff. Like, whenever there's a

00:04:38.155 --> 00:04:39.675
<v Speaker 0>cool open source project, I just feel the

00:04:39.675 --> 00:04:41.354
<v Speaker 0>need to, like, just go and play with

00:04:41.354 --> 00:04:43.360
<v Speaker 0>it. And Gitea has been on that list

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.640
<v Speaker 0>for a while, and I haven't actually got

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.160
<v Speaker 0>a run to it. So today, we're gonna

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.520
<v Speaker 0>have a bit of a a centric look

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.600
<v Speaker 0>at me just kinda kick the tires on

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.560
<v Speaker 0>it and get started.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.400
<v Speaker 0>I also love that you said that it

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.000
<v Speaker 0>runs on a a Raspberry Pi.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.920
<v Speaker 0>You know, I think we're in a really

00:04:55.985 --> 00:04:58.465
<v Speaker 0>cool age of technology where we all have

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:00.385
<v Speaker 0>these tiny little computers set in well, mines

00:05:00.385 --> 00:05:02.065
<v Speaker 0>are mostly in drawers, but I hope other

00:05:02.065 --> 00:05:03.985
<v Speaker 0>people's aren't always sitting in drawers. But, you

00:05:03.985 --> 00:05:05.825
<v Speaker 0>know, we do have the ability to, you

00:05:05.825 --> 00:05:07.185
<v Speaker 0>know, stick in a little bit of power

00:05:07.185 --> 00:05:08.625
<v Speaker 0>in these things, sell tape them onto the

00:05:08.625 --> 00:05:10.225
<v Speaker 0>wall, and run really cool stuff at our

00:05:10.225 --> 00:05:12.540
<v Speaker 0>homes, you know, like, Gitea and Home Assistant

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.780
<v Speaker 0>and all these other things. So it's cool

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.860
<v Speaker 0>that that is a kind of, you know,

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.020
<v Speaker 0>not a focus, but, like, it's something that

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.340
<v Speaker 0>the Gitea community has embraced and adopted.

00:05:22.835 --> 00:05:24.675
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Awesome. So

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:27.155
<v Speaker 0>you said that the Gitea project has been

00:05:27.155 --> 00:05:29.235
<v Speaker 0>around since 2016 and you joined in 2017.

00:05:29.235 --> 00:05:30.595
<v Speaker 0>I thought you were the founder, so I

00:05:30.595 --> 00:05:32.835
<v Speaker 0>made a mistake there. So Oh, sorry.

00:05:32.835 --> 00:05:33.315
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:05:34.195 --> 00:05:36.995
<v Speaker 1>I I'm the project owner and

00:05:37.075 --> 00:05:39.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm a project owner and leads.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.680
<v Speaker 1>So we have, yearly elections, and I've been,

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.760
<v Speaker 1>voted

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.800
<v Speaker 1>for to, be the steward of the projects,

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.680
<v Speaker 1>one of the three, owners, for the past

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.320
<v Speaker 1>couple of years.

00:05:52.935 --> 00:05:53.495
<v Speaker 1>It's

00:05:54.695 --> 00:05:58.295
<v Speaker 1>it was a project started by, Lanny Zhao,

00:05:59.815 --> 00:06:02.215
<v Speaker 1>also known as, Lanny on GitHub.

00:06:02.535 --> 00:06:03.255
<v Speaker 1>And,

00:06:03.735 --> 00:06:07.110
<v Speaker 1>so we've been, working together for quite some

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.830
<v Speaker 1>time now.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:09.510
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.390
<v Speaker 0>What are some of the like, is is

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.270
<v Speaker 0>there a mission statement, Rawkode? Is there, like,

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.070
<v Speaker 0>something that you're just driving forward to and

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.390
<v Speaker 0>pushing to? Like, you mentioned governance and elections

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:21.764
<v Speaker 0>and stuff. I mean, that sounds like a

00:06:21.764 --> 00:06:23.285
<v Speaker 0>very mature project.

00:06:23.285 --> 00:06:24.565
<v Speaker 0>So there must be some sort of mission

00:06:24.565 --> 00:06:28.085
<v Speaker 0>statement in involved here. Yeah. Definitely. With

00:06:28.085 --> 00:06:29.525
<v Speaker 1>close to 32,000

00:06:29.525 --> 00:06:31.685
<v Speaker 1>stars, we're one of the top

00:06:32.164 --> 00:06:34.485
<v Speaker 1>500 projects on GitHub or something.

00:06:34.884 --> 00:06:35.604
<v Speaker 1>And we're

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.350
<v Speaker 1>moving towards being able to actually self host

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.590
<v Speaker 1>ourselves. We have the infrastructure set up. It's

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:41.150
<v Speaker 1>just,

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.310
<v Speaker 1>takes some time to extract

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.870
<v Speaker 1>tens of thousands of issues and pull requests

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.870
<v Speaker 1>from the GitHub ecosystem.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.990
<v Speaker 1>And so our mission statement is really just

00:06:51.715 --> 00:06:52.595
<v Speaker 1>giving

00:06:52.595 --> 00:06:55.475
<v Speaker 1>control back to developers to be able to

00:06:57.555 --> 00:06:59.875
<v Speaker 1>post the code wherever they want. And

00:07:01.875 --> 00:07:02.115
<v Speaker 1>yeah.

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:05.520
<v Speaker 0>That's a good mission statement. I don't think

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.880
<v Speaker 0>you I don't think you need much more

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.400
<v Speaker 0>than that. Yeah. It's,

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.240
<v Speaker 1>yeah. I have,

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.840
<v Speaker 1>like, I have I get to running locally

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.919
<v Speaker 1>just on my NAS, and

00:07:16.485 --> 00:07:19.525
<v Speaker 1>I have it mirroring thousands of repositories just

00:07:19.525 --> 00:07:20.325
<v Speaker 1>because

00:07:21.285 --> 00:07:22.565
<v Speaker 1>repositories

00:07:22.565 --> 00:07:24.005
<v Speaker 1>come and go and just so that I

00:07:24.005 --> 00:07:26.485
<v Speaker 1>have that archive. So then if I'm working

00:07:26.485 --> 00:07:27.845
<v Speaker 1>on something, there's

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.460
<v Speaker 1>that Node. Js package from 2015 that disappeared

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.980
<v Speaker 1>or whatever, and

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:35.820
<v Speaker 1>it's there and

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.980
<v Speaker 1>all of my projects still

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.380
<v Speaker 1>run as expected.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:41.260
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:07:42.265 --> 00:07:43.865
<v Speaker 0>We're we're gonna dive into the hands on

00:07:43.865 --> 00:07:45.865
<v Speaker 0>component in just a second or maybe a

00:07:45.865 --> 00:07:47.225
<v Speaker 0>a minute or two, but I wanna ask

00:07:47.225 --> 00:07:49.545
<v Speaker 0>you just a couple more questions. So

00:07:49.705 --> 00:07:52.025
<v Speaker 0>on the thumbnail for this session and on

00:07:52.025 --> 00:07:54.505
<v Speaker 0>the Gitea website, it says, like, a painless

00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:56.600
<v Speaker 0>self hosted Git solution.

00:07:56.919 --> 00:07:58.199
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.080
<v Speaker 1>That's so hopefully Yeah. Sorry. Go for it.

00:08:04.919 --> 00:08:05.319
<v Speaker 1>That's

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.759
<v Speaker 1>I'm I'm not gonna tempt the demo gods

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:11.525
<v Speaker 1>today, but that is really what we strive

00:08:11.525 --> 00:08:12.725
<v Speaker 1>for that

00:08:13.205 --> 00:08:17.285
<v Speaker 1>we provide options for any technical skill level,

00:08:17.285 --> 00:08:17.765
<v Speaker 1>whether

00:08:18.324 --> 00:08:20.245
<v Speaker 1>you're a beginner or you've

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.860
<v Speaker 1>been writing Linux kernels

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.020
<v Speaker 1>the Linux kernel for, I guess, thirty one

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.900
<v Speaker 1>years now that you can set it up

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.420
<v Speaker 1>and it'll run.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:32.179
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.034
<v Speaker 0>Well, I was gonna say, I mean, it's

00:08:34.034 --> 00:08:35.794
<v Speaker 0>bold, and I like that. But I have

00:08:35.794 --> 00:08:37.154
<v Speaker 0>a I do have a natural talent for

00:08:37.154 --> 00:08:38.674
<v Speaker 0>breaking things, so I really hope that I

00:08:38.674 --> 00:08:41.235
<v Speaker 0>don't break anything today. I'm sure I won't.

00:08:41.875 --> 00:08:45.555
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Last question just because I think I've

00:08:45.555 --> 00:08:48.010
<v Speaker 0>said this publicly on Twitter before, and, like,

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.770
<v Speaker 0>I feel like Git is the version control

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:52.089
<v Speaker 0>system that we're stuck with, but not necessarily

00:08:52.089 --> 00:08:53.770
<v Speaker 0>the one we did want. And I was

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.850
<v Speaker 0>curious, what are your thoughts on Git? I

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:56.650
<v Speaker 0>mean, you must be quite

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.290
<v Speaker 0>you you must work with Git literally day

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:01.435
<v Speaker 0>in and day out. So, I mean, you

00:09:01.435 --> 00:09:02.475
<v Speaker 0>happy with it? Do you see that as

00:09:02.475 --> 00:09:03.595
<v Speaker 0>being an evolution?

00:09:03.754 --> 00:09:05.274
<v Speaker 0>While we still be using Git in five

00:09:05.274 --> 00:09:06.394
<v Speaker 0>or ten years time?

00:09:07.595 --> 00:09:10.154
<v Speaker 1>That's a very interesting question. Yeah. I've I

00:09:10.154 --> 00:09:11.995
<v Speaker 1>definitely work with Git every day,

00:09:12.714 --> 00:09:13.675
<v Speaker 1>and

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.050
<v Speaker 1>it it's,

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:21.370
<v Speaker 1>yeah. No. It's great. I love it. But

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:22.330
<v Speaker 1>there's,

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:25.850
<v Speaker 1>getting down into, like, the depths of things

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:28.330
<v Speaker 1>of being able to write your own forge.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:29.930
<v Speaker 1>There's

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:30.975
<v Speaker 1>some nuances that you have to be aware

00:09:30.975 --> 00:09:31.375
<v Speaker 1>of.

00:09:32.255 --> 00:09:35.215
<v Speaker 1>And I also understand that the user experience

00:09:35.215 --> 00:09:37.935
<v Speaker 1>isn't necessarily the best from command line. And

00:09:37.935 --> 00:09:38.415
<v Speaker 1>so

00:09:39.135 --> 00:09:40.655
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the problems that we're trying

00:09:40.655 --> 00:09:43.135
<v Speaker 1>to solve with Gitea is being able to

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:45.329
<v Speaker 1>if you don't use the command line at

00:09:45.329 --> 00:09:46.769
<v Speaker 1>all, that's fine. You can do everything in

00:09:46.769 --> 00:09:47.810
<v Speaker 1>the web editor.

00:09:48.209 --> 00:09:50.850
<v Speaker 1>And we have the full, Monaco,

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.410
<v Speaker 1>editor in,

00:09:53.889 --> 00:09:56.485
<v Speaker 1>the browser. Nice. And,

00:09:57.285 --> 00:09:59.685
<v Speaker 1>yeah. But I also like,

00:10:00.404 --> 00:10:04.084
<v Speaker 1>I'm I love, source control of all kinds.

00:10:05.524 --> 00:10:06.964
<v Speaker 1>I I I

00:10:07.524 --> 00:10:10.404
<v Speaker 1>I package Mercurial for NICS OS, and I

00:10:10.404 --> 00:10:13.500
<v Speaker 1>just sent a patch to Alpine just yesterday

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.220
<v Speaker 1>for the update to Curio. And so I

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:16.780
<v Speaker 1>think

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.180
<v Speaker 1>yeah. No. It's it's

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.540
<v Speaker 1>so fascinating,

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:26.540
<v Speaker 1>source control because and how, different source control

00:10:27.095 --> 00:10:28.055
<v Speaker 1>systems

00:10:28.615 --> 00:10:29.415
<v Speaker 1>approach

00:10:29.735 --> 00:10:31.175
<v Speaker 1>different things. Even

00:10:32.935 --> 00:10:34.295
<v Speaker 1>and

00:10:35.095 --> 00:10:37.575
<v Speaker 1>Git have their differences, and

00:10:38.455 --> 00:10:41.255
<v Speaker 1>some people like to compare them directly. But

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.260
<v Speaker 1>just even how things are stored.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.300
<v Speaker 1>Like, Git has their PAC system, and does

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.580
<v Speaker 1>as well. And

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:49.540
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And I I grew up with CVS

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.100
<v Speaker 1>and Subversion.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:54.580
<v Speaker 1>And so,

00:10:55.755 --> 00:10:58.555
<v Speaker 1>you know, Git and Curiel are a brush

00:10:58.715 --> 00:11:00.075
<v Speaker 1>a breath of fresh air.

00:11:00.955 --> 00:11:02.795
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I do not miss

00:11:03.195 --> 00:11:04.875
<v Speaker 0>either of those two tools.

00:11:05.435 --> 00:11:07.355
<v Speaker 0>I mean, Subversion felt like such a breath

00:11:07.355 --> 00:11:08.875
<v Speaker 0>of fresh air back in the day when

00:11:08.875 --> 00:11:10.155
<v Speaker 0>we adopted it and switched it.

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:14.190
<v Speaker 0>But, you know, the centralized model, like, it

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:17.150
<v Speaker 0>was just very painful pushing and locking fails

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.550
<v Speaker 0>and all. Yeah. Never again, hopefully.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:21.790
<v Speaker 0>And I I actually you know, I I

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:24.865
<v Speaker 0>I do really, like, get my only major

00:11:24.865 --> 00:11:26.945
<v Speaker 0>gripe with it is the identity model, and

00:11:26.945 --> 00:11:29.185
<v Speaker 0>then it's literally just a text email address.

00:11:29.425 --> 00:11:31.425
<v Speaker 0>And that's it. I mean, obviously, we can

00:11:31.425 --> 00:11:33.265
<v Speaker 0>sign stuff now, and that's very cool,

00:11:33.585 --> 00:11:35.345
<v Speaker 0>but you still need that email address.

00:11:35.665 --> 00:11:37.105
<v Speaker 0>I went through a phase of just changing

00:11:37.105 --> 00:11:39.820
<v Speaker 0>my email address to, like, bell@microsoft.gov

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.660
<v Speaker 0>and pushing stuff to GitHub. And, like, nothing

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.980
<v Speaker 0>stops you. Right? Because why?

00:11:45.339 --> 00:11:46.459
<v Speaker 0>Cool. And lastly

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.660
<v Speaker 0>on that, I experiment with a lot of

00:11:49.899 --> 00:11:51.899
<v Speaker 0>prototype

00:11:50.975 --> 00:11:52.975
<v Speaker 0>version control systems that have come out. There's

00:11:52.975 --> 00:11:54.735
<v Speaker 0>lots of them out there. Some really cool

00:11:54.735 --> 00:11:56.175
<v Speaker 0>Rust based ones that I'll try and put

00:11:56.175 --> 00:11:57.535
<v Speaker 0>the link to at the end. But then

00:11:57.535 --> 00:11:58.655
<v Speaker 0>every time I play with it for more

00:11:58.655 --> 00:12:00.095
<v Speaker 0>than ten minutes, I'm like,

00:12:00.575 --> 00:12:03.135
<v Speaker 0>I'm just wasting time now because GET is

00:12:03.135 --> 00:12:06.370
<v Speaker 0>ubiquitous. Right? Like, it's just literally everywhere. I

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:07.650
<v Speaker 0>don't think we can get away from it

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:08.530
<v Speaker 0>now. So

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:09.410
<v Speaker 0>alright.

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:11.410
<v Speaker 0>That's enough of my preferences.

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:13.490
<v Speaker 0>I think we should dive into the hands

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:15.810
<v Speaker 0>on component and let's get get to you

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:17.490
<v Speaker 0>running on some on some metal.

00:12:18.335 --> 00:12:21.215
<v Speaker 1>Excellent. Let's do this. Alright.

00:12:22.255 --> 00:12:25.535
<v Speaker 0>I have my screen shared and Russell, if

00:12:25.535 --> 00:12:27.455
<v Speaker 0>you swear again in the chat, I'm gonna

00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:29.935
<v Speaker 0>ban you. Visual source safe. Come on.

00:12:31.055 --> 00:12:33.089
<v Speaker 0>May as well say Pearforce or is it

00:12:33.089 --> 00:12:35.010
<v Speaker 0>Preforce or Perforce? I can never remember.

00:12:37.089 --> 00:12:38.850
<v Speaker 0>We have the Gitea website. So if you

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:40.370
<v Speaker 0>want to check out anything that we're doing

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:41.170
<v Speaker 0>today,

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:44.209
<v Speaker 0>I can remember how to zoom, you can

00:12:44.209 --> 00:12:45.010
<v Speaker 0>go to

00:12:45.285 --> 00:12:47.204
<v Speaker 0>gitea.io.

00:12:49.125 --> 00:12:51.045
<v Speaker 0>I mean, it looks familiar right off the

00:12:51.045 --> 00:12:54.165
<v Speaker 0>bat, and I'm guessing that's an intentional decision

00:12:54.165 --> 00:12:55.764
<v Speaker 0>by the team to make it familiar to

00:12:55.764 --> 00:12:56.245
<v Speaker 0>developers.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:58.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So,

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:00.770
<v Speaker 1>it's,

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.810
<v Speaker 1>reminiscent of, GitHub,

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.730
<v Speaker 1>and that's just,

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:09.410
<v Speaker 1>the user experience is familiar with one system.

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:12.850
<v Speaker 1>And so just transitioning over to ours is

00:13:13.325 --> 00:13:16.205
<v Speaker 1>they know where to expect things, and they

00:13:16.205 --> 00:13:19.645
<v Speaker 1>understand the concepts without having to relearn something

00:13:19.645 --> 00:13:20.445
<v Speaker 1>entirely.

00:13:21.085 --> 00:13:21.805
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:13:22.525 --> 00:13:23.965
<v Speaker 0>If I click on try,

00:13:25.165 --> 00:13:27.005
<v Speaker 0>this is oh, this is the test instance.

00:13:27.005 --> 00:13:28.765
<v Speaker 0>I guess I want to go to docs

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.000
<v Speaker 0>for today. Right? Yeah. Cool. Exactly.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.120
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We have a whole bunch of installation

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.320
<v Speaker 0>options here.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.640
<v Speaker 0>Do you have a preference?

00:13:40.615 --> 00:13:43.655
<v Speaker 1>So probably just from binary

00:13:43.895 --> 00:13:44.695
<v Speaker 1>is

00:13:45.415 --> 00:13:46.295
<v Speaker 1>likely the

00:13:47.015 --> 00:13:48.615
<v Speaker 1>is one of the most common

00:13:49.095 --> 00:13:49.975
<v Speaker 1>ways.

00:13:50.055 --> 00:13:52.615
<v Speaker 1>Just download the binary from our

00:13:53.015 --> 00:13:54.535
<v Speaker 1>release site and

00:13:54.855 --> 00:13:56.990
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Hit the ground running. Well, before I

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:58.590
<v Speaker 0>I do that then, you know,

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:01.550
<v Speaker 0>Gitea is written in Go. Right? Is that

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:02.030
<v Speaker 0>right?

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:05.150
<v Speaker 1>That's right. Yeah. And then we have our

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:07.950
<v Speaker 1>presentation layer is a combination of

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.590
<v Speaker 1>some Node. Js packages and

00:14:11.805 --> 00:14:13.404
<v Speaker 1>UCSS frameworks.

00:14:13.485 --> 00:14:14.685
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Cool.

00:14:15.004 --> 00:14:15.725
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:14:15.964 --> 00:14:17.964
<v Speaker 0>Because I haven't I have tried to install,

00:14:17.964 --> 00:14:20.045
<v Speaker 0>you know, GitLab is obviously an open source

00:14:20.045 --> 00:14:21.565
<v Speaker 0>Git solutions as well.

00:14:22.524 --> 00:14:24.285
<v Speaker 0>But that was the most painful week of

00:14:24.285 --> 00:14:25.964
<v Speaker 0>my life, I think, trying to

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.700
<v Speaker 0>it's multiple services, but really they're distributed as,

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.420
<v Speaker 0>like, one big massive thing. Yeah.

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.300
<v Speaker 0>I lost some sleep that week for sure.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.700
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting that you say that because that's

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.860
<v Speaker 1>actually how I came to Gitea as well

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:40.500
<v Speaker 1>is

00:14:41.365 --> 00:14:44.404
<v Speaker 1>I was responsible for managing GitLab and

00:14:45.045 --> 00:14:47.845
<v Speaker 1>no shade to them because they've done wonderful

00:14:47.845 --> 00:14:49.845
<v Speaker 1>things with their installer. It's just

00:14:50.485 --> 00:14:52.485
<v Speaker 1>the omnibus now. But

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:55.610
<v Speaker 1>at that time, it was I was looking

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:56.730
<v Speaker 1>for alternatives.

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:57.370
<v Speaker 1>And,

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:01.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah, I found Gitea, and my life has

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:03.210
<v Speaker 1>changed for the better since.

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:05.930
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I I love that you mentioned the

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:07.995
<v Speaker 0>omnibus because back in the day when I

00:15:08.075 --> 00:15:09.515
<v Speaker 0>I'd I'd talked to Kubernetes

00:15:09.675 --> 00:15:10.955
<v Speaker 0>really early,

00:15:11.675 --> 00:15:13.035
<v Speaker 0>and one of the first things I tried

00:15:13.035 --> 00:15:15.195
<v Speaker 0>to deploy to it was our own GitLab

00:15:15.195 --> 00:15:17.115
<v Speaker 0>instance for the organization I was working for

00:15:17.115 --> 00:15:19.435
<v Speaker 0>at the time and the Omnibus Helm chart

00:15:19.435 --> 00:15:21.860
<v Speaker 0>that just deployed everything. And I was like,

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.180
<v Speaker 0>how do I, like, upgrade one component? And

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.180
<v Speaker 0>the answer was just like, no. You don't.

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.300
<v Speaker 0>And I'm like, alright.

00:15:27.779 --> 00:15:30.339
<v Speaker 0>So this thing's shipping Postgres and Redis and

00:15:30.339 --> 00:15:33.225
<v Speaker 0>14 Ruby applications as this. Yeah.

00:15:33.625 --> 00:15:34.825
<v Speaker 0>I should have the toys at the prom

00:15:34.825 --> 00:15:36.105
<v Speaker 0>and just walked away.

00:15:37.065 --> 00:15:38.745
<v Speaker 0>But we're not gonna have that problem today.

00:15:38.745 --> 00:15:40.745
<v Speaker 0>So what have I prepared in advance? Well,

00:15:40.745 --> 00:15:44.025
<v Speaker 0>nothing as always the answer. We have a

00:15:45.305 --> 00:15:47.305
<v Speaker 0>oh, my shells kicked me off. Alright.

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.820
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully, that's the same IP address. Nice.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:55.420
<v Speaker 0>We have Equinix metal, bare metal machine. We've

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:56.780
<v Speaker 0>got some cores. We've got some RAM. I

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.900
<v Speaker 0>haven't done anything to this. This is a

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.485
<v Speaker 0>Ubuntu box. It's a vanilla Ubuntu install. There's

00:16:02.485 --> 00:16:04.565
<v Speaker 0>nothing special done here in advance.

00:16:04.885 --> 00:16:07.285
<v Speaker 0>So we're gonna go through the process of

00:16:07.285 --> 00:16:09.765
<v Speaker 0>installing Gitea on this machine. And I'm really

00:16:09.765 --> 00:16:11.045
<v Speaker 0>hoping that Matt is not gonna shut around

00:16:11.045 --> 00:16:13.685
<v Speaker 0>and go, oh, Ubuntu. Sorry. Not today.

00:16:14.005 --> 00:16:15.365
<v Speaker 0>Ubuntu is gonna be okay. Right?

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:18.730
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna be definitely great. And just as

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:21.529
<v Speaker 1>a disclaimer from our side, Equinix is a

00:16:21.529 --> 00:16:22.810
<v Speaker 1>sponsor of the project.

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:26.410
<v Speaker 0>Oh, are they? But Oh, nice. We recommend

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:27.450
<v Speaker 1>them otherwise

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:29.290
<v Speaker 1>even if they didn't sponsor us.

00:16:30.655 --> 00:16:32.895
<v Speaker 0>I I actually used to work for Equinix

00:16:32.895 --> 00:16:34.495
<v Speaker 0>Bell, so I do have access to the

00:16:34.495 --> 00:16:35.215
<v Speaker 0>machines.

00:16:35.855 --> 00:16:37.455
<v Speaker 0>And I use them for everything because they're

00:16:37.455 --> 00:16:39.695
<v Speaker 0>just they're fantastic. Why spin up a VM

00:16:39.695 --> 00:16:42.495
<v Speaker 0>with one core and 512 mega RAM when

00:16:42.495 --> 00:16:44.095
<v Speaker 0>you could just spin up a monster machine

00:16:44.095 --> 00:16:45.215
<v Speaker 0>and get so much more done?

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:48.340
<v Speaker 1>Exactly. Yeah. Okay.

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.020
<v Speaker 0>So I didn't know that, but that's very

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.620
<v Speaker 0>cool that they sponsored the project.

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.420
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's work through this then. So we're

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.820
<v Speaker 0>gonna download the right file. This is AMD

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:57.540
<v Speaker 0>sixty four.

00:17:00.815 --> 00:17:02.815
<v Speaker 0>This is gonna be really easy, isn't it?

00:17:02.815 --> 00:17:03.535
<v Speaker 0>I mean,

00:17:04.815 --> 00:17:06.734
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming I could probably just run Gitea

00:17:06.734 --> 00:17:08.335
<v Speaker 0>help. Yeah. There we go.

00:17:09.295 --> 00:17:09.934
<v Speaker 0>So

00:17:10.175 --> 00:17:11.695
<v Speaker 0>is this is one of the really special

00:17:11.695 --> 00:17:14.589
<v Speaker 0>things about Go as well. And I'm not

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:17.150
<v Speaker 0>a daily Go developer. I do typically prefer

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:19.390
<v Speaker 0>to write things in Rust, but the static

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:21.470
<v Speaker 0>compilation of Go binaries and the ability to

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:23.390
<v Speaker 0>ship them everywhere is very, very nice. I've

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:23.869
<v Speaker 0>got to say.

00:17:27.204 --> 00:17:28.565
<v Speaker 0>I mean, is that as done?

00:17:29.045 --> 00:17:30.485
<v Speaker 0>Did I just run Gitea?

00:17:31.365 --> 00:17:32.804
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:17:33.205 --> 00:17:34.164
<v Speaker 1>I mean, you could,

00:17:34.405 --> 00:17:37.925
<v Speaker 1>but it's recommended to use a separate Unix

00:17:37.925 --> 00:17:39.365
<v Speaker 1>user just because it

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:43.350
<v Speaker 1>if you're running with open SSHD,

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:46.229
<v Speaker 1>it will take over your authorized key files.

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:49.029
<v Speaker 1>So there's a bunch of copy and paste

00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:50.789
<v Speaker 1>things that you can do to create the,

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:52.149
<v Speaker 1>new,

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Git user. And then also just general,

00:17:55.035 --> 00:17:57.115
<v Speaker 1>if you're pushing and pulling via SSH, you

00:17:57.115 --> 00:17:58.715
<v Speaker 1>don't want root at

00:17:58.875 --> 00:18:00.075
<v Speaker 1>gitt.com.

00:18:00.075 --> 00:18:02.395
<v Speaker 1>You want to get gitt.com.

00:18:02.715 --> 00:18:04.554
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That makes a lot of sense.

00:18:05.195 --> 00:18:07.610
<v Speaker 0>I guess what I'm curious about right now

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:09.930
<v Speaker 0>is that you mentioned that there's Gitea,

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:12.010
<v Speaker 0>which is a server. It's written in Go.

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.490
<v Speaker 0>You have a front end, which has other

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:16.970
<v Speaker 0>components. I'm assuming there's a database that needs

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:18.730
<v Speaker 0>to be configured or used in some capacity.

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:19.985
<v Speaker 0>So,

00:18:20.145 --> 00:18:22.305
<v Speaker 0>like, does this all ship in a single

00:18:22.305 --> 00:18:23.185
<v Speaker 0>binary?

00:18:23.585 --> 00:18:24.625
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So

00:18:26.225 --> 00:18:27.745
<v Speaker 1>everything's precompiled,

00:18:27.745 --> 00:18:29.585
<v Speaker 1>you can use SQLite.

00:18:29.665 --> 00:18:30.625
<v Speaker 1>If you have

00:18:30.865 --> 00:18:33.025
<v Speaker 1>database already or if you wanna configure a

00:18:33.025 --> 00:18:33.825
<v Speaker 1>database as well,

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.059
<v Speaker 1>you can do that, MySQL, Postgres,

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.260
<v Speaker 1>MS SQL, if you're a Windows shop.

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.140
<v Speaker 1>But if

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.140
<v Speaker 1>you're just a lone developer,

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:49.780
<v Speaker 1>SQLite is will meet your needs more than

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:50.020
<v Speaker 1>enough.

00:18:50.715 --> 00:18:52.554
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'm I try to encourage people to

00:18:52.554 --> 00:18:55.275
<v Speaker 0>use SQLite a lot more, especially with what

00:18:55.275 --> 00:18:57.515
<v Speaker 0>Ben Johnson's doing now at fly.io

00:18:57.515 --> 00:19:00.315
<v Speaker 0>with LightStream and the ability to kinda, like,

00:19:00.554 --> 00:19:02.635
<v Speaker 0>hook into the rate ahead log and rate

00:19:02.635 --> 00:19:05.674
<v Speaker 0>it to blob storage. It's just absolutely

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:07.450
<v Speaker 0>ridiculous what you can do now with SQLite.

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:10.570
<v Speaker 0>I I actually find myself struggling to reach

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:12.410
<v Speaker 0>for post queries anymore, which was always my

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:13.049
<v Speaker 0>default.

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:14.730
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:18.090
<v Speaker 0>Well, this is really cool. Single binary stuff

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:20.330
<v Speaker 0>makes me happy, especially from an operational point

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:20.570
<v Speaker 0>of view.

00:19:21.835 --> 00:19:24.075
<v Speaker 0>What about other deployment models?

00:19:25.195 --> 00:19:27.115
<v Speaker 0>I couldn't look at the website here, but

00:19:27.115 --> 00:19:28.794
<v Speaker 0>if I wanna run this in a Kubernetes

00:19:28.794 --> 00:19:29.595
<v Speaker 0>cluster

00:19:30.235 --> 00:19:32.395
<v Speaker 1>And we have a Helm chart exactly for

00:19:32.395 --> 00:19:34.875
<v Speaker 1>that. So you can install the Helm chart,

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:39.179
<v Speaker 1>and it comes with, optional dependencies,

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.620
<v Speaker 1>the, Bitnami

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:41.500
<v Speaker 1>database

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:42.940
<v Speaker 1>charts if you,

00:19:44.299 --> 00:19:47.100
<v Speaker 1>want to, use them to spin up a

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:47.659
<v Speaker 1>database.

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:50.195
<v Speaker 1>But, again, it's optional. So if you already

00:19:50.195 --> 00:19:53.395
<v Speaker 1>have a database cluster set up, you can

00:19:53.395 --> 00:19:54.915
<v Speaker 1>point to that. Or,

00:19:55.555 --> 00:19:56.115
<v Speaker 1>if you

00:19:57.315 --> 00:20:00.035
<v Speaker 1>we don't recommend running the SQLite on Kubernetes

00:20:00.035 --> 00:20:02.115
<v Speaker 1>just because, likely, you're

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.799
<v Speaker 1>mounting the files from other NFS or

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.400
<v Speaker 1>whatnot.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.760
<v Speaker 1>So the latency there would be, something to

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.920
<v Speaker 1>worry about, but, you know, it's possible.

00:20:14.565 --> 00:20:15.604
<v Speaker 0>K. Cool.

00:20:16.164 --> 00:20:18.325
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, I'm gonna run through your recommended

00:20:18.325 --> 00:20:20.244
<v Speaker 0>server configuration then.

00:20:21.125 --> 00:20:22.884
<v Speaker 0>I don't even know if get ships by

00:20:22.884 --> 00:20:23.684
<v Speaker 0>default.

00:20:23.684 --> 00:20:25.284
<v Speaker 0>It does. Okay. Nice.

00:20:26.325 --> 00:20:27.924
<v Speaker 0>And next, we're gonna add the get user.

00:20:27.924 --> 00:20:29.365
<v Speaker 0>Like you said, we don't wanna be doing

00:20:29.365 --> 00:20:31.929
<v Speaker 0>root at. So let's grab this.

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:34.730
<v Speaker 0>It's just setting up bash and disable the

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:35.450
<v Speaker 0>password.

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:38.169
<v Speaker 0>And I'm assuming all the repositories within the

00:20:38.169 --> 00:20:41.130
<v Speaker 0>Gitea instance Gitea and Gitea

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:41.690
<v Speaker 0>Gitea and

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:43.929
<v Speaker 0>live in home get. They're just gonna be

00:20:43.929 --> 00:20:46.255
<v Speaker 0>thrown in there. Is that right? That's exactly.

00:20:47.295 --> 00:20:50.335
<v Speaker 1>Actually, in the next set of commands, you'll

00:20:50.335 --> 00:20:50.815
<v Speaker 1>see

00:20:51.695 --> 00:20:54.335
<v Speaker 1>that it's I'm gonna store it all in

00:20:54.495 --> 00:20:57.135
<v Speaker 1>bare lib Gitea. Alright. Okay.

00:20:58.255 --> 00:20:59.375
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's do that.

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:03.249
<v Speaker 0>And then we chill on some stuff.

00:21:05.809 --> 00:21:07.570
<v Speaker 0>But we don't have an any further yet.

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:08.049
<v Speaker 0>Right?

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:10.529
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yes. So if you

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:12.450
<v Speaker 1>the installer

00:21:12.529 --> 00:21:13.970
<v Speaker 1>will auto create it for you.

00:21:16.154 --> 00:21:18.554
<v Speaker 1>So when you, set up Gitea the first

00:21:18.554 --> 00:21:19.115
<v Speaker 1>time,

00:21:19.595 --> 00:21:21.914
<v Speaker 1>installer will be presented to you, or you

00:21:21.914 --> 00:21:24.394
<v Speaker 1>can, hand create the configuration

00:21:24.394 --> 00:21:25.115
<v Speaker 1>file yourself.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.360
<v Speaker 0>Okay. I haven't seen any mention of an

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.359
<v Speaker 0>installer yet. Did I skip a step?

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.039
<v Speaker 1>No.

00:21:34.679 --> 00:21:38.120
<v Speaker 1>So that's that's good to know to include

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:38.679
<v Speaker 1>that.

00:21:39.159 --> 00:21:41.640
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's just skip

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:42.840
<v Speaker 0>over that just now.

00:21:43.355 --> 00:21:44.075
<v Speaker 0>So

00:21:45.355 --> 00:21:46.235
<v Speaker 0>then

00:21:49.995 --> 00:21:52.075
<v Speaker 0>yeah. I really need to stop scamming stuff

00:21:52.075 --> 00:21:53.675
<v Speaker 0>and read things properly. Do I need to

00:21:53.675 --> 00:21:55.435
<v Speaker 0>run git generate secret?

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:59.620
<v Speaker 1>So that will if you're manually generating the

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.500
<v Speaker 1>configuration file, then you'll need to. But otherwise,

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.499
<v Speaker 1>the installer will create that for you.

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:06.499
<v Speaker 0>Alrighty.

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.100
<v Speaker 0>So let's set the work there.

00:22:09.125 --> 00:22:11.045
<v Speaker 0>Copy this to Ben.

00:22:11.365 --> 00:22:14.005
<v Speaker 0>And now we get to decide how to

00:22:14.005 --> 00:22:15.045
<v Speaker 0>manage

00:22:15.045 --> 00:22:15.684
<v Speaker 0>this.

00:22:17.605 --> 00:22:19.925
<v Speaker 0>So this is just to run it, but

00:22:19.925 --> 00:22:22.879
<v Speaker 0>we can use our Linux service. So

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.919
<v Speaker 0>let's do it the nice way.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.679
<v Speaker 0>I like it when software gives me a

00:22:29.679 --> 00:22:31.360
<v Speaker 0>system d unit fail. It makes me very

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:31.679
<v Speaker 0>happy.

00:22:37.785 --> 00:22:38.424
<v Speaker 0>Service.

00:22:39.625 --> 00:22:41.384
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. I'll fix that.

00:22:42.265 --> 00:22:43.625
<v Speaker 0>So this is set up with all the

00:22:43.625 --> 00:22:45.225
<v Speaker 0>defaults that we've just worked on, which is

00:22:45.225 --> 00:22:46.745
<v Speaker 0>the user

00:22:46.905 --> 00:22:48.985
<v Speaker 0>get. Yep. And the group. We didn't add

00:22:48.985 --> 00:22:50.905
<v Speaker 0>a group get that we I'll need to

00:22:50.905 --> 00:22:51.304
<v Speaker 0>add that.

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:56.289
<v Speaker 0>Working directory looks okay.

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:00.209
<v Speaker 0>And

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:03.089
<v Speaker 0>we don't need a database dependency.

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:04.690
<v Speaker 0>I think that's fine

00:23:05.804 --> 00:23:08.364
<v Speaker 0>except for my name because I can't type

00:23:09.325 --> 00:23:10.124
<v Speaker 0>service

00:23:11.804 --> 00:23:12.684
<v Speaker 0>enum

00:23:13.085 --> 00:23:13.884
<v Speaker 0>reload.

00:23:17.005 --> 00:23:17.325
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:19.950
<v Speaker 0>What do you think? That should I add

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:21.150
<v Speaker 0>that group, or do you think we'll be

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:21.710
<v Speaker 0>okay?

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:26.270
<v Speaker 1>Probably best to add that group, actually.

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:29.950
<v Speaker 1>We have one of our maintainers,

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:31.870
<v Speaker 1>John, in the chat, and

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:33.310
<v Speaker 1>he's taking notes.

00:23:35.525 --> 00:23:36.804
<v Speaker 0>Group ad.

00:23:37.445 --> 00:23:38.085
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:23:39.365 --> 00:23:40.085
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

00:23:40.725 --> 00:23:42.885
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I guess the ad user would have

00:23:42.885 --> 00:23:45.125
<v Speaker 1>created it. Oh, fantastic. Did it have a

00:23:45.125 --> 00:23:47.130
<v Speaker 0>flag on it? Oh, it did. Okay. Dash

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:49.050
<v Speaker 0>dash group. Okay. Fantastic.

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:50.810
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:53.370
<v Speaker 0>So we could then run the enable,

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:55.210
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming.

00:24:00.225 --> 00:24:00.945
<v Speaker 0>Tada.

00:24:02.465 --> 00:24:03.424
<v Speaker 1>There we go.

00:24:04.785 --> 00:24:07.105
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I don't need your docs anymore.

00:24:07.345 --> 00:24:07.985
<v Speaker 0>So

00:24:08.145 --> 00:24:09.345
<v Speaker 0>let's grab

00:24:09.745 --> 00:24:11.985
<v Speaker 0>the IP address, which I don't remember, so

00:24:11.985 --> 00:24:12.865
<v Speaker 0>I'll grab from here.

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:15.820
<v Speaker 0>And

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:19.179
<v Speaker 0>it doesn't run on port 80.

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:21.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's not a a privileged

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.300
<v Speaker 1>process, and so it can't listen to anything

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:24.700
<v Speaker 1>below

00:24:26.375 --> 00:24:27.255
<v Speaker 1>1084

00:24:27.415 --> 00:24:29.415
<v Speaker 1>or sorry, ten twenty four.

00:24:31.095 --> 00:24:32.135
<v Speaker 1>By default,

00:24:32.295 --> 00:24:33.895
<v Speaker 1>the port is 3,000.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:39.960
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:45.480
<v Speaker 0>So

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.280
<v Speaker 0>we've got it running

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:49.960
<v Speaker 0>with ease.

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.325
<v Speaker 0>I mean, let's just call it ease because

00:24:52.325 --> 00:24:53.365
<v Speaker 0>all I did was done with a pain.

00:24:53.365 --> 00:24:54.565
<v Speaker 0>We're sticking it our training how to get

00:24:54.565 --> 00:24:56.485
<v Speaker 0>a file. So this is pretty sweet.

00:24:56.885 --> 00:24:59.125
<v Speaker 0>Now I've got a web interface to configure

00:24:59.125 --> 00:25:00.885
<v Speaker 0>this, but I'm assuming this is just for

00:25:00.885 --> 00:25:02.405
<v Speaker 0>ease of use. Right? This is part of

00:25:02.405 --> 00:25:04.805
<v Speaker 0>your painless mission. If I wanted to, I

00:25:04.805 --> 00:25:07.440
<v Speaker 0>could write that any file and probably skip

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.080
<v Speaker 0>this step altogether. Is that Exactly.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.640
<v Speaker 1>In our Docker file, we have

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.880
<v Speaker 1>a series of environment variables that will actually

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.520
<v Speaker 1>it'll take those environment variables and generate the

00:25:20.404 --> 00:25:22.164
<v Speaker 1>app config based on that.

00:25:22.565 --> 00:25:25.365
<v Speaker 1>And similarly, in our helm chart, we have

00:25:25.365 --> 00:25:28.245
<v Speaker 1>an init scripts that will do something similar.

00:25:28.245 --> 00:25:29.445
<v Speaker 1>So you can just define it all in

00:25:29.445 --> 00:25:30.884
<v Speaker 1>your values dot YAML.

00:25:32.245 --> 00:25:32.964
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:25:34.404 --> 00:25:36.085
<v Speaker 0>Let me scan this.

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:41.660
<v Speaker 0>I'm not gonna configure email. Is that okay?

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Yes. That will only be needed if for,

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:47.820
<v Speaker 1>like, password resets or

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.380
<v Speaker 1>to get notified of, new pull request.

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:52.700
<v Speaker 0>What if the

00:25:53.475 --> 00:25:55.235
<v Speaker 0>that's because we didn't change the permissions because

00:25:55.235 --> 00:25:56.995
<v Speaker 0>it doesn't exist. But if I just do

00:25:56.995 --> 00:25:57.554
<v Speaker 0>a

00:25:58.035 --> 00:25:59.715
<v Speaker 0>app.ini

00:26:00.675 --> 00:26:01.715
<v Speaker 0>change owner.

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:09.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh, and the install page will also create

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:13.000
<v Speaker 1>you can create an administrator user through here,

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.720
<v Speaker 1>or you can also create it

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:17.880
<v Speaker 1>via the

00:26:21.034 --> 00:26:23.914
<v Speaker 0>it's just the first user that will register.

00:26:24.875 --> 00:26:25.514
<v Speaker 1>Oh.

00:26:25.835 --> 00:26:26.634
<v Speaker 1>Oh, dear.

00:26:28.794 --> 00:26:29.835
<v Speaker 1>See if it's still running.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.320
<v Speaker 1>K. It's running

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.679
<v Speaker 1>as like working. Log is showing up.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.640
<v Speaker 0>I think it just should it restart when

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:43.840
<v Speaker 0>I put the install?

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. But the listener should be still going.

00:26:49.375 --> 00:26:50.415
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:26:50.415 --> 00:26:51.534
<v Speaker 0>Let's try

00:26:51.775 --> 00:26:53.455
<v Speaker 0>a little bit of encouragement.

00:26:58.495 --> 00:27:01.294
<v Speaker 0>Oh, wait. It's redirected me to the cohost.

00:27:01.295 --> 00:27:01.935
<v Speaker 1>That's right.

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:04.030
<v Speaker 1>Because,

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:08.190
<v Speaker 1>it'll redirect you to the root URL,

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:12.590
<v Speaker 1>and by default, it's local host. I see.

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:14.350
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's good. So this will be a

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:15.470
<v Speaker 1>warning scene.

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:16.750
<v Speaker 1>There's a difference.

00:27:17.645 --> 00:27:19.725
<v Speaker 0>It's actually a warning. See, if I pay

00:27:19.725 --> 00:27:21.885
<v Speaker 0>attention to the error messages, I'd have less

00:27:21.885 --> 00:27:22.845
<v Speaker 0>problem. So

00:27:24.605 --> 00:27:26.365
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming that was part of that form

00:27:26.365 --> 00:27:28.524
<v Speaker 0>that I very quickly just failed on Rawkode

00:27:28.524 --> 00:27:30.125
<v Speaker 0>Academy and disappeared. So

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.580
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly it. Yeah. So if you just

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:34.700
<v Speaker 1>change

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:37.420
<v Speaker 1>finder and place local host all over to

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:38.380
<v Speaker 1>the IP,

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:39.980
<v Speaker 1>then

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:43.580
<v Speaker 0>So I'm There you go. Using an IP

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.580
<v Speaker 0>right now. Right? So I'm assuming for most

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:48.294
<v Speaker 0>people, they're gonna want some sort of

00:27:49.255 --> 00:27:50.934
<v Speaker 0>DNS entry here.

00:27:51.335 --> 00:27:53.254
<v Speaker 0>Does Exactly. He

00:27:53.735 --> 00:27:55.894
<v Speaker 0>do the let's encrypt that for us, or

00:27:55.894 --> 00:27:57.334
<v Speaker 0>do we handle that externally?

00:27:58.455 --> 00:28:01.575
<v Speaker 1>We can do the let's encrypt ourselves.

00:28:01.975 --> 00:28:02.375
<v Speaker 1>Although,

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:06.510
<v Speaker 1>you would need to set the binary

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:10.590
<v Speaker 1>some the privileged Linux permissions to be able

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:12.830
<v Speaker 1>to listen on port eighty and four four

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:13.070
<v Speaker 1>three.

00:28:14.985 --> 00:28:15.625
<v Speaker 1>But,

00:28:16.825 --> 00:28:18.505
<v Speaker 1>you know, you could run something like KADI

00:28:18.505 --> 00:28:21.465
<v Speaker 1>in front and other wonderful Go projects. Mhmm.

00:28:22.905 --> 00:28:24.504
<v Speaker 1>NGINX, Apache,

00:28:25.625 --> 00:28:26.264
<v Speaker 1>any

00:28:26.665 --> 00:28:27.705
<v Speaker 1>proxy even.

00:28:28.159 --> 00:28:30.159
<v Speaker 0>What does your setup look like for your

00:28:30.159 --> 00:28:31.519
<v Speaker 0>own Gitea instances?

00:28:32.559 --> 00:28:34.479
<v Speaker 1>So we, run,

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.880
<v Speaker 1>we provide the privileged,

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.559
<v Speaker 1>board access,

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.919
<v Speaker 1>just because it's,

00:28:43.585 --> 00:28:44.144
<v Speaker 1>yeah.

00:28:46.144 --> 00:28:46.784
<v Speaker 1>But,

00:28:49.105 --> 00:28:51.904
<v Speaker 1>yeah, let's encrypt works great. We actually also

00:28:51.904 --> 00:28:53.664
<v Speaker 1>use the caddy

00:28:53.664 --> 00:28:54.465
<v Speaker 1>library

00:28:54.465 --> 00:28:55.104
<v Speaker 1>for

00:28:55.265 --> 00:28:56.705
<v Speaker 1>working with let's encrypt.

00:28:58.049 --> 00:28:59.970
<v Speaker 0>And I was assuming by privilege, what you

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:02.049
<v Speaker 0>mean is modifying

00:29:02.049 --> 00:29:03.729
<v Speaker 0>this unit fail.

00:29:04.529 --> 00:29:05.570
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. System.

00:29:06.289 --> 00:29:09.955
<v Speaker 0>And add another net CAP net raw or

00:29:09.955 --> 00:29:11.475
<v Speaker 0>CAP net bank service

00:29:11.875 --> 00:29:12.755
<v Speaker 0>capability.

00:29:12.755 --> 00:29:13.235
<v Speaker 0>Right?

00:29:14.835 --> 00:29:16.755
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I think that's the one.

00:29:17.315 --> 00:29:18.675
<v Speaker 0>CAP

00:29:18.675 --> 00:29:20.275
<v Speaker 0>net bank.

00:29:20.355 --> 00:29:23.190
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's the one for getting port 80.

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:27.429
<v Speaker 1>We have it documented somewhere in our documentation.

00:29:27.429 --> 00:29:29.029
<v Speaker 1>So if you search for it

00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:31.350
<v Speaker 1>in our docs as well,

00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:33.350
<v Speaker 1>it should be somewhere there.

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:37.270
<v Speaker 0>I don't know what to search for. 80.

00:29:41.845 --> 00:29:43.524
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Let's try AT.

00:29:48.485 --> 00:29:52.405
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So, yep, this ACME lets encrypt support,

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.440
<v Speaker 0>username,

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.880
<v Speaker 0>or you can do okay. So you've documented

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.640
<v Speaker 0>the proxies as well.

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:03.840
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.760
<v Speaker 0>I don't see the privileged guide, but maybe

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:08.720
<v Speaker 0>it's in there somewhere.

00:30:11.065 --> 00:30:12.585
<v Speaker 0>Not a big deal for today.

00:30:13.065 --> 00:30:14.504
<v Speaker 0>So let's jump back

00:30:15.945 --> 00:30:18.345
<v Speaker 0>and now our error has gone.

00:30:19.465 --> 00:30:21.784
<v Speaker 0>So this is the fresh Gitea instance then.

00:30:21.784 --> 00:30:22.025
<v Speaker 0>Right?

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:27.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So you can create your first account

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:29.649
<v Speaker 1>and that will become the administrative

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:30.290
<v Speaker 1>user.

00:30:42.755 --> 00:30:44.755
<v Speaker 0>I mean, this is instance isn't gonna live

00:30:44.755 --> 00:30:46.515
<v Speaker 0>long, so I don't mind everybody seeing what

00:30:46.515 --> 00:30:48.355
<v Speaker 0>that password is for the for the next

00:30:48.355 --> 00:30:49.315
<v Speaker 0>thirty minutes.

00:30:50.195 --> 00:30:51.955
<v Speaker 0>These are all very trustworthy, I hope.

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.620
<v Speaker 0>Cool. So do we get, like,

00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:58.780
<v Speaker 0>let's say admin. That's what I was gonna

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:00.700
<v Speaker 0>say. Like, the ability to tweak and configure

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:03.260
<v Speaker 0>things within the Gitea instance. So

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:06.540
<v Speaker 1>most of the configuration is done via the

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:10.460
<v Speaker 1>app config just so that you can script

00:31:09.765 --> 00:31:11.044
<v Speaker 1>deployments.

00:31:11.525 --> 00:31:13.044
<v Speaker 1>But there's a

00:31:13.605 --> 00:31:16.005
<v Speaker 1>maintenance operations task as you can see right

00:31:16.005 --> 00:31:17.044
<v Speaker 1>here to,

00:31:17.845 --> 00:31:21.524
<v Speaker 1>clean up things and, test your configuration.

00:31:22.245 --> 00:31:22.485
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm.

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:25.769
<v Speaker 0>Does Gitea have LFS

00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:26.490
<v Speaker 0>support?

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:28.090
<v Speaker 1>Does.

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:29.289
<v Speaker 1>Nice. Yeah.

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:31.129
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:35.370
<v Speaker 1>And we recently had a major release

00:31:35.705 --> 00:31:37.785
<v Speaker 1>within the past month where we also added

00:31:37.785 --> 00:31:39.144
<v Speaker 1>support for

00:31:39.705 --> 00:31:41.784
<v Speaker 1>packages of all sorts. So

00:31:42.425 --> 00:31:43.385
<v Speaker 1>Python

00:31:43.465 --> 00:31:44.424
<v Speaker 1>packages,

00:31:44.505 --> 00:31:45.625
<v Speaker 1>Ruby gems,

00:31:45.865 --> 00:31:47.785
<v Speaker 1>Docker containers, Helm charts,

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:50.950
<v Speaker 1>so many things. And

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:56.710
<v Speaker 1>yeah. So we're very excited about that functionality

00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:57.510
<v Speaker 1>specifically.

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.310
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:32:00.945 --> 00:32:03.504
<v Speaker 0>I'm just clicking buttons now. Hope that's alright.

00:32:03.745 --> 00:32:04.544
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:32:05.184 --> 00:32:05.904
<v Speaker 1>Of course.

00:32:08.144 --> 00:32:09.584
<v Speaker 0>Template.

00:32:09.825 --> 00:32:10.784
<v Speaker 0>Label.

00:32:14.544 --> 00:32:15.745
<v Speaker 0>What license is Gitea?

00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:18.970
<v Speaker 1>We're licensed MIT.

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:22.170
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I use MIT for just pretty much

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:23.210
<v Speaker 0>everything there.

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:25.770
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:27.850
<v Speaker 0>So I've created the Git repository. In fact,

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:29.370
<v Speaker 0>I've a few things there while we were

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:29.930
<v Speaker 0>kind of chatting.

00:32:30.794 --> 00:32:32.474
<v Speaker 0>I created an organization,

00:32:35.274 --> 00:32:37.514
<v Speaker 0>which I guess might come up under explore.

00:32:37.514 --> 00:32:38.075
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:32:39.674 --> 00:32:41.914
<v Speaker 0>And I could create something here, which is

00:32:41.914 --> 00:32:45.034
<v Speaker 0>cool. I created at my own repository

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:47.890
<v Speaker 0>and we got a license and a read

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:48.530
<v Speaker 0>me.

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:50.050
<v Speaker 0>I guess what we wanna do is get

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:51.810
<v Speaker 0>to the step where I can actually pull

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:53.090
<v Speaker 0>this down.

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:56.290
<v Speaker 0>So I'm assuming if I

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:58.690
<v Speaker 0>could just add my SSH key

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:00.290
<v Speaker 0>to my settings.

00:33:05.245 --> 00:33:08.205
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you support signing commits too with GPG?

00:33:09.485 --> 00:33:11.965
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Signing commits with GPG

00:33:11.965 --> 00:33:13.485
<v Speaker 1>as well as

00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:15.650
<v Speaker 1>in January, reintroduced

00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:18.049
<v Speaker 1>signing commits with your SSH key.

00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:23.010
<v Speaker 0>Nice. I actually used I have one password

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:25.490
<v Speaker 0>that I configured with both my with my

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:27.250
<v Speaker 0>SSH keys, which I can use for signing.

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:28.530
<v Speaker 0>Although, I have been exploring

00:33:29.265 --> 00:33:31.825
<v Speaker 0>cosign from the the chain guard folks. I

00:33:31.825 --> 00:33:33.105
<v Speaker 0>don't know if you've been talking to them

00:33:33.105 --> 00:33:35.825
<v Speaker 0>about verifying their signatures, but those are pretty

00:33:35.825 --> 00:33:37.905
<v Speaker 0>cool as well because they use OIDC

00:33:37.985 --> 00:33:38.865
<v Speaker 0>against

00:33:39.185 --> 00:33:40.225
<v Speaker 0>Google, etcetera.

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:43.630
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:47.790
<v Speaker 0>One password was trying to be nice there

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:49.310
<v Speaker 0>and now it's changed its mind.

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:54.110
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. We'll create a new one.

00:34:03.515 --> 00:34:04.154
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:34:05.115 --> 00:34:07.274
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's do the test. Are you feeling

00:34:07.274 --> 00:34:07.994
<v Speaker 0>confident?

00:34:09.195 --> 00:34:10.074
<v Speaker 1>I am, yes.

00:34:13.119 --> 00:34:14.719
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:16.880
<v Speaker 0>So we are doing a git clone from

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:17.920
<v Speaker 0>our instance.

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:23.280
<v Speaker 0>Well, let's ask for my key so it's

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.000
<v Speaker 0>gonna work.

00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:25.359
<v Speaker 1>Hey.

00:34:26.555 --> 00:34:27.515
<v Speaker 1>There we go.

00:34:29.114 --> 00:34:30.555
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. You know what? I'm gonna give you

00:34:30.555 --> 00:34:32.315
<v Speaker 0>the painless. I can't take that away from

00:34:32.315 --> 00:34:34.155
<v Speaker 0>the project. Like, I mean, we we've done

00:34:34.155 --> 00:34:36.555
<v Speaker 0>a lot there and relatively no time or

00:34:36.555 --> 00:34:37.835
<v Speaker 0>effort whatsoever.

00:34:37.835 --> 00:34:39.755
<v Speaker 0>And already, I'm able to clone down our

00:34:39.755 --> 00:34:41.835
<v Speaker 0>repository and start working on it. So that's

00:34:41.835 --> 00:34:43.730
<v Speaker 0>pretty sweet. Very cool.

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:48.290
<v Speaker 0>Mozz asked in the chat, is Gitea written

00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:49.969
<v Speaker 0>in Go? Yeah. You joined a little bit

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:51.489
<v Speaker 0>late, but we did cover it. It's written

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:52.929
<v Speaker 0>in Go, but there is the front end

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:53.810
<v Speaker 0>which has

00:34:54.495 --> 00:34:56.335
<v Speaker 0>I think you said some react stuff going

00:34:56.335 --> 00:34:57.295
<v Speaker 0>on there.

00:34:57.775 --> 00:35:00.015
<v Speaker 1>I've I've view JS. Oh, view JS. Yeah.

00:35:00.015 --> 00:35:00.975
<v Speaker 1>And

00:35:02.415 --> 00:35:03.455
<v Speaker 1>we use

00:35:03.775 --> 00:35:04.815
<v Speaker 1>semantic

00:35:04.815 --> 00:35:07.855
<v Speaker 1>CSS framework, which is a fork of semantic

00:35:07.855 --> 00:35:08.335
<v Speaker 1>CSS.

00:35:11.819 --> 00:35:13.819
<v Speaker 0>John is saying don't forget to change this

00:35:13.819 --> 00:35:15.099
<v Speaker 0>to the dark theme.

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:22.539
<v Speaker 0>Rawkode agreeing that was pretty easy.

00:35:23.265 --> 00:35:23.984
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:35:24.144 --> 00:35:26.224
<v Speaker 0>We have a question from Miles.

00:35:27.904 --> 00:35:30.385
<v Speaker 0>Does Gitea support token based authentication

00:35:30.385 --> 00:35:31.825
<v Speaker 0>instead of passwords?

00:35:32.944 --> 00:35:34.464
<v Speaker 1>We do. And in fact,

00:35:34.944 --> 00:35:36.545
<v Speaker 1>we're working towards

00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:38.730
<v Speaker 1>slowly deprecating,

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:42.250
<v Speaker 1>utilizing your user's password

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:43.290
<v Speaker 1>to

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:46.730
<v Speaker 1>in your clone actions or API calls.

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:49.050
<v Speaker 1>There's token based API.

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:50.170
<v Speaker 1>There's,

00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:52.330
<v Speaker 1>app tokens available currently.

00:35:53.825 --> 00:35:56.464
<v Speaker 1>It is it is possible to use your

00:35:56.464 --> 00:35:57.825
<v Speaker 1>user's password,

00:35:58.065 --> 00:36:00.944
<v Speaker 1>but not recommended. And, eventually, it'll be going

00:36:00.944 --> 00:36:01.585
<v Speaker 1>away

00:36:02.145 --> 00:36:04.224
<v Speaker 1>just because you shouldn't be using your password

00:36:04.224 --> 00:36:05.025
<v Speaker 1>just everywhere.

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.440
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Well, I do see the option here

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.600
<v Speaker 0>to use web off end, which is awesome.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.000
<v Speaker 0>But because we're on look there we're not

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:12.880
<v Speaker 0>on local, but

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.520
<v Speaker 1>It's specifically

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.480
<v Speaker 0>It's it's TLS. It's HTTPS.

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:36:21.625 --> 00:36:22.345
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:36:23.545 --> 00:36:24.425
<v Speaker 1>So that

00:36:24.745 --> 00:36:27.305
<v Speaker 1>error should get updated as well. But you

00:36:27.305 --> 00:36:29.305
<v Speaker 0>also support two factor authentication

00:36:29.305 --> 00:36:31.785
<v Speaker 0>and there's open ID as well. You can

00:36:31.785 --> 00:36:32.905
<v Speaker 0>do delegation to,

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:35.350
<v Speaker 0>I guess, to Google, etcetera.

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So we have

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:39.030
<v Speaker 1>OpenID

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:41.350
<v Speaker 1>that you can log in as. But as

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:43.510
<v Speaker 1>an administrator, you're also able to set up

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:44.950
<v Speaker 1>other authentication

00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:47.735
<v Speaker 1>sources. So if you wanna have users log

00:36:47.735 --> 00:36:50.455
<v Speaker 1>in with their GitHub account, their GitLab account,

00:36:50.615 --> 00:36:51.735
<v Speaker 1>their Twitter,

00:36:54.775 --> 00:36:56.535
<v Speaker 1>we have a whole bunch. I think you

00:36:56.535 --> 00:36:59.255
<v Speaker 1>can even log in with, Discord is one

00:36:59.255 --> 00:37:01.015
<v Speaker 1>of the ones that was the last ones

00:37:01.015 --> 00:37:01.655
<v Speaker 1>that I added.

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:04.560
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:37:05.599 --> 00:37:08.000
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I'm gonna just gonna stop clicking on

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.440
<v Speaker 0>buttons. Is

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.119
<v Speaker 0>there anything

00:37:11.119 --> 00:37:12.880
<v Speaker 0>that you think would be interesting

00:37:13.119 --> 00:37:14.480
<v Speaker 0>to take a look at

00:37:16.095 --> 00:37:18.255
<v Speaker 0>from the Gitea instance that we set up.

00:37:19.295 --> 00:37:20.655
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So

00:37:20.974 --> 00:37:22.335
<v Speaker 1>you showed how to

00:37:22.815 --> 00:37:24.815
<v Speaker 1>create a new repository,

00:37:24.815 --> 00:37:25.855
<v Speaker 1>but one of

00:37:26.494 --> 00:37:28.255
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that we're

00:37:28.335 --> 00:37:31.455
<v Speaker 1>very excited about is our migration capabilities.

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:33.100
<v Speaker 1>So

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:34.540
<v Speaker 1>rather than

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:38.220
<v Speaker 1>if you wanna migrate away from GitHub or

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:39.580
<v Speaker 1>something,

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:42.540
<v Speaker 1>you can create a new migration, throw in

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:44.700
<v Speaker 1>your Git URL, and it will do the

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:46.300
<v Speaker 1>Git clone itself. So you don't need to

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:47.020
<v Speaker 1>do that step.

00:37:47.835 --> 00:37:49.275
<v Speaker 1>But then you can also

00:37:50.315 --> 00:37:52.075
<v Speaker 1>if you wanna get advanced, you can also

00:37:52.075 --> 00:37:52.875
<v Speaker 1>throw in

00:37:53.355 --> 00:37:54.075
<v Speaker 1>your

00:37:54.234 --> 00:37:57.195
<v Speaker 1>GitHub app token, and it'll actually clone over

00:37:57.195 --> 00:37:59.994
<v Speaker 1>issues from that repository as well and pull

00:37:59.994 --> 00:38:00.875
<v Speaker 1>request.

00:38:00.875 --> 00:38:01.115
<v Speaker 1>And

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:06.050
<v Speaker 1>so you can fully set up.

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:08.130
<v Speaker 1>So that's

00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:10.850
<v Speaker 1>pull mirrors, but then we also have push

00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:11.570
<v Speaker 1>mirrors.

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:13.890
<v Speaker 1>So you can work with your repository locally

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:16.050
<v Speaker 1>with your local Gitea instance, and then you

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:18.370
<v Speaker 1>can have it pushed to various remotes

00:38:19.215 --> 00:38:20.095
<v Speaker 1>itself.

00:38:20.735 --> 00:38:21.375
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:38:23.135 --> 00:38:24.735
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Will we test this?

00:38:25.295 --> 00:38:26.015
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:38:26.495 --> 00:38:28.015
<v Speaker 1>Pop in any

00:38:28.255 --> 00:38:29.295
<v Speaker 1>Git repository.

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:35.610
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:39.210
<v Speaker 0>Well, this is the meta support. So this

00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:40.010
<v Speaker 0>just means

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:42.090
<v Speaker 0>I guess I would have to provide the

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:43.610
<v Speaker 0>access token for that, or do I always

00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:46.010
<v Speaker 0>have to provide an access token? So

00:38:46.235 --> 00:38:48.795
<v Speaker 1>if you're mirroring it, it will just do

00:38:48.795 --> 00:38:50.795
<v Speaker 1>a git clone. You'll need to provide the

00:38:50.795 --> 00:38:53.835
<v Speaker 1>access token if it's a private repository.

00:38:54.395 --> 00:38:57.195
<v Speaker 1>However, if you're going to migrate labels,

00:38:57.195 --> 00:38:59.915
<v Speaker 1>pull request, milestones, you'll need to provide auth

00:38:59.915 --> 00:39:00.635
<v Speaker 1>because

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.200
<v Speaker 1>just

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:03.240
<v Speaker 1>otherwise,

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:04.760
<v Speaker 1>the experience of

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:08.360
<v Speaker 1>getting rate limited for, like, 50 queries from

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:10.760
<v Speaker 1>the GitHub API is not pleasant, and it

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:14.200
<v Speaker 1>will take a week to migrate anything.

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:17.845
<v Speaker 1>There you go. Holy shit.

00:39:18.245 --> 00:39:19.285
<v Speaker 0>That was fast.

00:39:20.645 --> 00:39:22.485
<v Speaker 1>And it pulls in the

00:39:22.885 --> 00:39:24.645
<v Speaker 1>project description as well,

00:39:26.805 --> 00:39:27.845
<v Speaker 1>full history.

00:39:28.965 --> 00:39:29.525
<v Speaker 1>And

00:39:30.085 --> 00:39:30.885
<v Speaker 1>Hand on my yeah.

00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:32.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:38.730
<v Speaker 1>So in terms of CI integration right now,

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:41.050
<v Speaker 1>there's a question in chat from Rio.

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:43.770
<v Speaker 1>We

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:45.610
<v Speaker 1>have integration with

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:48.655
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of different CI providers,

00:39:49.055 --> 00:39:49.935
<v Speaker 1>Jenkins,

00:39:50.015 --> 00:39:51.695
<v Speaker 1>Drone, Woodpecker,

00:39:52.415 --> 00:39:53.615
<v Speaker 1>to name a few.

00:39:54.015 --> 00:39:57.055
<v Speaker 1>The project itself, we use Drone

00:39:59.559 --> 00:40:01.320
<v Speaker 1>primarily just because,

00:40:02.359 --> 00:40:04.119
<v Speaker 1>in the beginning of our project, we had

00:40:04.119 --> 00:40:06.760
<v Speaker 1>a lot of overlap between contributors to drone

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:07.880
<v Speaker 1>as well as,

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:09.080
<v Speaker 1>Gitea.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.359
<v Speaker 1>However,

00:40:12.359 --> 00:40:13.240
<v Speaker 1>now

00:40:14.984 --> 00:40:17.065
<v Speaker 1>a Woodpecker is a fork of drone, and

00:40:17.065 --> 00:40:20.105
<v Speaker 1>that's where mainly the Gitea contributors are at

00:40:20.105 --> 00:40:20.665
<v Speaker 1>now.

00:40:22.505 --> 00:40:23.305
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:40:23.865 --> 00:40:25.464
<v Speaker 1>But it can report

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:27.640
<v Speaker 1>statuses

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.520
<v Speaker 1>back to commit. So just like on GitHub,

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:31.480
<v Speaker 1>you can see the

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.720
<v Speaker 1>check mark if you're build on a specific

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:35.080
<v Speaker 1>commit was successful.

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.480
<v Speaker 1>In pull request, you can see,

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:38.520
<v Speaker 1>again,

00:40:39.494 --> 00:40:41.255
<v Speaker 1>your various different external

00:40:41.414 --> 00:40:42.775
<v Speaker 1>CI providers

00:40:43.015 --> 00:40:43.815
<v Speaker 1>work out.

00:40:44.135 --> 00:40:46.135
<v Speaker 1>You can do branch protection

00:40:46.535 --> 00:40:49.255
<v Speaker 1>based on CI status.

00:40:49.654 --> 00:40:50.455
<v Speaker 1>So

00:40:50.615 --> 00:40:52.535
<v Speaker 1>don't merge that pull request if the tests

00:40:52.535 --> 00:40:52.934
<v Speaker 1>fail.

00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:56.750
<v Speaker 0>Very cool.

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:01.070
<v Speaker 0>I get an RSS feed as well from

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:05.150
<v Speaker 0>I guess if I start pushing to this,

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:07.150
<v Speaker 0>does that publish new things to the feed?

00:41:08.005 --> 00:41:09.925
<v Speaker 1>That will. Yeah. So it's not

00:41:10.325 --> 00:41:11.525
<v Speaker 1>every commit.

00:41:11.925 --> 00:41:13.765
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me. It's

00:41:13.925 --> 00:41:15.445
<v Speaker 1>that's specifically

00:41:15.445 --> 00:41:16.565
<v Speaker 1>for releases.

00:41:17.125 --> 00:41:19.125
<v Speaker 0>Ah, okay. Yeah.

00:41:19.605 --> 00:41:20.965
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's cut a release.

00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:23.789
<v Speaker 0>I've been meaning to do one point o

00:41:23.789 --> 00:41:25.150
<v Speaker 0>for a leak the last nine months, so

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:26.510
<v Speaker 0>why why not do it here?

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:29.390
<v Speaker 0>0.1.

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:35.444
<v Speaker 1>So let's make sure my assumptions are correct

00:41:35.444 --> 00:41:37.845
<v Speaker 1>in that case for the new assessment. Yeah.

00:41:37.845 --> 00:41:39.444
<v Speaker 0>And if I use the I'm just gonna

00:41:39.444 --> 00:41:40.725
<v Speaker 0>test it. So

00:41:43.204 --> 00:41:45.525
<v Speaker 0>okay. Let me throw a a question out

00:41:45.525 --> 00:41:48.070
<v Speaker 0>then. There's there's a lot of similarities here

00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:50.070
<v Speaker 0>between Gitea and GitHub, and we discussed that

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:51.670
<v Speaker 0>at the start about how it's supposed to

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:53.990
<v Speaker 0>be familiar so that people, you know, they're

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:56.390
<v Speaker 0>not discouraged or intimidated or anything like that.

00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:59.495
<v Speaker 0>Would you say Gitea has pretty good parity

00:41:59.495 --> 00:42:01.735
<v Speaker 0>with what GitHub offers?

00:42:01.735 --> 00:42:03.895
<v Speaker 0>Because it it looks and feels like it.

00:42:04.055 --> 00:42:05.975
<v Speaker 0>I I mean, I haven't visually seen anything

00:42:05.975 --> 00:42:07.495
<v Speaker 0>that isn't

00:42:07.575 --> 00:42:08.775
<v Speaker 0>on Gitea here.

00:42:09.335 --> 00:42:11.575
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So in our docs, we have a

00:42:11.575 --> 00:42:13.335
<v Speaker 1>a whole long comparison document

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:16.950
<v Speaker 1>that lists out the differences between,

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:18.790
<v Speaker 1>Gitea, Gogs,

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:21.510
<v Speaker 1>GitLab, and, GitHub.

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:23.030
<v Speaker 1>And,

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:25.830
<v Speaker 1>for the most part, there's a lot of,

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.790
<v Speaker 1>overlap.

00:42:27.974 --> 00:42:29.815
<v Speaker 1>And one of our actually,

00:42:30.454 --> 00:42:32.454
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned SSH signing.

00:42:32.855 --> 00:42:35.494
<v Speaker 1>We had that in January, but, Giteaub just

00:42:35.494 --> 00:42:37.575
<v Speaker 1>released that fairly recently. So in,

00:42:38.055 --> 00:42:39.655
<v Speaker 1>some cases, we're,

00:42:40.454 --> 00:42:41.255
<v Speaker 1>moving faster.

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:45.690
<v Speaker 1>We're not a multibillion dollar company, so but,

00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:47.450
<v Speaker 1>you know, we still have some agility.

00:42:48.490 --> 00:42:50.090
<v Speaker 0>Well, who who prioritizes

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:51.850
<v Speaker 0>the work then? I mean, I've I've an

00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:53.850
<v Speaker 0>open source project. This is a very common

00:42:53.850 --> 00:42:55.770
<v Speaker 0>problem. Right? Is that everybody wants to work

00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:58.090
<v Speaker 0>on the thing that's most important to them,

00:42:58.090 --> 00:43:01.025
<v Speaker 0>and this can be difficult to find direction.

00:43:01.025 --> 00:43:02.944
<v Speaker 0>But I'm assuming, again, come back to what

00:43:02.944 --> 00:43:04.065
<v Speaker 0>you said at the start of it, there

00:43:04.065 --> 00:43:05.905
<v Speaker 0>being, like, governance and such. So you must

00:43:05.905 --> 00:43:08.065
<v Speaker 0>be quite a well oiled machine to a

00:43:08.065 --> 00:43:09.905
<v Speaker 0>certain point. I am assuming you just know

00:43:09.905 --> 00:43:11.105
<v Speaker 0>what that road map looks like.

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:13.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:15.930
<v Speaker 1>As we're all volunteers right now,

00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:18.250
<v Speaker 1>it is working on,

00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:19.850
<v Speaker 1>what,

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:21.290
<v Speaker 1>we all

00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:22.730
<v Speaker 1>want to work on.

00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:23.930
<v Speaker 1>Although,

00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:24.890
<v Speaker 1>there's,

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:26.330
<v Speaker 1>maintainers

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:27.690
<v Speaker 1>and

00:43:28.585 --> 00:43:31.785
<v Speaker 1>core contributors, we all, also contribute,

00:43:32.185 --> 00:43:32.825
<v Speaker 1>like,

00:43:32.985 --> 00:43:33.545
<v Speaker 1>minor

00:43:34.345 --> 00:43:36.905
<v Speaker 1>refactors for stability enhancements,

00:43:37.785 --> 00:43:38.825
<v Speaker 1>as well as,

00:43:39.385 --> 00:43:40.105
<v Speaker 1>like,

00:43:40.745 --> 00:43:43.600
<v Speaker 1>like, bug fixes and whatnot. So,

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.600
<v Speaker 1>it's a nice mix of, features as well

00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:48.160
<v Speaker 1>as,

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:49.520
<v Speaker 1>stability

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:51.760
<v Speaker 1>resolutions.

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:54.080
<v Speaker 1>A question from chat.

00:43:54.785 --> 00:43:55.745
<v Speaker 1>Gitea

00:43:56.545 --> 00:43:57.185
<v Speaker 1>does

00:43:57.905 --> 00:43:59.665
<v Speaker 1>somewhat support clustering.

00:44:02.305 --> 00:44:04.545
<v Speaker 1>We previously on Gitea.com,

00:44:04.545 --> 00:44:06.945
<v Speaker 1>we were running Gitea in a

00:44:07.265 --> 00:44:08.145
<v Speaker 1>multicluster

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:13.600
<v Speaker 1>setup or a multinode setup.

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:15.360
<v Speaker 1>Although,

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.000
<v Speaker 1>right now,

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:22.720
<v Speaker 1>there's instances of Gitea with tens of thousands

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:25.280
<v Speaker 1>of users running on a single machine. So

00:44:25.865 --> 00:44:28.185
<v Speaker 1>the need for high availability

00:44:28.265 --> 00:44:29.065
<v Speaker 1>is

00:44:32.665 --> 00:44:34.825
<v Speaker 1>like, you'll need to question,

00:44:35.704 --> 00:44:36.025
<v Speaker 1>like

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:39.410
<v Speaker 1>like,

00:44:40.369 --> 00:44:42.609
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you do actually need it.

00:44:42.609 --> 00:44:44.609
<v Speaker 0>Well, yeah, whether they want it for scale

00:44:44.609 --> 00:44:46.609
<v Speaker 0>or whether they want it for redundant. Yeah.

00:44:46.609 --> 00:44:48.289
<v Speaker 0>I mean, if it's for scale Yeah. You

00:44:48.289 --> 00:44:49.809
<v Speaker 0>probably don't need to. I mean, we have

00:44:49.809 --> 00:44:51.410
<v Speaker 0>these numbers at the bottom, which I keep.

00:44:51.485 --> 00:44:52.925
<v Speaker 0>To catch my eye every time I load

00:44:52.925 --> 00:44:54.365
<v Speaker 0>a new page. But the there have never

00:44:54.365 --> 00:44:56.365
<v Speaker 0>been more than a few milliseconds for any

00:44:56.365 --> 00:44:57.565
<v Speaker 0>of these pages. Yeah. And I know this

00:44:57.565 --> 00:44:59.725
<v Speaker 0>is an empty instance, but, you know, is

00:44:59.725 --> 00:45:01.725
<v Speaker 0>that when you get to the larger instances,

00:45:01.725 --> 00:45:03.485
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming these I'm hoping these numbers still

00:45:03.485 --> 00:45:04.940
<v Speaker 0>stay pretty small.

00:45:05.819 --> 00:45:07.420
<v Speaker 1>They definitely do. And,

00:45:08.299 --> 00:45:10.460
<v Speaker 1>one of our, other owners,

00:45:10.859 --> 00:45:13.740
<v Speaker 1>Zary Path, he's put in a ton of

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:15.180
<v Speaker 1>effort into keeping,

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:19.164
<v Speaker 1>that performance of being able to browse, like,

00:45:19.164 --> 00:45:20.845
<v Speaker 1>even the Linux kernel with

00:45:21.484 --> 00:45:24.285
<v Speaker 1>all of its commits, just keeping it speedy.

00:45:26.204 --> 00:45:28.845
<v Speaker 1>Just keeping it down low. And just for

00:45:29.325 --> 00:45:30.605
<v Speaker 1>sake of comparison,

00:45:30.605 --> 00:45:31.644
<v Speaker 1>gt.com,

00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:35.110
<v Speaker 1>we have, I think, something like 30,000,

00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:36.870
<v Speaker 1>registered users,

00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:40.630
<v Speaker 1>and even more repositories.

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:43.350
<v Speaker 1>And we have four gigs of RAM on

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:43.910
<v Speaker 1>that server.

00:45:45.435 --> 00:45:46.075
<v Speaker 1>Now,

00:45:46.315 --> 00:45:48.875
<v Speaker 1>our storage is rather significant. We have

00:45:49.275 --> 00:45:52.395
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a a terabyte of storage,

00:45:52.635 --> 00:45:54.155
<v Speaker 1>right now reserved, and,

00:45:54.795 --> 00:45:57.355
<v Speaker 1>we can scale that up because we're on

00:45:57.355 --> 00:45:58.555
<v Speaker 1>a cloud provider.

00:45:58.795 --> 00:46:00.715
<v Speaker 1>Just click and drag the

00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:04.770
<v Speaker 1>storage bar for our NFS server.

00:46:04.930 --> 00:46:05.570
<v Speaker 1>But,

00:46:06.049 --> 00:46:08.130
<v Speaker 1>you know, like I said at the beginning,

00:46:08.609 --> 00:46:08.930
<v Speaker 1>our

00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:11.330
<v Speaker 1>we really aim to have

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:16.130
<v Speaker 1>just as little resources as possible

00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:16.770
<v Speaker 1>used.

00:46:17.945 --> 00:46:18.665
<v Speaker 0>Thanks.

00:46:19.625 --> 00:46:21.225
<v Speaker 0>Well, while you were talking about cluster and

00:46:21.225 --> 00:46:23.145
<v Speaker 0>high availability, I was playing with your project

00:46:23.145 --> 00:46:25.145
<v Speaker 0>feature and just threw

00:46:25.305 --> 00:46:27.225
<v Speaker 0>on some boards. I like that I can

00:46:27.225 --> 00:46:29.625
<v Speaker 0>color them. Got an issue. I mean,

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.720
<v Speaker 0>this is really cool. I mean, I'm just

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:35.600
<v Speaker 0>dragging stuff about there, but I like it.

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.920
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna close this now. This is where

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:39.119
<v Speaker 0>I fixed it. There we go.

00:46:44.474 --> 00:46:46.875
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So we oh, we were gonna test

00:46:46.875 --> 00:46:48.875
<v Speaker 0>your release RSS. That's what it was.

00:46:49.994 --> 00:46:50.795
<v Speaker 1>Hey.

00:46:51.035 --> 00:46:53.755
<v Speaker 1>Look at that. Alright. So we get issues.

00:46:54.154 --> 00:46:57.850
<v Speaker 0>My release as well. Cool. Okay. So,

00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:01.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah, these are actions that have taken place

00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:02.250
<v Speaker 1>in the repository,

00:47:02.250 --> 00:47:03.370
<v Speaker 1>not just releases.

00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:06.250
<v Speaker 1>So same thing that happens in your,

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:09.370
<v Speaker 1>your explore feed on the home page.

00:47:10.135 --> 00:47:13.575
<v Speaker 1>It will show that you've created issues, closures,

00:47:15.095 --> 00:47:15.735
<v Speaker 1>issues.

00:47:16.615 --> 00:47:17.895
<v Speaker 1>So this

00:47:18.775 --> 00:47:20.215
<v Speaker 1>is the information that will show up in

00:47:20.215 --> 00:47:22.695
<v Speaker 1>the RSS feed, except it'll be filtered per

00:47:23.655 --> 00:47:24.295
<v Speaker 1>that

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:28.120
<v Speaker 0>Cool. Specific repository. Alright.

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:31.160
<v Speaker 0>Nice. I mean, I don't think I've ever

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:34.760
<v Speaker 0>seen RSS feeds from another Git provider. But,

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:36.840
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I still use RSS daily, like,

00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:38.520
<v Speaker 0>for everything, for all my news and stuff

00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:40.440
<v Speaker 0>like that. Like, why would I not wanna

00:47:39.945 --> 00:47:42.425
<v Speaker 0>subscribe to, like, the most important project and

00:47:42.425 --> 00:47:43.225
<v Speaker 0>get update?

00:47:43.945 --> 00:47:48.025
<v Speaker 1>Exactly. So GitHub does have RSS feeds

00:47:48.265 --> 00:47:49.385
<v Speaker 1>if I can

00:47:50.105 --> 00:47:51.545
<v Speaker 1>promote another project.

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:57.430
<v Speaker 1>They just don't have the it visible. But

00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:59.030
<v Speaker 1>if you go view source, you can view

00:47:59.030 --> 00:48:01.110
<v Speaker 1>their atom links. Ah,

00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:02.230
<v Speaker 0>had no idea.

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:03.910
<v Speaker 0>But that was one of the first things

00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:06.070
<v Speaker 0>I noticed when I was on this thing.

00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:07.910
<v Speaker 0>Was like, oh, look. They got this. So

00:48:08.605 --> 00:48:10.285
<v Speaker 0>it's amazing how you just stick an icon

00:48:10.285 --> 00:48:11.645
<v Speaker 0>on something, and it actually becomes a whole

00:48:11.645 --> 00:48:13.005
<v Speaker 0>lot more visible to people.

00:48:13.325 --> 00:48:13.725
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:48:16.285 --> 00:48:17.645
<v Speaker 0>We've kinda covered

00:48:17.965 --> 00:48:19.085
<v Speaker 0>that Gitea

00:48:19.325 --> 00:48:22.250
<v Speaker 0>has a level of parity with GitHub. It's

00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:23.770
<v Speaker 0>got a couple of extra features. We've seen

00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:25.770
<v Speaker 0>the migration support there. Is there anything else

00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:28.250
<v Speaker 0>that's different in Gitea that you wanna highlight

00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:29.930
<v Speaker 0>as part of our our session?

00:48:34.809 --> 00:48:35.770
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.

00:48:36.170 --> 00:48:38.995
<v Speaker 1>I think I think we've covered everything I

00:48:38.995 --> 00:48:41.155
<v Speaker 1>wanted to focus on today.

00:48:41.635 --> 00:48:42.435
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:48:43.395 --> 00:48:45.075
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, I'm gonna ask you a question

00:48:45.075 --> 00:48:45.715
<v Speaker 0>then.

00:48:46.115 --> 00:48:47.395
<v Speaker 0>So Yeah. Definitely.

00:48:47.475 --> 00:48:49.715
<v Speaker 0>I have a lot of repositories

00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:52.790
<v Speaker 0>on GitHub

00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:54.870
<v Speaker 0>and

00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:57.590
<v Speaker 0>yeah. 306.

00:48:57.590 --> 00:48:59.670
<v Speaker 0>Now, of course, most of them are crappy

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:01.270
<v Speaker 0>one time Forex and stuff like that, but

00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:03.590
<v Speaker 0>but they they add up. And I've always

00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:05.495
<v Speaker 0>wanted to be able to group some together,

00:49:05.495 --> 00:49:07.575
<v Speaker 0>and GitLab does offer, like, grouping support. Is

00:49:07.575 --> 00:49:09.895
<v Speaker 0>that something that you've talked discussed

00:49:10.215 --> 00:49:12.135
<v Speaker 0>Gitea, and is that something that you think

00:49:12.135 --> 00:49:13.495
<v Speaker 0>you would implement?

00:49:14.295 --> 00:49:17.335
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So there is a ticket open for

00:49:17.335 --> 00:49:18.135
<v Speaker 1>subgroups.

00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:20.849
<v Speaker 1>But just like with GitHub,

00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:22.849
<v Speaker 1>we have, labels.

00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:25.650
<v Speaker 1>You can also filter based on labels to

00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:27.570
<v Speaker 1>be able to categorize.

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:30.609
<v Speaker 1>Say if you're working for a company and

00:49:30.609 --> 00:49:31.410
<v Speaker 1>you have your

00:49:31.985 --> 00:49:32.865
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure's

00:49:32.865 --> 00:49:33.985
<v Speaker 1>code repositories

00:49:33.985 --> 00:49:35.985
<v Speaker 1>and then you have your application code, you

00:49:35.985 --> 00:49:37.985
<v Speaker 1>can take stuff as IAC

00:49:37.985 --> 00:49:40.465
<v Speaker 1>and filter based on that, or

00:49:40.945 --> 00:49:41.745
<v Speaker 1>you can,

00:49:42.065 --> 00:49:44.625
<v Speaker 1>take stuff as application code and filter based

00:49:44.625 --> 00:49:46.225
<v Speaker 1>on that for your specific

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:49.560
<v Speaker 1>team

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:51.160
<v Speaker 1>repositories.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:53.720
<v Speaker 0>John

00:49:56.039 --> 00:49:59.079
<v Speaker 0>is in the chat mentioning a visual swagger

00:49:59.079 --> 00:49:59.640
<v Speaker 0>UI.

00:50:00.535 --> 00:50:02.935
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. If you scroll down to the bottom

00:50:02.935 --> 00:50:03.895
<v Speaker 1>of the page,

00:50:04.215 --> 00:50:06.135
<v Speaker 1>there should be a link to the API,

00:50:07.175 --> 00:50:09.655
<v Speaker 1>and that's what, John's talking about.

00:50:10.055 --> 00:50:11.015
<v Speaker 1>So we have,

00:50:11.735 --> 00:50:12.855
<v Speaker 0>an API,

00:50:13.175 --> 00:50:15.490
<v Speaker 1>and so this is actually

00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:17.570
<v Speaker 1>programmatically generated

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:19.650
<v Speaker 1>from our API endpoints.

00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:21.090
<v Speaker 1>And so

00:50:23.089 --> 00:50:23.890
<v Speaker 1>you can

00:50:24.849 --> 00:50:27.490
<v Speaker 1>see all of the endpoints that are available.

00:50:27.490 --> 00:50:29.410
<v Speaker 1>You can test the endpoints.

00:50:33.244 --> 00:50:34.765
<v Speaker 1>And we also have,

00:50:36.685 --> 00:50:38.925
<v Speaker 1>a command line tool that will work with

00:50:38.925 --> 00:50:40.605
<v Speaker 1>the API as well called,

00:50:41.005 --> 00:50:41.724
<v Speaker 1>t.

00:50:42.125 --> 00:50:43.805
<v Speaker 1>So if you don't wanna use the

00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:47.540
<v Speaker 1>web interface, you can use the CLI and

00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:49.860
<v Speaker 1>create pull request, browse issues.

00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:55.940
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I don't don't mean to break stuff

00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:58.505
<v Speaker 0>intentionally that time. Oh, cool. So you could

00:50:58.505 --> 00:51:00.665
<v Speaker 0>just can use it straight from in the

00:51:01.545 --> 00:51:02.585
<v Speaker 0>so I got you.

00:51:04.025 --> 00:51:04.425
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:51:07.145 --> 00:51:09.065
<v Speaker 0>And you mentioned that command line application as

00:51:09.065 --> 00:51:09.225
<v Speaker 0>well?

00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:11.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So

00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:14.790
<v Speaker 1>gitea.com/gitea/t,

00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:15.510
<v Speaker 1>and

00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:17.750
<v Speaker 1>you can install it.

00:51:18.310 --> 00:51:20.070
<v Speaker 1>If you're on a Mac, you can use

00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:21.430
<v Speaker 1>our homebrew tab.

00:51:22.964 --> 00:51:24.724
<v Speaker 0>T the letter or t the

00:51:25.365 --> 00:51:26.484
<v Speaker 1>I don't

00:51:27.125 --> 00:51:27.685
<v Speaker 1>know.

00:51:28.644 --> 00:51:30.164
<v Speaker 1>Oh, Gitea.com

00:51:30.164 --> 00:51:30.885
<v Speaker 1>rather.

00:51:32.724 --> 00:51:35.605
<v Speaker 0>Comt.

00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:39.110
<v Speaker 0>Nope.

00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Slash Gitea/t.

00:51:42.310 --> 00:51:42.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:47.750
<v Speaker 1>There we go.

00:51:50.395 --> 00:51:52.875
<v Speaker 0>There's a nice public instance that's available to

00:51:52.875 --> 00:51:53.515
<v Speaker 0>anyone?

00:51:54.315 --> 00:51:56.795
<v Speaker 1>It is public. The primary focus of it

00:51:56.795 --> 00:51:57.835
<v Speaker 1>is to

00:51:58.154 --> 00:51:58.875
<v Speaker 1>the

00:51:59.595 --> 00:52:02.395
<v Speaker 1>for the purpose of building Gitea,

00:52:03.039 --> 00:52:06.559
<v Speaker 1>although there are non Gitea related repositories

00:52:06.559 --> 00:52:07.440
<v Speaker 1>on there.

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:08.720
<v Speaker 1>But,

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:11.599
<v Speaker 1>generally, we recommend,

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:13.119
<v Speaker 1>right now,

00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:15.440
<v Speaker 1>codeberg.org.

00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:16.000
<v Speaker 1>They're a

00:52:16.665 --> 00:52:17.945
<v Speaker 1>Gitea instance

00:52:18.025 --> 00:52:19.705
<v Speaker 1>primarily focused on

00:52:19.945 --> 00:52:21.785
<v Speaker 1>free and open source software.

00:52:23.225 --> 00:52:23.865
<v Speaker 1>And

00:52:24.025 --> 00:52:25.225
<v Speaker 1>a disclaimer,

00:52:25.225 --> 00:52:28.425
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the Presidium of that organization.

00:52:30.505 --> 00:52:30.905
<v Speaker 0>Right.

00:52:31.830 --> 00:52:33.510
<v Speaker 0>So this is a green tick.

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:35.830
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. We've got checks here.

00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:37.910
<v Speaker 0>So what's this hooked up to?

00:52:38.550 --> 00:52:40.550
<v Speaker 1>So this is hooked up to our drone

00:52:40.550 --> 00:52:41.830
<v Speaker 1>instance. And

00:52:42.550 --> 00:52:43.670
<v Speaker 1>so you can see

00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:46.630
<v Speaker 1>all of the tests that it runs. And

00:52:50.525 --> 00:52:52.765
<v Speaker 1>so, yeah, this is a perfect example of

00:52:52.765 --> 00:52:54.045
<v Speaker 1>external CI.

00:52:56.285 --> 00:52:58.285
<v Speaker 0>So in a bit yeah. Nice.

00:52:59.805 --> 00:53:01.244
<v Speaker 0>I'm stuck. There we go.

00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:04.990
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:07.790
<v Speaker 0>I should've came here earlier. I'm seeing loads

00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:08.990
<v Speaker 0>of cool things now. So is that you

00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:10.910
<v Speaker 0>also support issue templates as well?

00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:12.350
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:13.630
<v Speaker 1>Issue templates,

00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:16.910
<v Speaker 1>you can

00:53:18.115 --> 00:53:20.275
<v Speaker 1>we just merged

00:53:20.275 --> 00:53:21.315
<v Speaker 1>the

00:53:21.875 --> 00:53:23.475
<v Speaker 1>custom issue forms.

00:53:23.555 --> 00:53:24.195
<v Speaker 1>Like,

00:53:24.515 --> 00:53:26.035
<v Speaker 1>on GitHub, you can say,

00:53:26.355 --> 00:53:29.875
<v Speaker 1>please fill out the version number of the,

00:53:31.310 --> 00:53:34.030
<v Speaker 1>of what you're using and having it required

00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:34.990
<v Speaker 1>so that,

00:53:35.950 --> 00:53:39.310
<v Speaker 1>users don't just, skip optional elements in or

00:53:39.310 --> 00:53:41.950
<v Speaker 1>required elements in the form. You can say,

00:53:42.444 --> 00:53:44.125
<v Speaker 1>fill out the version number

00:53:44.285 --> 00:53:47.005
<v Speaker 1>and other interesting things like that.

00:53:47.645 --> 00:53:48.525
<v Speaker 0>Great.

00:53:50.045 --> 00:53:50.845
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:53:52.365 --> 00:53:54.045
<v Speaker 0>Have we covered everything? Will I put this

00:53:54.045 --> 00:53:55.484
<v Speaker 0>back into, like, face mode?

00:53:57.410 --> 00:53:59.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Let's go back into face mode.

00:54:00.769 --> 00:54:03.170
<v Speaker 0>So that's really cool. Gitea is a a

00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:04.210
<v Speaker 0>really cool project.

00:54:05.329 --> 00:54:07.089
<v Speaker 0>Super simple to set up. I mean, literally,

00:54:07.089 --> 00:54:08.849
<v Speaker 0>pull out a binary down, tell us next

00:54:08.849 --> 00:54:10.355
<v Speaker 0>machine and just I mean, I could've just

00:54:10.355 --> 00:54:12.915
<v Speaker 0>ran it straight away, you know, set up

00:54:12.915 --> 00:54:14.515
<v Speaker 0>a system to unit files seems like the

00:54:14.515 --> 00:54:16.115
<v Speaker 0>nicer approach. And again, it took us a

00:54:16.115 --> 00:54:16.835
<v Speaker 0>few seconds

00:54:17.155 --> 00:54:19.315
<v Speaker 0>and everything just kinda worked.

00:54:19.875 --> 00:54:21.954
<v Speaker 0>I love that I can use SQLite.

00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:23.890
<v Speaker 0>You know, I definitely would hook that up

00:54:23.890 --> 00:54:26.690
<v Speaker 0>to Lightstream and start replicating that to GCS

00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:27.410
<v Speaker 0>probably,

00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:29.250
<v Speaker 0>pulling that down to give me some sort

00:54:29.250 --> 00:54:30.850
<v Speaker 0>of redundancy or resiliency.

00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:33.010
<v Speaker 0>Just a really cool

00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:34.050
<v Speaker 0>system.

00:54:34.050 --> 00:54:35.250
<v Speaker 0>Great work. Like

00:54:36.075 --> 00:54:38.315
<v Speaker 1>Thank you. Yeah. It's

00:54:38.875 --> 00:54:40.075
<v Speaker 1>thousand plus

00:54:40.395 --> 00:54:42.875
<v Speaker 1>people have contributed to the project, so it's

00:54:43.355 --> 00:54:46.395
<v Speaker 1>it's a real community effort, and it takes

00:54:46.395 --> 00:54:47.195
<v Speaker 1>a village.

00:54:48.635 --> 00:54:50.315
<v Speaker 0>Well, how about

00:54:50.875 --> 00:54:53.330
<v Speaker 0>like, say people watch this and they think,

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:55.730
<v Speaker 0>I'd love to get involved. Like, what what's

00:54:55.730 --> 00:54:57.490
<v Speaker 0>the best avenue for them to reach out,

00:54:57.490 --> 00:54:58.690
<v Speaker 0>to start discussions,

00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:00.690
<v Speaker 0>and to start writing code if they want?

00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:04.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So, in terms of reaching out, we

00:55:04.610 --> 00:55:07.615
<v Speaker 1>have our various chat channels. Discord and are

00:55:07.615 --> 00:55:08.655
<v Speaker 1>bridged together.

00:55:10.335 --> 00:55:12.735
<v Speaker 1>And and you can come into the developed

00:55:12.735 --> 00:55:14.895
<v Speaker 1>channel saying, hey. I wanna get started.

00:55:15.295 --> 00:55:16.735
<v Speaker 1>And there are a ton of people,

00:55:17.535 --> 00:55:20.095
<v Speaker 1>who are very happy to help there. That's

00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:23.869
<v Speaker 1>several of our core maintainers started out that

00:55:23.869 --> 00:55:26.190
<v Speaker 1>way with no go experience, and now they

00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:27.470
<v Speaker 1>write go every day.

00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:30.750
<v Speaker 1>And we also have a bunch of,

00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:35.630
<v Speaker 1>issues labeled good first issue of

00:55:35.175 --> 00:55:37.255
<v Speaker 1>improving the docs or,

00:55:39.335 --> 00:55:40.695
<v Speaker 1>things to get,

00:55:41.015 --> 00:55:43.735
<v Speaker 1>your feet wet with experiencing the code base.

00:55:44.535 --> 00:55:48.375
<v Speaker 1>And we also, participate in Oktoberfest every year,

00:55:49.610 --> 00:55:51.210
<v Speaker 1>run events. I've

00:55:51.530 --> 00:55:54.410
<v Speaker 1>last year, I livestreamed

00:55:54.970 --> 00:55:57.050
<v Speaker 1>over Twitch.tv.

00:55:57.050 --> 00:55:59.610
<v Speaker 1>As you mentioned, links will be down below.

00:56:01.770 --> 00:56:02.890
<v Speaker 1>And

00:56:02.605 --> 00:56:05.005
<v Speaker 1>this year, I'm actually, gonna try to do

00:56:05.005 --> 00:56:05.805
<v Speaker 1>some,

00:56:06.045 --> 00:56:07.565
<v Speaker 1>really interesting projects.

00:56:08.285 --> 00:56:10.685
<v Speaker 1>So we saw one instance of Gitea running

00:56:10.685 --> 00:56:12.045
<v Speaker 1>on Equinix metal,

00:56:12.285 --> 00:56:13.965
<v Speaker 1>but I'm gonna try something.

00:56:14.285 --> 00:56:16.880
<v Speaker 1>How many instances of Gitea can we run

00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:18.800
<v Speaker 1>on a single server?

00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:21.680
<v Speaker 1>Because

00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:26.480
<v Speaker 1>our RAM resources are extremely low, so let's

00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:28.000
<v Speaker 1>pop open one of those

00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:30.960
<v Speaker 1>super beefy ones or MacConnex, and

00:56:31.905 --> 00:56:33.345
<v Speaker 1>how many can we run?

00:56:34.225 --> 00:56:36.625
<v Speaker 0>I did a a stream

00:56:36.625 --> 00:56:38.225
<v Speaker 0>on Wednesday,

00:56:38.625 --> 00:56:39.185
<v Speaker 0>and

00:56:39.425 --> 00:56:40.625
<v Speaker 0>I used them at

00:56:40.865 --> 00:56:42.145
<v Speaker 0>you know, it's the back machine we're using

00:56:42.145 --> 00:56:43.825
<v Speaker 0>today, but it's it's the modest one on

00:56:43.825 --> 00:56:45.825
<v Speaker 0>Equinix metal. And they have these new machines

00:56:45.825 --> 00:56:46.785
<v Speaker 0>called the a thief,

00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:48.840
<v Speaker 0>and it had a

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.520
<v Speaker 0>terabyte of RAM

00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:51.400
<v Speaker 0>and

00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:53.000
<v Speaker 0>a 28

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.440
<v Speaker 0>cores, I think it was.

00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:55.960
<v Speaker 0>And I was like, I wonder if you

00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:58.119
<v Speaker 0>like, if you're gonna do that test, you

00:56:58.119 --> 00:57:00.615
<v Speaker 0>should get one of those and then see

00:57:00.615 --> 00:57:02.135
<v Speaker 0>how many Giteaus you can run on that

00:57:02.135 --> 00:57:03.735
<v Speaker 0>thing because I would imagine it's a hell

00:57:03.735 --> 00:57:05.895
<v Speaker 0>of a lot, especially with that RAM footprint

00:57:05.895 --> 00:57:06.615
<v Speaker 0>as well.

00:57:07.095 --> 00:57:07.895
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.

00:57:07.895 --> 00:57:08.455
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:57:09.735 --> 00:57:11.095
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Any

00:57:11.735 --> 00:57:14.135
<v Speaker 0>last words before we we finish up today?

00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:17.920
<v Speaker 1>No. I just thank you for having me.

00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:20.880
<v Speaker 1>Thank you everyone in chat for joining us

00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:22.480
<v Speaker 1>on this journey. And,

00:57:23.279 --> 00:57:23.760
<v Speaker 1>yeah,

00:57:24.319 --> 00:57:25.040
<v Speaker 1>please,

00:57:25.279 --> 00:57:28.319
<v Speaker 1>reach out, if you wanna get involved or

00:57:28.415 --> 00:57:30.015
<v Speaker 1>if you wanna set up your own instance

00:57:30.015 --> 00:57:31.455
<v Speaker 1>and you have any questions.

00:57:32.655 --> 00:57:34.895
<v Speaker 1>If you wanna go above and beyond what

00:57:34.895 --> 00:57:37.775
<v Speaker 1>we did today, set up a package registry,

00:57:38.415 --> 00:57:40.494
<v Speaker 1>you can hook it into

00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:43.319
<v Speaker 1>s three if you wanna store your packages

00:57:43.319 --> 00:57:46.520
<v Speaker 1>up there, your Docker containers, your Ruby gems.

00:57:47.079 --> 00:57:49.560
<v Speaker 1>If you wanna enable code search,

00:57:50.599 --> 00:57:51.960
<v Speaker 1>hook into Elasticsearch.

00:57:54.035 --> 00:57:55.155
<v Speaker 1>And you mentioned,

00:57:55.474 --> 00:57:56.515
<v Speaker 1>authentication

00:57:56.515 --> 00:57:56.994
<v Speaker 1>with,

00:57:57.315 --> 00:57:58.674
<v Speaker 1>or verification

00:57:58.674 --> 00:57:59.395
<v Speaker 1>with,

00:58:00.194 --> 00:58:01.155
<v Speaker 1>cosign.

00:58:01.394 --> 00:58:02.515
<v Speaker 1>But we also,

00:58:02.835 --> 00:58:03.954
<v Speaker 1>can hook into,

00:58:04.275 --> 00:58:05.395
<v Speaker 1>things such as,

00:58:05.795 --> 00:58:07.234
<v Speaker 1>small step for

00:58:07.710 --> 00:58:10.510
<v Speaker 1>being able to authenticate with an SSH principle

00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:11.870
<v Speaker 1>and similar

00:58:12.349 --> 00:58:13.150
<v Speaker 1>concept.

00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:14.750
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm

00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:16.910
<v Speaker 1>gonna be working on blog posts for all

00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:19.230
<v Speaker 1>these more advanced topics, so follow us on

00:58:19.230 --> 00:58:20.510
<v Speaker 1>our blog. Yeah.

00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:22.830
<v Speaker 1>And all of our links are down below.

00:58:23.615 --> 00:58:25.295
<v Speaker 0>Yes. I will make sure all the links

00:58:25.295 --> 00:58:27.375
<v Speaker 0>are there shortly after we finish up here

00:58:27.375 --> 00:58:28.095
<v Speaker 0>today.

00:58:29.135 --> 00:58:31.135
<v Speaker 0>And also, I didn't I did click on

00:58:31.135 --> 00:58:32.734
<v Speaker 0>the package thing as well while we were

00:58:32.734 --> 00:58:34.335
<v Speaker 0>chatting, and I forgot to actually talk about

00:58:34.335 --> 00:58:35.855
<v Speaker 0>it. But you said that there's an OCI

00:58:35.855 --> 00:58:36.735
<v Speaker 0>compatible

00:58:37.535 --> 00:58:40.630
<v Speaker 0>store as well. Do you do NPM, PyPI,

00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:41.670
<v Speaker 0>stuff like that?

00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Exactly. All of that. Yeah.

00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:45.430
<v Speaker 0>Nice. Any

00:58:45.830 --> 00:58:46.790
<v Speaker 1>we just

00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:49.510
<v Speaker 1>that was released in 01/17,

00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:51.030
<v Speaker 1>and in 01/18,

00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:53.110
<v Speaker 1>we're still adding even more, like,

00:58:53.875 --> 00:58:54.755
<v Speaker 1>Vagrant

00:58:55.155 --> 00:58:55.955
<v Speaker 1>packages.

00:58:56.035 --> 00:58:58.115
<v Speaker 1>Vagrant boxes was just added.

00:58:58.915 --> 00:59:00.035
<v Speaker 0>Wow. Awesome.

00:59:00.515 --> 00:59:02.355
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, thank you so much for joining

00:59:02.355 --> 00:59:04.755
<v Speaker 0>me today. It's been a pleasure. Very, very

00:59:04.755 --> 00:59:06.675
<v Speaker 0>cool projects. Lots of links will be in

00:59:06.675 --> 00:59:08.275
<v Speaker 0>the show notes, and we will see you

00:59:08.275 --> 00:59:10.530
<v Speaker 0>all again next time. Thank you for watching.

00:59:10.930 --> 00:59:11.650
<v Speaker 0>Have a nice day.
