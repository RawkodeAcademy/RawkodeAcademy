<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes.

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.199
<v Speaker 0>You may or may not be aware that

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:06.319
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes has a max pod limit per node

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:07.840
<v Speaker 0>of a 10.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.679
<v Speaker 0>So you would expect there to be a

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:12.160
<v Speaker 0>max on the number of containers per pod.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.440
<v Speaker 0>Right?
