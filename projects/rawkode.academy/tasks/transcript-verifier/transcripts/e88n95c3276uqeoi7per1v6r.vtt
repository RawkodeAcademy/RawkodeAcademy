00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.910
<v Speaker 0>Hello,

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.470
<v Speaker 0>and welcome back to the Rawkode Academy. I

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.550
<v Speaker 0>am your host, David Flanagan, and today is

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.430
<v Speaker 0>another episode of Rawkode live. A show where

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.750
<v Speaker 0>we take a look at cloud native software

00:02:59.225 --> 00:03:01.705
<v Speaker 0>to help assist you make your Kubernetes cloud

00:03:01.705 --> 00:03:04.105
<v Speaker 0>native microservices lives a little bit easier.

00:03:04.505 --> 00:03:06.345
<v Speaker 0>Today, we have a follow-up episode as we

00:03:06.345 --> 00:03:07.945
<v Speaker 0>take a look at Robusta,

00:03:08.025 --> 00:03:09.065
<v Speaker 0>and specifically,

00:03:09.065 --> 00:03:10.665
<v Speaker 0>we're gonna take a look at how Robusta

00:03:10.665 --> 00:03:13.800
<v Speaker 0>can improve or enhance our monitoring of Kubernetes

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.160
<v Speaker 0>clusters with Previous.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.840
<v Speaker 0>I'm joining us today. Excuse me. I am

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.920
<v Speaker 0>sitting in the freezing cold. It's minus five

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.440
<v Speaker 0>and the heating is broken in my building.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.720
<v Speaker 0>I'm just gonna get that out there in

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 0>case I start shivering.

00:03:25.885 --> 00:03:27.085
<v Speaker 0>Joining us today

00:03:27.725 --> 00:03:30.125
<v Speaker 0>are two wonderful guests that we've had before,

00:03:30.285 --> 00:03:32.445
<v Speaker 0>Nathan and Eric. Hey. How's it going?

00:03:32.925 --> 00:03:34.765
<v Speaker 1>It's going good. Thank you for having us

00:03:34.765 --> 00:03:35.485
<v Speaker 1>back here.

00:03:36.685 --> 00:03:38.365
<v Speaker 0>I tried so hard not to mention that

00:03:38.365 --> 00:03:39.725
<v Speaker 0>it was freezing cold, but I could already

00:03:39.725 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 0>feel my teeth chittering as I talk. So

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.690
<v Speaker 0>I just Yeah.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.410
<v Speaker 1>Like I said before this thing, the things

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.010
<v Speaker 1>that you do for the Internet.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.410
<v Speaker 1>Guys, if you haven't hit that subscribe button.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.410
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'll I'll just I'll let you do

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.690
<v Speaker 0>all the talking today. I appreciate it.

00:03:56.284 --> 00:03:57.005
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:03:57.325 --> 00:03:59.965
<v Speaker 0>For anyone who hasn't seen our last episode

00:03:59.965 --> 00:04:02.284
<v Speaker 0>or isn't familiar with you both on LinkedIn

00:04:02.284 --> 00:04:04.284
<v Speaker 0>and Twitter, etcetera, can you both tell us

00:04:04.284 --> 00:04:05.644
<v Speaker 0>a little bit about you and what you've

00:04:05.644 --> 00:04:06.365
<v Speaker 0>been up to?

00:04:07.245 --> 00:04:08.605
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So what we do is we do

00:04:08.605 --> 00:04:11.670
<v Speaker 1>runbook automation for Kubernetes based Prometheus. And that's

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.670
<v Speaker 1>a mouthful, so I'm gonna break that down

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.950
<v Speaker 1>with an analogy.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.990
<v Speaker 1>So I wanna start with a nontechnical

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.230
<v Speaker 1>example that I'll use to explain what this

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.870
<v Speaker 1>says and why it matters. So let me

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:23.670
<v Speaker 1>share my screen.

00:04:25.815 --> 00:04:28.134
<v Speaker 1>And I'm gonna start off with my favorite

00:04:28.134 --> 00:04:31.335
<v Speaker 1>website on the Internet, me, of course, Reddit.

00:04:31.574 --> 00:04:33.415
<v Speaker 1>And what I have up on here

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:36.294
<v Speaker 1>is a subreddit called, why is this thing?

00:04:36.615 --> 00:04:38.294
<v Speaker 1>And this is a subreddit where you can

00:04:38.294 --> 00:04:39.630
<v Speaker 1>go and

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.710
<v Speaker 1>people go on here and they post pictures

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.150
<v Speaker 1>of different things, and they say, why is

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.910
<v Speaker 1>this thing? So, like, someone here posted a

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.070
<v Speaker 1>picture of this blue disc that they found

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.310
<v Speaker 1>in the bag of crisps. I think crisps

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.710
<v Speaker 1>is British for some kind of snack, but

00:04:53.405 --> 00:04:55.485
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's it's British for chips.

00:04:55.965 --> 00:04:57.565
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.

00:04:57.805 --> 00:04:59.645
<v Speaker 1>And they said, why is this thing? And

00:04:59.645 --> 00:05:01.005
<v Speaker 1>then people go in the comments, they try

00:05:01.005 --> 00:05:03.245
<v Speaker 1>and guess what something is. And this is

00:05:03.245 --> 00:05:05.485
<v Speaker 1>a metaphor for something related to Kubernetes,

00:05:05.485 --> 00:05:06.685
<v Speaker 1>but I'll get there in just a moment.

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:07.930
<v Speaker 1>So

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.729
<v Speaker 1>I wanna take an example that someone posted

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:12.090
<v Speaker 1>a few years ago. This is the number

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.650
<v Speaker 1>three post of all time. And someone posted

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:15.449
<v Speaker 1>on here,

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.169
<v Speaker 1>I found this box in the attic,

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.849
<v Speaker 1>and, you know, what is this thing? And

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:21.050
<v Speaker 1>you look at the box, and it says

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.695
<v Speaker 1>on here, this is radioactive material,

00:05:23.775 --> 00:05:26.414
<v Speaker 1>route one or two, whatever that means. No

00:05:26.414 --> 00:05:28.895
<v Speaker 1>person shall remain within one meter of this

00:05:28.895 --> 00:05:30.414
<v Speaker 1>container unnecessarily.

00:05:30.414 --> 00:05:31.694
<v Speaker 1>And, of course, it's, I guess, in The

00:05:31.694 --> 00:05:33.695
<v Speaker 1>US, so they translate that to three feet.

00:05:34.255 --> 00:05:34.655
<v Speaker 1>If

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.360
<v Speaker 1>you didn't figure out, you should get the

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.560
<v Speaker 1>hell away from this.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.360
<v Speaker 1>And

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.960
<v Speaker 1>radioactive

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.400
<v Speaker 1>units of this thing and so on and

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.080
<v Speaker 1>so on. And they posted this on Reddit,

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.240
<v Speaker 1>and everyone on Reddit said, why are you

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.240
<v Speaker 1>posting this on Reddit? Department

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.800
<v Speaker 1>of Energy.

00:05:49.775 --> 00:05:51.215
<v Speaker 1>The Department of Energy came up to their

00:05:51.215 --> 00:05:52.655
<v Speaker 1>house, and that's like the guys with the

00:05:52.655 --> 00:05:54.815
<v Speaker 1>spacesuits. So they have on the spacesuits, and

00:05:54.815 --> 00:05:56.095
<v Speaker 1>they have that thing that goes beep, the

00:05:56.095 --> 00:05:57.775
<v Speaker 1>Geiger counter, and they're going all over the

00:05:57.775 --> 00:05:58.255
<v Speaker 1>place.

00:05:58.575 --> 00:06:00.095
<v Speaker 1>And the person is certain that he's gonna

00:06:00.095 --> 00:06:01.615
<v Speaker 1>die, and he's gonna be in the hospital,

00:06:01.615 --> 00:06:03.375
<v Speaker 1>or he got, like, a special iodine or

00:06:03.375 --> 00:06:03.935
<v Speaker 1>whatever.

00:06:04.175 --> 00:06:07.030
<v Speaker 1>And after this whole big thing and all

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.470
<v Speaker 1>this excitement,

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.790
<v Speaker 1>it turned out that it was all a

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:11.910
<v Speaker 1>false alarm and

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.870
<v Speaker 1>that this box just just had some old

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.150
<v Speaker 1>Raidon paint

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.190
<v Speaker 1>and

00:06:17.545 --> 00:06:19.625
<v Speaker 1>Iridium paint. And for people who aren't familiar

00:06:19.625 --> 00:06:21.465
<v Speaker 1>with it, then they used to paint watches

00:06:21.465 --> 00:06:22.745
<v Speaker 1>so they would glow in the dark with

00:06:22.745 --> 00:06:25.145
<v Speaker 1>this radioactive paint. And it wasn't good, and

00:06:25.145 --> 00:06:26.585
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people got cancer because they

00:06:26.585 --> 00:06:27.945
<v Speaker 1>worked in the factories and they would lick

00:06:27.945 --> 00:06:30.105
<v Speaker 1>it. So you shouldn't go around licking this

00:06:30.105 --> 00:06:31.385
<v Speaker 1>paint, but, like, if you find in your

00:06:31.385 --> 00:06:33.350
<v Speaker 1>attic, you're not gonna die. Everything is fine.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:34.310
<v Speaker 1>Nothing happens.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:36.150
<v Speaker 1>And

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:37.910
<v Speaker 1>now I don't know. I am do you

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.190
<v Speaker 1>do you wanna guess where I'm going with

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.670
<v Speaker 1>this?

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.830
<v Speaker 0>I'm still wondering what the little blue disc

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:42.710
<v Speaker 0>was. But

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh, the the old blue disc is in

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.115
<v Speaker 1>but it's too far off topic. So I

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:49.035
<v Speaker 1>recommend afterwards.

00:06:49.275 --> 00:06:50.075
<v Speaker 1>Me.

00:06:50.315 --> 00:06:51.755
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'm pretty sure we're spend the next

00:06:51.755 --> 00:06:54.075
<v Speaker 0>three hours after the stream on this subreddit,

00:06:54.075 --> 00:06:56.235
<v Speaker 0>just looking through all the most random stuff.

00:06:56.235 --> 00:06:57.675
<v Speaker 0>But I'll let you get back onto your

00:06:57.675 --> 00:06:58.395
<v Speaker 0>your point.

00:06:58.795 --> 00:07:00.555
<v Speaker 1>I'm embarrassed to admit how many of these

00:07:00.555 --> 00:07:01.515
<v Speaker 1>things here are purple.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.020
<v Speaker 1>So, me yeah. So going back to this

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.820
<v Speaker 1>though, the point here is that this is

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.900
<v Speaker 1>really representative of something that happens to us

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.460
<v Speaker 1>all the time in the world of SRE

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.700
<v Speaker 1>and DevOps and when we're operating stuff in

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.115
<v Speaker 1>production. What happens all the time is you

00:07:19.115 --> 00:07:20.875
<v Speaker 1>get some of their in your Slack channel,

00:07:21.195 --> 00:07:24.155
<v Speaker 1>and it could potentially be really bad. And

00:07:24.155 --> 00:07:26.075
<v Speaker 1>you wanna understand as fast as possible,

00:07:26.235 --> 00:07:27.915
<v Speaker 1>is this an alert that is going to

00:07:27.915 --> 00:07:29.515
<v Speaker 1>take down my production? Is this something I

00:07:29.515 --> 00:07:31.120
<v Speaker 1>need to look at right now? Or if

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.880
<v Speaker 1>it's 3AM, can I go back to sleep

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.560
<v Speaker 1>and just deal with this in the morning?

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.120
<v Speaker 1>And now when you get to bigger companies,

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.880
<v Speaker 1>then it's also a matter of responsibility. So

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.200
<v Speaker 1>just like you yourself didn't know by looking

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.520
<v Speaker 1>at this box whether, like, it was a

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.640
<v Speaker 1>big deal or not, you had to call

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.000
<v Speaker 1>that team with the Geiger counters

00:07:46.345 --> 00:07:48.665
<v Speaker 1>and with the spacesuits. In a big company,

00:07:48.665 --> 00:07:50.025
<v Speaker 1>you're not always the person who is not

00:07:50.025 --> 00:07:51.705
<v Speaker 1>even has the context or the knowledge to

00:07:51.705 --> 00:07:53.544
<v Speaker 1>look at and alert and understand what to

00:07:53.544 --> 00:07:55.945
<v Speaker 1>do with it. So what we're trying to

00:07:55.945 --> 00:07:57.465
<v Speaker 1>do with Robusta is when you see a

00:07:57.465 --> 00:08:00.105
<v Speaker 1>radioactive box like this, we're trying to say,

00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:03.370
<v Speaker 1>you know, this box isn't so bad. Like,

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:05.290
<v Speaker 1>okay, you'll call up someone you're disposed of

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:06.889
<v Speaker 1>in a safe manner, but, like, it's okay.

00:08:06.889 --> 00:08:08.570
<v Speaker 1>You can go back to work and relax.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.010
<v Speaker 1>Or we're trying to say, you know, this

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.250
<v Speaker 1>box is actually really bad. Get over your

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.815
<v Speaker 1>house right now. And that's what we call

00:08:14.815 --> 00:08:16.095
<v Speaker 1>runbook automation.

00:08:16.175 --> 00:08:18.175
<v Speaker 1>And in the Kubernetes context now, if I

00:08:18.175 --> 00:08:20.415
<v Speaker 1>jump over to, like, a concrete example, then

00:08:20.415 --> 00:08:23.375
<v Speaker 1>we're taking Prometheus alerts, like this Prometheus alert

00:08:23.375 --> 00:08:25.780
<v Speaker 1>that said pause is crash looping, and we're

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.540
<v Speaker 1>trying to get you as fast as possible

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.500
<v Speaker 1>to understand what does this alert mean? Does

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.820
<v Speaker 1>it mean something? Should I stop everything I'm

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.980
<v Speaker 1>doing and have people investigate what's going on

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.380
<v Speaker 1>in production right now? Or is this something

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.299
<v Speaker 1>like that radioactive box that isn't such a

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:40.100
<v Speaker 1>big deal and can wait?

00:08:43.675 --> 00:08:45.595
<v Speaker 0>Okay. I get it now. I understand the

00:08:45.595 --> 00:08:46.475
<v Speaker 0>Reddit hook.

00:08:47.835 --> 00:08:49.595
<v Speaker 1>So I have to say, I'm

00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:51.835
<v Speaker 1>gonna stop thinking about it. And I'm sure

00:08:51.835 --> 00:08:53.035
<v Speaker 1>there are other people there who won't stop

00:08:53.035 --> 00:08:54.795
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it until we say. So that

00:08:54.795 --> 00:08:57.070
<v Speaker 1>blue thing, the blue chip in the bag,

00:08:58.589 --> 00:09:00.670
<v Speaker 1>they put the they do quality control and

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:02.670
<v Speaker 1>they, like, run some blue chip that's, that's

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:04.990
<v Speaker 1>metallic through. And then they're supposed to identify

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:06.509
<v Speaker 1>all the blue chips and take them out

00:09:06.509 --> 00:09:08.110
<v Speaker 1>of the process. And if a blue chip

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:09.870
<v Speaker 1>escapes the process and gets to the end,

00:09:10.025 --> 00:09:12.105
<v Speaker 1>like something was faulty with the equipment. So

00:09:12.105 --> 00:09:13.865
<v Speaker 1>the blue chip shouldn't have been there. When

00:09:13.865 --> 00:09:15.705
<v Speaker 1>the blue chip goes missing, they know when

00:09:15.705 --> 00:09:17.385
<v Speaker 1>the machines are, like, the production lines has

00:09:17.385 --> 00:09:18.265
<v Speaker 1>broken down.

00:09:18.985 --> 00:09:19.785
<v Speaker 0>Uh-huh.

00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:21.545
<v Speaker 0>There we go. Today, I learned.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:25.149
<v Speaker 1>Now we can stop thinking about that. Okay.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.829
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So David, you've heard a little bit

00:09:30.829 --> 00:09:32.510
<v Speaker 1>about Robusta before. You've seen it a little

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:34.350
<v Speaker 1>bit. So does this make does it make

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:34.670
<v Speaker 1>sense?

00:09:37.115 --> 00:09:38.555
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It does make sense.

00:09:39.115 --> 00:09:40.954
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I think there's you know, one of

00:09:40.954 --> 00:09:42.795
<v Speaker 0>the things I think is really important when

00:09:42.795 --> 00:09:44.555
<v Speaker 0>it comes to operating Kubernetes,

00:09:44.555 --> 00:09:45.995
<v Speaker 0>you know, something that I I do quite

00:09:45.995 --> 00:09:46.954
<v Speaker 0>a lot is trying to

00:09:49.529 --> 00:09:51.930
<v Speaker 0>improve the signal to noise ratio,

00:09:52.089 --> 00:09:55.209
<v Speaker 0>specifically with monitoring as that is very easy

00:09:55.209 --> 00:09:57.290
<v Speaker 0>for you to get alert fatigue for things

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:59.290
<v Speaker 0>to be alert and all the time

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.889
<v Speaker 0>because you know what, Kubernetes is eventually consistent,

00:10:02.889 --> 00:10:05.585
<v Speaker 0>nodes go away, this go away, everything is

00:10:05.585 --> 00:10:08.385
<v Speaker 0>completely ephemeral to a certain degree and that

00:10:08.385 --> 00:10:11.425
<v Speaker 0>reconciliation process will cause alerts depending on how

00:10:11.425 --> 00:10:12.545
<v Speaker 0>you have them tweaked.

00:10:13.025 --> 00:10:13.745
<v Speaker 0>And then

00:10:14.145 --> 00:10:16.960
<v Speaker 0>something I'm guilty of, I guess, is well,

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.720
<v Speaker 0>sometimes I just change the parameters of those

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.720
<v Speaker 0>alerts so that I'm actually not notified as

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.160
<v Speaker 0>quickly as I should be,

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.200
<v Speaker 0>but I'm trying to reduce that noise and

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.360
<v Speaker 0>just get more of the signals.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.204
<v Speaker 0>And that's a wrong approach to do it

00:10:29.204 --> 00:10:30.725
<v Speaker 0>and I'm really hoping that what you're going

00:10:30.725 --> 00:10:32.485
<v Speaker 0>to show us today is actually going to

00:10:32.485 --> 00:10:34.565
<v Speaker 0>give me ways for me to improve that

00:10:35.524 --> 00:10:36.725
<v Speaker 0>just so that

00:10:37.365 --> 00:10:39.204
<v Speaker 0>I get more sleep most of the time

00:10:39.204 --> 00:10:40.725
<v Speaker 0>I guess would be really nice. If you

00:10:40.725 --> 00:10:42.005
<v Speaker 0>get me more sleep, I'll be a happy

00:10:42.005 --> 00:10:42.245
<v Speaker 0>man.

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:45.290
<v Speaker 0>And I still have the original Robusta t

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:46.330
<v Speaker 0>shirt. I don't know if you're still giving

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.090
<v Speaker 0>them away the cube control get sleep but

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:49.850
<v Speaker 0>that thing is great. Yeah. I like like

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:50.650
<v Speaker 0>my sleep.

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:52.890
<v Speaker 1>You got a UI, yes, because I'm so

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:55.529
<v Speaker 1>lucky in a little bit but we still

00:10:55.529 --> 00:10:57.210
<v Speaker 1>have some You're one of the lucky people

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:58.090
<v Speaker 1>with originals.

00:10:58.795 --> 00:10:59.595
<v Speaker 0>Right.

00:11:00.955 --> 00:11:01.515
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:11:03.035 --> 00:11:04.795
<v Speaker 1>So to test to to just touch on

00:11:04.795 --> 00:11:07.035
<v Speaker 1>that and to really, like, about about what

00:11:07.035 --> 00:11:08.715
<v Speaker 1>you said, then, yeah, it's absolutely a goal.

00:11:08.715 --> 00:11:10.475
<v Speaker 1>There's, two challenges. One is always a good

00:11:10.475 --> 00:11:12.660
<v Speaker 1>set of default alerts. So we're doing some

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:14.260
<v Speaker 1>work there, and we're taking existing alerts and

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.020
<v Speaker 1>trying to put it together into a good

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.340
<v Speaker 1>collection and to really add on context to,

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:19.780
<v Speaker 1>like, what does this alert mean?

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.860
<v Speaker 1>And then the other part of what we're

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.860
<v Speaker 1>doing is to really, like, when an alert

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.700
<v Speaker 1>fires, all the data is there.

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:27.995
<v Speaker 1>The problem isn't that the signal isn't there.

00:11:27.995 --> 00:11:29.115
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that the signal is buried

00:11:29.115 --> 00:11:31.435
<v Speaker 1>in data. So you don't really need, like,

00:11:31.435 --> 00:11:34.795
<v Speaker 1>another monitoring system. You don't need more metrics.

00:11:34.795 --> 00:11:36.315
<v Speaker 1>You don't need more alerts. Like, all the

00:11:36.315 --> 00:11:38.075
<v Speaker 1>data is there. You don't need more dogs.

00:11:38.075 --> 00:11:39.274
<v Speaker 1>You have all the dogs. You just need

00:11:39.274 --> 00:11:40.394
<v Speaker 1>to see the right data at the right

00:11:40.394 --> 00:11:42.740
<v Speaker 1>time. So part of, like, one way you

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.899
<v Speaker 1>could describe what we're doing is we're doing

00:11:44.899 --> 00:11:45.779
<v Speaker 1>monitoring

00:11:45.779 --> 00:11:46.900
<v Speaker 1>orchestration.

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.540
<v Speaker 1>So we're orchestrating, like, all your existing monitoring,

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.620
<v Speaker 1>but putting it together and tying it together

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.540
<v Speaker 1>in a coherent picture.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:55.940
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Awesome.

00:11:57.515 --> 00:11:59.995
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So I'll just say two quick words

00:11:59.995 --> 00:12:01.275
<v Speaker 1>about the architecture.

00:12:01.435 --> 00:12:02.875
<v Speaker 1>And then from there, I think we'll just

00:12:02.875 --> 00:12:04.315
<v Speaker 1>jump into a live demo.

00:12:04.635 --> 00:12:06.315
<v Speaker 1>And at the end, maybe we'll jump back

00:12:06.315 --> 00:12:07.915
<v Speaker 1>over here, and I can speak a little

00:12:07.915 --> 00:12:09.675
<v Speaker 1>bit about what's new since last time for

00:12:09.675 --> 00:12:11.830
<v Speaker 1>people who have seen this before, and what

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:12.950
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be doing in the next

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:15.430
<v Speaker 1>year. So just to get started, so a

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:16.470
<v Speaker 1>quick reminder,

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.870
<v Speaker 1>when you're using Prometheus, then typically you have

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.950
<v Speaker 1>a setup where you have Prometheus that generates

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:21.670
<v Speaker 1>alerts,

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.670
<v Speaker 1>and that sends them to their manager.

00:12:24.045 --> 00:12:25.964
<v Speaker 1>And the alert manager has some extra functionality,

00:12:25.964 --> 00:12:28.285
<v Speaker 1>like grouping the alerts together and waiting a

00:12:28.285 --> 00:12:30.205
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of time before it forwards them.

00:12:30.205 --> 00:12:32.365
<v Speaker 1>And then it sends that by webhook to

00:12:32.365 --> 00:12:34.925
<v Speaker 1>destination like Slack or like MS Teams.

00:12:35.565 --> 00:12:38.060
<v Speaker 1>And this is the normal setup. And then

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:39.660
<v Speaker 1>you get in Slack, you get alerts like

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.980
<v Speaker 1>this, which are great, and they sometimes indicate

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.700
<v Speaker 1>real problems, but they don't have context.

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:46.700
<v Speaker 1>So here you can see an example. Here

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.460
<v Speaker 1>you have a crashing pod, but it doesn't

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.540
<v Speaker 1>have context on why the pod is crashing.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:51.340
<v Speaker 1>And

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.185
<v Speaker 1>I like to say when all you have

00:12:53.185 --> 00:12:54.945
<v Speaker 1>is a time series database and everything looks

00:12:54.945 --> 00:12:56.065
<v Speaker 1>like a time series.

00:12:56.225 --> 00:12:56.785
<v Speaker 1>So

00:12:57.265 --> 00:13:00.145
<v Speaker 1>time series databases are excellent at using them

00:13:00.145 --> 00:13:02.705
<v Speaker 1>to write rules, identify when problems occur. They're

00:13:02.705 --> 00:13:04.705
<v Speaker 1>not good at telling you why those issues

00:13:04.705 --> 00:13:07.000
<v Speaker 1>occurred, though. So what we're doing with Robusta

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.080
<v Speaker 1>is we're adding on an additional component. We're

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.000
<v Speaker 1>leaving the first half of this exactly the

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.240
<v Speaker 1>same. So, you that comes from Prometheus to

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.200
<v Speaker 1>alert manager.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.040
<v Speaker 1>And then instead of going directly to stack,

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.080
<v Speaker 1>it gets sent to Robusta.

00:13:17.574 --> 00:13:19.654
<v Speaker 1>And Robusta now has rules that go in

00:13:19.654 --> 00:13:21.735
<v Speaker 1>to gather data about why that are fired

00:13:21.815 --> 00:13:23.975
<v Speaker 1>and what's the context. This is an observability

00:13:23.975 --> 00:13:26.535
<v Speaker 1>engine here or runbook engine if you prefer

00:13:26.535 --> 00:13:28.134
<v Speaker 1>that knows how to take that error and

00:13:28.134 --> 00:13:30.295
<v Speaker 1>correlate it with those Kubernetes objects. So there

00:13:30.295 --> 00:13:31.975
<v Speaker 1>was an inert on the pod. Go to

00:13:31.975 --> 00:13:33.660
<v Speaker 1>that pod, look at it, pull in the

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.780
<v Speaker 1>dogs. There was a pod that was pending.

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Go pull in the output of kubectl get

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.100
<v Speaker 1>events. Show me the reason why it's pending.

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:42.940
<v Speaker 1>And we have rules here in this observability

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.380
<v Speaker 1>engine, so we can go and we can

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:45.980
<v Speaker 1>gather all the data, and then we just

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:47.660
<v Speaker 1>forward it on to destinations like stock.

00:13:50.545 --> 00:13:51.265
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:13:52.065 --> 00:13:54.705
<v Speaker 0>So the runbook engine sets

00:13:55.345 --> 00:13:57.665
<v Speaker 0>it receives all the alert manager alerts, and

00:13:57.665 --> 00:14:00.065
<v Speaker 0>then you have some sort of utility. It

00:14:00.065 --> 00:14:02.300
<v Speaker 0>just goes collect logs and other data and

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.620
<v Speaker 0>then forwards them on to my so the

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.699
<v Speaker 0>Slack or whatever I wanna send those alerts

00:14:06.699 --> 00:14:08.300
<v Speaker 0>to. So you're just kind of retching that

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.139
<v Speaker 0>alert with the information that people need to

00:14:10.139 --> 00:14:12.300
<v Speaker 0>actually understand if it is signal or noise

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:13.820
<v Speaker 0>and what they have to do about it.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:14.300
<v Speaker 0>Right?

00:14:14.699 --> 00:14:15.339
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.

00:14:15.585 --> 00:14:18.065
<v Speaker 1>And the in data and the enrichments here,

00:14:18.065 --> 00:14:20.545
<v Speaker 1>they could be really simple or really complex.

00:14:20.785 --> 00:14:22.545
<v Speaker 1>It's like a simple enrichment as a pod

00:14:22.545 --> 00:14:24.625
<v Speaker 1>is crashing, just fetch the dog for me.

00:14:24.625 --> 00:14:25.905
<v Speaker 1>So now in stock, I get the other

00:14:25.905 --> 00:14:28.545
<v Speaker 1>with that pod's dog. And I'm thinking about,

00:14:28.545 --> 00:14:30.065
<v Speaker 1>like, how a big company works. Like, now

00:14:30.065 --> 00:14:30.945
<v Speaker 1>the developer

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.520
<v Speaker 1>you can route that directly to the developer.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.120
<v Speaker 1>And even if the developer doesn't know that

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.400
<v Speaker 1>much about Kubernetes,

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.400
<v Speaker 1>he can immediately see the dog there, and

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.920
<v Speaker 1>then you can triage it and decide whether

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.160
<v Speaker 1>it's a development issue that the developer should

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.840
<v Speaker 1>look at or if it's an infra issue

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.520
<v Speaker 1>that someone from the infrastructure team should look

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.585
<v Speaker 1>at. So there's simple stuff like dogs, and

00:14:48.585 --> 00:14:51.545
<v Speaker 1>then there's more complex stuff like, a pilot

00:14:51.545 --> 00:14:53.385
<v Speaker 1>with CPU throttle, go and look at the

00:14:53.385 --> 00:14:54.985
<v Speaker 1>memory limits, and look at sorry. Go and

00:14:54.985 --> 00:14:57.145
<v Speaker 1>look at CPU limits, the CPU requests, perform

00:14:57.145 --> 00:14:58.105
<v Speaker 1>some actual

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:00.410
<v Speaker 1>complicated analysis on that and tell me why

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:02.410
<v Speaker 1>it happens. So sometimes we're just pulling in

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:04.970
<v Speaker 1>right the right data, and sometimes we're taking,

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.649
<v Speaker 1>a a known alert and we're going really

00:15:06.649 --> 00:15:07.769
<v Speaker 1>deep on that and tell me why it

00:15:07.769 --> 00:15:08.330
<v Speaker 1>happens.

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:12.015
<v Speaker 0>Is this static or dynamic? And, like, I

00:15:12.015 --> 00:15:14.095
<v Speaker 0>mean, by that, like, have you already defined

00:15:14.095 --> 00:15:16.255
<v Speaker 0>what the collection sources are when an alert

00:15:16.255 --> 00:15:18.255
<v Speaker 0>manager alert triggers, or is this something that

00:15:18.255 --> 00:15:20.015
<v Speaker 0>I enrich with my own logic and code?

00:15:20.015 --> 00:15:22.975
<v Speaker 0>Could I call some arbitrary API? Like, what

00:15:22.975 --> 00:15:24.335
<v Speaker 0>does this runbook engine

00:15:24.735 --> 00:15:27.050
<v Speaker 0>look like from my point of view? Oh,

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:29.930
<v Speaker 1>excellent question. So what it looks like

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:32.089
<v Speaker 1>if you wanna go and you wanna define

00:15:32.089 --> 00:15:34.329
<v Speaker 1>stuff yourself, then it looks like just a

00:15:34.329 --> 00:15:36.490
<v Speaker 1>YAML definition. So you have here a YAML

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:37.930
<v Speaker 1>file that says,

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:40.570
<v Speaker 1>when there's this Prometheus alert for QPod crash

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:42.810
<v Speaker 1>looping, go and reach that with the dogs.

00:15:44.865 --> 00:15:47.185
<v Speaker 1>But most people need to do that. So

00:15:47.185 --> 00:15:48.785
<v Speaker 1>you can go and you can add on

00:15:48.785 --> 00:15:49.825
<v Speaker 1>your own rules,

00:15:50.145 --> 00:15:51.345
<v Speaker 1>and a big part of our focus in

00:15:51.345 --> 00:15:53.425
<v Speaker 1>2023 is gonna make this even easier and

00:15:53.425 --> 00:15:55.185
<v Speaker 1>to add on better documentation

00:15:55.265 --> 00:15:56.785
<v Speaker 1>and to make it super easy to do

00:15:56.785 --> 00:15:58.065
<v Speaker 1>and to add on your own rules.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.720
<v Speaker 1>But out of the box, we define a

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.840
<v Speaker 1>base set of alerts.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.560
<v Speaker 1>If you use Kube Prometheus stack, we define

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.600
<v Speaker 1>base set of enrichments for Kube Prometheus stack.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.120
<v Speaker 1>And out of the box, we try and

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.720
<v Speaker 1>give you something that will work for most

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.320
<v Speaker 1>people that you won't need to fine tune,

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.520
<v Speaker 1>you won't need to customize at all.

00:16:15.365 --> 00:16:16.485
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Cool.

00:16:17.764 --> 00:16:19.285
<v Speaker 1>And then the last thing I'll say, and

00:16:19.285 --> 00:16:21.204
<v Speaker 1>then we'll jump right over already to a

00:16:21.204 --> 00:16:22.084
<v Speaker 1>live demo,

00:16:22.404 --> 00:16:24.805
<v Speaker 1>is we take in more data, not just

00:16:24.805 --> 00:16:26.805
<v Speaker 1>from alert manager. Since the last time that

00:16:26.805 --> 00:16:29.010
<v Speaker 1>you talk, that we talked, I think, we

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:31.490
<v Speaker 1>took over Kube Watch as the official maintainers,

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.250
<v Speaker 1>and we'll be announcing very soon Kube Watch

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:35.490
<v Speaker 1>version two. So this is a utility that

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:37.650
<v Speaker 1>was once by before

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:39.330
<v Speaker 1>it was before

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:41.875
<v Speaker 1>they stopped maintaining it, that tracks all the

00:16:41.875 --> 00:16:44.035
<v Speaker 1>different Kubernetes changes by listening to the API

00:16:44.035 --> 00:16:44.675
<v Speaker 1>server.

00:16:44.915 --> 00:16:47.315
<v Speaker 1>So we take in data from, Kube Watch

00:16:47.315 --> 00:16:48.595
<v Speaker 1>so we can see, like, when an ingress

00:16:48.595 --> 00:16:51.075
<v Speaker 1>changes, and we can see when, pods change,

00:16:51.075 --> 00:16:52.275
<v Speaker 1>and we can see when jobs fail, we

00:16:52.275 --> 00:16:53.980
<v Speaker 1>can get all this data. And we take

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.580
<v Speaker 1>in data from other sources, like from an

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Elasticsearch, we you can send data. We can

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.420
<v Speaker 1>take in data from all these sources, not

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.180
<v Speaker 1>just the Dirt Manager, and then tie them

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:02.940
<v Speaker 1>all together into coherent picture.

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.980
<v Speaker 1>But we're mostly gonna focus on this today

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:06.619
<v Speaker 1>on the others.

00:17:08.455 --> 00:17:09.815
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Awesome.

00:17:09.975 --> 00:17:12.055
<v Speaker 0>Well, I'm excited to play with it. Are

00:17:12.055 --> 00:17:13.815
<v Speaker 0>we moving over to my screen now?

00:17:14.135 --> 00:17:16.214
<v Speaker 1>We are. That's it. I'm done talking.

00:17:16.775 --> 00:17:17.655
<v Speaker 0>That

00:17:17.655 --> 00:17:18.775
<v Speaker 0>means I have to take my hands out

00:17:18.775 --> 00:17:20.855
<v Speaker 0>of my pocket, but we'll do it. So

00:17:21.095 --> 00:17:22.135
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:25.460
<v Speaker 0>I have a terminal

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:29.299
<v Speaker 0>with a Kubernetes cluster running on JKE.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.740
<v Speaker 0>I have two tabs here. One with some

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:34.740
<v Speaker 0>demos that you've sent me. So if anyone

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.020
<v Speaker 0>else wants to check these out in their

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:39.715
<v Speaker 0>own time, you can go to github.com/robusta-dev

00:17:39.715 --> 00:17:41.235
<v Speaker 0>and that is Kubernetes

00:17:41.235 --> 00:17:42.434
<v Speaker 0>dash demos.

00:17:43.075 --> 00:17:44.915
<v Speaker 0>The other one we've got is just your

00:17:44.915 --> 00:17:45.715
<v Speaker 0>Robusta.

00:17:45.715 --> 00:17:47.715
<v Speaker 0>So if you're completely new to Robusta and

00:17:47.715 --> 00:17:49.155
<v Speaker 0>wanna check it out and go to the

00:17:49.155 --> 00:17:50.275
<v Speaker 0>Robusta repository

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:53.030
<v Speaker 0>or the docs. I guess both would work.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:54.470
<v Speaker 0>So

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:55.990
<v Speaker 0>am I

00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:59.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh, we should I should send you to

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:01.350
<v Speaker 1>the docs. Well, I was gonna say like,

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:02.710
<v Speaker 0>am I just gonna go to the docs

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:04.710
<v Speaker 0>and deploy Robusta to this cluster?

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.924
<v Speaker 0>Is it covered in the readme's for the

00:18:06.924 --> 00:18:07.804
<v Speaker 0>demos?

00:18:09.085 --> 00:18:10.524
<v Speaker 0>What's what's what's step one?

00:18:11.164 --> 00:18:12.845
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Yeah. So I sent you a a

00:18:12.845 --> 00:18:15.085
<v Speaker 1>demo re I sent you a demo repository

00:18:15.085 --> 00:18:16.044
<v Speaker 1>in advance,

00:18:16.605 --> 00:18:18.684
<v Speaker 1>but you should start at, like, the normal

00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:20.330
<v Speaker 1>Robusta repository.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.130
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Or just click the big get starting

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:25.130
<v Speaker 1>button for the docs. Yeah. Let's just go

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:27.130
<v Speaker 0>straight to that installation. Alright? So

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:30.410
<v Speaker 0>alright.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:31.610
<v Speaker 0>Zoom. Zoom. Zoom.

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:35.370
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we're going to be installing with

00:18:36.385 --> 00:18:37.184
<v Speaker 0>Helm.

00:18:37.265 --> 00:18:39.105
<v Speaker 0>Do we need to robust the CLI?

00:18:40.145 --> 00:18:41.985
<v Speaker 1>We do. Alright.

00:18:42.705 --> 00:18:44.065
<v Speaker 0>Do I have pip?

00:18:46.145 --> 00:18:47.585
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I think I do. I think it's

00:18:47.585 --> 00:18:48.865
<v Speaker 0>pip three. There we go.

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:51.350
<v Speaker 1>There's another option there that you can just

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:53.509
<v Speaker 1>use Docker container if you don't have pip.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:57.429
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I I don't run Docker desktop that

00:18:57.429 --> 00:18:58.070
<v Speaker 0>often.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:00.230
<v Speaker 0>I actually don't have access to containers really.

00:19:02.195 --> 00:19:04.195
<v Speaker 0>Everything's in Kubernetes now. Right?

00:19:04.915 --> 00:19:06.034
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

00:19:07.875 --> 00:19:09.635
<v Speaker 0>Then we're going to do a robust dot

00:19:09.635 --> 00:19:11.795
<v Speaker 0>gen config. Oh, there's a nice copy button.

00:19:11.795 --> 00:19:13.075
<v Speaker 0>Might as well use that.

00:19:13.715 --> 00:19:15.075
<v Speaker 0>And let's see what this spits out.

00:19:18.429 --> 00:19:20.350
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Do I want to configure a Slack

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:22.350
<v Speaker 0>integration? Do we need that for today or

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:23.309
<v Speaker 0>will I say no?

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:24.990
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be best if there's

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:26.190
<v Speaker 1>a Slack we can add it to. I

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:26.990
<v Speaker 1>think it would be best.

00:19:29.515 --> 00:19:31.034
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:19:34.475 --> 00:19:37.115
<v Speaker 0>Connect Robusta to Slack. Sure.

00:19:39.115 --> 00:19:39.595
<v Speaker 0>Nope.

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:45.309
<v Speaker 0>Too many Slack channels.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.310
<v Speaker 0>That's why wrong profile.

00:19:58.875 --> 00:19:59.754
<v Speaker 0>Is that it?

00:20:00.955 --> 00:20:02.794
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Yep. That's it. That was a bit

00:20:02.794 --> 00:20:03.514
<v Speaker 0>too easy.

00:20:04.955 --> 00:20:06.315
<v Speaker 1>Try. We do our best.

00:20:06.955 --> 00:20:09.274
<v Speaker 1>But there's always issues. There's always issues in

00:20:09.274 --> 00:20:10.714
<v Speaker 1>every live demo. So

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.820
<v Speaker 0>No. I'm definitely saying no to that one.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:19.340
<v Speaker 0>What is the Robusta UI sync?

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.540
<v Speaker 1>So that's our SaaS platform. I would recommend

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.220
<v Speaker 1>enabling that for the demo.

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:24.780
<v Speaker 1>Me.

00:20:28.645 --> 00:20:30.005
<v Speaker 0>So do I need to sign up to

00:20:30.005 --> 00:20:31.205
<v Speaker 0>Robusta SaaS?

00:20:32.405 --> 00:20:34.245
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You just put in here. Just put

00:20:34.245 --> 00:20:35.605
<v Speaker 1>in an email. You don't need us so

00:20:35.605 --> 00:20:37.445
<v Speaker 1>you don't need us set up anywhere else.

00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:39.445
<v Speaker 1>Just put in a new email. Yeah. That's

00:20:39.445 --> 00:20:40.725
<v Speaker 1>it. It'll generate it for you.

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:51.149
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:54.429
<v Speaker 0>So Robusta can use Prometheus as an alert

00:20:54.429 --> 00:20:55.229
<v Speaker 0>source.

00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:57.950
<v Speaker 0>You can

00:20:56.935 --> 00:20:59.575
<v Speaker 0>install a preconfigured Prometheus. Yes, please.

00:21:04.615 --> 00:21:05.095
<v Speaker 0>Sure.

00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:13.190
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So this has generated

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:16.309
<v Speaker 0>helm values file.

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.549
<v Speaker 0>Oh, bunch of keys in there.

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:19.590
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:23.029
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:21:23.445 --> 00:21:25.605
<v Speaker 0>I'll just show everybody them. That's not important.

00:21:25.605 --> 00:21:26.084
<v Speaker 0>Right?

00:21:26.644 --> 00:21:27.924
<v Speaker 1>No. It's fine.

00:21:31.205 --> 00:21:34.245
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So let's add the rebuster repository

00:21:34.245 --> 00:21:36.325
<v Speaker 0>and run a helm update.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.640
<v Speaker 0>And then we do an install.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.360
<v Speaker 0>And I'll need to change.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.600
<v Speaker 0>Do I have a small cluster?

00:21:50.804 --> 00:21:52.725
<v Speaker 1>No. I don't think so. Alright.

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:12.540
<v Speaker 0>I guess this might just take a wee

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:13.100
<v Speaker 0>minute.

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:15.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. No worries.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.020
<v Speaker 0>So what time is it where you're at?

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.060
<v Speaker 1>It's 07:30 over here.

00:22:22.595 --> 00:22:23.235
<v Speaker 1>You?

00:22:24.435 --> 00:22:25.395
<v Speaker 0>05:30.

00:22:26.435 --> 00:22:27.154
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:22:28.195 --> 00:22:28.995
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:22:30.035 --> 00:22:31.554
<v Speaker 0>Is it cold where you are?

00:22:32.755 --> 00:22:35.235
<v Speaker 1>Oh, it's all the matter. It's active. I

00:22:35.235 --> 00:22:36.355
<v Speaker 1>I can't say yes.

00:22:39.549 --> 00:22:41.629
<v Speaker 0>It still made us five. Okay.

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:44.429
<v Speaker 0>Okay. It looks like we're installed.

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:47.309
<v Speaker 0>It looks like I can go to platformrobusta.dev

00:22:47.309 --> 00:22:48.989
<v Speaker 0>for some sort of web UI.

00:22:49.549 --> 00:22:51.789
<v Speaker 0>And I'm assuming if I run

00:22:52.184 --> 00:22:55.544
<v Speaker 0>get pods, we'll see some Robusta stuff happening.

00:22:55.544 --> 00:22:56.664
<v Speaker 0>There. There we go.

00:22:57.225 --> 00:22:58.024
<v Speaker 1>Cool.

00:23:00.585 --> 00:23:01.945
<v Speaker 0>Alright. What do you want me to do

00:23:01.945 --> 00:23:02.504
<v Speaker 0>next?

00:23:04.024 --> 00:23:05.384
<v Speaker 1>Let's go back to the docs.

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:10.450
<v Speaker 1>And

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:13.250
<v Speaker 1>let's just wait, I guess, until the pods

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:14.529
<v Speaker 1>are up and running.

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:17.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So that's just the command there.

00:23:18.635 --> 00:23:20.635
<v Speaker 1>And then we're gonna crash some stuff. Let's

00:23:20.635 --> 00:23:22.075
<v Speaker 1>break some stuff in your cluster.

00:23:22.235 --> 00:23:23.514
<v Speaker 0>That I can handle.

00:23:25.595 --> 00:23:26.234
<v Speaker 1>And

00:23:26.395 --> 00:23:28.075
<v Speaker 1>that's some fun. You should have also gotten

00:23:28.075 --> 00:23:30.630
<v Speaker 1>a message on Slack, I believe. It sends

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:32.710
<v Speaker 1>a message just to confirm the Slack channel.

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:33.350
<v Speaker 1>So

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:36.230
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna wanna bring up Slack too.

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:39.190
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:24:14.415 --> 00:24:15.855
<v Speaker 0>So

00:24:17.295 --> 00:24:18.895
<v Speaker 0>we have all the pods

00:24:19.295 --> 00:24:21.215
<v Speaker 0>and then you want me to deploy this

00:24:21.215 --> 00:24:22.415
<v Speaker 0>thing to break stuff?

00:24:22.895 --> 00:24:24.975
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That's deploy crashing pods.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.799
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We have a crash in pods.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:39.880
<v Speaker 0>So does this mean I'm gonna see something

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.480
<v Speaker 0>in my Slack channel?

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.000
<v Speaker 1>You should. Yeah.

00:24:44.945 --> 00:24:47.424
<v Speaker 0>I don't know why that keeps deselecting.

00:24:54.145 --> 00:24:55.985
<v Speaker 1>You have to wait them we don't send

00:24:55.985 --> 00:24:58.100
<v Speaker 1>it on the first crash because, this is

00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:59.540
<v Speaker 1>exactly the type of thing that you spoke

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:01.460
<v Speaker 1>about. Right? Like, you have these transient issues

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:02.580
<v Speaker 1>with Kubernetes,

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:05.620
<v Speaker 1>and you don't wanna alert as soon as

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.340
<v Speaker 1>something happens that, like, that second, it's gonna

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.500
<v Speaker 1>then disappear. So we try and always find

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.580
<v Speaker 1>the right balance. What's the point where this

00:25:12.165 --> 00:25:13.925
<v Speaker 1>is really an issue that you then want

00:25:13.925 --> 00:25:16.325
<v Speaker 1>to get notified, not just a transient issue.

00:25:18.245 --> 00:25:20.165
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we have a

00:25:21.845 --> 00:25:23.285
<v Speaker 0>high severity

00:25:23.285 --> 00:25:25.845
<v Speaker 0>crashing pod. We have an investigate button.

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.920
<v Speaker 0>It's telling us it's crashed twice. It's gonna

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.240
<v Speaker 0>crash it back off and it's collected some

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.760
<v Speaker 0>logs from the

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.240
<v Speaker 0>application. Quite a lot of logs from the

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:35.880
<v Speaker 0>application.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.960
<v Speaker 0>I can't believe you put Java in my

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.480
<v Speaker 0>cluster. You know I have rules about that.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:39.640
<v Speaker 0>Right?

00:25:41.045 --> 00:25:41.845
<v Speaker 1>I actually

00:25:42.645 --> 00:25:44.165
<v Speaker 1>if you wanna okay. Take a look at

00:25:44.165 --> 00:25:45.205
<v Speaker 1>what that is.

00:25:45.445 --> 00:25:47.445
<v Speaker 1>Take a look at take a look at

00:25:47.445 --> 00:25:48.325
<v Speaker 1>the pod that's running.

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:55.549
<v Speaker 0>Computer.

00:26:00.669 --> 00:26:02.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a monster. I only put Java

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:05.309
<v Speaker 1>in there. Oh, it's BusyBox. Right. Okay.

00:26:07.505 --> 00:26:10.384
<v Speaker 1>It's a BusyBox command that outputs. Well, according

00:26:10.384 --> 00:26:12.225
<v Speaker 1>to Google, it was the world's dark longest

00:26:12.225 --> 00:26:13.344
<v Speaker 1>Java exception.

00:26:13.585 --> 00:26:15.904
<v Speaker 0>Well, yes. Slack warning told me, do I

00:26:15.904 --> 00:26:18.065
<v Speaker 0>want to expand this thousand line

00:26:18.945 --> 00:26:19.904
<v Speaker 0>log message.

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:23.110
<v Speaker 1>It is experience.

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh,

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:27.429
<v Speaker 0>yeah. That's the truncated to a 68 lines.

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:32.550
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We have a crashing pod. We got

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:33.350
<v Speaker 0>a nice alert.

00:26:35.085 --> 00:26:36.044
<v Speaker 0>What's next?

00:26:37.485 --> 00:26:39.485
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So let's

00:26:39.485 --> 00:26:41.485
<v Speaker 1>go and let's go over now to the

00:26:41.485 --> 00:26:43.885
<v Speaker 1>demo scenarios repository that I sent you, and

00:26:43.885 --> 00:26:45.725
<v Speaker 1>let's deploy some more stuff from over there.

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:51.360
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.440
<v Speaker 0>So that demo one was just to show

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:56.080
<v Speaker 0>the Slack integration that's posting something to my

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.120
<v Speaker 0>my channel.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:59.920
<v Speaker 1>Yep. And now we'll show an example of

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.160
<v Speaker 1>a different error that occurs where we pull

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.274
<v Speaker 1>in different data.

00:27:03.595 --> 00:27:06.075
<v Speaker 0>So Okay. So these demos then are demos

00:27:06.075 --> 00:27:07.914
<v Speaker 0>that you're going to show off the enrichment

00:27:07.914 --> 00:27:09.755
<v Speaker 0>process that you covered on the slides and

00:27:09.755 --> 00:27:11.995
<v Speaker 0>how that gives us more context than to

00:27:11.995 --> 00:27:13.434
<v Speaker 0>what's actually crashing. Right?

00:27:13.835 --> 00:27:16.075
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Exactly. And we've tried to pick the

00:27:16.075 --> 00:27:17.995
<v Speaker 1>demo scenarios so they don't actually mess up

00:27:17.995 --> 00:27:20.529
<v Speaker 1>your cluster. Like, I love to show how,

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:22.049
<v Speaker 1>for example, we have an issue with those

00:27:22.049 --> 00:27:22.929
<v Speaker 1>disk space,

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:24.529
<v Speaker 1>and then we pull in,

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:26.929
<v Speaker 1>like, a graph of the disk usage on

00:27:26.929 --> 00:27:28.769
<v Speaker 1>that node. But if I do that, that's

00:27:28.769 --> 00:27:30.210
<v Speaker 1>gonna actually mess up one of your nodes.

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:32.505
<v Speaker 1>Now in your case, that's okay, But we

00:27:32.505 --> 00:27:35.225
<v Speaker 1>try demo scenarios that won't really mess up

00:27:35.225 --> 00:27:36.025
<v Speaker 1>a cluster.

00:27:36.185 --> 00:27:36.745
<v Speaker 1>So,

00:27:37.145 --> 00:27:38.825
<v Speaker 1>I mean, it's mostly stuff that there's an

00:27:38.825 --> 00:27:40.345
<v Speaker 1>issue with this specific part.

00:27:41.065 --> 00:27:42.585
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. This is just a

00:27:42.985 --> 00:27:44.745
<v Speaker 0>cluster for today. So if you wanna break

00:27:44.745 --> 00:27:46.585
<v Speaker 0>it to pieces, it is completely fine by

00:27:46.585 --> 00:27:46.745
<v Speaker 0>me.

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:50.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So let's get started with if you

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:52.770
<v Speaker 1>go down a little bit, then in the

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:54.690
<v Speaker 1>read me, we have there something about the

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:55.409
<v Speaker 1>kill.

00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:58.370
<v Speaker 1>That should be the second one. Yep.

00:27:59.985 --> 00:28:03.184
<v Speaker 1>So let's just run that from the, REPL

00:28:03.184 --> 00:28:04.304
<v Speaker 1>that you checked out.

00:28:06.545 --> 00:28:07.745
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I've not cloned it yet.

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:20.590
<v Speaker 1>Who's that in the chat that said I'm

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:21.950
<v Speaker 1>finally breaking stuff?

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:26.670
<v Speaker 0>Hey, LP. He isn't it?

00:28:28.365 --> 00:28:29.164
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:28:29.165 --> 00:28:29.885
<v Speaker 0>So

00:28:31.645 --> 00:28:32.684
<v Speaker 0>let's apply.

00:28:33.165 --> 00:28:35.325
<v Speaker 0>Oh, it doesn't exist. I'm just doing what

00:28:35.325 --> 00:28:35.885
<v Speaker 1>I do best.

00:28:40.679 --> 00:28:41.720
<v Speaker 0>A typo.

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.479
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

00:28:48.039 --> 00:28:49.640
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming this is going to be a

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.400
<v Speaker 0>pod that eats up a whole bunch of

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:51.799
<v Speaker 0>memory.

00:28:54.195 --> 00:28:56.914
<v Speaker 2>Indeed. And getting unclean. So this one is

00:28:56.914 --> 00:28:58.034
<v Speaker 0>Java then. Right?

00:29:03.154 --> 00:29:05.235
<v Speaker 1>It's gotta be. So what do you need

00:29:05.235 --> 00:29:07.235
<v Speaker 2>to see when when your pod is unclean?

00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:10.169
<v Speaker 2>What what do you you usually check?

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:12.330
<v Speaker 0>I

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:15.850
<v Speaker 0>wanna check the resource constraints to see what

00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:18.490
<v Speaker 0>the the memory limits are set at. And,

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:20.010
<v Speaker 0>obviously, if I can get some information from

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:20.650
<v Speaker 0>Prometheus,

00:29:21.145 --> 00:29:23.385
<v Speaker 0>I'd normally like to see it's a tumbling

00:29:23.385 --> 00:29:24.985
<v Speaker 0>value over the last thirty minutes to see

00:29:24.985 --> 00:29:26.505
<v Speaker 0>if this was, like, a blip or if

00:29:26.505 --> 00:29:29.544
<v Speaker 0>it was a gradual growth, something like that.

00:29:30.025 --> 00:29:31.865
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. That's that's makes sense.

00:29:32.184 --> 00:29:32.424
<v Speaker 2>Now

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.320
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna try and, like,

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.960
<v Speaker 2>listen to people like you and then gather

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.759
<v Speaker 2>that information upfront and send it to you.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Well, go over to Slack, see how

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:45.559
<v Speaker 1>we did on this one.

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:46.840
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:29:48.135 --> 00:29:49.575
<v Speaker 0>I've got too many tabs, I don't wanna

00:29:49.575 --> 00:29:51.015
<v Speaker 0>put anything. There we go.

00:29:53.415 --> 00:29:56.294
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we got our high severity

00:29:56.455 --> 00:29:57.735
<v Speaker 0>pod umco,

00:29:58.935 --> 00:30:01.400
<v Speaker 0>namespace node name. Okay. So we got the

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.400
<v Speaker 0>node allocated memory, that's useful right off the

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:03.879
<v Speaker 0>bat.

00:30:04.919 --> 00:30:07.480
<v Speaker 0>The container name is memory eater. Nice.

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.039
<v Speaker 0>And we can see the request and a

00:30:10.039 --> 00:30:11.559
<v Speaker 0>limit right in front of us.

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:13.160
<v Speaker 0>So,

00:30:14.345 --> 00:30:16.505
<v Speaker 0>yeah. That's quite a good amount of information

00:30:16.505 --> 00:30:17.225
<v Speaker 0>upfront.

00:30:17.545 --> 00:30:19.225
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming it's been on code because it's

00:30:19.225 --> 00:30:20.745
<v Speaker 0>at the hundred meg limit and then we've

00:30:20.745 --> 00:30:21.865
<v Speaker 0>got some links.

00:30:22.025 --> 00:30:24.184
<v Speaker 0>Are these oh, that's a binary.

00:30:25.225 --> 00:30:27.145
<v Speaker 1>So it's Oh, it's an SVG.

00:30:27.785 --> 00:30:29.625
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. But you can open up not the

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:31.930
<v Speaker 1>PNG version. We're gonna knock out those SVG

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:34.970
<v Speaker 1>those SVGs soon because that doesn't run well.

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:39.129
<v Speaker 0>Oh, sweet. So we get that tumbling value.

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:40.650
<v Speaker 0>So I can actually see that it's quite

00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:41.210
<v Speaker 0>a

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:43.530
<v Speaker 0>quite a claim.

00:30:46.395 --> 00:30:49.195
<v Speaker 0>And the node looks okay. The memory chart

00:30:49.195 --> 00:30:51.035
<v Speaker 2>for your pod and for your node, and

00:30:51.035 --> 00:30:52.635
<v Speaker 2>then hopefully,

00:30:52.635 --> 00:30:54.635
<v Speaker 2>gives you a lot more context on your

00:30:54.635 --> 00:30:56.315
<v Speaker 2>your own kid's pod.

00:30:57.515 --> 00:30:57.835
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:00.669
<v Speaker 0>I see a line, a scary line. I

00:31:00.669 --> 00:31:02.349
<v Speaker 0>don't trust this workload anymore.

00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:04.750
<v Speaker 0>I guess Now

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:06.349
<v Speaker 0>Sorry, Nico.

00:31:06.909 --> 00:31:09.549
<v Speaker 1>It's an example that's optimized for demos. But,

00:31:09.549 --> 00:31:11.070
<v Speaker 1>like, in a real life scenario, then you'd

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:12.825
<v Speaker 1>see spikiness, and then you'd see also if

00:31:12.825 --> 00:31:14.184
<v Speaker 1>it's going up over time and then you

00:31:14.184 --> 00:31:16.024
<v Speaker 1>know there's a memory leak there as well.

00:31:17.865 --> 00:31:19.625
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Like, you know, if this was a

00:31:19.625 --> 00:31:21.065
<v Speaker 0>real production application

00:31:22.105 --> 00:31:24.264
<v Speaker 0>and then something gets unkilled,

00:31:24.505 --> 00:31:26.265
<v Speaker 0>been able to see that memory claim because

00:31:26.265 --> 00:31:28.105
<v Speaker 0>you always wanna know whether this is just,

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:32.120
<v Speaker 0>you know, it's just consistent growth. You know,

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.639
<v Speaker 0>it's just it's just running over time and

00:31:33.639 --> 00:31:35.240
<v Speaker 0>maybe we just need to set we need

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.919
<v Speaker 0>to restart that pod every six hours or

00:31:36.919 --> 00:31:38.600
<v Speaker 0>something, which is our hacky fix, but we've

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.279
<v Speaker 0>all done it. Right? Because because we have

00:31:40.279 --> 00:31:42.345
<v Speaker 0>some memory leak, we've not debugged yet. Or

00:31:42.345 --> 00:31:44.585
<v Speaker 0>it could be that it's just absolute context

00:31:44.585 --> 00:31:45.385
<v Speaker 0>situation

00:31:45.385 --> 00:31:47.065
<v Speaker 0>where, oh, maybe we got a spike of

00:31:47.065 --> 00:31:49.225
<v Speaker 0>10,000 users in a fifteen minute window and

00:31:49.225 --> 00:31:51.385
<v Speaker 0>that caused our Redis cache to just completely

00:31:51.385 --> 00:31:53.385
<v Speaker 0>fill up and fall over. Like, you know,

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.800
<v Speaker 0>not until you start to connect these dots

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.720
<v Speaker 0>of all these disparate systems within your cluster

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.640
<v Speaker 0>that you really understand what is actually happening

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.519
<v Speaker 0>here. So

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.640
<v Speaker 1>Exactly. Yeah. So what we're trying to do

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.720
<v Speaker 1>is make it easier to connect those dots

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.480
<v Speaker 1>where we can't connect them automatically.

00:32:08.025 --> 00:32:09.545
<v Speaker 1>And where you have dots that you know

00:32:09.545 --> 00:32:11.225
<v Speaker 1>makes sense to connect and to also make

00:32:11.225 --> 00:32:13.385
<v Speaker 1>it easy for you to connect them and

00:32:13.385 --> 00:32:14.985
<v Speaker 1>even easy for you to say, okay. Well,

00:32:14.985 --> 00:32:16.105
<v Speaker 1>next time this happens,

00:32:16.585 --> 00:32:19.065
<v Speaker 1>like, okay. Go and restart this pod after

00:32:19.065 --> 00:32:20.985
<v Speaker 1>five hours before it reaches the six hour

00:32:20.985 --> 00:32:22.665
<v Speaker 1>mark when it's at 80% mark.

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:25.260
<v Speaker 0>So these attachments

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:27.659
<v Speaker 0>on like, I I I don't know how

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:30.940
<v Speaker 0>this is configured, this trigger and the actions

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:33.340
<v Speaker 0>and stuff like that. But can I add

00:32:33.419 --> 00:32:36.220
<v Speaker 0>new PNGs with different queries against the Prometheus?

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:37.659
<v Speaker 0>Is that something that's an option?

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:39.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Exactly.

00:32:39.765 --> 00:32:41.765
<v Speaker 1>You can indeed. Do you wanna go over

00:32:41.765 --> 00:32:44.245
<v Speaker 1>to the GitHub, the main GitHub for Robusta

00:32:44.245 --> 00:32:46.325
<v Speaker 1>and check out the helm values file?

00:32:48.245 --> 00:32:48.645
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

00:32:54.289 --> 00:32:55.330
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

00:32:57.090 --> 00:32:59.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And now over here, that's just going

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:01.890
<v Speaker 1>to the Helm folder and then right into

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:03.489
<v Speaker 1>the default values file.

00:33:05.169 --> 00:33:06.370
<v Speaker 1>And look in here for.

00:33:12.505 --> 00:33:13.304
<v Speaker 0>This one?

00:33:13.625 --> 00:33:15.385
<v Speaker 1>Yep. And that's just how it's configured.

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.960
<v Speaker 0>Okay. What are these special terms in the

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:28.759
<v Speaker 0>Robusta?

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:33.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So we have here three different enrichers.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.795
<v Speaker 1>One of them is pulling in that data

00:33:34.795 --> 00:33:35.595
<v Speaker 1>that you saw,

00:33:35.995 --> 00:33:37.995
<v Speaker 1>the pod and killer enricher.

00:33:38.795 --> 00:33:40.875
<v Speaker 1>The other one is a little bit more

00:33:40.875 --> 00:33:42.875
<v Speaker 1>generic, but it's it's creating that graph, but

00:33:42.875 --> 00:33:45.115
<v Speaker 1>it's optimized specifically for the scenario so it

00:33:45.115 --> 00:33:46.554
<v Speaker 1>knows to add on the limits.

00:33:46.715 --> 00:33:48.475
<v Speaker 1>And then the third one is totally generic.

00:33:48.475 --> 00:33:50.400
<v Speaker 1>It just says take this pod, go with

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.880
<v Speaker 1>whatever node it's running on, and grab their

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.800
<v Speaker 1>graph of the memory from that node that

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.160
<v Speaker 1>this pod is running on.

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.080
<v Speaker 0>Nice. Okay.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.320
<v Speaker 0>Cool. So I can add more of these.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:04.914
<v Speaker 0>What kind of enrichers are available then to

00:34:04.914 --> 00:34:06.514
<v Speaker 0>people? Is there a list somewhere?

00:34:07.394 --> 00:34:09.715
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Yep. Yeah. But this documentation,

00:34:10.514 --> 00:34:11.954
<v Speaker 1>and this is the main area, by the

00:34:11.954 --> 00:34:14.034
<v Speaker 1>way, like, that we're really gonna focus on

00:34:14.034 --> 00:34:16.275
<v Speaker 1>in 2023 and making this way easier to

00:34:16.275 --> 00:34:16.995
<v Speaker 1>navigate

00:34:17.155 --> 00:34:19.210
<v Speaker 1>and way easier to use. So this is

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:21.210
<v Speaker 1>gonna be a big focus of ours.

00:34:21.450 --> 00:34:22.730
<v Speaker 1>If you look on the left hand side

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:23.610
<v Speaker 1>of the page,

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:25.370
<v Speaker 1>then you can find there,

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:27.130
<v Speaker 1>on the left hand side of the page

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:28.570
<v Speaker 1>in the menu, there's something there that says

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:29.050
<v Speaker 1>actions.

00:34:33.025 --> 00:34:33.824
<v Speaker 0>Got it.

00:34:35.105 --> 00:34:37.185
<v Speaker 1>And we have here all these different actions.

00:34:40.945 --> 00:34:42.864
<v Speaker 1>Nice. And no, it's bash enricher.

00:34:42.864 --> 00:34:44.304
<v Speaker 0>I could have some fun with that one.

00:34:45.039 --> 00:34:46.480
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'm assuming I could just write a

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.559
<v Speaker 0>bash script and lane and the yaml and

00:34:48.559 --> 00:34:50.159
<v Speaker 0>then does this run it or

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Click on the example config.

00:34:53.599 --> 00:34:56.000
<v Speaker 0>See that that's awesome. Right? Like,

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:58.175
<v Speaker 0>I used to be an SRE and I

00:34:58.175 --> 00:34:59.775
<v Speaker 0>used to give talks about how terrible I

00:34:59.775 --> 00:35:02.015
<v Speaker 0>was at being an SRE. Right? Because I

00:35:02.015 --> 00:35:04.015
<v Speaker 0>used to get alerts at 03:00 in the

00:35:04.015 --> 00:35:05.375
<v Speaker 0>morning and we had a a six month

00:35:05.375 --> 00:35:06.815
<v Speaker 0>old at this time. Right? So my wife

00:35:06.815 --> 00:35:08.415
<v Speaker 0>was already hating the fact that she'd only

00:35:08.415 --> 00:35:09.935
<v Speaker 0>been asleep for ten minutes and my alerts

00:35:09.935 --> 00:35:10.815
<v Speaker 0>gone off crazy.

00:35:11.609 --> 00:35:13.130
<v Speaker 0>So I would always just, like, grab my

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:14.569
<v Speaker 0>laptop and it would be like a disk

00:35:14.569 --> 00:35:16.490
<v Speaker 0>alert and say, oh, you're at 96% or

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:17.050
<v Speaker 0>whatever.

00:35:17.609 --> 00:35:19.369
<v Speaker 0>And I would just go on and delete

00:35:19.369 --> 00:35:21.369
<v Speaker 0>the log directory on a Linux machine. Like,

00:35:21.369 --> 00:35:22.970
<v Speaker 0>I because I just wanted to go back

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:24.890
<v Speaker 0>to sleep, but I never actually spent enough

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:26.250
<v Speaker 0>time to work it out and do it

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:28.305
<v Speaker 0>properly. But if we had the ability if

00:35:28.305 --> 00:35:30.145
<v Speaker 0>I had the ability to just have a

00:35:30.145 --> 00:35:31.665
<v Speaker 0>bash command and, like, run, like, a d

00:35:31.665 --> 00:35:33.744
<v Speaker 0>u dash h against the directories, do a

00:35:33.744 --> 00:35:35.425
<v Speaker 0>depth on it, and kind of analyze where

00:35:35.425 --> 00:35:37.505
<v Speaker 0>the actual consumption is coming from and identify

00:35:37.505 --> 00:35:39.505
<v Speaker 0>the process. Like, I could chain a bunch

00:35:39.505 --> 00:35:41.345
<v Speaker 0>of these bash commands together and I would

00:35:41.345 --> 00:35:43.345
<v Speaker 0>have all the information I need to actually

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.920
<v Speaker 0>fix it once and for all instead of

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:46.600
<v Speaker 0>just taking the lazy approach.

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.520
<v Speaker 0>So but, yeah, that's really cool. I'm glad

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:49.800
<v Speaker 0>that's the first one I've seen.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Exactly. And I see there's a comment

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.240
<v Speaker 1>here in the chat.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.960
<v Speaker 1>Wind is asking, does it create just Prometheus

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:56.760
<v Speaker 1>rules

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:58.280
<v Speaker 1>objects in the cluster?

00:35:58.520 --> 00:35:58.840
<v Speaker 1>So,

00:35:59.445 --> 00:36:02.005
<v Speaker 1>yeah, the answer is, yes and no.

00:36:02.325 --> 00:36:04.965
<v Speaker 1>We do create Prometheus rules in the cluster

00:36:05.205 --> 00:36:07.285
<v Speaker 1>if you take the default alerts that we

00:36:07.285 --> 00:36:07.925
<v Speaker 1>provide.

00:36:08.165 --> 00:36:09.605
<v Speaker 1>And if you already have other manager rather

00:36:09.605 --> 00:36:11.045
<v Speaker 1>than you already have Prometheus,

00:36:11.045 --> 00:36:12.325
<v Speaker 1>then you can disable that. You can just

00:36:12.325 --> 00:36:14.560
<v Speaker 1>say use my existing Don't create any rules

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.800
<v Speaker 1>for me. And then the second part of

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.200
<v Speaker 1>this is we're not just creating those Prometheus

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:22.560
<v Speaker 1>rules. We're taking those, like, the Prometheus Prometheus

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.880
<v Speaker 1>alerts, and then we're tying them together

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.515
<v Speaker 1>to, like, the different context gathering in the

00:36:27.515 --> 00:36:29.914
<v Speaker 1>runbook automation. So, essentially, we're doing two things.

00:36:29.914 --> 00:36:32.315
<v Speaker 1>We're installing default alerts if you don't already

00:36:32.315 --> 00:36:34.555
<v Speaker 1>have them, and that does create Prometheus rules.

00:36:34.634 --> 00:36:35.994
<v Speaker 1>And then the second thing that we always

00:36:35.994 --> 00:36:37.914
<v Speaker 1>do is we take those alerts, and we

00:36:37.914 --> 00:36:39.755
<v Speaker 1>now pull in the right context.

00:36:39.914 --> 00:36:41.355
<v Speaker 1>And for that, you you can't do that

00:36:41.355 --> 00:36:43.829
<v Speaker 1>with Prometheus alone because it's not just based

00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:45.350
<v Speaker 1>on time series databases.

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:46.869
<v Speaker 1>It's, like, not just based on looking at

00:36:46.869 --> 00:36:48.710
<v Speaker 1>time series. It's saying, okay. Here's an alert.

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:51.109
<v Speaker 1>Look at the labels here. Has this label

00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:53.270
<v Speaker 1>saying that's running on this node. Go run

00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:55.190
<v Speaker 1>this batch command on that node and so

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.430
<v Speaker 1>on.

00:36:57.185 --> 00:36:57.985
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:36:58.865 --> 00:37:00.545
<v Speaker 2>So a big part of what we do

00:37:00.545 --> 00:37:01.505
<v Speaker 2>is not only

00:37:01.745 --> 00:37:04.145
<v Speaker 2>building the platform that enables to do that,

00:37:04.145 --> 00:37:05.185
<v Speaker 2>but we also

00:37:05.585 --> 00:37:08.545
<v Speaker 2>want to collect the community knowledge. So if

00:37:08.545 --> 00:37:09.265
<v Speaker 2>you have

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.880
<v Speaker 2>some insights about some specific alert and you

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:13.360
<v Speaker 2>know

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.640
<v Speaker 2>as someone who who is specialized in that,

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.080
<v Speaker 2>what exactly you need to do, you can

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:19.120
<v Speaker 2>actually contribute

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.680
<v Speaker 2>your own playbook and even your own alert,

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:22.320
<v Speaker 2>and then

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.280
<v Speaker 2>everyone else can enjoy the the benefit of

00:37:26.445 --> 00:37:27.725
<v Speaker 1>It's about taking

00:37:27.965 --> 00:37:29.405
<v Speaker 1>it's like you said at the beginning. Right?

00:37:29.405 --> 00:37:30.685
<v Speaker 1>Like, you have all the data there, and

00:37:30.685 --> 00:37:31.885
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to find the signal and the

00:37:31.885 --> 00:37:32.525
<v Speaker 1>noise.

00:37:33.005 --> 00:37:35.165
<v Speaker 1>So what we're saying is, okay. If you're

00:37:35.165 --> 00:37:36.765
<v Speaker 1>running on Kubernetes, we all actually have this

00:37:36.765 --> 00:37:39.725
<v Speaker 1>very similar alerts anyway because we're all

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:41.780
<v Speaker 1>on these different scenarios.

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:46.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:48.900
<v Speaker 1>there's, like, known issues with the nodes,

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:50.660
<v Speaker 1>then we're all dirthing on the same common

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:52.900
<v Speaker 1>scenarios. So why not also share the investigation

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.740
<v Speaker 1>for that? Why not share that as community

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:55.220
<v Speaker 1>knowledge?

00:37:56.965 --> 00:37:57.685
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:37:58.965 --> 00:38:00.725
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let me scan what other ones we

00:38:00.725 --> 00:38:02.245
<v Speaker 0>have here. Uh-oh.

00:38:03.605 --> 00:38:05.285
<v Speaker 0>The node graph nurture.

00:38:05.445 --> 00:38:07.205
<v Speaker 0>Everybody loves a good graph. Right?

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:13.410
<v Speaker 0>Hard bash. Does this run up

00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:16.610
<v Speaker 0>execute a command and save the pod?

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:19.410
<v Speaker 1>It does. So you would put that if

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:20.850
<v Speaker 1>you have an alert that fires on a

00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:21.890
<v Speaker 1>specific pod,

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:24.290
<v Speaker 1>then that would execute on the pod with

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:26.130
<v Speaker 1>either it fires. Yeah. And send you the

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:28.585
<v Speaker 2>results to Slack or whatever you define.

00:38:30.265 --> 00:38:30.905
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:38:31.705 --> 00:38:33.385
<v Speaker 0>Alright. There's quite a lot of choice here.

00:38:33.385 --> 00:38:34.745
<v Speaker 0>I'm not gonna scroll through

00:38:36.425 --> 00:38:38.505
<v Speaker 0>all of these, but there's definitely a lot

00:38:38.505 --> 00:38:39.545
<v Speaker 0>of flexibility

00:38:39.545 --> 00:38:41.690
<v Speaker 0>in the enrichers that we can add. And

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:43.210
<v Speaker 0>that was just was that just the event

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:44.810
<v Speaker 0>ones? There's, like, remediation

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:46.170
<v Speaker 0>stuff.

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:50.730
<v Speaker 0>And Yep. So when this sort of fires,

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:51.370
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be the

00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:54.570
<v Speaker 0>hyphen troubleshooting. When this happen.

00:38:56.135 --> 00:38:57.415
<v Speaker 0>Alright. There's loads.

00:39:01.575 --> 00:39:03.335
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So we'll take a look at another

00:39:03.335 --> 00:39:04.135
<v Speaker 0>example?

00:39:05.895 --> 00:39:07.575
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Let's go back

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:10.319
<v Speaker 1>for a second to the demo repository.

00:39:10.319 --> 00:39:12.400
<v Speaker 1>I think we'll look at one last example

00:39:13.119 --> 00:39:15.440
<v Speaker 1>that will be good to generate the concept.

00:39:15.839 --> 00:39:18.160
<v Speaker 1>And I wanna take here

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.440
<v Speaker 1>may go down a little bit.

00:39:24.095 --> 00:39:26.414
<v Speaker 1>Just a little bit more. Yeah. I wanna

00:39:26.414 --> 00:39:28.174
<v Speaker 1>take care of an example with pending pods.

00:39:28.174 --> 00:39:30.255
<v Speaker 1>So skip the next one. The CPU throttling,

00:39:30.255 --> 00:39:31.055
<v Speaker 1>we can skip.

00:39:31.375 --> 00:39:32.575
<v Speaker 1>Just like the,

00:39:33.535 --> 00:39:35.375
<v Speaker 1>you know, pull pull in the relevant data.

00:39:35.454 --> 00:39:36.974
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, let's take care of the pending

00:39:36.974 --> 00:39:37.615
<v Speaker 1>pods one.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.920
<v Speaker 0>I'll clean up after myself.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.120
<v Speaker 0>I think it's gone.

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:54.520
<v Speaker 1>Now the pending pods is an interesting one

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.280
<v Speaker 1>because

00:39:55.665 --> 00:39:57.265
<v Speaker 1>what we're trying to do is we're trying

00:39:57.265 --> 00:39:58.545
<v Speaker 1>to give everyone the best out of the

00:39:58.545 --> 00:39:59.505
<v Speaker 1>box experience,

00:40:00.225 --> 00:40:02.065
<v Speaker 1>and that means it means we have to

00:40:02.065 --> 00:40:03.905
<v Speaker 1>make decisions about what we are there on.

00:40:03.905 --> 00:40:05.585
<v Speaker 1>Right? Because let's say you have

00:40:05.745 --> 00:40:07.425
<v Speaker 1>a normal healthy cluster and you have an

00:40:07.425 --> 00:40:08.465
<v Speaker 1>autoscaler defined.

00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:11.380
<v Speaker 1>A pending pod isn't necessarily a big deal

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:13.300
<v Speaker 1>because the autoscaler will fix it. You spin

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:14.420
<v Speaker 1>up a new node. It takes a few

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:14.980
<v Speaker 1>minutes.

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:16.660
<v Speaker 1>And then once you spin up that new

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:19.140
<v Speaker 1>node, now everything is fine. Right?

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:21.460
<v Speaker 1>Like, the pod won't be pending anymore. So

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:22.500
<v Speaker 1>for pending pods,

00:40:23.195 --> 00:40:25.035
<v Speaker 1>you actually don't wanna alert on that right

00:40:25.035 --> 00:40:27.115
<v Speaker 1>away. So by default of the box, we

00:40:27.115 --> 00:40:28.955
<v Speaker 1>don't send you an alert right when the

00:40:28.955 --> 00:40:30.155
<v Speaker 1>pending pod happens.

00:40:30.395 --> 00:40:31.995
<v Speaker 1>We wait fifteen minutes,

00:40:32.395 --> 00:40:34.075
<v Speaker 1>and then we send it if that hasn't

00:40:34.075 --> 00:40:35.755
<v Speaker 1>been resolved, and then we give the autoscaler

00:40:35.755 --> 00:40:36.555
<v Speaker 1>a chance to do that.

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:38.130
<v Speaker 1>But

00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:40.130
<v Speaker 1>if you have pods that are pending, you

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:41.970
<v Speaker 1>still wanna get some form of visibility into

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:44.050
<v Speaker 1>that. So that also ties into what we're

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:45.970
<v Speaker 1>doing in the SaaS platform, where here's a

00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:47.810
<v Speaker 1>scenario where we don't wanna alert you on

00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:49.650
<v Speaker 1>it. But if you're going and you're checking,

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:51.089
<v Speaker 1>you're saying, okay. Well, I just deployed what's

00:40:51.089 --> 00:40:52.765
<v Speaker 1>going on. We still wanna give you that

00:40:52.765 --> 00:40:55.245
<v Speaker 1>visibility even before it becomes an issue.

00:40:57.485 --> 00:40:59.165
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Does that mean we're sitting here for

00:40:59.165 --> 00:41:01.885
<v Speaker 0>fifteen minutes? Because No. I was thinking we

00:41:01.885 --> 00:41:03.485
<v Speaker 1>could open up I I was thinking we

00:41:03.485 --> 00:41:05.600
<v Speaker 1>could open up this SaaS platform, and then

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.440
<v Speaker 1>we'll also tie that into some other stuff

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.320
<v Speaker 1>that

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.160
<v Speaker 1>we didn't show off in that we that's

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.440
<v Speaker 1>in the open source as well that we

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:12.400
<v Speaker 1>didn't show off.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:13.680
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:16.640
<v Speaker 0>How does one get to the Robusta SaaS

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:19.280
<v Speaker 0>platform? I guess the login button. Yep.

00:41:27.255 --> 00:41:28.935
<v Speaker 0>Now because I just typed in my email

00:41:28.935 --> 00:41:30.375
<v Speaker 0>address and I don't have an account, if

00:41:30.375 --> 00:41:32.455
<v Speaker 0>I click Google off, is it gonna work?

00:41:32.535 --> 00:41:33.175
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:36.150
<v Speaker 0>I think I will need to

00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:38.790
<v Speaker 0>move this to the right profile, though.

00:41:45.845 --> 00:41:47.205
<v Speaker 0>You're gonna hack me?

00:41:48.484 --> 00:41:50.404
<v Speaker 1>I don't really get access to do anything

00:41:50.404 --> 00:41:51.205
<v Speaker 1>meaningful.

00:41:52.085 --> 00:41:54.885
<v Speaker 2>No. It's just It's just OAuth. Yeah.

00:41:56.484 --> 00:42:00.244
<v Speaker 0>Alright. It was just a fairly random

00:41:59.530 --> 00:42:01.930
<v Speaker 0>sub domain string on that super base thing

00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:03.290
<v Speaker 0>there. Yeah. Yeah.

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:05.450
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:06.170
<v Speaker 0>So

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:08.650
<v Speaker 0>what do we have here? I don't think

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:09.930
<v Speaker 0>I've seen the SaaS platform

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:11.930
<v Speaker 0>before. Did we look at this last time?

00:42:12.945 --> 00:42:14.705
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. And if we did, it

00:42:14.705 --> 00:42:15.905
<v Speaker 1>looked totally different.

00:42:16.385 --> 00:42:18.065
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Why don't you give us the guided

00:42:18.065 --> 00:42:18.625
<v Speaker 0>tour?

00:42:19.185 --> 00:42:21.825
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So let's click let's

00:42:21.825 --> 00:42:22.865
<v Speaker 1>say on

00:42:24.305 --> 00:42:26.785
<v Speaker 1>let's

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:26.160
<v Speaker 1>take

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.720
<v Speaker 1>what's a good place to take?

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.560
<v Speaker 1>Let's just take one any one of these.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.240
<v Speaker 1>Take GKE metrics that you check.

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.160
<v Speaker 1>Yep. And now

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.319
<v Speaker 1>you can see here there was a transient

00:42:38.319 --> 00:42:40.160
<v Speaker 1>issue, but it fixed itself. There was some

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.165
<v Speaker 1>issue with the mount that self resolved, so

00:42:42.165 --> 00:42:44.725
<v Speaker 1>that's just debug priority under the priority there.

00:42:44.725 --> 00:42:47.045
<v Speaker 1>We're saying this wasn't important. It happened. You

00:42:47.045 --> 00:42:48.885
<v Speaker 1>might wanna know about it, but it wasn't

00:42:48.885 --> 00:42:49.605
<v Speaker 1>important.

00:42:50.565 --> 00:42:53.045
<v Speaker 1>And now if you jump over to the

00:42:53.045 --> 00:42:54.245
<v Speaker 1>pad screen for a second,

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.480
<v Speaker 1>then one thing that we can do is

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.160
<v Speaker 1>we can let you pull in different data

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:00.800
<v Speaker 1>here

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:02.720
<v Speaker 1>from what's running in your cluster.

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.119
<v Speaker 1>But for security reasons, we want you to

00:43:05.119 --> 00:43:07.440
<v Speaker 1>generate a token that's specific to your browser,

00:43:07.759 --> 00:43:09.759
<v Speaker 1>so to give it, like, access to do

00:43:09.759 --> 00:43:09.920
<v Speaker 1>that.

00:43:16.775 --> 00:43:19.335
<v Speaker 2>I think you need just a step three.

00:43:19.335 --> 00:43:19.655
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:24.180
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I've already used my context. Right? So

00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:25.860
<v Speaker 0>I don't need to worry about that. I

00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:26.580
<v Speaker 0>can just do this.

00:43:43.965 --> 00:43:44.765
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:43:45.405 --> 00:43:47.165
<v Speaker 0>So what happened?

00:43:47.965 --> 00:43:49.165
<v Speaker 1>Let me check.

00:43:49.885 --> 00:43:52.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So we generated a token so that

00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Robusta will have access to pull in a

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:57.030
<v Speaker 1>little bit of data, very limited data type

00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:58.550
<v Speaker 1>pulls from Robusta itself,

00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:01.270
<v Speaker 1>about what's going on in your cluster. And

00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:03.510
<v Speaker 1>that will then pull into the SaaS platform

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:06.905
<v Speaker 1>some graphs, like, about different metrics, CPU usage,

00:44:06.905 --> 00:44:08.585
<v Speaker 1>and so on, and to get dogs.

00:44:08.905 --> 00:44:11.385
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So the Robusta that we installed to

00:44:11.385 --> 00:44:14.505
<v Speaker 0>the cluster, does that have any permissions to

00:44:14.505 --> 00:44:15.625
<v Speaker 0>the rest of stuff? Does it speak to

00:44:15.625 --> 00:44:18.105
<v Speaker 0>the SaaS platform? Are they completely independent? Like,

00:44:18.105 --> 00:44:19.945
<v Speaker 0>what's the relationship between those two components?

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:23.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So it depends on whether you enable

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:25.560
<v Speaker 1>it or don't enable it. So if you

00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:27.240
<v Speaker 1>start off and you check off at the

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:28.760
<v Speaker 1>beginning that you don't wanna enable the SaaS

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:29.480
<v Speaker 1>platform,

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:30.840
<v Speaker 1>then nothing gets sent.

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.440
<v Speaker 1>And if you check off that you do

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:34.040
<v Speaker 1>wanna enable the SaaS platform,

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:37.785
<v Speaker 1>then we're sending just metadata there, like, dirt's

00:44:37.785 --> 00:44:40.425
<v Speaker 1>crashing pods, so data about what's happening,

00:44:40.665 --> 00:44:42.265
<v Speaker 1>and it's all with a push model.

00:44:42.505 --> 00:44:44.825
<v Speaker 1>Now when you go into the UI, though,

00:44:44.825 --> 00:44:46.665
<v Speaker 1>you might wanna see data there. Like, you

00:44:46.665 --> 00:44:48.425
<v Speaker 1>might wanna see data. Okay. Where is the

00:44:48.425 --> 00:44:50.900
<v Speaker 1>pod log right now? In order to enable

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:52.580
<v Speaker 1>that, then you have to explicitly give permission

00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:53.060
<v Speaker 1>there.

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:56.340
<v Speaker 0>Okay. And is this a short lived token,

00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:57.540
<v Speaker 0>or is this something I should be cleaning

00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:59.700
<v Speaker 0>up after a certain amount of time? Does

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:00.500
<v Speaker 0>it have an expiration?

00:45:02.125 --> 00:45:03.565
<v Speaker 1>This is a token that you can remove

00:45:03.565 --> 00:45:05.805
<v Speaker 1>from the UI itself afterwards. It's not a

00:45:05.805 --> 00:45:08.125
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes token or anything. So it doesn't have

00:45:08.125 --> 00:45:09.725
<v Speaker 1>any Kubernetes meaning.

00:45:10.045 --> 00:45:12.205
<v Speaker 1>It just has meaning in Robusta itself to

00:45:12.205 --> 00:45:13.325
<v Speaker 1>authorize your computer.

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:16.580
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Got it. Cool.

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:19.780
<v Speaker 0>So now we get some information

00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:22.980
<v Speaker 0>about the the pod itself. Right? So we

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:23.940
<v Speaker 0>can see the

00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:26.580
<v Speaker 0>CPU and memory consumption,

00:45:28.425 --> 00:45:30.105
<v Speaker 0>and we can see that there's more than

00:45:30.105 --> 00:45:30.985
<v Speaker 0>one of them.

00:45:31.785 --> 00:45:34.105
<v Speaker 1>Mhmm. Yep. And if you wanted, then you

00:45:34.105 --> 00:45:36.105
<v Speaker 1>could pull in from here the logs, for

00:45:36.105 --> 00:45:37.705
<v Speaker 1>example. You can see different data.

00:45:37.865 --> 00:45:40.345
<v Speaker 1>And one thing that's cool about this is

00:45:40.345 --> 00:45:42.665
<v Speaker 1>we're doing this on all your different clusters.

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:45.059
<v Speaker 1>So even if this was a microservice that

00:45:45.059 --> 00:45:45.940
<v Speaker 1>was running

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:48.579
<v Speaker 1>on 300 different clusters, you would still get

00:45:48.579 --> 00:45:50.339
<v Speaker 1>a single pane of glass to see all

00:45:50.339 --> 00:45:53.140
<v Speaker 1>those different clusters in one single place.

00:45:54.579 --> 00:45:54.980
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:45:57.135 --> 00:45:59.135
<v Speaker 1>But let's go back to that transient issue

00:45:59.135 --> 00:46:00.575
<v Speaker 1>we were speaking about. We were saying, okay.

00:46:00.575 --> 00:46:02.735
<v Speaker 1>How sometimes this issue that occurs,

00:46:02.815 --> 00:46:05.215
<v Speaker 1>that's a transient issue. So just click here

00:46:05.215 --> 00:46:07.135
<v Speaker 1>on the timeline page on the left.

00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:12.299
<v Speaker 0>Am I on it? Oh, no. That's over.

00:46:12.299 --> 00:46:13.420
<v Speaker 0>That's fine. Okay. Yep.

00:46:15.099 --> 00:46:16.540
<v Speaker 1>And then you can see here

00:46:16.859 --> 00:46:18.460
<v Speaker 1>we can go in here, and we can

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:20.140
<v Speaker 1>see some of these transient issues.

00:46:20.299 --> 00:46:20.860
<v Speaker 1>So

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:23.385
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna want you to can you go

00:46:23.385 --> 00:46:25.225
<v Speaker 1>first just zoom in a little bit with

00:46:25.225 --> 00:46:27.225
<v Speaker 1>your scroll bar on the right hand side

00:46:27.225 --> 00:46:28.185
<v Speaker 1>of this graph?

00:46:29.385 --> 00:46:31.065
<v Speaker 1>If you use your scroll bar on the

00:46:31.065 --> 00:46:33.385
<v Speaker 1>right hand on the graph itself, put your

00:46:33.385 --> 00:46:34.665
<v Speaker 1>mouse over the graph.

00:46:35.465 --> 00:46:36.745
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And then you can zoom in.

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:41.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. You can drag it as well.

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:46.140
<v Speaker 1>Zoomed in a little bit too much.

00:46:52.434 --> 00:46:53.075
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

00:46:53.315 --> 00:46:55.155
<v Speaker 0>never trust me with a mouse. This is

00:46:55.155 --> 00:46:57.635
<v Speaker 0>what I'm learning today. Alright. Hold on. And

00:46:57.635 --> 00:46:59.555
<v Speaker 0>the resume and there we go. That's what

00:46:59.555 --> 00:47:00.195
<v Speaker 0>you wanted?

00:47:00.674 --> 00:47:02.994
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So see that icon on the top

00:47:02.994 --> 00:47:03.315
<v Speaker 1>row?

00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:04.810
<v Speaker 1>Mhmm.

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:07.450
<v Speaker 0>Yep. So if you click there, then that's

00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:09.849
<v Speaker 1>an example. Yeah. Just click on that. Oh,

00:47:09.849 --> 00:47:11.450
<v Speaker 0>I just wanna make sure I understand what

00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:12.329
<v Speaker 0>I'm seeing here. So this

00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:15.450
<v Speaker 0>these are the different types of things, events

00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:17.210
<v Speaker 0>within my Kubernetes cluster.

00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:19.210
<v Speaker 0>This is

00:47:20.695 --> 00:47:22.775
<v Speaker 0>a timeline of when these events happen. I

00:47:22.775 --> 00:47:24.295
<v Speaker 0>don't understand what the colors are yet, but

00:47:24.295 --> 00:47:25.095
<v Speaker 0>that's okay.

00:47:25.494 --> 00:47:28.135
<v Speaker 0>And this change one is not like the

00:47:28.135 --> 00:47:29.415
<v Speaker 0>others. Why

00:47:29.734 --> 00:47:31.974
<v Speaker 0>is that? Because this is a special event.

00:47:31.974 --> 00:47:33.415
<v Speaker 0>Is that got some significance?

00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:36.310
<v Speaker 1>This comes from the API server. So we're

00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:38.470
<v Speaker 1>tracking a list of all the different changes

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:40.310
<v Speaker 1>that happen. What I would do is go

00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:42.870
<v Speaker 1>in and run KubeCatl edit on a deployment

00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:44.390
<v Speaker 1>or a pod or something in your cluster,

00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:45.590
<v Speaker 1>even that crash pods.

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:48.550
<v Speaker 1>And we're using the UI here to show

00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:50.305
<v Speaker 1>this, but you could do this even without

00:47:50.305 --> 00:47:52.145
<v Speaker 1>the UI. Like, what we're doing here when

00:47:52.145 --> 00:47:53.905
<v Speaker 1>we're tracking all these changes, this is based

00:47:53.905 --> 00:47:54.865
<v Speaker 1>on KubeWatch.

00:47:55.025 --> 00:47:57.105
<v Speaker 1>And all the functionality here, it's important to

00:47:57.105 --> 00:47:59.345
<v Speaker 1>emphasize, it's also in the open source. So

00:47:59.345 --> 00:48:01.025
<v Speaker 1>the UI is just like a thin layer

00:48:01.025 --> 00:48:01.505
<v Speaker 1>on top.

00:48:16.724 --> 00:48:18.245
<v Speaker 2>You can change the,

00:48:18.405 --> 00:48:20.325
<v Speaker 2>like, the time range for one hour. It

00:48:20.325 --> 00:48:23.685
<v Speaker 2>will be, like yeah. Yeah. Up they'll be

00:48:23.685 --> 00:48:24.244
<v Speaker 1>above that.

00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:34.100
<v Speaker 0>I'm just gonna start playing with all the

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:34.980
<v Speaker 0>sentence now.

00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:37.700
<v Speaker 1>Mhmm. Yep. Maybe hit the refresh button there.

00:48:42.615 --> 00:48:43.815
<v Speaker 0>Have I broke it?

00:48:45.495 --> 00:48:47.255
<v Speaker 0>That's I may not get the label, the

00:48:47.255 --> 00:48:49.175
<v Speaker 0>metadata change. Maybe that was just a silly

00:48:49.175 --> 00:48:49.815
<v Speaker 0>change.

00:48:50.215 --> 00:48:51.495
<v Speaker 0>I'll delete the pod.

00:48:53.015 --> 00:48:54.935
<v Speaker 1>No. I want do a change. The deletion

00:48:54.935 --> 00:48:56.375
<v Speaker 1>will definitely pick up on, but do a

00:48:56.375 --> 00:48:58.510
<v Speaker 1>change. Maybe go back to the change.

00:48:58.750 --> 00:49:01.309
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Do edit pods or edit deployment. Do

00:49:01.309 --> 00:49:03.150
<v Speaker 1>you change the pod or the deployment? I

00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:04.430
<v Speaker 0>changed the labels

00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:05.550
<v Speaker 0>on the pod.

00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:08.270
<v Speaker 1>So try changing the deployment. We might

00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:11.390
<v Speaker 1>if the pod is part of its deployment,

00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:12.670
<v Speaker 1>we might only look at the deployment.

00:49:14.085 --> 00:49:15.205
<v Speaker 0>One moment.

00:49:15.445 --> 00:49:18.405
<v Speaker 0>So let's change the replicas. Right? This is

00:49:18.405 --> 00:49:19.685
<v Speaker 0>probably a change I'd wanna be able to

00:49:19.685 --> 00:49:20.405
<v Speaker 0>visualize.

00:49:26.325 --> 00:49:28.165
<v Speaker 1>Alright. And I'll give that one moment.

00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:39.340
<v Speaker 1>Well, what can you do about the demo

00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:40.140
<v Speaker 1>gods?

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:40.700
<v Speaker 1>What

00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:44.540
<v Speaker 1>can you do?

00:49:45.625 --> 00:49:46.265
<v Speaker 1>Me.

00:49:47.305 --> 00:49:48.905
<v Speaker 1>Can you check what's in your Robusta on

00:49:48.905 --> 00:49:49.705
<v Speaker 1>your logs?

00:49:50.265 --> 00:49:50.985
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Sure.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.320
<v Speaker 1>Do deployment slash Robusta around there.

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:04.680
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:08.520
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

00:50:14.375 --> 00:50:16.535
<v Speaker 2>No. I think that's okay. Yeah. I don't

00:50:16.535 --> 00:50:17.815
<v Speaker 1>think it's that. It should appear in the

00:50:17.815 --> 00:50:20.295
<v Speaker 2>UI, I guess, in a few seconds. Go

00:50:20.295 --> 00:50:21.494
<v Speaker 1>back to the UI and see if it

00:50:21.494 --> 00:50:22.135
<v Speaker 1>appeared yet.

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Right. So I'll I'll look into that a

00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:29.359
<v Speaker 1>little bit afterward. Let me go back, I

00:50:29.359 --> 00:50:31.440
<v Speaker 1>mean, go back to the home page over

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:32.000
<v Speaker 1>here.

00:50:33.839 --> 00:50:36.400
<v Speaker 1>Yep. And you added a crash pod. Right?

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.119
<v Speaker 2>Mhmm. Yeah.

00:50:38.375 --> 00:50:39.575
<v Speaker 0>I did. Yes.

00:50:40.055 --> 00:50:41.655
<v Speaker 1>So if you click here,

00:50:42.055 --> 00:50:42.855
<v Speaker 1>me

00:50:43.815 --> 00:50:45.175
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to take a look later on

00:50:45.175 --> 00:50:46.855
<v Speaker 1>and see what's going on there. Well, it's

00:50:46.855 --> 00:50:48.935
<v Speaker 0>noticed that it's not scaled up.

00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:58.270
<v Speaker 1>Yep. That is true. I'll

00:50:58.270 --> 00:51:00.030
<v Speaker 1>need to check and see what's going on

00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:01.630
<v Speaker 1>with the change over there. But let's go

00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:03.630
<v Speaker 1>back for a second now. Just go back

00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:05.070
<v Speaker 1>to the main app screen.

00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:08.285
<v Speaker 1>So just go on the left over to

00:51:08.285 --> 00:51:09.724
<v Speaker 1>the app screen. Yep.

00:51:09.964 --> 00:51:12.605
<v Speaker 1>Now remember we put here this example pod

00:51:12.684 --> 00:51:15.164
<v Speaker 1>that was gonna go into pending state? So

00:51:15.164 --> 00:51:16.605
<v Speaker 1>just open this up.

00:51:18.765 --> 00:51:20.125
<v Speaker 1>And if you go down here and you

00:51:20.125 --> 00:51:21.404
<v Speaker 1>look at the morning, then you can see

00:51:21.404 --> 00:51:23.110
<v Speaker 1>here, okay. It failed scheduling,

00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:25.270
<v Speaker 1>and we're pulling in here the reasons why

00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:26.470
<v Speaker 1>it failed scheduling.

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:28.950
<v Speaker 1>So you can see here that it failed

00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:31.590
<v Speaker 1>to be scheduled because three nodes didn't match

00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:33.190
<v Speaker 1>the pods node selector.

00:51:35.305 --> 00:51:36.185
<v Speaker 1>Uh-huh.

00:51:37.785 --> 00:51:39.545
<v Speaker 1>And what we're doing here is we're pulling

00:51:39.545 --> 00:51:41.065
<v Speaker 1>in out the events

00:51:41.065 --> 00:51:42.585
<v Speaker 1>to show you the data on what's going

00:51:42.585 --> 00:51:44.425
<v Speaker 1>on. Even if this is a transient issue,

00:51:44.425 --> 00:51:45.865
<v Speaker 1>we're still showing you the data on why

00:51:45.865 --> 00:51:46.425
<v Speaker 1>this is happening.

00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:51.400
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:58.040
<v Speaker 0>Quite an issue. Alright?

00:51:59.319 --> 00:52:01.480
<v Speaker 1>Thank you. I'm gonna have our also our

00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:03.400
<v Speaker 1>UI UX design

00:52:02.955 --> 00:52:04.555
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow, and then she'll go over the stuff

00:52:04.555 --> 00:52:06.155
<v Speaker 1>and then she'll pick pick out the things

00:52:06.155 --> 00:52:07.915
<v Speaker 1>where you didn't click on the things she

00:52:07.915 --> 00:52:09.515
<v Speaker 1>thought you would click on, and we'll do

00:52:09.515 --> 00:52:11.595
<v Speaker 1>improvements on that. So that's always useful.

00:52:11.675 --> 00:52:14.235
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I think my Zoom is causing problems,

00:52:14.315 --> 00:52:15.275
<v Speaker 0>but yeah.

00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:18.500
<v Speaker 0>I like this kind of level of visibility

00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:20.980
<v Speaker 0>into everything. I like this timeline view.

00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:23.380
<v Speaker 0>I think that's very clever.

00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:25.860
<v Speaker 0>And then, yeah,

00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:28.820
<v Speaker 0>understanding why the pod isn't scheduling. Like,

00:52:29.745 --> 00:52:32.305
<v Speaker 0>is this something that you expect to, like,

00:52:32.385 --> 00:52:34.145
<v Speaker 0>hypothetical question here because I don't know if

00:52:34.145 --> 00:52:35.105
<v Speaker 0>it does this just now. I don't know

00:52:35.105 --> 00:52:35.985
<v Speaker 0>if it's going to do this in the

00:52:35.985 --> 00:52:36.945
<v Speaker 0>future, etcetera.

00:52:37.185 --> 00:52:38.945
<v Speaker 0>But I wonder

00:52:39.585 --> 00:52:41.585
<v Speaker 0>if a pod fails to schedule and it's

00:52:41.585 --> 00:52:42.705
<v Speaker 0>because of,

00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:46.930
<v Speaker 0>you know, the CPU of the memory request

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:48.450
<v Speaker 0>can't be satisfied by a member in the

00:52:48.450 --> 00:52:50.930
<v Speaker 0>cluster, then we could probably expect that pending

00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:53.330
<v Speaker 0>status which kicks off the cluster autoscaler will

00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:54.130
<v Speaker 0>eventually

00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:54.690
<v Speaker 0>work.

00:52:55.090 --> 00:52:58.130
<v Speaker 0>But this one was an affinity selector,

00:52:58.130 --> 00:53:00.674
<v Speaker 0>like, does does Robusta know that there are

00:53:00.674 --> 00:53:03.395
<v Speaker 0>no nodes with those matching criteria?

00:53:03.954 --> 00:53:05.795
<v Speaker 0>And can it can can it handle that

00:53:05.795 --> 00:53:07.474
<v Speaker 0>differently? Is that what it's doing already?

00:53:08.275 --> 00:53:10.355
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So we don't have that resolution yet

00:53:10.355 --> 00:53:12.115
<v Speaker 1>today, but what we've done is we've built

00:53:12.115 --> 00:53:13.954
<v Speaker 1>out, like, the thing which we can express

00:53:13.954 --> 00:53:14.595
<v Speaker 1>that resolution.

00:53:15.130 --> 00:53:16.410
<v Speaker 1>And a big part of what we're doing

00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:17.610
<v Speaker 1>in 2023

00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:19.770
<v Speaker 1>is to handle, like, increase our coverage on

00:53:19.770 --> 00:53:21.690
<v Speaker 1>each of those fine edge cases.

00:53:23.290 --> 00:53:26.490
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Because, you know, I could be especially

00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:30.090
<v Speaker 0>with with node topologies and different architectures and

00:53:29.235 --> 00:53:31.235
<v Speaker 0>GPUs now, there's probably a lot of things

00:53:31.235 --> 00:53:32.995
<v Speaker 0>that you can just make assumptions about. Like

00:53:32.995 --> 00:53:34.835
<v Speaker 0>if there are no GPUs in the the

00:53:34.835 --> 00:53:36.515
<v Speaker 0>cluster, maybe there's never going to be any

00:53:36.515 --> 00:53:38.355
<v Speaker 0>GPUs in the cluster. And if there's no

00:53:38.595 --> 00:53:41.555
<v Speaker 0>nodes and EU East one, maybe it's because

00:53:41.555 --> 00:53:43.750
<v Speaker 0>we never deployed EU East 1. There's almost

00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:45.829
<v Speaker 0>just copy and pasted some crappy YAML from

00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:47.910
<v Speaker 0>the Internet into their cluster. Like, these are

00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:50.069
<v Speaker 0>probably things you could surface relatively quickly for

00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:51.589
<v Speaker 0>people, and it doesn't require

00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:54.630
<v Speaker 0>a lot of knowledge of their cluster. You

00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:56.630
<v Speaker 0>can make certain assumptions, I guess, based on

00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:58.825
<v Speaker 0>the the complete lack of

00:53:59.545 --> 00:54:01.465
<v Speaker 0>a certain criteria. Yeah. I think this is

00:54:01.465 --> 00:54:03.545
<v Speaker 0>a really interesting space where you can deliver

00:54:03.545 --> 00:54:05.945
<v Speaker 0>a lot of real value to people with

00:54:05.945 --> 00:54:07.865
<v Speaker 0>some very simple kind of checks like that.

00:54:07.865 --> 00:54:09.785
<v Speaker 0>That that's cool. I really like this.

00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:13.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. No. It's kinda like open sourcing the

00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:15.960
<v Speaker 1>operations. It's like taking how you work,

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:17.640
<v Speaker 1>forcing,

00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:19.400
<v Speaker 1>like, the way that we actually think and

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:20.360
<v Speaker 1>we handle this.

00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:22.359
<v Speaker 1>Right? Like, ultimately, this is just a rule

00:54:22.359 --> 00:54:24.280
<v Speaker 1>in the in the repository that's written in

00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:26.155
<v Speaker 1>YAML. And we're, like, taking the knowledge out

00:54:26.155 --> 00:54:27.915
<v Speaker 1>of your head for how you would handle

00:54:27.915 --> 00:54:29.994
<v Speaker 1>this error and now turning into codes.

00:54:30.474 --> 00:54:32.395
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like infrastructure as code said, okay.

00:54:32.395 --> 00:54:34.555
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't set up servers ad hoc. And

00:54:34.555 --> 00:54:36.315
<v Speaker 1>what we're doing is we're doing incident response

00:54:36.315 --> 00:54:37.915
<v Speaker 1>as code and saying that you shouldn't respond

00:54:37.915 --> 00:54:39.515
<v Speaker 1>to incidents ad hoc either.

00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:42.580
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:43.860
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:46.660
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We still got a whole bunch of

00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:48.580
<v Speaker 0>tabs on the robust assess. Do you wanna

00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:50.100
<v Speaker 0>dive into any of them? I see we've

00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:52.740
<v Speaker 0>got jobs, notes, comparison, health, silences.

00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:54.020
<v Speaker 0>So everything here you would like to show

00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:54.260
<v Speaker 0>up?

00:54:56.525 --> 00:54:57.325
<v Speaker 1>Arik,

00:54:57.325 --> 00:54:58.845
<v Speaker 1>anything you wanna emphasize?

00:55:00.525 --> 00:55:01.165
<v Speaker 1>No.

00:55:02.045 --> 00:55:04.845
<v Speaker 1>We're constantly adding and adding.

00:55:04.845 --> 00:55:06.925
<v Speaker 1>So the help of new to just give

00:55:06.925 --> 00:55:08.365
<v Speaker 1>you, like, a one if you have a

00:55:08.365 --> 00:55:09.805
<v Speaker 1>lot of clusters to give you a single

00:55:09.805 --> 00:55:12.680
<v Speaker 1>overview of everything over there. The silences,

00:55:13.079 --> 00:55:15.079
<v Speaker 1>when there's a Prometheus alert, then we add

00:55:15.079 --> 00:55:16.920
<v Speaker 1>their silence button in Slack. So with one

00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:19.560
<v Speaker 1>click, you can silence alerts directly from Slack,

00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:21.400
<v Speaker 1>and then that shows up in the silences

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:21.640
<v Speaker 1>screen.

00:55:23.675 --> 00:55:24.635
<v Speaker 0>So

00:55:25.435 --> 00:55:27.515
<v Speaker 0>tell me a couple more things then about

00:55:27.515 --> 00:55:29.595
<v Speaker 0>the the SaaS platform. For people that wanna

00:55:29.595 --> 00:55:31.515
<v Speaker 0>get started and start using it, is there

00:55:31.515 --> 00:55:32.475
<v Speaker 0>a free tier?

00:55:32.955 --> 00:55:34.715
<v Speaker 0>How do they get started? Is it as

00:55:34.715 --> 00:55:36.475
<v Speaker 0>simple as what we've shown today? Maybe you

00:55:36.475 --> 00:55:37.755
<v Speaker 0>can give them a little bit more detail.

00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Sure. I mean, so very extensive free

00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:42.280
<v Speaker 1>tier.

00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:43.480
<v Speaker 1>Mean, we

00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:45.560
<v Speaker 1>currently have our free tier up to 50

00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:46.360
<v Speaker 1>nodes.

00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Mean, so that's 50. Five zero. Yeah.

00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:50.520
<v Speaker 1>You've seen them in shock.

00:55:52.325 --> 00:55:53.445
<v Speaker 0>I mean,

00:55:53.845 --> 00:55:54.645
<v Speaker 0>I just

00:55:55.285 --> 00:55:56.964
<v Speaker 0>yeah. It's it's it's not a lot of

00:55:56.964 --> 00:55:59.605
<v Speaker 0>nodes. You know, obviously, the clusters get much,

00:55:59.605 --> 00:56:02.005
<v Speaker 0>much bigger than this. But I think it's

00:56:02.005 --> 00:56:03.444
<v Speaker 0>it's rare or maybe it's just the people

00:56:03.444 --> 00:56:04.964
<v Speaker 0>that are calling me asking for help is

00:56:04.964 --> 00:56:07.045
<v Speaker 0>that their clusters are normally in that kind

00:56:07.045 --> 00:56:10.369
<v Speaker 0>of eight to 12, maybe 20 and absolute,

00:56:10.369 --> 00:56:13.010
<v Speaker 0>personally. That is a very generous three tier.

00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:16.849
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. We know that. Yep. We know. We're

00:56:16.849 --> 00:56:19.410
<v Speaker 1>not guaranteeing that we will forever have 50

00:56:19.410 --> 00:56:22.210
<v Speaker 1>nodes on there. Although if someone adds things

00:56:22.210 --> 00:56:24.045
<v Speaker 1>on in advance

00:56:24.525 --> 00:56:26.925
<v Speaker 1>and they're already on, like, Robusta, then we

00:56:26.925 --> 00:56:29.005
<v Speaker 1>do try and, like, at least be thoughtful.

00:56:29.005 --> 00:56:30.205
<v Speaker 1>Like, if people if we ever change the

00:56:30.205 --> 00:56:31.565
<v Speaker 1>tier, we will try and be thoughtful people

00:56:31.565 --> 00:56:33.325
<v Speaker 1>who are also there beforehand.

00:56:33.805 --> 00:56:35.325
<v Speaker 0>And is there a limit on how many

00:56:35.325 --> 00:56:36.925
<v Speaker 0>clusters of up to 50 nodes I can

00:56:36.925 --> 00:56:37.724
<v Speaker 0>have on my account?

00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:40.079
<v Speaker 1>No. We don't wanna force you in that

00:56:40.079 --> 00:56:42.480
<v Speaker 1>regards. You can deploy however you want. You

00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:44.880
<v Speaker 1>want, like, to split everything up into clusters.

00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:46.640
<v Speaker 1>That's fine. You want everything on one mega

00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:49.520
<v Speaker 1>cluster. That's your choice. That shouldn't affect like,

00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:51.440
<v Speaker 1>our software shouldn't affect how you choose to

00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:51.680
<v Speaker 1>deploy.

00:56:52.315 --> 00:56:54.795
<v Speaker 0>So I could have 10 clusters with 49

00:56:54.795 --> 00:56:57.035
<v Speaker 0>nodes each and that's still free tier, or

00:56:57.035 --> 00:56:59.435
<v Speaker 0>have I misunderstood? Is it 50 nodes total?

00:56:59.835 --> 00:57:02.155
<v Speaker 1>50 nodes total. Ah, okay. Yeah. Okay. That

00:57:02.155 --> 00:57:03.835
<v Speaker 0>makes a lot more sense. Alright.

00:57:04.155 --> 00:57:06.300
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I just assumed I could have an

00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:08.700
<v Speaker 0>inform a clusters with 50 notes, but that

00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:11.260
<v Speaker 0>was just me. Mean, you could technically create

00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:13.820
<v Speaker 1>a different account for each one, like, you

00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:16.380
<v Speaker 1>probably we wouldn't go after you, but I

00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:17.980
<v Speaker 0>think the value add from what I'm seeing

00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:20.140
<v Speaker 0>so far is this multi cluster pane of

00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:22.165
<v Speaker 0>glass. Like, you know, this UI with apps

00:57:22.165 --> 00:57:23.685
<v Speaker 0>and timeline and jobs, we've got all the

00:57:23.685 --> 00:57:26.165
<v Speaker 0>debugging information there. We've got alerts.

00:57:26.805 --> 00:57:27.605
<v Speaker 0>Like, you know,

00:57:28.325 --> 00:57:30.405
<v Speaker 0>multi cluster is definitely a growing

00:57:31.045 --> 00:57:33.765
<v Speaker 0>popular way of running Kubernetes, lots of smaller

00:57:33.765 --> 00:57:35.930
<v Speaker 0>clusters. And that single pane of glass is

00:57:35.930 --> 00:57:37.369
<v Speaker 0>still a kind of missing piece of the

00:57:37.369 --> 00:57:38.570
<v Speaker 0>puzzle so far.

00:57:38.970 --> 00:57:40.970
<v Speaker 0>Especially as it comes to actually being able

00:57:40.970 --> 00:57:43.609
<v Speaker 0>to apply run books or logic or conditional

00:57:43.609 --> 00:57:46.170
<v Speaker 0>statements to those clusters rather than just have

00:57:46.170 --> 00:57:47.849
<v Speaker 0>a graph on Grafana that can filter by

00:57:47.849 --> 00:57:48.570
<v Speaker 0>the cluster.

00:57:49.450 --> 00:57:51.585
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Exactly. I I think where you're going

00:57:51.585 --> 00:57:53.905
<v Speaker 0>with this, I like the direction, and I'm

00:57:53.905 --> 00:57:55.265
<v Speaker 0>very excited to see this.

00:57:55.745 --> 00:57:58.545
<v Speaker 0>So yeah. There's a question too, I think,

00:57:58.545 --> 00:58:00.705
<v Speaker 1>also about that you can also rather route

00:58:00.705 --> 00:58:01.905
<v Speaker 1>others with Grafana.

00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:04.400
<v Speaker 1>So the big part of what we're doing

00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:06.240
<v Speaker 1>here is to not just route the alerts

00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:07.440
<v Speaker 1>to the right destination,

00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:09.680
<v Speaker 1>but to pull in the right context.

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:11.760
<v Speaker 1>Like, if I go back to that example

00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:13.520
<v Speaker 1>with the radioactive box that I started off

00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:16.415
<v Speaker 1>with, then, like, you wanna find out that

00:58:16.415 --> 00:58:17.935
<v Speaker 1>there's a radioactive box there, but you also

00:58:17.935 --> 00:58:19.615
<v Speaker 1>wanna find out what that box means and

00:58:19.615 --> 00:58:21.215
<v Speaker 1>to see the context there as fast as

00:58:21.215 --> 00:58:23.695
<v Speaker 1>possible. So our goal is to pull in

00:58:23.695 --> 00:58:25.215
<v Speaker 1>the right data and show you all the

00:58:25.215 --> 00:58:27.295
<v Speaker 1>right data at the right time, not just

00:58:27.295 --> 00:58:29.390
<v Speaker 1>to do the other routing, which you can

00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:31.150
<v Speaker 1>obviously do on your own as well.

00:58:32.590 --> 00:58:33.390
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:38.510
<v Speaker 0>Alright. If anyone else has any more questions,

00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:39.950
<v Speaker 0>feel free to drop them into the comment

00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:41.710
<v Speaker 0>section, and we'll pass them on before we

00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:42.510
<v Speaker 0>finish for today.

00:58:43.715 --> 00:58:46.355
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So as far as

00:58:46.675 --> 00:58:48.355
<v Speaker 0>what we've looked at today,

00:58:48.915 --> 00:58:51.635
<v Speaker 0>we've got all these options for enrichers.

00:58:52.195 --> 00:58:54.675
<v Speaker 0>If I wanna start going rogue on this

00:58:54.675 --> 00:58:56.035
<v Speaker 0>and do my own thing,

00:58:56.515 --> 00:58:57.795
<v Speaker 0>what's the best place to

00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:59.830
<v Speaker 0>get examples?

00:59:01.030 --> 00:59:02.790
<v Speaker 1>In the docs. So if you go to

00:59:02.790 --> 00:59:04.390
<v Speaker 1>the docs, then we have examples there on

00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:05.910
<v Speaker 1>configuring the enrichers,

00:59:06.070 --> 00:59:07.670
<v Speaker 1>and we have examples on writing your own

00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:09.830
<v Speaker 1>enrichers too. So for example, you could do

00:59:09.830 --> 00:59:12.395
<v Speaker 1>an enricher that takes an alert, and,

00:59:12.795 --> 00:59:14.875
<v Speaker 1>it acts asks GPT

00:59:15.035 --> 00:59:16.474
<v Speaker 1>sorry, chat GPT

00:59:16.474 --> 00:59:17.994
<v Speaker 1>what you should do about that alert and

00:59:17.994 --> 00:59:20.075
<v Speaker 1>then sends it on Slack channel or to

00:59:20.075 --> 00:59:20.795
<v Speaker 1>Discord.

00:59:20.955 --> 00:59:22.395
<v Speaker 1>So you could do that, something like that

00:59:22.395 --> 00:59:24.075
<v Speaker 1>if you wanted. Have you already done that

00:59:24.075 --> 00:59:24.395
<v Speaker 0>demo?

00:59:25.490 --> 00:59:27.570
<v Speaker 1>I haven't. I wish I hadn't.

00:59:28.210 --> 00:59:30.369
<v Speaker 1>If someone does that demo, though, we will

00:59:30.369 --> 00:59:32.290
<v Speaker 1>send you swag to your house.

00:59:32.609 --> 00:59:34.050
<v Speaker 1>We will send you swag

00:59:34.530 --> 00:59:36.210
<v Speaker 1>and special swag. I will I will send

00:59:36.210 --> 00:59:37.490
<v Speaker 1>you a custom swag that no one else

00:59:37.490 --> 00:59:39.285
<v Speaker 1>in the world has ever gotten if you

00:59:39.285 --> 00:59:40.325
<v Speaker 1>ask

00:59:41.045 --> 00:59:42.405
<v Speaker 1>chat GPT.

00:59:43.285 --> 00:59:45.765
<v Speaker 0>I think that would be generally awesome. Like,

00:59:45.765 --> 00:59:47.845
<v Speaker 0>I think we've all seen enough of these

00:59:47.845 --> 00:59:49.765
<v Speaker 0>chat GPT things on Twitter now where people

00:59:49.765 --> 00:59:51.204
<v Speaker 0>are filling up with a bunch of context

00:59:51.204 --> 00:59:52.805
<v Speaker 0>and then ask a question based on that

00:59:52.805 --> 00:59:55.285
<v Speaker 0>new information. And you could totally do that

00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:57.500
<v Speaker 0>with Robusta. Like, here's the logs for my

00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:00.540
<v Speaker 0>application and here is the scheduling problems for

01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:01.420
<v Speaker 0>this pod.

01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:03.740
<v Speaker 0>Like, what is the remediation path here? Thanks.

01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:05.180
<v Speaker 0>And it would probably tell you, oh, you

01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:06.460
<v Speaker 0>need to go and spin up a note

01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:08.465
<v Speaker 0>of a GPU on it or you need

01:00:08.465 --> 01:00:11.505
<v Speaker 0>to tweak your requests and limits, etcetera. Like

01:00:11.665 --> 01:00:14.145
<v Speaker 2>We actually have an enrichment that

01:00:15.185 --> 01:00:18.305
<v Speaker 2>run the search on Stack Overflow. So this

01:00:18.305 --> 01:00:20.225
<v Speaker 2>will be an enhanced version of that. Do

01:00:20.225 --> 01:00:21.665
<v Speaker 1>you wanna try and configure one that runs

01:00:21.665 --> 01:00:22.785
<v Speaker 1>the search on Stack Overflow?

01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:26.500
<v Speaker 0>Does that work?

01:00:27.619 --> 01:00:29.859
<v Speaker 1>I I think so. I mean, let's let's

01:00:29.859 --> 01:00:31.700
<v Speaker 1>go let's go to actions.

01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:34.740
<v Speaker 0>Uh-huh.

01:00:36.545 --> 01:00:38.625
<v Speaker 1>And I'll just say in the meantime, I

01:00:38.625 --> 01:00:40.225
<v Speaker 1>think it's under event enrichment.

01:00:40.225 --> 01:00:42.545
<v Speaker 1>Either event enrichment or miscellaneous. Just look here

01:00:42.545 --> 01:00:45.505
<v Speaker 1>for Stack Overflow.

01:00:45.505 --> 01:00:47.345
<v Speaker 0>Yep. Stack Overflow and richer.

01:00:47.745 --> 01:00:49.105
<v Speaker 1>And in the meantime, I'm just gonna say

01:00:49.105 --> 01:00:51.185
<v Speaker 1>to Wind, excellent questions. So thank you very

01:00:51.185 --> 01:00:51.345
<v Speaker 1>much.

01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:53.670
<v Speaker 1>And, also, we're on Slack stuff, and we

01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:54.790
<v Speaker 1>have a community. So if you have any

01:00:54.790 --> 01:00:57.030
<v Speaker 1>questions, always reach out. Okay. Now take care

01:00:57.030 --> 01:00:58.310
<v Speaker 1>of the example config.

01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:04.550
<v Speaker 1>And yep. And so you're just gonna copy

01:01:04.550 --> 01:01:04.870
<v Speaker 1>this.

01:01:06.355 --> 01:01:08.275
<v Speaker 1>Copy the whole thing. Oh, the whole thing.

01:01:10.195 --> 01:01:11.875
<v Speaker 1>And now we're gonna add this to the

01:01:11.955 --> 01:01:13.475
<v Speaker 1>your home values. So you have to now

01:01:13.475 --> 01:01:14.915
<v Speaker 1>change the home values,

01:01:16.675 --> 01:01:18.515
<v Speaker 1>and you should have already have the generated

01:01:18.515 --> 01:01:19.075
<v Speaker 1>values.

01:01:22.510 --> 01:01:24.350
<v Speaker 1>And we just add on a new value

01:01:24.350 --> 01:01:26.350
<v Speaker 1>here called custom playbooks.

01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:28.990
<v Speaker 1>I think yep. C u s t o

01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:29.630
<v Speaker 1>m.

01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:30.990
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Playbooks.

01:01:31.550 --> 01:01:33.870
<v Speaker 1>Yep. And just pop this in here, but

01:01:33.870 --> 01:01:35.390
<v Speaker 1>just make that, like, a member of an

01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:36.990
<v Speaker 1>array. Custom playbooks is an array.

01:01:38.765 --> 01:01:39.885
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Okay. And

01:01:40.525 --> 01:01:42.125
<v Speaker 1>then you have to indent all of this.

01:01:44.045 --> 01:01:47.165
<v Speaker 0>With that. Right? No. The triggers, yeah, should

01:01:47.165 --> 01:01:49.245
<v Speaker 1>be the triggers should be backspaced. No. The

01:01:49.245 --> 01:01:49.885
<v Speaker 1>triggers

01:01:50.125 --> 01:01:50.685
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:01:51.085 --> 01:01:51.565
<v Speaker 1>Backspaced.

01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:53.900
<v Speaker 1>Two backspaces on that line and the line

01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:56.380
<v Speaker 1>after it. Yeah. On triggers and on.

01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:57.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:01.020
<v Speaker 1>That's it. And Oh, yeah. Actions and then

01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:02.700
<v Speaker 0>trigger. Alright. Okay. Gotcha. Gotcha.

01:02:04.075 --> 01:02:05.515
<v Speaker 0>See, YAML's hard.

01:02:06.315 --> 01:02:07.355
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah.

01:02:08.475 --> 01:02:10.555
<v Speaker 0>So just save that to the helm.

01:02:11.835 --> 01:02:12.475
<v Speaker 0>Upgrade.

01:02:12.955 --> 01:02:14.715
<v Speaker 0>Okay. In fact, I still have my helm

01:02:14.715 --> 01:02:15.275
<v Speaker 0>command here.

01:02:15.930 --> 01:02:17.849
<v Speaker 0>And I'll need to change this. Oh, no.

01:02:17.849 --> 01:02:18.810
<v Speaker 0>Don't do it again.

01:02:19.609 --> 01:02:21.050
<v Speaker 0>Home upgrade

01:02:21.050 --> 01:02:23.290
<v Speaker 0>slash slash install. Is that gonna be enough?

01:02:23.530 --> 01:02:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Perfect.

01:02:33.765 --> 01:02:35.765
<v Speaker 0>So now when we cause some sort of

01:02:35.765 --> 01:02:37.045
<v Speaker 0>failure scenario,

01:02:37.125 --> 01:02:38.165
<v Speaker 0>it looks up the

01:02:38.725 --> 01:02:40.405
<v Speaker 0>it does a search for Stack Overflow with

01:02:40.405 --> 01:02:41.845
<v Speaker 0>some of the information and then tries to

01:02:41.845 --> 01:02:42.645
<v Speaker 0>get me

01:02:42.965 --> 01:02:44.005
<v Speaker 0>a response?

01:02:44.565 --> 01:02:47.310
<v Speaker 1>Something like that. Yeah. We'll see it in

01:02:47.310 --> 01:02:47.870
<v Speaker 1>action.

01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:49.950
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I'm hoping you don't just copy

01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:52.270
<v Speaker 0>and paste the commands from Stack Overflow and

01:02:52.270 --> 01:02:54.030
<v Speaker 0>paste them into my cluster. Although that would

01:02:54.030 --> 01:02:55.390
<v Speaker 0>be fine. I'm not gonna I'm not gonna

01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:57.230
<v Speaker 1>do that. This is actually one of first

01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:59.390
<v Speaker 1>enrichers I wrote to kind of play around

01:02:59.390 --> 01:03:00.510
<v Speaker 1>with the concept myself

01:03:01.395 --> 01:03:03.155
<v Speaker 1>and mostly as a toy, like, not as

01:03:03.155 --> 01:03:05.475
<v Speaker 1>a real production use case, but it's interesting

01:03:05.475 --> 01:03:06.675
<v Speaker 1>to show the concept.

01:03:06.995 --> 01:03:08.355
<v Speaker 0>Well, let's go to

01:03:08.755 --> 01:03:09.555
<v Speaker 0>Robusta.

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:15.880
<v Speaker 0>So where's the code for the enrichers?

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:18.440
<v Speaker 1>So go into playbooks,

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.000
<v Speaker 1>and then we have here there should be

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.360
<v Speaker 1>one here called Stack Overflow.

01:03:28.695 --> 01:03:30.135
<v Speaker 1>Let's see. Maybe

01:03:32.375 --> 01:03:33.415
<v Speaker 1>so try

01:03:33.975 --> 01:03:35.015
<v Speaker 0>Search?

01:03:35.415 --> 01:03:37.255
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Try doing a search on Stack Overflow.

01:03:40.049 --> 01:03:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Yep. There we go. There's integration.

01:03:43.650 --> 01:03:45.650
<v Speaker 1>So 9262.

01:03:54.885 --> 01:03:55.685
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

01:03:56.725 --> 01:03:59.445
<v Speaker 0>So I can add chat GPT

01:03:59.685 --> 01:04:01.845
<v Speaker 0>and 25 lines of code, hopefully.

01:04:03.685 --> 01:04:06.165
<v Speaker 1>Exactly. Yeah. Because I I actually have played

01:04:06.165 --> 01:04:08.405
<v Speaker 0>with the chat GPT API

01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:11.620
<v Speaker 0>and that is just a regular request you're

01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:14.180
<v Speaker 0>making to an endpoint with some context. I

01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:15.620
<v Speaker 0>mean, we could totally make that work. Not

01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:16.980
<v Speaker 0>that suggestion we try and do it right

01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:18.740
<v Speaker 0>now, but I think this demo needs to

01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:19.380
<v Speaker 0>exist

01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:21.620
<v Speaker 0>and has to exist soon.

01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:22.260
<v Speaker 1>So

01:04:23.115 --> 01:04:25.595
<v Speaker 1>If you do this, our our offer stands.

01:04:25.595 --> 01:04:28.635
<v Speaker 1>We will send you some incredible customized

01:04:28.635 --> 01:04:30.555
<v Speaker 1>one off swag that no one else in

01:04:30.555 --> 01:04:31.355
<v Speaker 1>the world has.

01:04:31.995 --> 01:04:35.195
<v Speaker 0>Consider it done. Only that. Well, the text

01:04:35.195 --> 01:04:37.275
<v Speaker 1>on the shirt, we will generate with ChatGPT.

01:04:37.275 --> 01:04:39.170
<v Speaker 1>I will ask chat GPT to give me

01:04:39.170 --> 01:04:40.450
<v Speaker 1>the appropriate

01:04:40.609 --> 01:04:42.369
<v Speaker 1>quote for the shirt to send you.

01:04:43.170 --> 01:04:43.890
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:04:44.849 --> 01:04:46.609
<v Speaker 0>I mean, we could just have chat GPT

01:04:46.609 --> 01:04:48.210
<v Speaker 0>take over the stream as well. I'm pretty

01:04:48.210 --> 01:04:50.770
<v Speaker 0>sure. Just write write a script to show

01:04:50.770 --> 01:04:53.924
<v Speaker 0>off Robusta demo and improving your previous monitoring

01:04:53.924 --> 01:04:54.724
<v Speaker 0>and alert.

01:04:55.365 --> 01:04:58.005
<v Speaker 2>Yep. We have deployed the Stack Overflow thing,

01:04:58.005 --> 01:04:58.724
<v Speaker 0>I think.

01:04:58.964 --> 01:04:59.605
<v Speaker 0>So

01:04:59.924 --> 01:05:01.525
<v Speaker 0>how how do we check?

01:05:02.164 --> 01:05:04.484
<v Speaker 2>We have a utility in the CLI that

01:05:04.484 --> 01:05:06.244
<v Speaker 2>generates a demo alert. So

01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:08.820
<v Speaker 2>you run Robusta

01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:13.940
<v Speaker 2>demo minus alert.

01:05:18.755 --> 01:05:20.995
<v Speaker 2>So it takes a random pod from the

01:05:20.995 --> 01:05:23.635
<v Speaker 2>cluster and create the and a major alert

01:05:23.635 --> 01:05:24.435
<v Speaker 2>on that.

01:05:24.835 --> 01:05:27.235
<v Speaker 2>And then within few minutes, you should be

01:05:27.235 --> 01:05:29.955
<v Speaker 2>able you should get a new message on

01:05:29.955 --> 01:05:30.275
<v Speaker 2>Slack.

01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:40.550
<v Speaker 1>That, I believe, arrived yeah. That arrived beforehand.

01:05:40.550 --> 01:05:42.310
<v Speaker 1>That's not from right now. So just give

01:05:42.310 --> 01:05:44.230
<v Speaker 1>it a moment. You have a manager's sinuses.

01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:46.150
<v Speaker 1>So it sorry. An manager wait period, so

01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:46.870
<v Speaker 1>it takes a moment.

01:05:48.375 --> 01:05:50.215
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. This one's from six minutes ago, so

01:05:50.215 --> 01:05:51.255
<v Speaker 0>we just need to be

01:05:51.655 --> 01:05:52.695
<v Speaker 0>be patient.

01:05:53.415 --> 01:05:54.135
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

01:05:54.455 --> 01:05:55.735
<v Speaker 1>Are you all the you're all the way

01:05:55.735 --> 01:05:57.655
<v Speaker 1>scrolled down there. Right? Yeah.

01:05:58.295 --> 01:05:59.335
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Cool. Cool. Cool.

01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:01.770
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm. Just a weird

01:06:02.570 --> 01:06:03.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. So

01:06:04.170 --> 01:06:06.330
<v Speaker 1>while we're waiting, though, I'll say, okay. Here's

01:06:06.330 --> 01:06:08.090
<v Speaker 1>an alert. So see how how there's that

01:06:08.090 --> 01:06:10.330
<v Speaker 1>silence button at the top of the alert?

01:06:13.695 --> 01:06:15.375
<v Speaker 1>So I used to get a live alerts

01:06:15.375 --> 01:06:17.695
<v Speaker 1>in Slack, and then sometimes I wanna silence

01:06:17.695 --> 01:06:19.215
<v Speaker 1>them, but it was, like, annoying to do,

01:06:19.215 --> 01:06:21.295
<v Speaker 1>or I had multiple clusters that I'd have

01:06:21.295 --> 01:06:23.455
<v Speaker 1>to go and silence them on. So sometimes

01:06:24.415 --> 01:06:26.255
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really do what I should have,

01:06:26.255 --> 01:06:27.775
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes I didn't silence them, and I

01:06:27.775 --> 01:06:29.440
<v Speaker 1>would just get that same alert every six

01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:30.000
<v Speaker 1>hours.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:31.920
<v Speaker 1>So we've tried to make it really easy

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:32.800
<v Speaker 1>to silence.

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:34.400
<v Speaker 1>And even if you have, like, 10 different

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:36.800
<v Speaker 1>clusters, each with their own Prometheus and alert

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:38.720
<v Speaker 1>manager, then you can push out with one

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.480
<v Speaker 1>click that silence to all the different clusters.

01:06:40.815 --> 01:06:42.895
<v Speaker 1>And we prefill all the boxes here. It's

01:06:42.895 --> 01:06:45.214
<v Speaker 1>really, like, trying to encourage you to silence

01:06:45.214 --> 01:06:46.575
<v Speaker 1>something if it's noisy.

01:06:47.935 --> 01:06:50.015
<v Speaker 0>You need to put Mhmm.

01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:54.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh, no. But if you silence this, we're

01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:55.900
<v Speaker 1>gonna silence the dirt that

01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:58.140
<v Speaker 1>you have to delete it. We're gonna silence

01:06:58.140 --> 01:06:59.660
<v Speaker 1>the dirt that we have to simulate.

01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:02.220
<v Speaker 1>The the same what? Yeah.

01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:06.540
<v Speaker 1>And I've heard from that

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:09.475
<v Speaker 1>we will have a hundred at stars

01:07:09.635 --> 01:07:12.435
<v Speaker 1>at some point during this stream. A thousand?

01:07:12.435 --> 01:07:14.835
<v Speaker 1>Sorry. A thousand GitHub stars. At some point

01:07:14.835 --> 01:07:18.035
<v Speaker 1>during the stream, we're currently on 999.

01:07:18.275 --> 01:07:19.955
<v Speaker 1>So if you're the lucky person who gets

01:07:19.955 --> 01:07:21.395
<v Speaker 1>this thousand star,

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:22.240
<v Speaker 1>then,

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.400
<v Speaker 1>send it to us, and we will send

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:25.280
<v Speaker 1>you a T shirt.

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.960
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I've already started it. Correct.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Whoever gets the thousand star, just screenshot it

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:34.560
<v Speaker 1>and post it on Twitter afterwards.

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:37.475
<v Speaker 1>Tag me, tag, David, and we will send

01:07:37.475 --> 01:07:38.355
<v Speaker 1>you a T shirt.

01:07:39.955 --> 01:07:42.515
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Someone get out there. Win that T

01:07:42.515 --> 01:07:43.075
<v Speaker 0>shirt.

01:07:43.715 --> 01:07:44.755
<v Speaker 0>Let's

01:07:44.755 --> 01:07:45.235
<v Speaker 0>see.

01:07:45.635 --> 01:07:47.795
<v Speaker 0>We still don't have our Stack Overflow alert

01:07:47.795 --> 01:07:48.675
<v Speaker 0>just yet.

01:07:49.155 --> 01:07:51.315
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Let's check the dogs. And someone just

01:07:51.315 --> 01:07:53.410
<v Speaker 1>got a T shirt. I don't know who,

01:07:53.410 --> 01:07:54.690
<v Speaker 1>but someone just got the T shirt, so

01:07:54.690 --> 01:07:55.410
<v Speaker 1>congrats.

01:07:56.610 --> 01:07:57.490
<v Speaker 0>Hey.

01:07:59.890 --> 01:08:00.770
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

01:08:02.130 --> 01:08:03.810
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we think there's no problem?

01:08:05.214 --> 01:08:06.895
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. Let's jump over. Let's check

01:08:06.895 --> 01:08:08.095
<v Speaker 1>the Robusta dogs.

01:08:08.895 --> 01:08:10.095
<v Speaker 0>From the runner?

01:08:10.415 --> 01:08:12.415
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Yep. Congratulations,

01:08:12.575 --> 01:08:13.855
<v Speaker 1>JS. We got that T shirt.

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.119
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well done.

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:21.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I don't see any issue here.

01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:24.080
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we just need to wait a couple

01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:25.439
<v Speaker 2>of more minutes until

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:28.960
<v Speaker 2>alert manager will file it. There's default alert

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:30.160
<v Speaker 1>manager silences.

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Mhmm. So it's not silences. I'll wait periods.

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:34.175
<v Speaker 1>So when you send in the dirt, depending

01:08:34.175 --> 01:08:35.854
<v Speaker 1>on your configuration, it actually takes some time

01:08:35.854 --> 01:08:37.135
<v Speaker 1>for the dirt to arrive.

01:08:38.014 --> 01:08:38.654
<v Speaker 1>Let

01:08:39.215 --> 01:08:40.814
<v Speaker 1>me see. I'm trying to think if there's

01:08:40.814 --> 01:08:43.454
<v Speaker 1>a different way we could simulate it faster.

01:08:43.454 --> 01:08:44.974
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Maybe

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:49.000
<v Speaker 2>we have an alert simulation playbook you can

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.160
<v Speaker 2>take. That that's not the demo there it

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:51.640
<v Speaker 1>does?

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:55.000
<v Speaker 2>No. It creates an an alert on alert

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.920
<v Speaker 2>manager. Oh, that's why we have to wait

01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:58.680
<v Speaker 1>the period. Mhmm. Okay. So can you send

01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:00.835
<v Speaker 1>him the command then for the we're gonna

01:09:00.835 --> 01:09:01.875
<v Speaker 1>send you a way that does it faster.

01:09:01.875 --> 01:09:03.954
<v Speaker 0>It's here. It's here. Woo hoo.

01:09:04.755 --> 01:09:06.594
<v Speaker 2>And now if you click the button,

01:09:06.835 --> 01:09:07.635
<v Speaker 2>the

01:09:07.875 --> 01:09:09.794
<v Speaker 2>search Stack Overflow for

01:09:11.074 --> 01:09:13.474
<v Speaker 1>So this also shows, like, how playbooks can

01:09:13.474 --> 01:09:14.034
<v Speaker 1>be interactive.

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:16.920
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example of a playbook that's taking

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:19.160
<v Speaker 1>an action. You can also automatically remediate stuff

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:20.920
<v Speaker 1>when you click that button. You can do

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:21.880
<v Speaker 1>it different ways.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.600
<v Speaker 2>I think it will be really good to

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:25.800
<v Speaker 2>have chat GPT.

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:28.680
<v Speaker 1>Yes. Whoever flat GPT is getting the prize.

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:29.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you.

01:09:31.215 --> 01:09:33.135
<v Speaker 0>Hey. This stream's done. I've got some code

01:09:33.135 --> 01:09:33.854
<v Speaker 0>to write.

01:09:36.335 --> 01:09:38.495
<v Speaker 1>I'll point everyone in the right direction. Okay.

01:09:38.495 --> 01:09:39.935
<v Speaker 1>So go over to the Robusta docs,

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:44.840
<v Speaker 1>and there's a tutorial there on the left

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:46.679
<v Speaker 1>that says custom automation.

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:50.520
<v Speaker 1>And that tutorial shows you how to write

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:53.160
<v Speaker 1>your own playbook and to load into Robusta.

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:56.325
<v Speaker 1>And the source code, of course, So the

01:09:56.325 --> 01:09:57.525
<v Speaker 1>source code for this, can you drop in

01:09:57.525 --> 01:09:59.125
<v Speaker 1>the source code for the Stack Overflow one

01:09:59.125 --> 01:10:00.485
<v Speaker 1>so people know what they can go and

01:10:00.485 --> 01:10:01.045
<v Speaker 1>copy?

01:10:01.364 --> 01:10:03.125
<v Speaker 1>Alright. We'll drop that into the chat.

01:10:04.565 --> 01:10:08.165
<v Speaker 1>Which one? The Stack Overflow one. Yeah.

01:10:08.165 --> 01:10:10.820
<v Speaker 1>I think David's gonna do it anyway. Okay.

01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:12.500
<v Speaker 1>David might email someone else.

01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:19.300
<v Speaker 0>So it's just some Python code. So nice

01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:20.980
<v Speaker 0>and easy for people to work with web

01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:23.805
<v Speaker 0>APIs and pass in the data. I'm assuming

01:10:23.805 --> 01:10:25.085
<v Speaker 0>that's event event,

01:10:25.245 --> 01:10:26.765
<v Speaker 0>which I'm loving the name of and hating

01:10:26.765 --> 01:10:28.125
<v Speaker 0>it every much the same at the same

01:10:28.125 --> 01:10:28.605
<v Speaker 0>time.

01:10:30.125 --> 01:10:31.245
<v Speaker 0>Yep. Does does this

01:10:31.805 --> 01:10:33.485
<v Speaker 0>get event event get event.

01:10:34.125 --> 01:10:36.125
<v Speaker 0>Does that have all of that enrichment that

01:10:36.125 --> 01:10:38.960
<v Speaker 0>was previously done? Like what what do they

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:40.160
<v Speaker 0>have access to? I know we see we've

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:41.840
<v Speaker 0>got type, we've got reason, but does it

01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:43.519
<v Speaker 0>have the logs? Does it have

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.400
<v Speaker 0>the request and memory limits from the other

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:48.160
<v Speaker 0>enricher? Like, what what do we have access

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:48.960
<v Speaker 0>to within

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:52.000
<v Speaker 0>this? So each enricher is independent and each

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.665
<v Speaker 1>enricher access, it depends on the event there.

01:10:55.825 --> 01:10:57.425
<v Speaker 1>And I know event event has a really

01:10:57.425 --> 01:10:58.385
<v Speaker 1>awkward name.

01:10:58.945 --> 01:11:01.665
<v Speaker 1>But what event event represents,

01:11:01.665 --> 01:11:03.585
<v Speaker 1>like okay. What you would normally see there

01:11:03.585 --> 01:11:05.105
<v Speaker 1>isn't event event. What you would normally see

01:11:05.105 --> 01:11:07.860
<v Speaker 1>is pod event or deployment events.

01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:10.099
<v Speaker 1>And in this case, it's

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.660
<v Speaker 1>really a an event that happened on a

01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:14.820
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes event. You were listening to kubectl get

01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:16.580
<v Speaker 1>effect. So I know that's a super awkward

01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:18.420
<v Speaker 1>name and, like, I'm sorry about that.

01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:19.219
<v Speaker 1>But

01:11:20.034 --> 01:11:21.715
<v Speaker 1>what you would so what you would have

01:11:21.715 --> 01:11:24.354
<v Speaker 1>access to on the event object depends

01:11:24.675 --> 01:11:26.034
<v Speaker 1>on, like,

01:11:26.514 --> 01:11:28.114
<v Speaker 1>what it is. So if you're looking at

01:11:28.114 --> 01:11:29.795
<v Speaker 1>pod event, you can access the logs. If

01:11:29.795 --> 01:11:31.875
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at Prometheus event, then you can

01:11:31.875 --> 01:11:34.239
<v Speaker 1>access the pod that's associated with that. You

01:11:34.239 --> 01:11:36.480
<v Speaker 1>can access the Prometheus labels, the alert name,

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:37.920
<v Speaker 1>and all the different stuff. And you have

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:39.679
<v Speaker 1>all the complete, of course. So you'll just

01:11:39.679 --> 01:11:41.599
<v Speaker 1>be able to see there what's available.

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:43.199
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:46.239
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I'll be playing with that later on.

01:11:47.199 --> 01:11:47.760
<v Speaker 0>So

01:11:48.405 --> 01:11:50.805
<v Speaker 0>I think we're shown a lot here. We

01:11:50.805 --> 01:11:52.244
<v Speaker 0>deployed Robusta.

01:11:52.885 --> 01:11:55.765
<v Speaker 0>We've used the SaaS platform. We've poked around

01:11:55.765 --> 01:11:57.765
<v Speaker 0>our cluster. We caused a couple of failure

01:11:57.765 --> 01:11:58.645
<v Speaker 0>scenarios.

01:11:59.125 --> 01:12:01.765
<v Speaker 0>We've seen the messages come into Slack. We've

01:12:01.765 --> 01:12:04.085
<v Speaker 0>seen that those are interactive. We've got the

01:12:03.630 --> 01:12:05.949
<v Speaker 0>Slack overflow one. We've got the silences.

01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:08.590
<v Speaker 0>There's there's a lot of value from people

01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:11.550
<v Speaker 0>deploying Robusta to the cluster. So maybe if

01:12:11.550 --> 01:12:13.469
<v Speaker 0>you're happy to, you could tell us, like,

01:12:13.469 --> 01:12:15.870
<v Speaker 0>what are you working on? What's coming next?

01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:17.710
<v Speaker 0>How are you going to take Robusta to

01:12:17.710 --> 01:12:18.270
<v Speaker 0>the next level?

01:12:19.045 --> 01:12:21.524
<v Speaker 1>Oh, so let me open up my slides

01:12:21.605 --> 01:12:23.764
<v Speaker 1>and I'm gonna show exactly that.

01:12:24.244 --> 01:12:25.525
<v Speaker 0>So is there anything else you want to

01:12:25.525 --> 01:12:26.885
<v Speaker 0>show on on my side before we do

01:12:26.885 --> 01:12:28.405
<v Speaker 0>that? Like, I didn't mean to

01:12:29.045 --> 01:12:29.445
<v Speaker 1>No.

01:12:30.164 --> 01:12:31.125
<v Speaker 1>No. I think that's

01:12:32.719 --> 01:12:34.400
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Your slides are now live. Take it

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:34.960
<v Speaker 0>away.

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So I'll I'll speak briefly on what

01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:40.719
<v Speaker 1>we've done since we were last here. So

01:12:40.719 --> 01:12:42.480
<v Speaker 1>what we did is a live coverage. So,

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:44.000
<v Speaker 1>like, that's a lots of stuff to cover

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.199
<v Speaker 1>all these different things,

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:47.600
<v Speaker 1>all these different scenarios and add these playbooks

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:49.375
<v Speaker 1>for them. And the second thing we did

01:12:49.375 --> 01:12:50.975
<v Speaker 1>was to add in live destinations.

01:12:51.135 --> 01:12:52.335
<v Speaker 1>So last time we were here, you could

01:12:52.335 --> 01:12:54.255
<v Speaker 1>send stuff to, think, just Slack, and we

01:12:54.255 --> 01:12:56.895
<v Speaker 1>added on MS Teams and Discord and PagerDuty

01:12:56.895 --> 01:12:58.975
<v Speaker 1>and Cisco Webex and Opsgenie and all these

01:12:58.975 --> 01:13:00.015
<v Speaker 1>other destinations.

01:13:00.575 --> 01:13:02.255
<v Speaker 1>So those were the two main things that

01:13:02.255 --> 01:13:03.535
<v Speaker 1>we worked on here

01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:05.940
<v Speaker 1>as well as improvements to the SaaS platform,

01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:07.460
<v Speaker 1>but those were the main improvements in the

01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:08.980
<v Speaker 1>open source since we were last on the

01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:09.540
<v Speaker 1>stream.

01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:11.300
<v Speaker 1>And what we're gonna be working on in

01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:13.860
<v Speaker 1>the next year is more coverage. So it's

01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:15.220
<v Speaker 1>got different types of stuff,

01:13:16.135 --> 01:13:18.935
<v Speaker 1>major improvements to developer experience to to make

01:13:18.935 --> 01:13:21.655
<v Speaker 1>it even easier to update the playbook definitions.

01:13:22.054 --> 01:13:24.295
<v Speaker 1>And I edited my slides while you were

01:13:24.295 --> 01:13:26.534
<v Speaker 1>talking. So I think we're gonna get top

01:13:26.534 --> 01:13:27.414
<v Speaker 1>GPT

01:13:27.735 --> 01:13:28.775
<v Speaker 1>from David Flanagan.

01:13:29.890 --> 01:13:30.210
<v Speaker 1>They

01:13:30.690 --> 01:13:32.130
<v Speaker 1>from our favorite Rawkode,

01:13:32.290 --> 01:13:35.010
<v Speaker 1>and there'll be some more surprises coming, more

01:13:35.010 --> 01:13:36.450
<v Speaker 1>stuff that we're going to work on. We're

01:13:36.450 --> 01:13:38.770
<v Speaker 1>very driven by feedback we get. So, like,

01:13:38.770 --> 01:13:40.690
<v Speaker 1>it's the old saying goes, like, send us

01:13:40.690 --> 01:13:43.805
<v Speaker 1>all your weary and tired alerts. So, like,

01:13:43.805 --> 01:13:45.645
<v Speaker 1>tell us what's going on in your clusters.

01:13:45.645 --> 01:13:47.565
<v Speaker 1>Tell us what you want automated or why.

01:13:47.565 --> 01:13:49.885
<v Speaker 1>Tell us what issues you saw that happened

01:13:49.885 --> 01:13:51.885
<v Speaker 1>in your cluster that were annoying to investigate,

01:13:52.045 --> 01:13:53.805
<v Speaker 1>and those will go into their own map.

01:13:53.885 --> 01:13:55.805
<v Speaker 1>Tell us if you wanna send alerts to

01:13:56.045 --> 01:13:59.050
<v Speaker 1>different destinations that we don't support today. That's

01:13:59.050 --> 01:14:00.249
<v Speaker 1>why we support now

01:14:00.810 --> 01:14:03.130
<v Speaker 1>PagerDuty and AppsGenie, and, of course, we got

01:14:03.130 --> 01:14:05.370
<v Speaker 1>a lot of contributions there from the community

01:14:05.370 --> 01:14:07.929
<v Speaker 1>who have open PR requests as well. So

01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:11.370
<v Speaker 1>I think that's everything.

01:14:13.204 --> 01:14:14.724
<v Speaker 1>There's some more stuff I could talk about,

01:14:14.724 --> 01:14:16.244
<v Speaker 1>but I think those are the main things.

01:14:17.125 --> 01:14:20.164
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Thank you. Alright. Let me pop this

01:14:20.164 --> 01:14:21.364
<v Speaker 0>back over to here.

01:14:22.244 --> 01:14:24.804
<v Speaker 0>So thank you for sorry. Were you are

01:14:24.804 --> 01:14:27.060
<v Speaker 0>you not done? Oh, hey to JS. I

01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:28.420
<v Speaker 1>I want I need to get your address

01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:30.740
<v Speaker 1>and stuff, so message me afterwards on Twitter.

01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:32.180
<v Speaker 1>And it's already late here, so I'll probably

01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:34.180
<v Speaker 1>reply to you tomorrow. But message me on

01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:35.940
<v Speaker 1>Twitter, and then I'll put you in touch

01:14:35.940 --> 01:14:37.860
<v Speaker 1>with Mayan from our team, and you'll get

01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:38.660
<v Speaker 1>some swag.

01:14:40.045 --> 01:14:42.204
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Definitely drop him a DM, get that

01:14:42.204 --> 01:14:42.844
<v Speaker 0>swag.

01:14:43.485 --> 01:14:44.204
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:14:45.005 --> 01:14:46.844
<v Speaker 0>Well, thank you both for joining me today.

01:14:46.844 --> 01:14:48.605
<v Speaker 0>It's been fun taking a look at Robusta

01:14:48.605 --> 01:14:50.925
<v Speaker 0>again. It's always great to see where these

01:14:50.925 --> 01:14:52.844
<v Speaker 0>projects are going and the speed and the

01:14:52.844 --> 01:14:54.764
<v Speaker 0>velocity that these projects are kind of evolving

01:14:54.764 --> 01:14:56.860
<v Speaker 0>at. So it's just nice to to see

01:14:56.860 --> 01:14:58.860
<v Speaker 0>that you're making people's Kubernetes lives a little

01:14:58.860 --> 01:14:59.659
<v Speaker 0>bit easier.

01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:02.300
<v Speaker 0>So thank you again for taking the time.

01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:04.220
<v Speaker 0>Any last words before we finish up for

01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:04.780
<v Speaker 0>today?

01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:08.139
<v Speaker 1>Oh, there is a fun remark.

01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:10.140
<v Speaker 1>I I think,

01:15:11.265 --> 01:15:13.745
<v Speaker 1>but I think last time that Arik and

01:15:13.745 --> 01:15:15.665
<v Speaker 1>I were here, then there was someone in

01:15:15.665 --> 01:15:16.385
<v Speaker 1>the chat

01:15:16.625 --> 01:15:17.344
<v Speaker 1>who

01:15:17.505 --> 01:15:20.304
<v Speaker 1>we noticed and who was creating excellent content

01:15:20.304 --> 01:15:23.105
<v Speaker 1>on Twitter and who we subsequently added to

01:15:23.105 --> 01:15:23.744
<v Speaker 1>our team,

01:15:25.344 --> 01:15:26.065
<v Speaker 1>So

01:15:26.650 --> 01:15:27.610
<v Speaker 1>I think

01:15:27.850 --> 01:15:28.969
<v Speaker 1>I

01:15:29.290 --> 01:15:31.130
<v Speaker 1>think that's, like, a good closing the circle.

01:15:31.130 --> 01:15:32.890
<v Speaker 1>Think Pohang was here as part of the

01:15:32.890 --> 01:15:35.050
<v Speaker 1>community last time, and now he's also here

01:15:35.050 --> 01:15:36.170
<v Speaker 1>as part of the team.

01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Maybe next time also on the screen with

01:15:38.170 --> 01:15:39.449
<v Speaker 1>us. So,

01:15:40.090 --> 01:15:40.570
<v Speaker 1>I

01:15:40.890 --> 01:15:41.290
<v Speaker 1>guess

01:15:42.065 --> 01:15:44.065
<v Speaker 1>it's good to say, like, we're doing our

01:15:44.065 --> 01:15:45.985
<v Speaker 1>best to really build that open source community.

01:15:45.985 --> 01:15:47.505
<v Speaker 1>We are always hiring as well. So if

01:15:47.505 --> 01:15:49.025
<v Speaker 1>this sort of thing interests you, then please

01:15:49.025 --> 01:15:51.185
<v Speaker 1>reach out. We're hiring for front end positions.

01:15:51.345 --> 01:15:52.785
<v Speaker 1>We're hiring for a lot of different stuff.

01:15:52.785 --> 01:15:53.265
<v Speaker 1>So

01:15:54.065 --> 01:15:55.185
<v Speaker 1>my DMs are open.

01:15:55.969 --> 01:15:58.290
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. JS, just include your CV or your

01:15:58.290 --> 01:16:00.849
<v Speaker 0>resume when you're requesting your swag T shirt.

01:16:00.850 --> 01:16:01.729
<v Speaker 0>You never know.

01:16:02.370 --> 01:16:04.130
<v Speaker 1>Yes. Yes. Yes, please.

01:16:04.770 --> 01:16:06.610
<v Speaker 1>And has been doing excellent work on the

01:16:06.610 --> 01:16:09.825
<v Speaker 1>Robusta team. We also have the widest Kubernetes

01:16:09.825 --> 01:16:11.985
<v Speaker 1>thing now that we're doing together.

01:16:12.225 --> 01:16:12.784
<v Speaker 1>So

01:16:13.585 --> 01:16:15.905
<v Speaker 1>sometimes interesting, some stuff comes out with these

01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:16.545
<v Speaker 1>streams.

01:16:17.585 --> 01:16:19.265
<v Speaker 0>Well, yeah, it's it's nice that we get

01:16:19.265 --> 01:16:21.930
<v Speaker 0>the opportunity to share knowledge with each other

01:16:21.930 --> 01:16:23.610
<v Speaker 0>and with others. And then for the people

01:16:23.610 --> 01:16:25.690
<v Speaker 0>that, you know, wanna get more involved, there's

01:16:25.690 --> 01:16:27.850
<v Speaker 0>always opportunities. You know, open source is one

01:16:27.850 --> 01:16:30.170
<v Speaker 0>of the most welcoming places to get involved

01:16:30.170 --> 01:16:33.530
<v Speaker 0>and start contributing. It doesn't take any prerequisites.

01:16:33.610 --> 01:16:35.449
<v Speaker 0>And especially, I've gotta say the Kubernetes is

01:16:35.449 --> 01:16:37.050
<v Speaker 0>a cloud native ecosystem with some of the

01:16:37.050 --> 01:16:38.945
<v Speaker 0>most welcoming communities I've ever had the honor

01:16:38.945 --> 01:16:40.465
<v Speaker 0>of kind of participating in. So

01:16:41.185 --> 01:16:42.945
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's like, you know that old joke

01:16:42.945 --> 01:16:44.385
<v Speaker 1>down the Internet, no one knows you're a

01:16:44.385 --> 01:16:44.945
<v Speaker 1>dog?

01:16:45.905 --> 01:16:48.065
<v Speaker 0>No. I don't know that joke. I

01:16:48.625 --> 01:16:51.270
<v Speaker 1>think it's a famous New Yorker I

01:16:51.430 --> 01:16:53.989
<v Speaker 1>think it's a famous New Yorker comic strip,

01:16:54.070 --> 01:16:54.630
<v Speaker 1>but

01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:57.110
<v Speaker 1>it's so true, especially with open source. Like,

01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:59.510
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter who you are or where

01:16:59.510 --> 01:17:01.270
<v Speaker 1>you are, even what age you are. I

01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:02.950
<v Speaker 1>first got involved in open source when I

01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:04.630
<v Speaker 1>was 14 years old, and I was like

01:17:04.630 --> 01:17:07.314
<v Speaker 1>an old kid who didn't go outside enough.

01:17:07.554 --> 01:17:08.114
<v Speaker 1>And

01:17:08.435 --> 01:17:10.514
<v Speaker 1>then next thing I knew it, was, like,

01:17:10.514 --> 01:17:12.755
<v Speaker 1>flying me out to different hackathons and conferences.

01:17:13.235 --> 01:17:15.074
<v Speaker 1>And it's really one of the incredible things

01:17:15.074 --> 01:17:17.074
<v Speaker 1>about open source, the ability to really connect

01:17:17.074 --> 01:17:19.250
<v Speaker 1>people and to, like, be judged based on

01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:21.489
<v Speaker 1>the merit of your codes, not on your

01:17:21.489 --> 01:17:23.330
<v Speaker 1>background, not on what country you live in.

01:17:23.330 --> 01:17:25.090
<v Speaker 1>Like, none of it even matters with open

01:17:25.090 --> 01:17:27.730
<v Speaker 1>source. They're all just melts away. So

01:17:29.570 --> 01:17:32.185
<v Speaker 1>thank you, David, for, like, helping also to

01:17:32.185 --> 01:17:34.985
<v Speaker 1>organize this event and this stream. And think

01:17:35.145 --> 01:17:37.465
<v Speaker 1>at least one person, like, is who is

01:17:37.465 --> 01:17:39.865
<v Speaker 1>in the community, we became closer to also

01:17:39.865 --> 01:17:41.865
<v Speaker 1>due to a stream like this. So thank

01:17:41.865 --> 01:17:43.225
<v Speaker 1>you very much. Yeah. Thank you.

01:17:45.050 --> 01:17:47.450
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Alright. Well, thank you both again for

01:17:47.450 --> 01:17:49.050
<v Speaker 0>your time. It's been a pleasure. I'm sure

01:17:49.050 --> 01:17:51.690
<v Speaker 0>we'll speak again soon. And until next time,

01:17:51.690 --> 01:17:53.690
<v Speaker 0>we'll be back. Have a great day, everyone.
