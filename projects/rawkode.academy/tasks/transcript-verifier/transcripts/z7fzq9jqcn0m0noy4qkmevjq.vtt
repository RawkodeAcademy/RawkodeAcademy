<v Speaker 0>You know the situation.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.000
<v Speaker 0>You run your application locally in dev mode.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.360
<v Speaker 0>You hit refresh.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.759
<v Speaker 0>Your application works.

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.039
<v Speaker 0>But then you push it to production,

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.400
<v Speaker 0>and oh no.

00:00:15.705 --> 00:00:16.985

<v Speaker 0>In this video, we're going to take a

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:21.945
<v Speaker 0>look at a pretty cool feature and use

00:00:21.945 --> 00:00:24.345
<v Speaker 0>case for ngrok that will help you get

00:00:24.345 --> 00:00:26.105
<v Speaker 0>rid of this situation,

00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:28.744
<v Speaker 0>or at least make debugging it a whole

00:00:28.744 --> 00:00:29.705
<v Speaker 0>lot simpler.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.240

<v Speaker 0>100%

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.600
<v Speaker 0>test coverage across unit tests, integration tests, acceptance
