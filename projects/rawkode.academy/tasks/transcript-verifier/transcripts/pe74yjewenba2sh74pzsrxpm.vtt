00:00:38.524 --> 00:00:40.605
<v Speaker 0>Hello and welcome

00:00:40.605 --> 00:00:42.124
<v Speaker 0>to metal Mondays.

00:00:42.844 --> 00:00:45.484
<v Speaker 0>Well, I am joined by two fabulous colleagues.

00:00:45.484 --> 00:00:46.765
<v Speaker 0>One of them has decided to take a

00:00:46.765 --> 00:00:48.524
<v Speaker 0>little break at the last minute and I'm

00:00:48.524 --> 00:00:49.725
<v Speaker 0>just gonna bring him in now.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.390
<v Speaker 0>I decided not to show your empty chair

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.750
<v Speaker 0>Jeremy because this is professional

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.309
<v Speaker 0>feature and we do not have that kind

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.350
<v Speaker 0>of thing around here.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Happy Monday.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.590
<v Speaker 0>I've also joined oh, I haven't actually introduced

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.989
<v Speaker 0>anyone. I'm joined by two wonderful colleagues from

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.595
<v Speaker 0>Equinix Medal, Tom Crow and Jeremy Tanner. Welcome

00:01:07.595 --> 00:01:08.395
<v Speaker 0>friends.

00:01:09.115 --> 00:01:11.435
<v Speaker 1>Thank you. Thanks, Macay.

00:01:12.235 --> 00:01:12.955
<v Speaker 0>So

00:01:13.195 --> 00:01:14.395
<v Speaker 0>who wants to

00:01:15.035 --> 00:01:17.275
<v Speaker 0>explain to our wonderful viewers what we're gonna

00:01:17.275 --> 00:01:17.915
<v Speaker 0>be doing today?

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.460
<v Speaker 2>Sure. We're gonna basically start at the very

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.860
<v Speaker 2>entry point into Equinix metal and we're gonna

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.700
<v Speaker 2>show you how to spin up your your

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.420
<v Speaker 2>servers

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.180
<v Speaker 2>and what information you can get out of

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.420
<v Speaker 2>those. We're gonna go through three stages of

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.460
<v Speaker 2>that. We're gonna look at how to do

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 2>it through the UI,

00:01:33.884 --> 00:01:35.564
<v Speaker 2>what what you get through there.

00:01:36.045 --> 00:01:37.804
<v Speaker 2>Then we're gonna delve into the API and

00:01:37.804 --> 00:01:39.725
<v Speaker 2>look at the power of the CLI.

00:01:40.765 --> 00:01:41.965
<v Speaker 0>That sounds awesome.

00:01:42.365 --> 00:01:43.485
<v Speaker 0>So I think this is gonna be a

00:01:43.485 --> 00:01:45.244
<v Speaker 0>regular feature by the three of us here.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.660
<v Speaker 0>Metal Mondays may not be the working title

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.180
<v Speaker 0>name and this is very much ad hoc

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.260
<v Speaker 0>and off the cuff this evening. But we

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.780
<v Speaker 0>do have some really good content to show

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.540
<v Speaker 0>you. Like Tom says, we're gonna introduce you

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.940
<v Speaker 0>to spinning up metal with Equinix metal through

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.780
<v Speaker 0>the three different avenues.

00:01:59.924 --> 00:02:02.564
<v Speaker 0>And I think the plan is, is that

00:02:02.564 --> 00:02:04.725
<v Speaker 0>Tom here is gonna walk us through using

00:02:04.725 --> 00:02:07.124
<v Speaker 0>the user interface of the console. The

00:02:07.844 --> 00:02:10.084
<v Speaker 0>clicky approach, click ops to spin an upper

00:02:10.084 --> 00:02:12.004
<v Speaker 0>metal. We're then gonna go into a slightly

00:02:12.004 --> 00:02:13.765
<v Speaker 0>deeper dive with Jeremy who's gonna show us

00:02:13.765 --> 00:02:15.770
<v Speaker 0>how to use the XMetal

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.690
<v Speaker 0>API to provision infrastructure.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.570
<v Speaker 0>And then I'm gonna phone it in with

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.570
<v Speaker 0>a really quick demo of the CLI and

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.810
<v Speaker 0>show you how you can just use the

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.410
<v Speaker 0>the packet tools that are available on the

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.410
<v Speaker 0>terminal to do something very similar to the

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.010
<v Speaker 0>API, but hopefully a little bit easier.

00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:32.534
<v Speaker 0>With that being said, if I can get

00:02:32.534 --> 00:02:34.615
<v Speaker 0>you Tom to share your screen,

00:02:34.775 --> 00:02:37.175
<v Speaker 0>we'll start with the ClickOps.

00:02:37.735 --> 00:02:38.535
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.

00:02:40.855 --> 00:02:41.735
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:02:41.735 --> 00:02:44.250
<v Speaker 0>There we go. Alright. Here is our landing

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.570
<v Speaker 2>page. When you get your account up and

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.810
<v Speaker 2>running on Equinix Medal, this is what you're

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.410
<v Speaker 2>gonna see. If you have questions about the

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.130
<v Speaker 2>servers

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.370
<v Speaker 2>and how things work, click right here, get

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.970
<v Speaker 2>some help, open up to our

00:02:56.595 --> 00:02:58.834
<v Speaker 2>server's docs. But let's go ahead and get

00:02:58.834 --> 00:03:00.755
<v Speaker 2>started. Let's just spin up our first server.

00:03:01.155 --> 00:03:03.075
<v Speaker 2>And for this purpose, we're gonna go ahead

00:03:03.075 --> 00:03:05.155
<v Speaker 2>and pick up an on demand server.

00:03:05.315 --> 00:03:08.915
<v Speaker 2>If you wanna ensure that you have the

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 2>that you have this the hardware you need

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 2>for growth and,

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:14.460
<v Speaker 2>scale.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.299
<v Speaker 2>The only way we can really guarantee that

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:17.739
<v Speaker 2>is reserve. But for what we're doing right

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 2>now, we can do a quick on demand

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.739
<v Speaker 2>server.

00:03:23.105 --> 00:03:25.505
<v Speaker 2>And I am gonna go with

00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:27.505
<v Speaker 2>our

00:03:27.905 --> 00:03:28.945
<v Speaker 2>New York

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:32.145
<v Speaker 2>off oh, I am not gonna go with

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:32.545
<v Speaker 2>New York.

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.760
<v Speaker 2>So we'll go with our Dallas. That's closest

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.680
<v Speaker 2>to Jeremy and I, actually halfway between the

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.400
<v Speaker 2>two of us.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.560
<v Speaker 2>And for this,

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm just gonna do a c three medium,

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.865
<v Speaker 2>which, you can see in the c in

00:03:47.865 --> 00:03:49.785
<v Speaker 2>the UI, you can tell exactly what all

00:03:49.785 --> 00:03:51.465
<v Speaker 2>the specs are for your devices that you're

00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:53.225
<v Speaker 2>looking for in the data in which data

00:03:53.225 --> 00:03:55.305
<v Speaker 2>center. I think this is really cool stuff

00:03:55.305 --> 00:03:56.985
<v Speaker 0>about the the plans that we have available

00:03:56.985 --> 00:03:58.505
<v Speaker 0>as well. It's like, not only do we

00:03:58.505 --> 00:04:01.430
<v Speaker 0>have some pretty awesome chunky bare metal hardware,

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.950
<v Speaker 0>there's also a lot of ARM chips in

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:03.670
<v Speaker 0>there too.

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:05.270
<v Speaker 2>There are. You can

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:09.750
<v Speaker 2>as you look through, you can see, like,

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.189
<v Speaker 2>our c one large ARM. If you wanna

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:12.709
<v Speaker 2>play with the ARM, we know that's gonna

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.225
<v Speaker 2>be a bigger player in the in the

00:04:15.704 --> 00:04:17.704
<v Speaker 2>hardware space in the coming years.

00:04:18.024 --> 00:04:19.065
<v Speaker 2>But for right now, like I said, we'll

00:04:19.065 --> 00:04:20.505
<v Speaker 2>just go with the c three, and I'm

00:04:20.505 --> 00:04:23.385
<v Speaker 2>gonna deploy cent CentOS seven.

00:04:24.025 --> 00:04:25.544
<v Speaker 2>When you're looking, you can see you can

00:04:25.544 --> 00:04:27.945
<v Speaker 2>bring your own

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.240
<v Speaker 2>IPXC image. You can do Debian. You can

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.080
<v Speaker 2>do Ubuntu. You can do so you can

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.520
<v Speaker 2>do pretty much anything you want.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.800
<v Speaker 2>I am going to unlike every other time

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.640
<v Speaker 2>I've deployed, I'm gonna remember to to change

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.280
<v Speaker 2>the name here.

00:04:42.495 --> 00:04:44.255
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna call it metal both mean.

00:04:44.895 --> 00:04:45.935
<v Speaker 2>Metal Monday.

00:04:47.215 --> 00:04:49.455
<v Speaker 2>It means that this operating system is faster

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:51.375
<v Speaker 2>than the others here. So you can see

00:04:51.375 --> 00:04:52.495
<v Speaker 2>that Ubuntu

00:04:52.655 --> 00:04:56.255
<v Speaker 2>and, CentOS both deploy in sixty seconds. So

00:04:56.255 --> 00:04:58.919
<v Speaker 2>once I hit once I hit go, we

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:00.199
<v Speaker 2>can start our timer and see how we're

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:01.800
<v Speaker 2>doing. I'm gonna go on and just do

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.639
<v Speaker 2>everything by default to keep things simple for

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.800
<v Speaker 2>us and deploy now.

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:09.319
<v Speaker 1>Alright. You're on the clock.

00:05:12.345 --> 00:05:13.865
<v Speaker 2>Right here we can see It

00:05:15.465 --> 00:05:16.665
<v Speaker 2>looks like one or more of our new

00:05:16.665 --> 00:05:18.985
<v Speaker 2>instances is waiting for something else to deprovision.

00:05:19.225 --> 00:05:20.905
<v Speaker 2>And now we're actually going. You can see

00:05:20.905 --> 00:05:22.905
<v Speaker 2>the spinning wheel letting us know that it's

00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:23.625
<v Speaker 2>provisioning.

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:25.385
<v Speaker 2>One thing I like in the UI, you

00:05:25.385 --> 00:05:27.305
<v Speaker 2>can click here and see exactly what stage

00:05:27.305 --> 00:05:27.785
<v Speaker 2>of the

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.599
<v Speaker 2>provisioning process you're in. Right now, we've hit

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:34.000
<v Speaker 2>9% and we're setting our network configuration. You

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.919
<v Speaker 2>can see the entire path that this

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.319
<v Speaker 2>hardware is gonna go before it's up and

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:38.880
<v Speaker 2>running.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.960
<v Speaker 1>Third thirty seconds. Twenty

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.479
<v Speaker 1>seven percent.

00:05:44.105 --> 00:05:45.625
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm I'm under the gun

00:05:45.625 --> 00:05:47.385
<v Speaker 2>here, y'all. I I may have promised more

00:05:47.385 --> 00:05:48.905
<v Speaker 2>than I could more than I can deliver

00:05:48.905 --> 00:05:49.465
<v Speaker 2>here.

00:05:50.825 --> 00:05:53.225
<v Speaker 1>Well, the lightning bolt might made some promises.

00:05:53.545 --> 00:05:54.745
<v Speaker 2>It did. It did.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.810
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. The light at all is is quite

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.370
<v Speaker 0>accurate. I found that, you know, maybe not

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.490
<v Speaker 0>consistently under sixty seconds, but it's consistently fast

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.570
<v Speaker 0>for those operating systems. And it really just

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.210
<v Speaker 0>depends on the the facility that you choose.

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.305
<v Speaker 0>You did pick one of the default facilities

00:06:10.305 --> 00:06:12.545
<v Speaker 0>Dallas Fort Fort Worth, which is obviously got

00:06:12.545 --> 00:06:14.225
<v Speaker 0>a lot going on. So sometimes it can

00:06:14.225 --> 00:06:15.265
<v Speaker 0>be a little bit slower.

00:06:15.665 --> 00:06:18.065
<v Speaker 2>Right. But it just depends on facility, what

00:06:18.065 --> 00:06:20.465
<v Speaker 0>capacity is available, which type of machine you

00:06:20.465 --> 00:06:21.265
<v Speaker 0>you chose.

00:06:21.505 --> 00:06:23.425
<v Speaker 0>There are many different conditions, but still it

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:25.530
<v Speaker 0>will be fast. Maybe not sixty seconds, but

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:26.490
<v Speaker 0>it will be fast.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.850
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.690
<v Speaker 1>And then not not a CentOS emergency.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.850
<v Speaker 0>No. Definitely not. And then, you know, the

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.264
<v Speaker 0>next few what, dots? Oh, there you I

00:06:38.264 --> 00:06:40.104
<v Speaker 0>was gonna say, the They go really quickly.

00:06:40.104 --> 00:06:40.745
<v Speaker 1>Fast.

00:06:40.905 --> 00:06:43.065
<v Speaker 2>They are. But I think for what we're

00:06:43.065 --> 00:06:44.825
<v Speaker 2>used to with deploying servers,

00:06:45.065 --> 00:06:46.745
<v Speaker 2>you know, you would you would start deploying,

00:06:46.745 --> 00:06:48.505
<v Speaker 2>walk off, go grab your coffee, talk to

00:06:48.505 --> 00:06:50.025
<v Speaker 2>your coworker, come back, check-in.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.620
<v Speaker 2>We're definitely not in those days anymore with

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.100
<v Speaker 2>this.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.900
<v Speaker 0>No. And now the machine is is just

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.460
<v Speaker 0>rebooting. So the operating system has already been

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.380
<v Speaker 0>provisioned. And now it's just a case of

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.260
<v Speaker 0>that machine spinning back up, loading the kernel,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.940
<v Speaker 0>and and giving you a a shell if

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.405
<v Speaker 0>you want it, which is good.

00:07:08.165 --> 00:07:10.005
<v Speaker 2>Alright. We are up and running. We can

00:07:10.005 --> 00:07:12.405
<v Speaker 2>see that here. Under actions, we do have

00:07:12.485 --> 00:07:14.165
<v Speaker 2>details that we can get. We can go

00:07:14.165 --> 00:07:16.805
<v Speaker 2>here and get all of the the IP

00:07:17.445 --> 00:07:18.885
<v Speaker 2>addresses for our

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.770
<v Speaker 2>machine. You'll notice that there's an SSH root

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.530
<v Speaker 2>password. This is when you if you're gonna

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.930
<v Speaker 2>tunnel in to your device, you can copy

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.210
<v Speaker 2>this and use it for the first twenty

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.130
<v Speaker 2>four hours while you get everything set up.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:30.970
<v Speaker 2>Down here, we can see exactly what hardware

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:32.485
<v Speaker 2>we have. We can look at the twenty

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:34.805
<v Speaker 2>four hour traffic. Obviously, we haven't done anything

00:07:34.805 --> 00:07:37.125
<v Speaker 2>with this server yet, so there's no traffic.

00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:41.685
<v Speaker 2>We can set up our SSH keys.

00:07:41.845 --> 00:07:42.485
<v Speaker 2>Nope.

00:07:42.645 --> 00:07:44.565
<v Speaker 2>See who see all the SSH keys that

00:07:44.565 --> 00:07:45.285
<v Speaker 2>are tied to it.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.260
<v Speaker 2>One thing I also like, we have built

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.500
<v Speaker 2>into everything is this rescue OS. If something

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.580
<v Speaker 2>goes wrong and our server is not performing

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.260
<v Speaker 2>the way it should or not communicating,

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.500
<v Speaker 2>we can do a rescue OS and recover

00:07:58.820 --> 00:07:59.860
<v Speaker 2>recover the hardware.

00:08:00.795 --> 00:08:01.835
<v Speaker 2>And

00:08:02.155 --> 00:08:03.755
<v Speaker 2>have a question if you're happy to take

00:08:03.755 --> 00:08:06.235
<v Speaker 0>it, Tom. We do. What is it?

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:07.835
<v Speaker 0>So

00:08:07.995 --> 00:08:11.995
<v Speaker 0>Vikram has asked, can we explain why Equinix

00:08:11.995 --> 00:08:13.755
<v Speaker 0>Metal is different to Digital Ocean?

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. So Equinix Metal, you're actually the you're

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.980
<v Speaker 2>getting the full hardware. You're not getting some,

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.340
<v Speaker 2>you know, something you're not getting a a

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.340
<v Speaker 2>droplet wrapped up as part of a hardware.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.860
<v Speaker 2>You actually have all the way down to

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.425
<v Speaker 2>the very base basic level of of this

00:08:30.425 --> 00:08:32.825
<v Speaker 2>hardware. You can, put whatever you want. There

00:08:32.825 --> 00:08:34.825
<v Speaker 2>are no assumptions that are built into what

00:08:34.825 --> 00:08:36.345
<v Speaker 2>you may or may not need in your

00:08:36.345 --> 00:08:38.745
<v Speaker 2>stack or how it should be provisioned. You're

00:08:38.745 --> 00:08:40.664
<v Speaker 2>making every decision and have a lot more

00:08:40.664 --> 00:08:42.664
<v Speaker 2>a lot more control over

00:08:42.825 --> 00:08:45.225
<v Speaker 2>your infrastructure than you do with other providers.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I would say, quite simply, there is

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.440
<v Speaker 1>one of you on one machine,

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.760
<v Speaker 1>and, that's bare metal.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.720
<v Speaker 1>You with, with other providers, often the situation

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.035
<v Speaker 1>is you're on a virtual machine. There may

00:08:59.035 --> 00:08:59.515
<v Speaker 1>be,

00:09:00.315 --> 00:09:03.275
<v Speaker 1>n of you, usually n being many,

00:09:04.635 --> 00:09:07.675
<v Speaker 1>all on the same machine with a, subdivided

00:09:07.675 --> 00:09:10.555
<v Speaker 1>into a little virtual machine chunks, which appears

00:09:10.555 --> 00:09:12.075
<v Speaker 1>to be its own computer, but it's not

00:09:12.075 --> 00:09:12.715
<v Speaker 1>a real computer.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Which Without the whole matrix background of what

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:16.540
<v Speaker 1>is real.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.540
<v Speaker 2>Which can become problematic if one of if

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.780
<v Speaker 2>if something's going wrong with somebody else's drop

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.220
<v Speaker 2>or somebody else's

00:09:25.305 --> 00:09:27.305
<v Speaker 2>environment on on the same server, you can

00:09:27.305 --> 00:09:29.945
<v Speaker 2>start having noisy neighbor problems, have performance issues.

00:09:29.945 --> 00:09:32.665
<v Speaker 2>Here, you know exactly what you have reserved

00:09:32.665 --> 00:09:34.345
<v Speaker 2>for yourself and you know what space you

00:09:34.345 --> 00:09:36.265
<v Speaker 2>have, and that's all dedicated a % to

00:09:36.265 --> 00:09:36.425
<v Speaker 2>you.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.920
<v Speaker 2>We went ahead,

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.800
<v Speaker 2>before I pass off to Jeremy, what we

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.400
<v Speaker 2>would normally do here is we would go

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.040
<v Speaker 2>grab,

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.000
<v Speaker 2>and create an API key. Jeremy's already got

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.360
<v Speaker 2>that. So with that, I'm gonna pass it

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.880
<v Speaker 2>over to you, Jeremy, and let you show

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.600
<v Speaker 2>them what they can do with the API.

00:09:54.585 --> 00:09:55.625
<v Speaker 0>I

00:09:56.185 --> 00:09:58.185
<v Speaker 0>went to remove your screen talking to Jeremy.

00:09:58.985 --> 00:09:59.945
<v Speaker 2>That's

00:09:59.945 --> 00:10:01.545
<v Speaker 2>not the time to run away, Jeremy.

00:10:04.185 --> 00:10:05.865
<v Speaker 1>Alright. We're going to

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:09.630
<v Speaker 1>give a look at the Equinix metal project

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:10.910
<v Speaker 1>right here. Perfect.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:15.230
<v Speaker 1>So, for this, to demonstrate these features, I'm

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.110
<v Speaker 1>going to use my favorite API explorer,

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:19.790
<v Speaker 1>which is Paw for macOS.

00:10:20.665 --> 00:10:23.145
<v Speaker 1>And the first thing is I'm going to

00:10:23.145 --> 00:10:24.505
<v Speaker 1>look for the,

00:10:24.905 --> 00:10:27.865
<v Speaker 1>decide before I, bring up a machine, what

00:10:27.865 --> 00:10:30.665
<v Speaker 1>operating system I'm going to want to use.

00:10:30.745 --> 00:10:32.505
<v Speaker 1>The operating system's endpoint,

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:35.810
<v Speaker 1>you can give a look, and then that

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:36.370
<v Speaker 1>will,

00:10:37.569 --> 00:10:38.769
<v Speaker 1>bring back the

00:10:39.089 --> 00:10:41.329
<v Speaker 1>full list of the operating systems that are

00:10:41.329 --> 00:10:41.970
<v Speaker 1>available,

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.250
<v Speaker 1>the UUID that we're using for them, their,

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:46.209
<v Speaker 1>their version,

00:10:46.764 --> 00:10:48.445
<v Speaker 1>and and so on.

00:10:48.845 --> 00:10:50.685
<v Speaker 1>And so if you use,

00:10:51.245 --> 00:10:53.084
<v Speaker 1>j q to filter that list to just

00:10:53.084 --> 00:10:54.765
<v Speaker 1>the names of the operating system,

00:10:55.084 --> 00:10:58.204
<v Speaker 1>there are 58 different OSs that we have

00:10:58.204 --> 00:10:59.725
<v Speaker 1>available for you to

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.300
<v Speaker 1>put on these,

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.420
<v Speaker 1>machines.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.260
<v Speaker 1>In addition to, you can, bring your own,

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.580
<v Speaker 1>on this. I believe that's the,

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:10.580
<v Speaker 1>custom IPXC,

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.100
<v Speaker 1>and you can, so

00:11:12.955 --> 00:11:15.195
<v Speaker 1>50 so 56

00:11:15.595 --> 00:11:17.275
<v Speaker 1>because one of them is

00:11:17.755 --> 00:11:19.755
<v Speaker 1>is called deep revision

00:11:19.835 --> 00:11:22.795
<v Speaker 1>up here, which is actually the the the

00:11:22.795 --> 00:11:25.035
<v Speaker 1>reverse of putting operating system onto a machine.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.320
<v Speaker 1>And

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.480
<v Speaker 1>all the all the rest of them are.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.400
<v Speaker 1>And then, you can also you can also

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.240
<v Speaker 1>bring your own if you would like. And

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.280
<v Speaker 1>so, once we decide which operating system we'll

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:35.840
<v Speaker 1>use,

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.440
<v Speaker 1>how about,

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.440
<v Speaker 1>how about Ubuntu 20

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.560
<v Speaker 1>we'll go with?

00:11:41.834 --> 00:11:43.834
<v Speaker 1>And then we'll look for plans,

00:11:43.834 --> 00:11:44.475
<v Speaker 1>which is

00:11:45.355 --> 00:11:47.115
<v Speaker 1>what we call our different

00:11:48.154 --> 00:11:49.675
<v Speaker 1>our different machine types.

00:11:50.395 --> 00:11:52.395
<v Speaker 1>And so you're going to see the very

00:11:52.395 --> 00:11:55.100
<v Speaker 1>much the same things that you saw in

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:56.380
<v Speaker 1>the dashboard.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:57.580
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be able to see here.

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:00.060
<v Speaker 1>And so the the names of the machines,

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.980
<v Speaker 1>the sizes of them, how much memory,

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.459
<v Speaker 1>what sort of, sort of drives are inside

00:12:04.459 --> 00:12:04.940
<v Speaker 1>them,

00:12:05.339 --> 00:12:05.660
<v Speaker 1>which,

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:08.140
<v Speaker 1>how many NICs at at what speed they

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:08.380
<v Speaker 1>have,

00:12:09.065 --> 00:12:09.625
<v Speaker 1>and,

00:12:10.185 --> 00:12:12.425
<v Speaker 1>what they're going to cost for your particular

00:12:12.425 --> 00:12:14.665
<v Speaker 1>account to use. And so,

00:12:15.065 --> 00:12:17.225
<v Speaker 1>for this particular machine,

00:12:17.464 --> 00:12:17.785
<v Speaker 1>the,

00:12:18.585 --> 00:12:21.145
<v Speaker 1>the two a four, that's going to be,

00:12:21.385 --> 00:12:22.425
<v Speaker 1>50¢ an hour.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.600
<v Speaker 1>And then,

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.399
<v Speaker 1>the final part of, deciding what we what

00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:32.000
<v Speaker 1>we want is going to be which which

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.720
<v Speaker 1>facility we put that in. And so at

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.600
<v Speaker 1>the facilities endpoint, you're able to look and

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.120
<v Speaker 1>see all of the different

00:12:40.135 --> 00:12:41.095
<v Speaker 1>facilities

00:12:41.335 --> 00:12:41.975
<v Speaker 1>that

00:12:42.215 --> 00:12:42.855
<v Speaker 1>we

00:12:43.495 --> 00:12:45.895
<v Speaker 1>we have available to you. Your account may

00:12:45.895 --> 00:12:46.535
<v Speaker 1>show,

00:12:46.855 --> 00:12:49.895
<v Speaker 1>more or fewer depending on, what the, what

00:12:49.895 --> 00:12:51.335
<v Speaker 1>the permissions on it are.

00:12:51.815 --> 00:12:53.415
<v Speaker 1>Those are the names of all the

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:55.650
<v Speaker 1>facilities we're using.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:58.529
<v Speaker 1>They're all given the, they're all given the

00:12:58.529 --> 00:12:59.170
<v Speaker 1>code,

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:03.089
<v Speaker 1>counting upwards of the nearest airport to that

00:13:03.089 --> 00:13:03.810
<v Speaker 1>data center.

00:13:07.405 --> 00:13:08.365
<v Speaker 1>And then

00:13:09.165 --> 00:13:09.485
<v Speaker 1>your

00:13:11.005 --> 00:13:14.045
<v Speaker 1>these list of servers in the dashboard is

00:13:14.045 --> 00:13:16.045
<v Speaker 1>is very similar to the

00:13:16.925 --> 00:13:18.445
<v Speaker 1>what you're going to get when you call

00:13:18.445 --> 00:13:19.965
<v Speaker 1>a git on devices,

00:13:20.845 --> 00:13:23.160
<v Speaker 1>and that's going to bring back all of

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.360
<v Speaker 1>the machines

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.560
<v Speaker 1>that are currently

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.760
<v Speaker 1>on that in that particular project.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.760
<v Speaker 1>So Tom did not kill

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:31.720
<v Speaker 1>the

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.960
<v Speaker 1>the one that he brought up, and so

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.120
<v Speaker 1>you can now see all of the information

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.560
<v Speaker 1>associated with the

00:13:38.865 --> 00:13:40.465
<v Speaker 1>the device that Tom made and called it

00:13:40.465 --> 00:13:42.065
<v Speaker 1>demo metal Monday.

00:13:42.225 --> 00:13:44.225
<v Speaker 1>It's assigned to him.

00:13:44.385 --> 00:13:46.705
<v Speaker 1>If you're if you're sharing this account, you're

00:13:46.705 --> 00:13:48.545
<v Speaker 1>able to see who brought a particular

00:13:48.945 --> 00:13:51.025
<v Speaker 1>machine up, so you're able to then contact

00:13:51.025 --> 00:13:52.945
<v Speaker 1>them if you have if you have questions

00:13:52.945 --> 00:13:53.345
<v Speaker 1>about it.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:56.500
<v Speaker 1>That's seven.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.100
<v Speaker 1>And then all of the rest of the

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.740
<v Speaker 1>you'll have the list of SSH keys that

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:03.220
<v Speaker 1>are

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.340
<v Speaker 1>that are on that machine so that you'll

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.655
<v Speaker 1>know who's able to who's able to easily

00:14:08.655 --> 00:14:09.535
<v Speaker 1>get into it.

00:14:10.095 --> 00:14:11.695
<v Speaker 1>Again, where it is, that one's up in

00:14:11.695 --> 00:14:12.415
<v Speaker 1>Dallas,

00:14:13.215 --> 00:14:15.375
<v Speaker 1>and all of the rest of the information.

00:14:15.455 --> 00:14:17.455
<v Speaker 1>So don't have to show bringing one up,

00:14:17.455 --> 00:14:18.095
<v Speaker 1>but we

00:14:18.655 --> 00:14:21.055
<v Speaker 1>very quite easily can. Bringing up a machine

00:14:21.055 --> 00:14:22.255
<v Speaker 1>is done by

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.640
<v Speaker 1>sending just a few bits of information

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.480
<v Speaker 1>to that same

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.560
<v Speaker 1>devices endpoint,

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.440
<v Speaker 1>but as opposed instead of a as opposed

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.360
<v Speaker 1>instead of a get. And you're going to

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.440
<v Speaker 1>want to say what facility you're putting something

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.145
<v Speaker 1>into, or you can give it the word

00:14:38.145 --> 00:14:40.065
<v Speaker 1>any in case you want to in case

00:14:40.065 --> 00:14:41.505
<v Speaker 1>you want to leave it up to us

00:14:41.745 --> 00:14:42.465
<v Speaker 1>where

00:14:43.105 --> 00:14:45.105
<v Speaker 1>where that machine is. And then we have

00:14:45.105 --> 00:14:47.265
<v Speaker 1>the UUID for the particular

00:14:47.345 --> 00:14:48.785
<v Speaker 1>machine that you've chosen,

00:14:49.185 --> 00:14:50.945
<v Speaker 1>the UUID for the particular operating

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:54.660
<v Speaker 1>system you've chosen. This one corresponds with Ubuntu

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:55.380
<v Speaker 1>20.

00:14:56.019 --> 00:14:57.860
<v Speaker 1>You can give tags.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.260
<v Speaker 1>You can give your machine a host name.

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:02.980
<v Speaker 1>When you hit the off you go button,

00:15:04.165 --> 00:15:06.485
<v Speaker 1>you know, get a two zero one response,

00:15:07.365 --> 00:15:08.485
<v Speaker 1>which means we've,

00:15:08.805 --> 00:15:11.285
<v Speaker 1>we've gone ahead and started, but we're, that

00:15:11.285 --> 00:15:13.125
<v Speaker 1>machine isn't up quite yet.

00:15:13.445 --> 00:15:16.085
<v Speaker 1>When we, when we run git devices again,

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:18.330
<v Speaker 1>there should be a

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:25.130
<v Speaker 1>not a four zero four, but a 200.

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:26.810
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're looking for.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.995
<v Speaker 1>And now there are two items in our

00:15:30.995 --> 00:15:34.035
<v Speaker 1>Git devices. We have metal Monday being the

00:15:34.035 --> 00:15:35.875
<v Speaker 1>first one, and then we have the API

00:15:35.875 --> 00:15:37.155
<v Speaker 1>test device one,

00:15:37.395 --> 00:15:39.555
<v Speaker 1>which I just made.

00:15:40.915 --> 00:15:41.875
<v Speaker 1>And then

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:44.570
<v Speaker 1>that'll have all the information about it. So

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:45.930
<v Speaker 1>provisioning percentage,

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:47.610
<v Speaker 1>that's the same sort of thing that you

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:49.690
<v Speaker 1>were looking at in the dashboard where we

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:52.410
<v Speaker 1>went from, I think, 27, 20 one percent

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.570
<v Speaker 1>up to 90. If you're looking for the

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:55.370
<v Speaker 1>exact

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:57.450
<v Speaker 1>if you're looking for the exact steps,

00:15:58.535 --> 00:16:00.295
<v Speaker 1>you can get that through

00:16:01.815 --> 00:16:02.935
<v Speaker 1>looking for

00:16:03.334 --> 00:16:07.095
<v Speaker 1>there'll be provisioning events inside that JSON, and

00:16:07.095 --> 00:16:09.495
<v Speaker 1>then the body of those is what so,

00:16:09.495 --> 00:16:11.575
<v Speaker 1>yeah, first step is provisioning started,

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:13.790
<v Speaker 1>network configured,

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:17.710
<v Speaker 1>connected to magic install system, OS system, server

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:20.270
<v Speaker 1>partitions created, then all the way through the

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:22.670
<v Speaker 1>eleventh step, which is device phone home and

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:23.710
<v Speaker 1>is ready to go.

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:25.310
<v Speaker 1>And if we

00:16:26.565 --> 00:16:28.085
<v Speaker 1>refresh this,

00:16:28.885 --> 00:16:30.245
<v Speaker 1>that probably means

00:16:30.565 --> 00:16:31.285
<v Speaker 1>that

00:16:32.885 --> 00:16:36.085
<v Speaker 1>it's now at, yeah, it's now at 90%.

00:16:36.245 --> 00:16:37.525
<v Speaker 1>The machine is

00:16:38.405 --> 00:16:39.765
<v Speaker 1>should be rebooting now.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:40.960
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.160
<v Speaker 1>And

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.960
<v Speaker 1>Tom can probably see that in his

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.880
<v Speaker 1>in his dashboard.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.200
<v Speaker 1>And

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.720
<v Speaker 1>I suppose the final final portion is to

00:16:55.195 --> 00:16:57.595
<v Speaker 1>is to then remove that is to then

00:16:57.595 --> 00:16:58.795
<v Speaker 1>remove that device

00:17:01.995 --> 00:17:04.075
<v Speaker 1>once it's up. Or

00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:06.315
<v Speaker 1>I could just take and remove Tom's

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.420
<v Speaker 1>after getting verbal confirmation from Tom, but that's

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:10.940
<v Speaker 1>okay, and he's not in the, in the

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:12.619
<v Speaker 1>midst of doing anything on it.

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.500
<v Speaker 2>As we've learned, that verbal confirmation is very

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.220
<v Speaker 2>important.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.300
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead and tear that one down.

00:17:21.665 --> 00:17:25.025
<v Speaker 1>Alright. That's the first device. There's its ID.

00:17:29.505 --> 00:17:32.545
<v Speaker 1>Take and copy that key over that

00:17:32.625 --> 00:17:36.419
<v Speaker 1>UUID for Tom's device that's in Dallas over

00:17:36.419 --> 00:17:36.979
<v Speaker 1>to

00:17:37.299 --> 00:17:38.019
<v Speaker 1>the,

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.739
<v Speaker 1>again, the device's endpoint, but in this case,

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:41.940
<v Speaker 1>going to

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.340
<v Speaker 1>send it a delete.

00:17:50.145 --> 00:17:52.225
<v Speaker 1>Two zero four, no content, which is exactly

00:17:52.225 --> 00:17:53.505
<v Speaker 1>what we were expecting.

00:17:54.465 --> 00:17:56.065
<v Speaker 1>And now when I go back to get

00:17:56.065 --> 00:17:56.865
<v Speaker 1>devices,

00:17:57.265 --> 00:17:59.345
<v Speaker 1>instead of two items, I have just the

00:17:59.345 --> 00:18:00.145
<v Speaker 1>one item,

00:18:00.945 --> 00:18:03.025
<v Speaker 1>API test device one

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:04.330
<v Speaker 1>and,

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:08.330
<v Speaker 1>Tom's, which I believe he called Metal Monday,

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:10.169
<v Speaker 1>is now gone,

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:12.090
<v Speaker 1>gone forever.

00:18:14.809 --> 00:18:17.610
<v Speaker 1>And if I look back at

00:18:20.615 --> 00:18:23.174
<v Speaker 1>the API test device one,

00:18:23.815 --> 00:18:26.375
<v Speaker 1>the state is now active instead of provisioning.

00:18:26.535 --> 00:18:27.335
<v Speaker 1>And so

00:18:27.655 --> 00:18:30.535
<v Speaker 1>that Ubuntu 20 machine is up and

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.240
<v Speaker 1>ready to go. And you can see the

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.080
<v Speaker 1>same sorts of things that you'd see in

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:35.320
<v Speaker 1>that

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.960
<v Speaker 1>that you'd be seeing in the in the

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.839
<v Speaker 1>dashboard. It's internal and external IPs,

00:18:40.919 --> 00:18:42.919
<v Speaker 1>the list of SSH keys that are able

00:18:42.919 --> 00:18:44.455
<v Speaker 1>to reach that

00:18:45.495 --> 00:18:47.174
<v Speaker 1>that are able to reach that machine.

00:18:48.135 --> 00:18:49.975
<v Speaker 1>Since I said any, and it was a

00:18:50.135 --> 00:18:51.975
<v Speaker 1>it was roulette as to where it ended

00:18:51.975 --> 00:18:54.534
<v Speaker 1>up, this one is in the the New

00:18:54.534 --> 00:18:56.135
<v Speaker 1>York 5

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:59.349
<v Speaker 1>data center that's in

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:02.229
<v Speaker 1>Secaucus, New Jersey.

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:05.429
<v Speaker 1>And

00:19:05.509 --> 00:19:07.110
<v Speaker 1>what else have we got in here? All

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:08.870
<v Speaker 1>kinds of good stuff. Anything else you want?

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:10.870
<v Speaker 1>That's a this machine happened to be a

00:19:10.985 --> 00:19:13.625
<v Speaker 1>happens to be a c three small, an

00:19:13.625 --> 00:19:14.745
<v Speaker 1>eight core Xeon.

00:19:14.905 --> 00:19:16.905
<v Speaker 1>But with that, I think we can

00:19:17.785 --> 00:19:18.664
<v Speaker 1>unless

00:19:19.865 --> 00:19:21.145
<v Speaker 1>I'm a guy who wouldn't

00:19:21.465 --> 00:19:22.664
<v Speaker 1>let's

00:19:23.465 --> 00:19:24.905
<v Speaker 1>let's not delete this one also.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:28.260
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I've already provisioned my production website on

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.460
<v Speaker 0>it, so let's not do that.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.580
<v Speaker 1>Alright. We'll leave that, we'll leave that up

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:33.860
<v Speaker 1>and available for now.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.020
<v Speaker 1>But that is both bringing up and bringing

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:36.580
<v Speaker 1>down

00:19:38.595 --> 00:19:39.315
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:19:39.555 --> 00:19:40.755
<v Speaker 0>You. The API.

00:19:41.875 --> 00:19:43.715
<v Speaker 0>So if you wanna learn more about using

00:19:43.715 --> 00:19:45.555
<v Speaker 0>our API and there are some use cases

00:19:45.555 --> 00:19:47.555
<v Speaker 0>for using the API over using UI or

00:19:47.555 --> 00:19:49.475
<v Speaker 0>CLI, we'll maybe talk about that just after

00:19:49.475 --> 00:19:52.920
<v Speaker 0>my quick demonstration. But we have really decent

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.720
<v Speaker 0>documentation, really good documentation, sell it better David.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.800
<v Speaker 0>Then you can go to metals.equinox.com/developers/API

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.800
<v Speaker 0>and all of the endpoints that Jeremy was

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.880
<v Speaker 0>using there are listed with the parameters that

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.160
<v Speaker 0>you need to have it in etcetera.

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:08.205
<v Speaker 0>Now what I wanna do is show you

00:20:08.205 --> 00:20:10.605
<v Speaker 0>how to use the CLI application. So

00:20:11.725 --> 00:20:12.605
<v Speaker 0>you can

00:20:13.165 --> 00:20:15.325
<v Speaker 0>download the packet CLI and run it as

00:20:15.325 --> 00:20:16.605
<v Speaker 0>packet CLI here.

00:20:17.085 --> 00:20:18.525
<v Speaker 0>And the first thing we're gonna try and

00:20:18.525 --> 00:20:20.360
<v Speaker 0>do then is see if we can list

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.639
<v Speaker 0>Jeremy's machine.

00:20:22.039 --> 00:20:23.960
<v Speaker 0>Now to do that, we're gonna use the

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:24.839
<v Speaker 0>device

00:20:25.399 --> 00:20:26.519
<v Speaker 0>sub command

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.000
<v Speaker 0>which has a few options here. So we

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.679
<v Speaker 0>also have the ability to create a device

00:20:30.679 --> 00:20:32.279
<v Speaker 0>like Jeremy did. We also have the ability

00:20:32.279 --> 00:20:34.120
<v Speaker 0>to delete Jeremy's device which I'll hopefully do

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.375
<v Speaker 0>in a moment. We can reboot, start, stop,

00:20:36.375 --> 00:20:37.975
<v Speaker 0>update, etcetera. You can see all the sub

00:20:37.975 --> 00:20:39.975
<v Speaker 0>commands there and for all the sub commands,

00:20:39.975 --> 00:20:41.735
<v Speaker 0>you have the option of passing dash dash

00:20:41.735 --> 00:20:44.055
<v Speaker 0>help and it'll just tell you which parameters

00:20:44.055 --> 00:20:46.135
<v Speaker 0>are available and what flags are available to

00:20:46.135 --> 00:20:47.015
<v Speaker 0>manipulate that data.

00:20:47.929 --> 00:20:50.570
<v Speaker 0>What I wanna do is try and list

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:52.090
<v Speaker 0>all of the devices

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:54.889
<v Speaker 0>and see if we can see Jeremy's.

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:58.249
<v Speaker 0>And

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:01.370
<v Speaker 0>I need a project ID. No. Did I

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:02.490
<v Speaker 0>copy that ahead of time?

00:21:03.425 --> 00:21:04.785
<v Speaker 0>Well, I probably did but now I've lost

00:21:04.785 --> 00:21:06.144
<v Speaker 0>it. So let's do

00:21:06.385 --> 00:21:08.544
<v Speaker 0>j q dot demo.

00:21:09.985 --> 00:21:12.145
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I planned ahead. I've got a project

00:21:12.145 --> 00:21:12.624
<v Speaker 0>scale and

00:21:14.385 --> 00:21:16.625
<v Speaker 0>if I ask for that without quotes

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:19.549
<v Speaker 0>PB copy, I should get that back into

00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:21.789
<v Speaker 0>my buffer. Now if I run devices get

00:21:21.789 --> 00:21:23.629
<v Speaker 0>project filter with that,

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:26.590
<v Speaker 0>you can actually see the API call is

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:28.830
<v Speaker 0>very similar to what Jeremy was using with

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.065
<v Speaker 0>Paul. Like There is. ID,

00:21:31.545 --> 00:21:33.145
<v Speaker 0>I see the host name, I can see

00:21:33.145 --> 00:21:34.665
<v Speaker 0>the operating system and the fact that it's

00:21:34.665 --> 00:21:37.385
<v Speaker 0>active and it was created only a few

00:21:37.385 --> 00:21:38.345
<v Speaker 0>minutes ago.

00:21:38.985 --> 00:21:41.304
<v Speaker 0>So I'm gonna copy this ID

00:21:41.465 --> 00:21:44.509
<v Speaker 0>and I'm gonna delete it. Which

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:47.710
<v Speaker 0>oh, I can't see. I I can't remember

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:51.950
<v Speaker 0>the ID. Is it dash d? It's

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:54.429
<v Speaker 0>dash I. Woah. What happened to my legs?

00:21:54.429 --> 00:21:57.150
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we're gonna pass and delete with

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:58.030
<v Speaker 0>the device ID.

00:21:58.665 --> 00:22:00.025
<v Speaker 0>And it's gonna ask me if I want

00:22:00.025 --> 00:22:01.705
<v Speaker 0>to confirm, yes or no.

00:22:02.825 --> 00:22:04.505
<v Speaker 0>And my daughter is banging on my door.

00:22:04.505 --> 00:22:05.945
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if you can hear that.

00:22:06.025 --> 00:22:06.745
<v Speaker 2>I'm

00:22:07.705 --> 00:22:10.825
<v Speaker 2>I'm having some flashbacks watching one of Jeremy's

00:22:10.825 --> 00:22:11.785
<v Speaker 2>servers getting deleted.

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:16.190
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure are you sure your daughter

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:17.710
<v Speaker 1>wasn't running something on that a bunch of

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:18.190
<v Speaker 1>bucks?

00:22:20.029 --> 00:22:22.510
<v Speaker 0>Very possibly. So what we see here is

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:24.509
<v Speaker 0>the device deletion was initiated.

00:22:25.149 --> 00:22:27.070
<v Speaker 0>And if we run get in fact, I

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:28.830
<v Speaker 0>wasn't even fast enough because we're too busy

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:30.485
<v Speaker 0>laughing at door being banged. But we can

00:22:30.485 --> 00:22:32.405
<v Speaker 0>see that device has already disappeared.

00:22:32.805 --> 00:22:34.805
<v Speaker 0>Other use cases in the CLI, we also

00:22:34.805 --> 00:22:36.725
<v Speaker 0>have the ability to view the plans. So

00:22:36.725 --> 00:22:38.085
<v Speaker 0>we can see all the same plans that

00:22:38.085 --> 00:22:40.085
<v Speaker 0>Jeremy was able to pull back. So everything

00:22:40.085 --> 00:22:41.525
<v Speaker 0>we could do for the API, we can

00:22:41.525 --> 00:22:42.965
<v Speaker 0>also do for the CLI. And there are

00:22:42.965 --> 00:22:44.805
<v Speaker 0>different use cases for when you want to

00:22:44.805 --> 00:22:46.860
<v Speaker 0>use one or the other. Like,

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:49.180
<v Speaker 0>maybe we could talk about that briefly before

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:51.020
<v Speaker 0>we finish up then. Yeah. So

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:55.100
<v Speaker 0>do you guys, CLI and API? What, when

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.700
<v Speaker 0>and where? And I won't get any opinions

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:57.100
<v Speaker 0>on that.

00:23:00.325 --> 00:23:01.365
<v Speaker 0>I'll go first.

00:23:01.685 --> 00:23:02.485
<v Speaker 0>So

00:23:03.285 --> 00:23:05.365
<v Speaker 0>for me, think the UI is good for

00:23:05.365 --> 00:23:07.845
<v Speaker 0>any new product. If you're new to Equinix

00:23:07.845 --> 00:23:09.205
<v Speaker 0>metal and you just wanna go to the

00:23:09.205 --> 00:23:11.365
<v Speaker 0>console, spin up something and really, know, just

00:23:11.365 --> 00:23:13.285
<v Speaker 0>wanna vanilla up into a machine and you

00:23:13.285 --> 00:23:15.480
<v Speaker 0>just wanna get on a SSHN and start

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.160
<v Speaker 0>kicking the tires a bit. The AI is

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.520
<v Speaker 0>probably the easiest way to do that and

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.600
<v Speaker 0>it requires no upfront knowledge. You don't need

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.360
<v Speaker 0>to know the API or the CLI.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:26.040
<v Speaker 0>For automation stuff, I'd probably jump straight to

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.640
<v Speaker 0>the API before the CLI.

00:23:27.865 --> 00:23:29.544
<v Speaker 0>You know, if I wanna be able to

00:23:29.544 --> 00:23:32.265
<v Speaker 0>like see for a continuous integration or test

00:23:32.265 --> 00:23:33.865
<v Speaker 0>room, I wanna spin up a device provision

00:23:33.865 --> 00:23:35.304
<v Speaker 0>of the stuff. Then API is probably the

00:23:35.304 --> 00:23:38.104
<v Speaker 0>way to go forward for that. The CLI,

00:23:38.505 --> 00:23:40.105
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure if there's a de facto

00:23:40.105 --> 00:23:41.385
<v Speaker 0>use case I would go for it. I

00:23:41.385 --> 00:23:43.465
<v Speaker 0>mean personally, I prefer the API, I'm comfortable

00:23:43.465 --> 00:23:45.440
<v Speaker 0>with that tooling, but the CLI is available

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.800
<v Speaker 0>for there if you know,

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.840
<v Speaker 0>it's probably good for debugging, I guess actually.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.640
<v Speaker 0>So if you wanna introspect what's already running

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.640
<v Speaker 0>as a device without going through the UI,

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.640
<v Speaker 0>it's a lot easier to type packet CLI

00:23:56.925 --> 00:23:58.205
<v Speaker 0>devices get

00:23:58.525 --> 00:23:59.965
<v Speaker 0>and take a look at what's going on

00:23:59.965 --> 00:24:01.965
<v Speaker 0>or if you just even want to query

00:24:02.045 --> 00:24:04.605
<v Speaker 0>the availability or capacity, which is another really

00:24:04.605 --> 00:24:06.445
<v Speaker 0>good API endpoint. In fact, I don't think

00:24:06.445 --> 00:24:07.005
<v Speaker 0>I showed that.

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:10.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. API is gonna be your go to

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.139
<v Speaker 1>for automation

00:24:12.139 --> 00:24:14.379
<v Speaker 1>and repeatability. We we showed,

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.019
<v Speaker 1>for example, bringing up one machine as opposed

00:24:17.019 --> 00:24:19.259
<v Speaker 1>to 10 or a hundred or a thousand.

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.580
<v Speaker 1>And while you're sitting in front of it

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:22.700
<v Speaker 1>and, you know, making

00:24:23.215 --> 00:24:24.095
<v Speaker 1>handcrafted

00:24:24.095 --> 00:24:26.014
<v Speaker 1>artisanal API requests

00:24:26.095 --> 00:24:28.734
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to baking those into your product.

00:24:28.735 --> 00:24:32.095
<v Speaker 1>The API is used by our our SDKs

00:24:32.095 --> 00:24:34.654
<v Speaker 1>if you have a Python program that you

00:24:35.054 --> 00:24:36.575
<v Speaker 1>that you want to write and run or

00:24:36.575 --> 00:24:37.375
<v Speaker 1>that's your

00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:40.070
<v Speaker 1>stack your application is written in.

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:43.429
<v Speaker 1>Also so, the API is used by, tools

00:24:43.429 --> 00:24:44.950
<v Speaker 1>like TerraForm

00:24:45.029 --> 00:24:45.510
<v Speaker 1>if,

00:24:46.309 --> 00:24:47.830
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to bring your,

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:50.390
<v Speaker 1>bring your machines up, using

00:24:51.355 --> 00:24:52.955
<v Speaker 1>using the HashiCorp tools.

00:24:53.275 --> 00:24:53.835
<v Speaker 1>So,

00:24:54.875 --> 00:24:58.154
<v Speaker 1>yeah, definite like, API is probably where most

00:24:58.154 --> 00:25:00.634
<v Speaker 1>of the where most of the usage happens,

00:25:00.715 --> 00:25:02.715
<v Speaker 1>but being able to try and inspect with

00:25:02.715 --> 00:25:03.515
<v Speaker 1>another

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.240
<v Speaker 1>with another mechanism you're comfortable and familiar with

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.239
<v Speaker 1>is is no trouble at all.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.520
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. And I think it's really pertinent. You

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:14.000
<v Speaker 0>mentioned tools like Terraform and then there's also

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.799
<v Speaker 0>Pulumi and Crossplane and all these other libraries

00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:18.755
<v Speaker 0>out there. And there are other ways to

00:25:18.755 --> 00:25:21.154
<v Speaker 0>spin up Equinix metal devices. Today, thought we

00:25:21.154 --> 00:25:23.395
<v Speaker 0>tackle the first three. I'm sure with future

00:25:23.395 --> 00:25:25.715
<v Speaker 0>metal Mondays, I'm hoping that name won't stick,

00:25:25.715 --> 00:25:27.875
<v Speaker 0>you never know. Then we

00:25:27.875 --> 00:25:29.315
<v Speaker 0>are gonna look at all these other tools

00:25:29.315 --> 00:25:30.995
<v Speaker 0>too. There's a lot of great ways to

00:25:30.995 --> 00:25:33.230
<v Speaker 0>interact with Equinix middle API. And this is

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:33.950
<v Speaker 0>just the

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:36.510
<v Speaker 0>easiest way to get started, I guess, without

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:38.109
<v Speaker 0>having to learn any other tools.

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:40.669
<v Speaker 2>It really is. But like you said, it's

00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:42.190
<v Speaker 2>just scratching the surface on what you can

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:42.909
<v Speaker 2>actually do.

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.950
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Definitely.

00:25:47.345 --> 00:25:49.665
<v Speaker 0>So we'll give it another one or two

00:25:49.665 --> 00:25:51.185
<v Speaker 0>minutes. If you have any questions that you

00:25:51.185 --> 00:25:52.465
<v Speaker 0>want us to cover, feel free to drop

00:25:52.465 --> 00:25:53.985
<v Speaker 0>that in the comment section and we will

00:25:53.985 --> 00:25:56.065
<v Speaker 0>tackle it. As far as other sessions that

00:25:56.065 --> 00:25:57.505
<v Speaker 0>we wanna do, like I said, we will

00:25:57.505 --> 00:25:59.425
<v Speaker 0>take a look at Terraforms and Pulumi's cross

00:25:59.425 --> 00:26:01.050
<v Speaker 0>planes. We will take a look at, you

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:02.650
<v Speaker 0>know, the next step of this. Right now,

00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:04.730
<v Speaker 0>we've done a good job of hopefully, hopefully

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:06.170
<v Speaker 0>a good job. I've shown you how to

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:08.010
<v Speaker 0>get a new bare metal device.

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:09.370
<v Speaker 0>But we haven't shown you how to put

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:11.450
<v Speaker 0>it in phononic yet. So, you know, whether

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:12.570
<v Speaker 0>it'd be next week or the week after,

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:13.850
<v Speaker 0>we're gonna show you, okay, how do I

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:15.554
<v Speaker 0>get NGINX running? How do I get Kubernetes

00:26:15.554 --> 00:26:18.034
<v Speaker 0>running? How do I get whatever software I

00:26:18.034 --> 00:26:19.875
<v Speaker 0>wanna run, running on this device? And there's

00:26:19.875 --> 00:26:21.715
<v Speaker 0>a whole bunch of tooling there that we

00:26:21.715 --> 00:26:23.154
<v Speaker 0>could show you how to do that too.

00:26:25.235 --> 00:26:27.234
<v Speaker 2>And you're actually planning on

00:26:27.635 --> 00:26:29.715
<v Speaker 2>playing with a new provider. Right? Live?

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:32.190
<v Speaker 2>Does that happen next month?

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:35.070
<v Speaker 0>So we will be

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:38.350
<v Speaker 0>doing a livestream with the Pulumi team on

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:39.630
<v Speaker 0>November 16.

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:42.270
<v Speaker 0>I don't think we'll be working with a

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:44.110
<v Speaker 0>new provider, but we will be showing you

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:45.835
<v Speaker 0>to do some really cool stuff with Equinix

00:26:45.835 --> 00:26:48.554
<v Speaker 0>metal and the Pulumi stack. So more details

00:26:48.554 --> 00:26:50.315
<v Speaker 0>on that will be available soon,

00:26:50.634 --> 00:26:51.594
<v Speaker 0>but not today. Alright,

00:26:55.034 --> 00:26:56.634
<v Speaker 0>I don't think we're gonna get any more

00:26:56.634 --> 00:26:57.354
<v Speaker 0>questions.

00:26:57.755 --> 00:26:57.914
<v Speaker 0>Nope.

00:26:58.919 --> 00:27:00.440
<v Speaker 0>I'm happy to leave it there. So thank

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:02.039
<v Speaker 0>you very much for joining us today. We

00:27:02.039 --> 00:27:03.639
<v Speaker 0>will be back. There will be plenty more

00:27:03.639 --> 00:27:05.320
<v Speaker 0>information coming your way and we hope to

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:06.760
<v Speaker 0>speak to you all soon. Thank you very

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:07.559
<v Speaker 0>much for joining.

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.239
