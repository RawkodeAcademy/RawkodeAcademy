<v Speaker 0>Everyone. My name is Kunal. I work as

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.000
<v Speaker 0>a manager here at. We are here at

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.720
<v Speaker 0>navigate, and, you know, in sunny Florida here

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.120
<v Speaker 0>with Rawkode. I think it's, great. I've been

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.200
<v Speaker 0>watching your channel for a while now since

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.200
<v Speaker 0>I was a student. It helped me quite

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.405
<v Speaker 0>a lot. I like the cluster series. It's

00:00:15.405 --> 00:00:17.725
<v Speaker 0>pretty cool how you, you know, fix broken

00:00:17.725 --> 00:00:20.205
<v Speaker 0>clusters, more hands on. Most folks, they just

00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:22.045
<v Speaker 0>write, like, read the blog post and make

00:00:22.045 --> 00:00:23.485
<v Speaker 0>a video out of it. It's not that

00:00:23.485 --> 00:00:24.365
<v Speaker 0>original.

00:00:24.365 --> 00:00:26.205
<v Speaker 0>It does help a few people because some

00:00:26.205 --> 00:00:28.445
<v Speaker 0>people like learning from videos. Some people like

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:30.285
<v Speaker 0>learning from blogs. Some people like learning from

00:00:30.285 --> 00:00:30.765
<v Speaker 0>documentation.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.820
<v Speaker 0>I like to learn by doing, and I

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.860
<v Speaker 0>think clusters

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.020
<v Speaker 0>is like spot on for that. And I

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.460
<v Speaker 0>really like how you utilize some of the

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.820
<v Speaker 0>tools in your

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.380
<v Speaker 0>livestreams as well. Like, I see you do

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.580
<v Speaker 0>a lot of stuff with, like, the use

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.340
<v Speaker 0>cases of Teleport, for example. I saw some

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.940
<v Speaker 0>of the streams on that. They say I've

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.220
<v Speaker 0>learned quite a lot, and I'm very grateful

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.900
<v Speaker 0>to find the YouTube channel. Yeah.
