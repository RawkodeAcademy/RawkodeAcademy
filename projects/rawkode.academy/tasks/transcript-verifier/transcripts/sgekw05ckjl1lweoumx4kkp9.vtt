00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.410
<v Speaker 0>Hello, and welcome to today's episode.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:07.005
<v Speaker 0>Today we are gonna take a look at

00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:07.965
<v Speaker 0>MeiliSearch,

00:01:07.965 --> 00:01:11.325
<v Speaker 0>a search engine database written in Rust.

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:13.005
<v Speaker 0>So far it has taken all the right

00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:14.765
<v Speaker 0>boxes for me and I'm really happy and

00:01:14.765 --> 00:01:16.525
<v Speaker 0>excited to be exploring it today.

00:01:17.405 --> 00:01:19.920
<v Speaker 0>To guide me through our MeiliSearch journey today,

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.360
<v Speaker 0>I am joined by two members of the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.200
<v Speaker 0>Meilisearch team, Fred and Carolina. Hello and welcome.

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.880
<v Speaker 1>You so Thank

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.240
<v Speaker 0>you both very much for joining me today.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.119
<v Speaker 0>I'm very excited.

00:01:31.705 --> 00:01:33.784
<v Speaker 0>I think we should start with some a

00:01:33.784 --> 00:01:35.465
<v Speaker 0>quick round of introductions and then we'll talk

00:01:35.465 --> 00:01:37.145
<v Speaker 0>about Meilisearch and what it is.

00:01:38.104 --> 00:01:40.905
<v Speaker 2>Okay. So hello everybody. I'm Carolina.

00:01:40.905 --> 00:01:44.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm junior developer advocate at Meilisearch and I'm

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.549
<v Speaker 2>here with, my mentor, Fred.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.270
<v Speaker 1>Wow.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.189
<v Speaker 1>That that is a good intro.

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.549
<v Speaker 1>So my name is Fred. I'm a director

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.549
<v Speaker 1>of developer relation at Meilisearch,

00:01:56.965 --> 00:02:00.485
<v Speaker 1>which mean that, you know, I mentor Carolina.

00:02:00.485 --> 00:02:03.284
<v Speaker 1>It's one of it's one of my job.

00:02:05.045 --> 00:02:08.005
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. But yeah. No. Yep. Yep. That's it.

00:02:09.044 --> 00:02:11.525
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Awesome. Well, why do

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.650
<v Speaker 0>alright. I've got I've got it. I've I've

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.650
<v Speaker 0>got this under control. Okay. So why don't

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.770
<v Speaker 0>we start off then with what is Meilisearch?

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.050
<v Speaker 0>Who wants to tackle that?

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.290
<v Speaker 2>K.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.570
<v Speaker 2>Maybe search is an ultra fast and ultra

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.345
<v Speaker 2>relevant search engine built in Rust,

00:02:29.425 --> 00:02:29.985
<v Speaker 2>and

00:02:30.625 --> 00:02:32.144
<v Speaker 2>you can communicate

00:02:32.144 --> 00:02:34.945
<v Speaker 2>to the server with through a RESTful API.

00:02:36.065 --> 00:02:37.265
<v Speaker 2>It's very simple.

00:02:37.504 --> 00:02:37.665
<v Speaker 1>Yeah?

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I know. I was I was going

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.040
<v Speaker 1>to say, you know, it's it's simple. When

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.000
<v Speaker 1>we say search engine, it's not like it's

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.480
<v Speaker 1>not a replacement for Google or or I

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.240
<v Speaker 1>was going to say AltaVista.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.960
<v Speaker 1>Like, yeah, that that that is that is

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.000
<v Speaker 1>saying my name,

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.405
<v Speaker 1>my age. But,

00:02:56.645 --> 00:02:58.405
<v Speaker 0>you know, it's not a replacement for those

00:02:58.405 --> 00:03:00.645
<v Speaker 1>type of search engines. It's really, like, search

00:03:00.645 --> 00:03:02.965
<v Speaker 1>engine you're gonna use in your web application

00:03:02.965 --> 00:03:03.925
<v Speaker 1>or website.

00:03:04.325 --> 00:03:04.805
<v Speaker 1>And

00:03:05.605 --> 00:03:07.445
<v Speaker 1>the best part of it is that it's

00:03:07.445 --> 00:03:09.940
<v Speaker 1>open source. But, you know, like like, we

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.940
<v Speaker 1>like to think that, like, it's really open

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.780
<v Speaker 1>source because their way of doing thing is

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.260
<v Speaker 1>not just to put the source code and

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.620
<v Speaker 1>decide everything.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.860
<v Speaker 1>We include the community. We try to be

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.815
<v Speaker 1>transparent as much as possible for decision

00:03:22.815 --> 00:03:25.615
<v Speaker 1>or having discussion with the community. So, yeah,

00:03:26.334 --> 00:03:28.735
<v Speaker 1>it's it's I would say it's the next

00:03:28.735 --> 00:03:30.495
<v Speaker 1>generation search API.

00:03:31.295 --> 00:03:32.095
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:03:33.455 --> 00:03:35.300
<v Speaker 0>I mean, it's open source. If I remember

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.940
<v Speaker 0>correctly it's MIT license, so it's pretty a

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.300
<v Speaker 0>very permissive open source project which is fantastic.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.780
<v Speaker 0>I love that it's written in Rust and

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.700
<v Speaker 0>you said ultra fast as well. I think

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.220
<v Speaker 0>you know all of these things are just

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.140
<v Speaker 0>what we want and I'm hoping when we

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.315
<v Speaker 0>explore it today we're gonna see this ultra

00:03:51.315 --> 00:03:53.395
<v Speaker 0>simple to set up as well. I mean,

00:03:54.835 --> 00:03:56.995
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming with it being written in Rust

00:03:56.995 --> 00:03:58.835
<v Speaker 0>we're just compelling a binary and throwing it

00:03:58.835 --> 00:04:00.195
<v Speaker 0>around right, it's probably

00:04:00.435 --> 00:04:02.995
<v Speaker 0>there's no runtime needed, there's nothing to set

00:04:02.995 --> 00:04:04.435
<v Speaker 0>up but is it really going to be

00:04:04.435 --> 00:04:05.220
<v Speaker 0>that easy?

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.980
<v Speaker 2>Yes. It should. It it should be. It

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.780
<v Speaker 1>should be. Like, you can make it complicated

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.940
<v Speaker 1>if you want. Like, you know, you can

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.020
<v Speaker 1>use it with Docker. You can compile a

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.454
<v Speaker 1>search for yourself if you want to. But,

00:04:18.454 --> 00:04:20.135
<v Speaker 1>like, if you want to try it quickly,

00:04:20.375 --> 00:04:23.175
<v Speaker 1>yeah, it's just the binary, and you're gonna

00:04:23.175 --> 00:04:23.975
<v Speaker 1>make it happen.

00:04:24.535 --> 00:04:27.175
<v Speaker 1>Unless unless you're not following the instruction, you're

00:04:27.175 --> 00:04:29.495
<v Speaker 1>really not good, David. So that but that's

00:04:29.495 --> 00:04:31.574
<v Speaker 1>a different story. Yeah. I have been known

00:04:31.574 --> 00:04:33.580
<v Speaker 0>to skip a few instructions from time to

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.300
<v Speaker 0>time. And I I'm new to development because

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.700
<v Speaker 2>I come from another background. I was a

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:39.820
<v Speaker 2>teacher, so

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.020
<v Speaker 2>I have

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.740
<v Speaker 2>I didn't code for the past years. I

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.740
<v Speaker 2>I it's very recent for me.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.020
<v Speaker 2>And

00:04:48.025 --> 00:04:50.185
<v Speaker 2>I was quite new to code. I was

00:04:50.185 --> 00:04:52.105
<v Speaker 2>coding for a year or two, and I

00:04:52.105 --> 00:04:52.745
<v Speaker 2>could

00:04:54.345 --> 00:04:57.065
<v Speaker 2>install Meilisearch and get get it to work

00:04:57.065 --> 00:04:59.625
<v Speaker 2>very, very easily. So if I can, everybody

00:04:59.625 --> 00:05:00.585
<v Speaker 2>can. I swear.

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.259
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. I think what we'll do then is

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:07.100
<v Speaker 0>we're just gonna get started. I think we'll

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.780
<v Speaker 0>pull up the docs, we'll start working through

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.380
<v Speaker 0>it. We'll see what we can start doing

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.900
<v Speaker 0>with Meilisearch as we go.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.035
<v Speaker 0>Before we do that, do have question and

00:05:15.035 --> 00:05:17.915
<v Speaker 0>one hello. So Peter says, good afternoon. Hey

00:05:17.915 --> 00:05:20.235
<v Speaker 0>Peter. Thanks for joining us. Hello Peter. Hi.

00:05:20.635 --> 00:05:22.875
<v Speaker 0>And we have a question from Jared.

00:05:23.355 --> 00:05:25.835
<v Speaker 0>Is it comparable to Elasticsearch?

00:05:25.835 --> 00:05:27.195
<v Speaker 0>Is this a question you get a lot?

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.330
<v Speaker 2>Yes. Yeah. In our documentation, there is a

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.770
<v Speaker 2>section where we Yes.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.650
<v Speaker 0>So what's it? I mean, we can build

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.770
<v Speaker 0>up the docs and take a look at

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.450
<v Speaker 0>the answer as well. But is there a

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.210
<v Speaker 0>one word answer? Yes or no here? Is

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.845
<v Speaker 0>it do people use this to replace Elasticsearch?

00:05:44.445 --> 00:05:46.365
<v Speaker 1>Yes and no. In the sense it's like

00:05:46.365 --> 00:05:48.045
<v Speaker 1>we we yeah. Yeah. It's it's a little

00:05:48.045 --> 00:05:49.645
<v Speaker 1>more complicated than just yes and no in

00:05:49.645 --> 00:05:51.325
<v Speaker 1>the sense like we are not a complete

00:05:51.325 --> 00:05:53.805
<v Speaker 1>replacement for Elasticsearch,

00:05:53.805 --> 00:05:56.525
<v Speaker 1>but for people using Elasticsearch

00:05:56.525 --> 00:05:58.570
<v Speaker 1>for the search function

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.610
<v Speaker 1>of elastic search, like like strictly what we're

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.250
<v Speaker 1>it's the part we're quote unquote replacing.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.170
<v Speaker 1>So I would say we're closer to a

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.010
<v Speaker 1>replacement to Algolia

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.730
<v Speaker 1>than

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.450
<v Speaker 1>a complete replacement to elastic search.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.065
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, let's just get started then. Hopefully

00:06:15.065 --> 00:06:16.664
<v Speaker 0>we can answer this question as we go

00:06:16.664 --> 00:06:18.025
<v Speaker 0>Jared and you can

00:06:19.065 --> 00:06:20.985
<v Speaker 0>can make your own decision. It depends like

00:06:20.985 --> 00:06:22.665
<v Speaker 0>classic answer and technology.

00:06:23.145 --> 00:06:23.465
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.030
<v Speaker 0>Okay, let's see. Let's push the magic button.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.550
<v Speaker 0>Three floating heads, one Meilisearch web page. So

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.510
<v Speaker 0>the next generation search API open source blazing

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.830
<v Speaker 0>fast hyper relevant search engine.

00:06:38.145 --> 00:06:39.425
<v Speaker 0>Sounds great to me.

00:06:40.545 --> 00:06:43.505
<v Speaker 0>Are people using this and production already?

00:06:44.465 --> 00:06:45.105
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

00:06:45.265 --> 00:06:47.585
<v Speaker 1>Yes. Yes. So we have a we have

00:06:47.585 --> 00:06:49.025
<v Speaker 1>a couple of great users.

00:06:49.345 --> 00:06:51.985
<v Speaker 1>Right now the thing is that

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:54.000
<v Speaker 1>we don't have, like, a v one, so

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.479
<v Speaker 1>we're still really cautious about the version we're

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:59.680
<v Speaker 1>putting out there. It's still in development.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.680
<v Speaker 1>So people still use this in production,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.719
<v Speaker 1>but, this year, and I don't have the

00:07:04.719 --> 00:07:07.215
<v Speaker 1>ATA yet, but we will launch the

00:07:07.615 --> 00:07:09.215
<v Speaker 1>quote, unquote official

00:07:09.215 --> 00:07:10.655
<v Speaker 1>v one version,

00:07:11.055 --> 00:07:12.815
<v Speaker 1>which gonna be, like, even better than what

00:07:12.815 --> 00:07:14.815
<v Speaker 1>we have right now, even faster,

00:07:15.134 --> 00:07:15.695
<v Speaker 1>and,

00:07:16.014 --> 00:07:17.535
<v Speaker 1>you know, taking less resources.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.000
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Thanks. Alright. Let's get the docs up

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.880
<v Speaker 0>then. So

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.240
<v Speaker 0>this is the getting started guides.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.640
<v Speaker 0>Is the Elasticsearch question here, should we pull

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.600
<v Speaker 0>that up quickly before we

00:07:30.795 --> 00:07:32.235
<v Speaker 0>start kicking the tires?

00:07:34.075 --> 00:07:36.155
<v Speaker 2>There's comparison to alternatives.

00:07:37.195 --> 00:07:39.595
<v Speaker 0>Thank you. Let me zoom in on that

00:07:39.595 --> 00:07:40.475
<v Speaker 0>a bit as well.

00:07:40.955 --> 00:07:41.995
<v Speaker 0>A little bit more real.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.360
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.800
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. There's a whole section there in the

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.720
<v Speaker 0>documentation. So hopefully that helps the people that

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.080
<v Speaker 0>are having the same question.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.640
<v Speaker 0>I think what you said is spot

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.960
<v Speaker 0>on from what I've read as well. Know,

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.365
<v Speaker 0>Elasticsearch does so much beyond just full text

00:08:01.365 --> 00:08:03.445
<v Speaker 0>search or text search and most

00:08:04.165 --> 00:08:05.365
<v Speaker 0>of the time people are using it for

00:08:05.365 --> 00:08:07.525
<v Speaker 0>that really small use case but you're bringing

00:08:07.525 --> 00:08:09.764
<v Speaker 0>in all this other stuff with it and

00:08:09.764 --> 00:08:11.925
<v Speaker 0>like having something that's just purpose built to

00:08:11.925 --> 00:08:14.190
<v Speaker 0>do this kind thing, I think is really

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.830
<v Speaker 0>interesting. So that's everything. I I see some

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.710
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people are using Elasticsearch like you're using

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:20.910
<v Speaker 1>a shotgun to

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.710
<v Speaker 1>cut your picture tables and I'm like, yeah.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.885
<v Speaker 1>So it it's good for use cases, but,

00:08:25.885 --> 00:08:27.645
<v Speaker 1>like, more simple use cases, maybe you probably

00:08:27.645 --> 00:08:29.405
<v Speaker 1>want something that is more adapted to your

00:08:29.405 --> 00:08:31.165
<v Speaker 1>need and that, like, do one thing but

00:08:31.165 --> 00:08:34.045
<v Speaker 1>do it well, and probably doesn't cost the

00:08:34.045 --> 00:08:35.485
<v Speaker 1>same amount of money too.

00:08:36.445 --> 00:08:37.485
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Definitely.

00:08:38.684 --> 00:08:39.085
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.210
<v Speaker 0>Oh, that's the wrong page. There we go.

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:42.010
<v Speaker 0>Getting started.

00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:44.410
<v Speaker 0>So in order to get this started, I

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.410
<v Speaker 0>mean you did mention there's containers and stuff,

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:48.170
<v Speaker 0>but I think I'm more than happy just

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.650
<v Speaker 0>to curl and shell this right into my

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:51.290
<v Speaker 0>system.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:58.535
<v Speaker 0>So I'm assuming this is just gonna pull

00:08:58.535 --> 00:09:00.775
<v Speaker 0>down a binary, stick it in my

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:03.415
<v Speaker 0>directory.

00:09:04.214 --> 00:09:05.735
<v Speaker 0>See, I'm not even gonna read the docs,

00:09:05.735 --> 00:09:06.455
<v Speaker 0>I'm just gonna run it.

00:09:07.709 --> 00:09:08.589
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:12.829
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So a couple of things strike me

00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:15.790
<v Speaker 0>here. No master key found. What's a what's

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.390
<v Speaker 0>a master key in this context?

00:09:19.949 --> 00:09:21.149
<v Speaker 1>You can go and care. Master

00:09:21.709 --> 00:09:22.110
<v Speaker 2>okay.

00:09:23.015 --> 00:09:26.295
<v Speaker 2>The master keys to protect the the roots.

00:09:26.935 --> 00:09:28.855
<v Speaker 2>If you want to to set it to

00:09:28.855 --> 00:09:31.095
<v Speaker 2>production, you can set the master key.

00:09:31.655 --> 00:09:35.095
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So this provides some sort of authentication,

00:09:35.095 --> 00:09:37.735
<v Speaker 0>protections from admin endpoints or or search in

00:09:37.735 --> 00:09:40.480
<v Speaker 0>general. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Which which you don't

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.800
<v Speaker 1>need if you just want to test it.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.920
<v Speaker 0>Yes. Makes sense to me. I also see

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.280
<v Speaker 0>Actics server here.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.560
<v Speaker 0>I am a

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.360
<v Speaker 0>trying to be Rust developer these days and

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.834
<v Speaker 0>I have banged my head against Actics many

00:09:53.834 --> 00:09:54.395
<v Speaker 0>times.

00:09:54.635 --> 00:09:56.075
<v Speaker 0>So one of the things I'm now excited

00:09:56.075 --> 00:09:57.595
<v Speaker 0>for is that whenever I get stuck and

00:09:57.595 --> 00:09:58.714
<v Speaker 0>I need to go see an example of

00:09:58.714 --> 00:10:00.154
<v Speaker 0>how to work with Actics, gonna go to

00:10:00.154 --> 00:10:02.154
<v Speaker 0>the Meilisearch code base, so that's awesome.

00:10:03.435 --> 00:10:04.154
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. And

00:10:05.435 --> 00:10:07.355
<v Speaker 0>then this is I think my DNS is

00:10:07.355 --> 00:10:10.230
<v Speaker 0>just blocking a call to some analytics. We'll

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:13.029
<v Speaker 0>ignore that. So Actually, you make me think,

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:16.230
<v Speaker 1>like, that that should be something you

00:10:17.589 --> 00:10:19.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking for a word, but, you accept

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:22.310
<v Speaker 1>to, like, send some stats

00:10:22.445 --> 00:10:24.925
<v Speaker 1>to be more respectful about people data.

00:10:25.245 --> 00:10:26.765
<v Speaker 1>It just gave me an idea to create

00:10:26.765 --> 00:10:28.125
<v Speaker 1>an issue for our team.

00:10:29.245 --> 00:10:31.245
<v Speaker 0>Oh, that's awesome. Yeah. It's always nice to

00:10:31.245 --> 00:10:33.645
<v Speaker 0>give that as a block telemetry or something

00:10:33.645 --> 00:10:35.165
<v Speaker 0>like that. And I see we've actually got

00:10:35.165 --> 00:10:36.640
<v Speaker 0>quite a lot of flags here. That I

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.240
<v Speaker 0>didn't even look at either. So lots of

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.120
<v Speaker 0>stuff. Okay.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.520
<v Speaker 0>Let's get it running again and pop back

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.480
<v Speaker 0>over to this.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.440
<v Speaker 0>Now that this is running, I'm assuming there's

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.520
<v Speaker 0>is there a web interface to Meilisearch?

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.920
<v Speaker 2>Yes. In development mode.

00:10:51.075 --> 00:10:54.275
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Port seven seven zero zero.

00:10:55.475 --> 00:10:56.835
<v Speaker 0>Let's see if it's running.

00:10:59.715 --> 00:11:00.515
<v Speaker 0>Tada.

00:11:02.835 --> 00:11:04.515
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So I haven't done anything with it

00:11:04.515 --> 00:11:06.279
<v Speaker 0>yet. So I'm I'm gonna assume right now

00:11:06.279 --> 00:11:08.760
<v Speaker 0>that the the UI really isn't gonna provide

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.760
<v Speaker 0>me much value. Is that a fair assumption?

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.720
<v Speaker 1>It is. It is. And and you know

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.800
<v Speaker 1>what? Let's be honest. Even even when you're

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.400
<v Speaker 1>gonna have data data,

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.880
<v Speaker 1>out of the box right now, this is

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.440
<v Speaker 1>not the most sexy dev

00:11:21.834 --> 00:11:22.795
<v Speaker 1>portal.

00:11:23.755 --> 00:11:26.235
<v Speaker 1>The good news is that we just hired

00:11:26.235 --> 00:11:29.915
<v Speaker 1>a designer. She started actually last week, and

00:11:29.915 --> 00:11:32.635
<v Speaker 1>she is amazing. So she will give some

00:11:32.635 --> 00:11:36.154
<v Speaker 1>love to those interfaces that are obviously made

00:11:36.154 --> 00:11:36.955
<v Speaker 1>by developers.

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.850
<v Speaker 0>How big is the Meilisearch team at the

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:41.330
<v Speaker 0>moment?

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:44.050
<v Speaker 2>We are 13. 13.

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:45.330
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:46.850
<v Speaker 2>And

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:48.450
<v Speaker 2>soon, 14.

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:53.075
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So Yeah. The team the team's gonna

00:11:53.075 --> 00:11:56.195
<v Speaker 1>grow pretty fast in the next year. The

00:11:56.195 --> 00:11:58.435
<v Speaker 1>company is is, like, it's working well. We're

00:11:58.435 --> 00:12:01.714
<v Speaker 1>still a small startup beginning, but the product

00:12:01.714 --> 00:12:03.555
<v Speaker 1>got a lot of traction, so it's it's

00:12:03.555 --> 00:12:04.835
<v Speaker 1>going in the right direction.

00:12:05.395 --> 00:12:06.595
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Definitely.

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:09.250
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I think it's just one of

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.090
<v Speaker 0>these technologies. I think people have been looking

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:14.610
<v Speaker 0>for alternatives to search engine and databases for

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:15.970
<v Speaker 0>a long time and I think this fits

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.570
<v Speaker 0>in and just fills the right gap. So

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.250
<v Speaker 0>I'm really excited to see what happens.

00:12:20.324 --> 00:12:21.925
<v Speaker 0>But right now I'm gonna try and play

00:12:21.925 --> 00:12:22.885
<v Speaker 0>with it. So

00:12:23.845 --> 00:12:25.524
<v Speaker 0>it's kind of just jump straight into this

00:12:25.524 --> 00:12:26.964
<v Speaker 0>add document space.

00:12:27.445 --> 00:12:29.445
<v Speaker 0>So that raises a few questions from my

00:12:29.445 --> 00:12:30.245
<v Speaker 0>head now,

00:12:30.805 --> 00:12:32.644
<v Speaker 0>does Meilisearch have any sort of

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.470
<v Speaker 0>schema or is the schema inferred from the

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:39.110
<v Speaker 0>data I put into it? Do define tables?

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.910
<v Speaker 0>What is what

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.510
<v Speaker 0>is the structure of the back end? Like

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.350
<v Speaker 0>how do I just interact with documents and

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:46.790
<v Speaker 0>nothing else? Do I need to prepare tables

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.630
<v Speaker 0>and if not, maybe you can help me

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:48.710
<v Speaker 0>out.

00:12:50.505 --> 00:12:53.145
<v Speaker 2>No. No. So You don't have to to

00:12:53.145 --> 00:12:55.705
<v Speaker 2>create any tables. You just have indexes with

00:12:55.705 --> 00:12:56.505
<v Speaker 2>documents,

00:12:56.905 --> 00:12:57.865
<v Speaker 2>and that's it.

00:12:58.665 --> 00:13:00.985
<v Speaker 1>So actually, when when when you create document,

00:13:00.985 --> 00:13:02.700
<v Speaker 1>like, the structure of the document you're gonna

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.260
<v Speaker 1>create or if you import data from

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:06.780
<v Speaker 1>a JSON file,

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:10.220
<v Speaker 1>your, structure of the document will be,

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.500
<v Speaker 1>taken from the JSON file or,

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:14.940
<v Speaker 1>the document

00:13:15.165 --> 00:13:17.084
<v Speaker 1>on the using JSON format that it will

00:13:17.084 --> 00:13:17.644
<v Speaker 1>create.

00:13:18.045 --> 00:13:20.204
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at the small code

00:13:20.204 --> 00:13:22.285
<v Speaker 1>box right there with ID title,

00:13:22.524 --> 00:13:24.524
<v Speaker 1>so you're gonna create document that have those

00:13:24.524 --> 00:13:25.084
<v Speaker 1>two

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:27.805
<v Speaker 1>those two values, ID title.

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:30.730
<v Speaker 0>Ah, okay. So I'm gonna assume that the

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.410
<v Speaker 0>index that I write to is just part

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:34.410
<v Speaker 0>of the URL that I post this data

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:36.330
<v Speaker 0>to, and that's probably gonna connect the dots

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.050
<v Speaker 0>there. So Yeah. Let's see index. You can

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:41.705
<v Speaker 1>see index as, like, separate

00:13:41.705 --> 00:13:42.665
<v Speaker 1>database

00:13:42.985 --> 00:13:44.345
<v Speaker 1>or separate

00:13:45.065 --> 00:13:45.945
<v Speaker 1>separate

00:13:46.105 --> 00:13:47.625
<v Speaker 1>silo of documents.

00:13:48.345 --> 00:13:49.065
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:13:49.465 --> 00:13:50.745
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, let's just

00:13:51.545 --> 00:13:53.145
<v Speaker 0>well, I guess I should save the first

00:13:53.145 --> 00:13:55.380
<v Speaker 0>thing first rather than skipping ahead. So let's

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.020
<v Speaker 0>do that.

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.420
<v Speaker 0>So create a new file

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:03.860
<v Speaker 0>superman.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.605
<v Speaker 1>So what what what you can do also

00:14:06.605 --> 00:14:07.165
<v Speaker 1>is that,

00:14:07.645 --> 00:14:09.965
<v Speaker 1>right right before the code you copy,

00:14:10.205 --> 00:14:11.885
<v Speaker 1>there is a JSON file that you can

00:14:11.885 --> 00:14:14.525
<v Speaker 1>download already populated for you.

00:14:16.524 --> 00:14:19.085
<v Speaker 1>If you Oh, yeah. Yeah. Just move it

00:14:19.085 --> 00:14:20.960
<v Speaker 1>to JSON so you don't have to unless

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.880
<v Speaker 1>you really want to write some JSON, feel

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.000
<v Speaker 1>free. But JSON JSON post product, it's probably

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.520
<v Speaker 1>gonna be a little bit sexier if you

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.720
<v Speaker 1>download that JSON file. Yeah.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.640
<v Speaker 0>I think that's a good idea.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.360
<v Speaker 0>I said, I I usually just skip all

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.765
<v Speaker 0>this stuff, so you'll need to keep me

00:14:34.765 --> 00:14:37.165
<v Speaker 0>right. So movies.JSON.

00:14:38.605 --> 00:14:39.725
<v Speaker 1>Oh, actually,

00:14:41.885 --> 00:14:43.645
<v Speaker 1>I think it's pointing on

00:14:45.725 --> 00:14:48.285
<v Speaker 1>the getup page, so Oh, it's not really

00:14:48.045 --> 00:14:49.805
<v Speaker 1>if you're gonna have access. Yeah. We should

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.680
<v Speaker 1>put a rolling.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:54.760
<v Speaker 0>Raw.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.120
<v Speaker 1>I like that. I'm just taking notes and

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.120
<v Speaker 1>being like, we should we should do better.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.000
<v Speaker 1>It's it's perfect.

00:15:03.185 --> 00:15:04.385
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's

00:15:04.785 --> 00:15:06.305
<v Speaker 0>try that again then.

00:15:08.065 --> 00:15:10.225
<v Speaker 0>-0movies.JSON

00:15:10.225 --> 00:15:11.904
<v Speaker 0>dropping the raw link.

00:15:12.305 --> 00:15:13.505
<v Speaker 0>Yep. There we go.

00:15:15.584 --> 00:15:17.920
<v Speaker 0>And now we just wanna issue this curl

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.240
<v Speaker 0>command, which is gonna populate our database with

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.200
<v Speaker 0>this. So

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And and what you can see with

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.320
<v Speaker 1>that comment is that if if you read

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.125
<v Speaker 1>the documentation, you're gonna see that by importing

00:15:31.125 --> 00:15:32.325
<v Speaker 1>those documents,

00:15:32.644 --> 00:15:33.605
<v Speaker 1>using that,

00:15:34.084 --> 00:15:35.845
<v Speaker 1>REST API endpoint,

00:15:36.084 --> 00:15:40.165
<v Speaker 1>you are, automatically creating a Mendix called movies.

00:15:40.324 --> 00:15:42.880
<v Speaker 1>But if you want, you can, If you

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.040
<v Speaker 1>check the documentation, you can create an index

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.000
<v Speaker 1>by yourself,

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.720
<v Speaker 1>and after that, have documents. So in the

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.040
<v Speaker 1>case that that index does not exist, Meilisearch

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.480
<v Speaker 1>will create it by default.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:54.800
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well,

00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:57.305
<v Speaker 0>I'll keep it as movies for now because

00:15:57.305 --> 00:15:58.745
<v Speaker 0>I'm sure I'll copy and paste Yeah. More

00:15:58.745 --> 00:16:00.665
<v Speaker 0>example code and I'll forget to change it.

00:16:00.665 --> 00:16:02.025
<v Speaker 0>So I'll just leave it as is for

00:16:02.025 --> 00:16:02.585
<v Speaker 0>now.

00:16:03.545 --> 00:16:05.225
<v Speaker 0>Now I'm curious if I just pop over

00:16:05.225 --> 00:16:06.425
<v Speaker 0>here then and hit refresh.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:10.370
<v Speaker 0>We have movies now. Cool.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:13.410
<v Speaker 0>Let's see. Gotta search for the metrics.

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:15.650
<v Speaker 2>May be still

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:17.330
<v Speaker 2>updating. Have documented.

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.810
<v Speaker 2>Yes. Check the update

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:21.730
<v Speaker 2>ID status.

00:16:25.865 --> 00:16:26.825
<v Speaker 0>So this

00:16:27.465 --> 00:16:29.385
<v Speaker 0>this is telling So if you go back

00:16:30.105 --> 00:16:32.105
<v Speaker 1>now if you go back, the best way

00:16:32.105 --> 00:16:33.225
<v Speaker 1>to do that is, like, if you go

00:16:33.225 --> 00:16:35.320
<v Speaker 1>back to the other terminal you used Oh,

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:35.960
<v Speaker 0>yeah. Yeah.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.560
<v Speaker 1>Probably in Versus Code, I think. Yeah. Yeah.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.160
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna see it return you an update

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:41.880
<v Speaker 1>ID.

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.200
<v Speaker 1>And, with that update ID, it's, because, like,

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.315
<v Speaker 1>the importation is is a sync. So it

00:16:49.315 --> 00:16:51.235
<v Speaker 1>would probably be done by now, I guess,

00:16:51.235 --> 00:16:53.154
<v Speaker 1>depending on the speed of your computer. But,

00:16:53.154 --> 00:16:54.995
<v Speaker 1>like, if you want to check the status,

00:16:55.235 --> 00:16:57.235
<v Speaker 1>you can do this by calling

00:16:57.395 --> 00:16:59.315
<v Speaker 1>the proper API endpoint.

00:17:00.275 --> 00:17:01.555
<v Speaker 2>It's get

00:17:01.715 --> 00:17:02.755
<v Speaker 2>indexes, movies,

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:05.210
<v Speaker 2>updates,

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:07.290
<v Speaker 2>and then the number of the update ID,

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:07.929
<v Speaker 2>I think.

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:11.690
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Okay. So indexes,

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:13.849
<v Speaker 2>movies. Updates.

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:15.049
<v Speaker 2>Updates.

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:17.770
<v Speaker 2>And then zero.

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:18.090
<v Speaker 2>Yes.

00:17:21.224 --> 00:17:24.265
<v Speaker 0>Cool. Let's put this through a GQ. Processed.

00:17:25.464 --> 00:17:27.385
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So we've just imported

00:17:28.105 --> 00:17:30.664
<v Speaker 0>19,554

00:17:30.985 --> 00:17:31.625
<v Speaker 0>movies.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:35.510
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So now now you see its process.

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:36.870
<v Speaker 1>So if you refresh.

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:38.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yes.

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:40.470
<v Speaker 0>Now the matrix.

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:41.430
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:45.754
<v Speaker 0>That one doesn't exist. Oh, okay.

00:17:46.554 --> 00:17:49.434
<v Speaker 0>That's just my dig at the second matrix

00:17:49.434 --> 00:17:51.355
<v Speaker 0>but I'll save that for an hour time.

00:17:51.355 --> 00:17:51.835
<v Speaker 0>So,

00:17:52.635 --> 00:17:53.514
<v Speaker 1>I

00:17:54.235 --> 00:17:56.235
<v Speaker 0>know it was so subtle even to myself.

00:17:56.235 --> 00:17:57.679
<v Speaker 0>I felt I had to explain it

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.200
<v Speaker 0>but it's alright.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.080
<v Speaker 0>So now we have a really fast way

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.000
<v Speaker 0>to search for movies and a database of

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.360
<v Speaker 0>around 20,000

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.440
<v Speaker 0>and it does seem quick,

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.279
<v Speaker 0>I like it.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.080
<v Speaker 0>So let's see what else the documentation is

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.385
<v Speaker 0>gonna run through. Is there anything you just

00:18:13.385 --> 00:18:15.544
<v Speaker 0>wanna highlight, point out before we jump back

00:18:15.544 --> 00:18:17.065
<v Speaker 0>to the docs? Like, is there anything Try

00:18:17.065 --> 00:18:17.705
<v Speaker 1>to try

00:18:18.105 --> 00:18:19.544
<v Speaker 1>to search for metrics,

00:18:19.625 --> 00:18:21.225
<v Speaker 1>by making a mistake,

00:18:21.544 --> 00:18:23.225
<v Speaker 1>like search for, I don't know,

00:18:23.784 --> 00:18:24.825
<v Speaker 1>matrix

00:18:25.304 --> 00:18:26.184
<v Speaker 1>or metrics.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.580
<v Speaker 1>So this this is a feature I like.

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.900
<v Speaker 1>I I call it threat proof because I

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.300
<v Speaker 1>I do mistakes all the time. And you

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:36.980
<v Speaker 1>know, this is how search work. You know?

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.740
<v Speaker 1>You go to Google search. I don't even

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:40.740
<v Speaker 1>fix my search query when I go on

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.180
<v Speaker 1>Google search because I'm like, oh, I made

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:45.014
<v Speaker 1>a mistake. It's faster to like push enter

00:18:45.015 --> 00:18:47.654
<v Speaker 1>and just select what Google proposed me after.

00:18:48.215 --> 00:18:50.135
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bit like that where like

00:18:50.135 --> 00:18:51.815
<v Speaker 1>it's it's typo tolerant.

00:18:52.294 --> 00:18:53.655
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I I do that all the time

00:18:53.655 --> 00:18:55.095
<v Speaker 0>on my phone as well where I'm typing

00:18:55.095 --> 00:18:56.695
<v Speaker 0>and I noticed the mistake and I think

00:18:56.695 --> 00:18:58.215
<v Speaker 0>I'm just gonna go and hit and like

00:18:58.215 --> 00:19:00.400
<v Speaker 0>Google fix it and it usually does.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.280
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So yeah, I can type whatever I

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.559
<v Speaker 0>want here and

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.280
<v Speaker 0>I'm just testing how how much of a

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:10.320
<v Speaker 0>mistake I can make.

00:19:13.145 --> 00:19:14.904
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Cool. Yeah. You need you need you

00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:16.985
<v Speaker 1>need to be like close. You cannot go

00:19:16.985 --> 00:19:20.505
<v Speaker 1>crazy with your mistakes either. But yeah. Okay.

00:19:20.505 --> 00:19:23.145
<v Speaker 0>The movie with that guy that I like

00:19:23.145 --> 00:19:23.625
<v Speaker 0>in it.

00:19:25.279 --> 00:19:26.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I I

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.240
<v Speaker 1>you nearly got your answer. I I think

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.000
<v Speaker 1>the what was the movie you just saw

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:32.719
<v Speaker 1>before?

00:19:34.559 --> 00:19:34.960
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

00:19:39.645 --> 00:19:40.365
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:19:40.525 --> 00:19:43.005
<v Speaker 1>Twelve twelve days of Christmas. It's it's your

00:19:43.005 --> 00:19:45.165
<v Speaker 1>it's your preferred film movie.

00:19:45.245 --> 00:19:46.605
<v Speaker 0>Well, I've never seen that, but I think

00:19:46.605 --> 00:19:48.205
<v Speaker 0>that's definitely gonna have to be tonight's for

00:19:48.205 --> 00:19:51.245
<v Speaker 0>you. A Christmas movie in February. Definitely. So

00:19:52.685 --> 00:19:54.845
<v Speaker 1>Or Christmas romantic comedy.

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:56.740
<v Speaker 1>That that's promising.

00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:57.780
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.540
<v Speaker 0>It just seems to have matched each of

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:01.220
<v Speaker 0>those words that I've tied with the overview

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:02.980
<v Speaker 0>of the film, which makes sense. Like this

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:04.340
<v Speaker 0>is coming back. In fact, I've got a

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:06.100
<v Speaker 0>few choice, two choices. There we go.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:08.900
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's see what else we can do.

00:20:11.294 --> 00:20:13.775
<v Speaker 0>So we actually, oh, see we've already covered

00:20:13.775 --> 00:20:16.014
<v Speaker 0>checking updates as well, so

00:20:16.815 --> 00:20:18.815
<v Speaker 0>we don't need to do that and we

00:20:18.815 --> 00:20:20.735
<v Speaker 0>can do a search via the API which

00:20:20.735 --> 00:20:22.850
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming is gonna just be very to

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:25.090
<v Speaker 0>what we got back for the web interface.

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:25.490
<v Speaker 0>But

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:27.970
<v Speaker 0>let's just run it anyway.

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Nice.

00:20:37.055 --> 00:20:39.535
<v Speaker 0>Cool. Alright. Let's see. So we got the

00:20:39.535 --> 00:20:41.375
<v Speaker 0>web interface. We've had a quick play with

00:20:41.375 --> 00:20:43.055
<v Speaker 0>that too. And then we can integrate it

00:20:43.055 --> 00:20:44.575
<v Speaker 0>with our project and we've already made our

00:20:44.575 --> 00:20:46.175
<v Speaker 0>million dollar thing and we could move on.

00:20:46.175 --> 00:20:46.654
<v Speaker 0>Perfect.

00:20:47.295 --> 00:20:48.255
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.

00:20:49.455 --> 00:20:52.169
<v Speaker 1>This is a sample like hello type of

00:20:52.169 --> 00:20:52.889
<v Speaker 1>example.

00:20:53.769 --> 00:20:55.769
<v Speaker 1>But after, you know now you've got a

00:20:55.769 --> 00:20:58.090
<v Speaker 1>server working with Meilisearch and get access to

00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:59.929
<v Speaker 1>the API, but you probably want to integrate

00:20:59.929 --> 00:21:01.849
<v Speaker 1>it within your project.

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:03.769
<v Speaker 1>And this is what I really love because

00:21:03.769 --> 00:21:07.125
<v Speaker 1>our integration team done, like, an amazing job.

00:21:07.125 --> 00:21:09.285
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to integrate it yourself

00:21:09.285 --> 00:21:11.365
<v Speaker 1>and, like, just, like, use the API and

00:21:11.365 --> 00:21:12.885
<v Speaker 1>and create a code yourself,

00:21:13.045 --> 00:21:15.445
<v Speaker 1>like, good for you. You can do it.

00:21:15.445 --> 00:21:17.285
<v Speaker 1>But if you check on the sidebar

00:21:17.365 --> 00:21:19.845
<v Speaker 1>on official's a SDK libraries

00:21:19.845 --> 00:21:21.525
<v Speaker 1>on the four three links

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:22.470
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:25.110
<v Speaker 1>On the top of the yeah. You click

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:27.830
<v Speaker 1>there, and, you're gonna see a list of

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:30.230
<v Speaker 1>the actual integration we have. So, you know,

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:32.870
<v Speaker 1>if you are building something in PHP,

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:35.294
<v Speaker 1>again, you can just like do your

00:21:35.615 --> 00:21:38.175
<v Speaker 1>HTTP request and and like call the API

00:21:38.175 --> 00:21:39.774
<v Speaker 1>or you can use the SDK

00:21:39.934 --> 00:21:42.415
<v Speaker 1>and just use like easy function to do

00:21:42.415 --> 00:21:43.455
<v Speaker 1>the implementation.

00:21:44.575 --> 00:21:45.775
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's pretty

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:50.559
<v Speaker 0>pretty well covered support there. Know, I'll skip

00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:52.159
<v Speaker 0>the Java one, but you know, Golang and

00:21:52.159 --> 00:21:54.159
<v Speaker 0>JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Rust.

00:21:54.639 --> 00:21:56.000
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I think that's pretty much every

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.759
<v Speaker 0>language that I'm gonna be working with these

00:21:57.759 --> 00:21:59.600
<v Speaker 0>days anyway. So it's nice to see that

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.679
<v Speaker 0>support is just there out of the box.

00:22:01.679 --> 00:22:03.735
<v Speaker 0>So those all officially maintained by the the

00:22:03.735 --> 00:22:06.855
<v Speaker 0>Meilisearch team? Yep. Yeah. Yeah. And, actually, it's

00:22:07.335 --> 00:22:09.095
<v Speaker 1>there there is other integration.

00:22:09.095 --> 00:22:10.455
<v Speaker 1>So we have our team like, we have

00:22:10.455 --> 00:22:12.695
<v Speaker 1>a team that work full time on integrations.

00:22:12.935 --> 00:22:15.095
<v Speaker 1>So, like, more and more front end tools

00:22:15.095 --> 00:22:17.175
<v Speaker 1>are coming. More frameworks are coming.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. We we really think that that's just

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.720
<v Speaker 1>gonna make, like, people's life easy, so we

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.320
<v Speaker 1>put a lot of effort on that.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.279
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.920
<v Speaker 0>And there's also front end tools. You can

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.440
<v Speaker 0>say, you know, I use React a fair

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:31.720
<v Speaker 0>bit, so it looks like there's a way

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.184
<v Speaker 0>to just drop that in react components, angular

00:22:34.184 --> 00:22:34.985
<v Speaker 0>view.

00:22:35.545 --> 00:22:36.664
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure what

00:22:36.905 --> 00:22:39.144
<v Speaker 0>instant search is but it

00:22:39.465 --> 00:22:40.504
<v Speaker 0>sounds fancy.

00:22:41.465 --> 00:22:44.105
<v Speaker 0>And we have Kubernetes deployment manifest as well,

00:22:44.105 --> 00:22:44.745
<v Speaker 0>is this

00:22:45.145 --> 00:22:47.305
<v Speaker 0>a Helm chart or yeah, a Helm chart,

00:22:47.305 --> 00:22:48.265
<v Speaker 0>there we go. Yep.

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:49.690
<v Speaker 0>Is

00:22:51.049 --> 00:22:51.929
<v Speaker 0>Meilisearch

00:22:51.929 --> 00:22:52.970
<v Speaker 0>horizontally

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:54.730
<v Speaker 0>scalable or do I just run one of

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:57.849
<v Speaker 0>them? Like what is the deployment architecture there?

00:22:59.049 --> 00:22:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:22:59.929 --> 00:23:02.505
<v Speaker 1>Right right now it's not. Like, I mean,

00:23:03.225 --> 00:23:06.505
<v Speaker 1>we are working on making it hazier

00:23:06.585 --> 00:23:09.785
<v Speaker 1>horizontally scaling because right now, there's no what's

00:23:09.785 --> 00:23:10.505
<v Speaker 1>the word when

00:23:12.025 --> 00:23:12.825
<v Speaker 1>shading?

00:23:12.905 --> 00:23:13.785
<v Speaker 1>Sharding?

00:23:14.265 --> 00:23:15.385
<v Speaker 1>Sharding. Yeah.

00:23:15.945 --> 00:23:16.585
<v Speaker 1>Close enough.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
<v Speaker 1>So there's no way to do sharding right

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
<v Speaker 1>now, but it's something we're gonna work on

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.240
<v Speaker 1>because in production, that's gonna be important to

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.600
<v Speaker 1>be able to to

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.720
<v Speaker 1>use it like that.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.840
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. But I guess it's also retina and

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.240
<v Speaker 0>rust fully synchronous through the actor framework. So

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.845
<v Speaker 0>I can imagine it's pretty fast and scales

00:23:33.845 --> 00:23:36.884
<v Speaker 0>terribly well just vertically. It never remained horizontally,

00:23:36.884 --> 00:23:38.085
<v Speaker 0>but it's nice to know that. It is.

00:23:38.085 --> 00:23:40.404
<v Speaker 1>It is. Act actually, you know, the thing

00:23:40.404 --> 00:23:41.364
<v Speaker 1>that are taking

00:23:41.764 --> 00:23:44.485
<v Speaker 1>most of the resources is when you import

00:23:44.485 --> 00:23:44.965
<v Speaker 1>document.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.680
<v Speaker 1>So, it's it's taking a lot of memories

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.120
<v Speaker 1>to import documents,

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.120
<v Speaker 1>but, I would say it's the biggest,

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.840
<v Speaker 1>unless you tell me capital I'm wrong, but

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.399
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the biggest, usage of resources.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.000
<v Speaker 1>And even for that,

00:23:58.559 --> 00:24:00.695
<v Speaker 1>right now, what you see when you try

00:24:00.695 --> 00:24:03.255
<v Speaker 1>Meilisearch right now is the actual version we

00:24:03.255 --> 00:24:06.455
<v Speaker 1>have, but our developers are working on the

00:24:06.455 --> 00:24:08.295
<v Speaker 1>v two of the engine. So the the

00:24:08.375 --> 00:24:10.294
<v Speaker 1>like, strictly the engine part.

00:24:10.535 --> 00:24:13.649
<v Speaker 1>And, if you think Meilisearch is now, you've

00:24:13.649 --> 00:24:16.370
<v Speaker 1>seen nothing. So I I should release a

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:19.649
<v Speaker 1>video soon enough, I hope, of, like, just

00:24:19.649 --> 00:24:20.450
<v Speaker 1>showcasing

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:23.409
<v Speaker 1>how much Meilisearch is even faster right now

00:24:23.409 --> 00:24:25.730
<v Speaker 1>because now we we're not gonna talk about,

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:27.649
<v Speaker 1>like, something like 100,000

00:24:27.649 --> 00:24:28.130
<v Speaker 1>document.

00:24:28.555 --> 00:24:30.795
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna talk about, like, 1,000,000, two million

00:24:30.795 --> 00:24:33.835
<v Speaker 1>document, and that's gonna be faster than the

00:24:33.835 --> 00:24:36.155
<v Speaker 1>experience we have right now. So

00:24:36.715 --> 00:24:39.915
<v Speaker 1>it's it's it's just awesome. But now, obviously,

00:24:39.915 --> 00:24:41.515
<v Speaker 1>you have to believe me because you cannot

00:24:41.515 --> 00:24:44.200
<v Speaker 1>see it, but, yeah, It's it's it's coming

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.440
<v Speaker 1>in the pipeline really, really soon. Well, you

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.440
<v Speaker 0>seem quite trustworthy, so I know I believe

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:48.999
<v Speaker 0>you.

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Also You shouldn't you shouldn't you shouldn't not

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:52.679
<v Speaker 1>trust me.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.960
<v Speaker 0>Well, I pulled up this held chart values

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.480
<v Speaker 0>file. I actually see this in the environment

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.355
<v Speaker 0>variable. It looks like it disables the analytics

00:24:59.355 --> 00:25:02.075
<v Speaker 0>as well, so Meilis know analytics, true. There

00:25:02.075 --> 00:25:03.995
<v Speaker 0>you go. Oh I didn't even know Alright

00:25:06.955 --> 00:25:08.875
<v Speaker 0>so I'm curious about the,

00:25:09.515 --> 00:25:10.075
<v Speaker 0>you know,

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.580
<v Speaker 0>I've not really done anything yet and I'm

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:15.740
<v Speaker 0>getting a whole lot back from Meilisearch.

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:17.420
<v Speaker 0>Like you know, I've just imported data and

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.340
<v Speaker 0>I could imagine doing this for my application

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:21.340
<v Speaker 0>when I start throwing loads of documents into

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:22.940
<v Speaker 0>the index and then just using it as

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.700
<v Speaker 0>a search endpoint. Is there

00:25:25.605 --> 00:25:28.965
<v Speaker 0>is everything indexed by default for me or

00:25:28.965 --> 00:25:30.405
<v Speaker 0>do I have to tweak the schema in

00:25:30.405 --> 00:25:32.085
<v Speaker 0>some way to tell it how to index

00:25:32.085 --> 00:25:34.725
<v Speaker 0>and which matters to apply? Like how how

00:25:34.725 --> 00:25:36.485
<v Speaker 0>much configuration do I have when I work

00:25:36.485 --> 00:25:37.205
<v Speaker 0>with Meilisearch?

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:39.190
<v Speaker 2>Well, do you

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:41.109
<v Speaker 2>you can

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:42.710
<v Speaker 2>customize

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:45.029
<v Speaker 2>what you want to be indexed,

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.749
<v Speaker 2>the

00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:49.750
<v Speaker 2>what you want to be searchable, the attributes

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:52.630
<v Speaker 2>you want to be you want to be

00:25:52.205 --> 00:25:54.684
<v Speaker 2>you want to set a searchable. You can

00:25:55.165 --> 00:25:56.525
<v Speaker 2>like, there is a bunch of thing you

00:25:56.525 --> 00:25:59.245
<v Speaker 2>can customize. Like, you it's

00:25:59.325 --> 00:26:01.804
<v Speaker 2>ultra relevant out of the box,

00:26:02.205 --> 00:26:04.365
<v Speaker 2>but you can change a lot of things.

00:26:04.525 --> 00:26:06.059
<v Speaker 2>Like, if you want,

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:09.020
<v Speaker 2>here, the relevancy

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:12.379
<v Speaker 2>is, set by the first document indexed.

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.460
<v Speaker 2>For instance,

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.780
<v Speaker 2>something a word found in the title will

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:19.020
<v Speaker 2>be more important, considered as more important than

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:21.415
<v Speaker 2>a word found in the overview, for instance.

00:26:22.055 --> 00:26:23.575
<v Speaker 2>But if you want to change this this

00:26:23.575 --> 00:26:26.215
<v Speaker 2>behavior, you can. You can. In the settings,

00:26:26.615 --> 00:26:28.455
<v Speaker 2>you have a lot of things you can

00:26:28.455 --> 00:26:29.335
<v Speaker 2>customize.

00:26:29.655 --> 00:26:32.375
<v Speaker 0>Does that mean there's a curl request I

00:26:32.375 --> 00:26:35.175
<v Speaker 0>can send to kinda understand that schema just

00:26:35.175 --> 00:26:36.240
<v Speaker 0>now? Will

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.600
<v Speaker 0>it print it out for me?

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You can can actually, you can you

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.400
<v Speaker 1>know, all the option you can change is

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.360
<v Speaker 1>like you can

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.320
<v Speaker 1>have a list of associated word

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.515
<v Speaker 1>of synonyms because,

00:26:48.995 --> 00:26:51.395
<v Speaker 1>like, we can treat synonyms and you define

00:26:51.395 --> 00:26:52.835
<v Speaker 1>those synonyms yourself.

00:26:53.154 --> 00:26:54.995
<v Speaker 1>You can have a list of stop words.

00:26:54.995 --> 00:26:56.674
<v Speaker 1>Like, as an example, you've seen, like, your

00:26:56.674 --> 00:26:59.075
<v Speaker 1>your really long example trying to,

00:26:59.315 --> 00:27:01.409
<v Speaker 1>make your product look bad, David.

00:27:02.049 --> 00:27:04.529
<v Speaker 1>You know, you've seen I'm joking. You've seen

00:27:04.529 --> 00:27:06.209
<v Speaker 1>out, like, all the, like

00:27:06.929 --> 00:27:08.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's the word in English,

00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:10.450
<v Speaker 1>but, you know, like, those small word that

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:12.849
<v Speaker 1>are in between, like, t h e, of,

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:15.809
<v Speaker 1>buy, those words that you probably don't want

00:27:15.809 --> 00:27:18.825
<v Speaker 1>them to be part of your search queries.

00:27:18.825 --> 00:27:20.585
<v Speaker 1>So those are call stop words. You can

00:27:20.585 --> 00:27:21.465
<v Speaker 1>define them.

00:27:21.865 --> 00:27:24.505
<v Speaker 1>Has Carol said, like, the ranking rules. And

00:27:24.505 --> 00:27:26.905
<v Speaker 1>there's both things you can do. In the

00:27:26.905 --> 00:27:27.945
<v Speaker 1>documentation,

00:27:27.945 --> 00:27:30.230
<v Speaker 1>you can see those if you go and

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:32.470
<v Speaker 1>I think it's in reference.

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:35.190
<v Speaker 1>In the API reference,

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:37.430
<v Speaker 1>there is a section called settings.

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:39.910
<v Speaker 1>So if you go at the top level

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:41.350
<v Speaker 1>yeah. Click reference.

00:27:43.305 --> 00:27:44.745
<v Speaker 1>API reference.

00:27:47.625 --> 00:27:48.904
<v Speaker 2>Settings. Yeah.

00:27:49.705 --> 00:27:51.625
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. But you can you can, yeah, you

00:27:51.625 --> 00:27:53.305
<v Speaker 1>can see all of them there. And if

00:27:53.305 --> 00:27:54.345
<v Speaker 1>you want to see how

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:56.910
<v Speaker 1>use the API to change them, you can

00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:59.230
<v Speaker 1>check-in the API reference. There's also a check

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:00.909
<v Speaker 1>a section called settings.

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:02.830
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah.

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:07.215
<v Speaker 0>So you were asking how to, can, like,

00:28:07.215 --> 00:28:09.135
<v Speaker 1>get the list so you can use, like,

00:28:09.135 --> 00:28:11.615
<v Speaker 1>the m deck slash settings. Yeah. Okay. You

00:28:11.615 --> 00:28:12.575
<v Speaker 1>you got it.

00:28:12.895 --> 00:28:14.575
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Let's take a look. So

00:28:15.455 --> 00:28:17.294
<v Speaker 0>current request to movies

00:28:18.015 --> 00:28:18.415
<v Speaker 0>settings,

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:22.049
<v Speaker 0>and

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:24.770
<v Speaker 0>we get back to this. Okay. So we

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:25.330
<v Speaker 0>got

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:26.770
<v Speaker 0>ranking

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:27.809
<v Speaker 0>rules.

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:31.490
<v Speaker 0>Don't know what that means yet. Distinct attributes,

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:34.575
<v Speaker 0>searchable attributes, display, attraction. Alright. Okay. We've got

00:28:34.575 --> 00:28:37.455
<v Speaker 0>a fair amount of customization here. I'm

00:28:37.695 --> 00:28:39.695
<v Speaker 0>gonna guess what some of this means and

00:28:39.695 --> 00:28:41.455
<v Speaker 0>then you can tell me Okay. Where I'm

00:28:41.455 --> 00:28:43.534
<v Speaker 0>wrong or whether I'm right. I'm gonna skip

00:28:43.534 --> 00:28:45.455
<v Speaker 0>the ranking rules and just let both of

00:28:45.455 --> 00:28:46.895
<v Speaker 0>you handle that in a moment because I'm

00:28:46.895 --> 00:28:47.135
<v Speaker 0>not sure.

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:50.570
<v Speaker 0>The searchable attributes, think I can maybe work

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:51.369
<v Speaker 0>that one out.

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:55.130
<v Speaker 0>So you know if I maybe wanted to

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:55.769
<v Speaker 0>store

00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:59.049
<v Speaker 0>people I meet at conferences in a Meilisearch.

00:28:59.529 --> 00:29:00.890
<v Speaker 0>I may want to be able to search

00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:02.490
<v Speaker 0>for them by name or a company or

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:04.735
<v Speaker 0>Twitter handle but probably not by email address,

00:29:04.735 --> 00:29:06.975
<v Speaker 0>I wouldn't want to expose that. I'm assuming

00:29:07.455 --> 00:29:09.295
<v Speaker 0>by searchable attributes I can just say only

00:29:09.295 --> 00:29:11.294
<v Speaker 0>allow searching on these certain fields.

00:29:11.615 --> 00:29:13.534
<v Speaker 2>Mhmm. That's my guess. That's right.

00:29:15.295 --> 00:29:18.220
<v Speaker 0>And displayed attributes is this what if I

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:19.340
<v Speaker 0>pull down,

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:22.380
<v Speaker 0>say I search movies for the matrix, the

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.059
<v Speaker 0>displayed attributes will be the only ones that

00:29:24.059 --> 00:29:26.059
<v Speaker 0>are returned for each of those.

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:28.779
<v Speaker 0>Do we call them records at Meilisearch or

00:29:28.779 --> 00:29:30.539
<v Speaker 0>rows of documents?

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:31.659
<v Speaker 0>Documents.

00:29:32.105 --> 00:29:34.505
<v Speaker 0>Okay. But I'm assuming the displayed attributes are

00:29:34.505 --> 00:29:36.665
<v Speaker 0>what sent by default, I'm not sure if

00:29:36.665 --> 00:29:37.625
<v Speaker 0>I could tweak that.

00:29:38.105 --> 00:29:40.985
<v Speaker 0>The stop words, I think Fred's already kinda

00:29:40.985 --> 00:29:43.705
<v Speaker 0>covered that a moment ago. Synonyms, I'm assuming

00:29:43.785 --> 00:29:45.625
<v Speaker 0>if I wanna call the matrix or translate

00:29:45.625 --> 00:29:47.945
<v Speaker 0>it to other languages, would I use synonyms

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:48.330
<v Speaker 0>there?

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:49.129
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:50.330
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm.

00:29:50.809 --> 00:29:51.529
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:54.890
<v Speaker 0>And I'll leave attributes for faceting up to

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:56.410
<v Speaker 0>you. So if you just wanna tell me

00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:58.250
<v Speaker 0>what rank and rules and attributes for faceting

00:29:58.250 --> 00:29:59.530
<v Speaker 0>are, I would love that.

00:30:02.105 --> 00:30:02.904
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:30:03.545 --> 00:30:07.225
<v Speaker 2>Ranking rules are the the rules that define

00:30:07.225 --> 00:30:09.865
<v Speaker 2>the relevance of the search results.

00:30:10.745 --> 00:30:12.505
<v Speaker 2>So it's

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.520
<v Speaker 2>it's a bucket sort.

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:15.880
<v Speaker 2>Like, first,

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.560
<v Speaker 2>it's by

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.120
<v Speaker 2>the results are

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.640
<v Speaker 2>showed by

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.200
<v Speaker 2>increasing number of typos.

00:30:26.654 --> 00:30:28.575
<v Speaker 2>There is also the

00:30:30.335 --> 00:30:32.095
<v Speaker 2>how do you sorry.

00:30:32.815 --> 00:30:33.455
<v Speaker 2>Like,

00:30:33.615 --> 00:30:35.134
<v Speaker 2>my English is not

00:30:35.775 --> 00:30:36.895
<v Speaker 2>here at the moment.

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:40.770
<v Speaker 2>The proximity of the words you search is

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:42.770
<v Speaker 2>not the same to search, for instance,

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:45.809
<v Speaker 2>I love rock and

00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:49.250
<v Speaker 2>and I love something and rock.

00:30:49.985 --> 00:30:50.625
<v Speaker 2>So

00:30:50.785 --> 00:30:54.065
<v Speaker 2>the the results are going to to show

00:30:54.625 --> 00:30:57.825
<v Speaker 2>in that particular order. The word position,

00:30:58.945 --> 00:30:59.905
<v Speaker 2>it's

00:31:02.065 --> 00:31:02.945
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry. I

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:05.590
<v Speaker 2>the attributes,

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:07.030
<v Speaker 2>that is related

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:09.670
<v Speaker 2>with the searchable attributes, this thing I mentioned

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:10.390
<v Speaker 2>earlier.

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:12.630
<v Speaker 2>Like, the

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:16.485
<v Speaker 2>the order of the first document

00:31:16.565 --> 00:31:18.965
<v Speaker 2>is in which attributes appear in the first

00:31:18.965 --> 00:31:22.245
<v Speaker 2>document, it's important. Something that appears in the

00:31:22.245 --> 00:31:23.765
<v Speaker 2>title, it's not the same

00:31:24.165 --> 00:31:26.805
<v Speaker 2>as word that appears in the overview because

00:31:26.805 --> 00:31:28.965
<v Speaker 2>the title appears first in the first document.

00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:32.529
<v Speaker 2>And do you want to help me, Fred?

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:35.409
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Which one you

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:37.090
<v Speaker 1>you have left?

00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:39.330
<v Speaker 2>Which position

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:40.370
<v Speaker 2>and accept

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:41.410
<v Speaker 2>exactness?

00:31:43.385 --> 00:31:46.105
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So, word position is is,

00:31:47.065 --> 00:31:50.185
<v Speaker 1>like, it's the result are sorted by, the

00:31:50.185 --> 00:31:52.585
<v Speaker 1>position of the query word and the attributes.

00:31:52.745 --> 00:31:54.665
<v Speaker 1>So if you go you can even see

00:31:54.665 --> 00:31:55.865
<v Speaker 1>example of that.

00:31:56.185 --> 00:31:58.505
<v Speaker 1>If you go into documentation and, like, the

00:31:58.505 --> 00:31:59.560
<v Speaker 1>learn court

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.480
<v Speaker 1>I know right now it's a little bit

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.160
<v Speaker 1>all over the place because we we talk

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.520
<v Speaker 1>about different topic. But, like, if you could

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:05.640
<v Speaker 1>click on learn,

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:08.040
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a core concept

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.799
<v Speaker 1>relevancy

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.720
<v Speaker 1>and

00:32:11.255 --> 00:32:13.415
<v Speaker 1>if you check ranking row.

00:32:13.575 --> 00:32:15.975
<v Speaker 1>So maybe, like, something more visual is gonna

00:32:15.975 --> 00:32:17.735
<v Speaker 1>be easier. If you scroll down until you

00:32:17.735 --> 00:32:20.455
<v Speaker 1>go to example yeah. So you're gonna see,

00:32:20.455 --> 00:32:21.335
<v Speaker 1>like yeah.

00:32:21.975 --> 00:32:24.455
<v Speaker 1>There. So you're gonna see, like, each go

00:32:24.455 --> 00:32:25.095
<v Speaker 1>up a little bit.

00:32:26.539 --> 00:32:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Each tab,

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.979
<v Speaker 1>to show you example of, like, those,

00:32:30.299 --> 00:32:32.460
<v Speaker 1>those different rules. So, like, if you go

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:34.220
<v Speaker 1>to word position, you're gonna see, like, if

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.659
<v Speaker 1>you search for Belgium,

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.460
<v Speaker 1>like like

00:32:40.164 --> 00:32:43.445
<v Speaker 1>like, is gonna happen, is gonna happen before

00:32:43.445 --> 00:32:44.565
<v Speaker 1>Dunkirk because

00:32:45.044 --> 00:32:48.164
<v Speaker 1>Belgium app her appear sooner in the attributes.

00:32:48.164 --> 00:32:50.164
<v Speaker 1>So it's really like to say, like, hey.

00:32:50.164 --> 00:32:52.644
<v Speaker 1>If the, word position is more important to

00:32:52.644 --> 00:32:53.764
<v Speaker 1>you, like,

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.040
<v Speaker 1>you would have a title like, if you

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.280
<v Speaker 1>took if you put this as one of

00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:58.680
<v Speaker 1>the,

00:32:59.559 --> 00:33:02.440
<v Speaker 1>the more important rule for your search. So

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:04.040
<v Speaker 1>as an example, if there is a a

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.080
<v Speaker 1>movie

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:05.960
<v Speaker 1>that is

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.040
<v Speaker 1>metrics

00:33:09.164 --> 00:33:11.725
<v Speaker 1>colon, how the movie was done, like the

00:33:11.725 --> 00:33:14.284
<v Speaker 1>comic documentary on metrics. So if you put

00:33:14.284 --> 00:33:17.725
<v Speaker 1>word position as one of the, main attributes

00:33:17.725 --> 00:33:18.924
<v Speaker 1>for your search,

00:33:19.325 --> 00:33:20.684
<v Speaker 1>that title,

00:33:20.845 --> 00:33:23.164
<v Speaker 1>that movie will come first before

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:27.860
<v Speaker 1>the metrics because, like, metrics, the word is

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:29.460
<v Speaker 1>before the metrics.

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.380
<v Speaker 1>Does does it make sense what you just

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:33.860
<v Speaker 1>said? Yes. So based what and what you've

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:35.700
<v Speaker 0>just described there, I'm assuming if I search

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.895
<v Speaker 0>for Christmas, movies that have Christmas in the

00:33:37.895 --> 00:33:40.535
<v Speaker 0>title will show up before movies that mention

00:33:40.535 --> 00:33:42.695
<v Speaker 0>Christmas in their overview.

00:33:43.015 --> 00:33:45.015
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So Christmas in the title, Christmas in

00:33:45.015 --> 00:33:45.735
<v Speaker 0>the title.

00:33:46.855 --> 00:33:48.775
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So that that's two thing. Like Christmas

00:33:48.775 --> 00:33:49.735
<v Speaker 1>in the title

00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:51.029
<v Speaker 1>is because

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:53.589
<v Speaker 1>because we didn't set any

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:55.749
<v Speaker 1>ranking rule or,

00:33:56.309 --> 00:33:56.950
<v Speaker 1>like,

00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:59.349
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the

00:33:59.909 --> 00:34:01.830
<v Speaker 1>what do you wanna say something, Carol? Because

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:03.669
<v Speaker 2>no. Because the the

00:34:04.145 --> 00:34:06.304
<v Speaker 2>the attribute title is more important than the

00:34:06.304 --> 00:34:07.585
<v Speaker 2>attribute overview.

00:34:07.585 --> 00:34:10.304
<v Speaker 2>But let's say we are just searching

00:34:10.545 --> 00:34:12.864
<v Speaker 2>only the overview is searchable.

00:34:13.824 --> 00:34:16.385
<v Speaker 2>So if Christmas is the first word in

00:34:16.385 --> 00:34:18.864
<v Speaker 2>the overview, it will appear first in your

00:34:18.864 --> 00:34:21.239
<v Speaker 2>search result than if it's the last words

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:22.200
<v Speaker 2>in the middle.

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Right. And and because why why title is

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.440
<v Speaker 1>more important right now is because we didn't

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:29.080
<v Speaker 1>set,

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.160
<v Speaker 1>the rules ourselves, so we go with the

00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:33.505
<v Speaker 1>default rules. And because we go with the

00:34:33.505 --> 00:34:34.545
<v Speaker 1>default rules,

00:34:34.705 --> 00:34:37.425
<v Speaker 1>it means that it will take, the importance

00:34:37.425 --> 00:34:40.625
<v Speaker 1>of the, different attributes will be in,

00:34:41.025 --> 00:34:42.225
<v Speaker 1>the order

00:34:42.225 --> 00:34:45.105
<v Speaker 1>that they are in each document. So each

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.599
<v Speaker 1>JSON object. So you're gonna have, like, titles

00:34:47.599 --> 00:34:50.000
<v Speaker 1>gonna be more important after that poster, after

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.880
<v Speaker 1>that overview, after that release date, after that

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:53.760
<v Speaker 1>junk.

00:34:54.559 --> 00:34:56.000
<v Speaker 2>It's the first document. Yep.

00:34:58.404 --> 00:35:00.005
<v Speaker 0>So when I search for Disney, I get

00:35:00.005 --> 00:35:01.765
<v Speaker 0>something that has Disney as a title, then

00:35:01.765 --> 00:35:03.125
<v Speaker 0>I get something that has Disney as the

00:35:03.125 --> 00:35:04.484
<v Speaker 0>first word on the overview.

00:35:04.805 --> 00:35:06.644
<v Speaker 1>First word in overview, first word in overview,

00:35:06.644 --> 00:35:08.085
<v Speaker 0>alright, there's a few and then second word.

00:35:08.085 --> 00:35:10.005
<v Speaker 0>Okay. That's done to make sense now. I

00:35:10.005 --> 00:35:11.045
<v Speaker 0>think I understand

00:35:11.444 --> 00:35:11.684
<v Speaker 0>that.

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:14.270
<v Speaker 0>And I'm assuming if I just pick another

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:17.150
<v Speaker 0>random word like Donald, that should spring up

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:18.030
<v Speaker 0>to the top.

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:20.670
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. There we go.

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:23.790
<v Speaker 0>That makes sense. Got it.

00:35:25.085 --> 00:35:27.484
<v Speaker 0>Now there was one more thing, the attributes

00:35:27.484 --> 00:35:28.525
<v Speaker 0>for faceting.

00:35:29.724 --> 00:35:31.405
<v Speaker 2>Okay. Facets

00:35:31.405 --> 00:35:32.845
<v Speaker 2>are like categories

00:35:32.924 --> 00:35:34.525
<v Speaker 2>in which you can search.

00:35:35.164 --> 00:35:37.484
<v Speaker 2>So let's say you

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:39.660
<v Speaker 2>in the in the movie example, you have

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:40.220
<v Speaker 2>the

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.420
<v Speaker 2>genre. You say that in English genre of

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:46.620
<v Speaker 2>the movie and you can just it's a

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:49.100
<v Speaker 2>strange word for me to say. Sorry.

00:35:52.895 --> 00:35:55.855
<v Speaker 2>So you can just search in the comedy

00:35:55.855 --> 00:35:59.055
<v Speaker 2>type movies or the romantic movies,

00:35:59.055 --> 00:36:01.455
<v Speaker 2>etcetera. You can set categories

00:36:01.455 --> 00:36:02.335
<v Speaker 2>to search.

00:36:02.575 --> 00:36:04.815
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. So I'm gonna throw an idea out

00:36:04.815 --> 00:36:06.350
<v Speaker 0>there then. Let's tell me if we can

00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:08.990
<v Speaker 0>do this in a timely amount of fashion.

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:09.390
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:13.070
<v Speaker 0>Now our schema here is just a default

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:14.830
<v Speaker 0>because all we did was import movies dot

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:17.390
<v Speaker 0>JSON but what I'm thinking is

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:20.484
<v Speaker 0>and let me test a hypothesis here is

00:36:20.484 --> 00:36:23.125
<v Speaker 0>that this will return that movie. Yeah. Now

00:36:23.125 --> 00:36:24.885
<v Speaker 0>I probably never want to search by the

00:36:24.885 --> 00:36:25.605
<v Speaker 0>poster

00:36:26.005 --> 00:36:28.484
<v Speaker 0>URL. So what I'm thinking is could we

00:36:28.484 --> 00:36:31.205
<v Speaker 0>modify the searchable attributes to omit

00:36:31.525 --> 00:36:32.645
<v Speaker 0>the poster

00:36:33.285 --> 00:36:33.925
<v Speaker 0>and

00:36:34.244 --> 00:36:36.860
<v Speaker 0>add and the genre as a faceted search

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:39.100
<v Speaker 0>to make it a little bit more sophisticated.

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Mhmm.

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:43.900
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Yeah. Yeah. You can do it. Is

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:45.500
<v Speaker 0>is that part of the getting started guide

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.580
<v Speaker 0>and I've just like made it up or

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:47.820
<v Speaker 0>no?

00:36:48.795 --> 00:36:50.875
<v Speaker 1>No. No. Actually, that's gonna be

00:36:51.835 --> 00:36:54.155
<v Speaker 1>let me be sure we have we have

00:36:54.155 --> 00:36:55.915
<v Speaker 1>an example for that.

00:36:57.515 --> 00:37:00.875
<v Speaker 1>This thing should be no. Searchable attributes. So

00:37:00.875 --> 00:37:02.155
<v Speaker 1>if you go

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:05.330
<v Speaker 1>if you go in reference

00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:06.930
<v Speaker 1>in settings

00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:08.130
<v Speaker 1>and

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:09.970
<v Speaker 1>searchable attributes

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:11.810
<v Speaker 1>yeah.

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:16.130
<v Speaker 0>So feature reference.

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:16.450
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:37:20.974 --> 00:37:24.255
<v Speaker 2>Our search bar of our documentation works.

00:37:25.375 --> 00:37:28.015
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. Actually, search search is is

00:37:28.335 --> 00:37:30.815
<v Speaker 1>really good in the documentation because we're using

00:37:30.815 --> 00:37:32.415
<v Speaker 1>a software called Meilisearch.

00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's so good. It's working so well.

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:37.790
<v Speaker 0>I was actually just about to ask if

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:39.550
<v Speaker 0>you used Meilisearch for the search on the

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:40.670
<v Speaker 0>doc. So I'm glad you said to the

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:41.310
<v Speaker 0>YouTube.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:45.310
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So I could just We're we're dogfooding.

00:37:47.175 --> 00:37:48.215
<v Speaker 0>So this

00:37:48.375 --> 00:37:50.695
<v Speaker 0>reference page in the documentation is is working

00:37:50.695 --> 00:37:52.535
<v Speaker 0>against the same movie set. So I'm actually

00:37:52.535 --> 00:37:53.975
<v Speaker 0>not really gonna have to change too much

00:37:53.975 --> 00:37:55.575
<v Speaker 0>here. Right? Like I could just

00:37:56.455 --> 00:37:57.815
<v Speaker 0>drop this in

00:37:58.615 --> 00:38:00.855
<v Speaker 0>and that's gonna give us title, description and

00:38:00.855 --> 00:38:02.750
<v Speaker 0>genre as a search.

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:04.270
<v Speaker 0>I think we need to change that to

00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:06.670
<v Speaker 0>overview instead of description. Is that right?

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:08.190
<v Speaker 2>Yes.

00:38:10.349 --> 00:38:10.990
<v Speaker 0>And

00:38:11.869 --> 00:38:12.670
<v Speaker 0>go.

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:14.990
<v Speaker 0>And then I can do my update command.

00:38:16.505 --> 00:38:18.345
<v Speaker 0>Where was that? Updates

00:38:18.505 --> 00:38:19.145
<v Speaker 0>one,

00:38:19.545 --> 00:38:21.385
<v Speaker 0>which I would expect just to see.

00:38:21.785 --> 00:38:23.705
<v Speaker 0>Oh, well, maybe not up, maybe it won't

00:38:23.705 --> 00:38:25.385
<v Speaker 0>be done as quickly as I thought because

00:38:25.385 --> 00:38:28.025
<v Speaker 0>does this have to rebuild the indices on

00:38:28.505 --> 00:38:29.225
<v Speaker 0>the index?

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:34.290
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question. I have no idea.

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:36.610
<v Speaker 0>That's fair. Do you do you know, Pavel?

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:38.130
<v Speaker 2>It's

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:39.810
<v Speaker 2>I think

00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:42.690
<v Speaker 2>I know it's much better to to set

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:44.690
<v Speaker 2>the in the settings before

00:38:44.785 --> 00:38:46.385
<v Speaker 2>indexing the documents.

00:38:46.465 --> 00:38:47.025
<v Speaker 2>But

00:38:48.225 --> 00:38:49.825
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. But I assume the data will still

00:38:49.825 --> 00:38:52.225
<v Speaker 1>be there. It will be just not searchable

00:38:52.225 --> 00:38:54.385
<v Speaker 1>because if you change your setting at some

00:38:54.385 --> 00:38:56.385
<v Speaker 1>point, like, the document is still there. So

00:38:56.625 --> 00:38:56.865
<v Speaker 1>yeah.

00:38:57.530 --> 00:38:59.849
<v Speaker 0>Well, we have achieved our first objective, which

00:38:59.849 --> 00:39:02.810
<v Speaker 0>is I'm now dropping in the poster URL

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:05.530
<v Speaker 0>and it's not returning anything. So I'm calling

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:06.410
<v Speaker 0>that a win.

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:09.130
<v Speaker 0>Fred's

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:10.355
<v Speaker 0>calling that a win too by the looks

00:39:10.355 --> 00:39:10.994
<v Speaker 0>of it.

00:39:11.635 --> 00:39:12.275
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:39:12.515 --> 00:39:13.395
<v Speaker 0>Objective

00:39:13.395 --> 00:39:14.595
<v Speaker 0>two is

00:39:15.155 --> 00:39:18.275
<v Speaker 0>is there a special operator for faceted search?

00:39:18.275 --> 00:39:19.715
<v Speaker 0>Like, can I do an

00:39:19.954 --> 00:39:21.954
<v Speaker 0>action or like or do I just type

00:39:22.035 --> 00:39:23.395
<v Speaker 0>like, how would I do a faceted search

00:39:23.395 --> 00:39:24.835
<v Speaker 0>where I only want action movies?

00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:29.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you can do it

00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:30.970
<v Speaker 2>from this web interface.

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:32.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's so. Oh, but

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:34.410
<v Speaker 0>we could do it from the curl, I

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:35.210
<v Speaker 0>guess. Right?

00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:36.330
<v Speaker 2>Yes.

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:37.850
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:39:38.715 --> 00:39:41.435
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna test out your docs now.

00:39:41.755 --> 00:39:43.755
<v Speaker 0>So fast as you search

00:39:45.755 --> 00:39:47.275
<v Speaker 0>and see if I can find me a

00:39:47.275 --> 00:39:48.475
<v Speaker 0>recurl command.

00:39:50.635 --> 00:39:53.130
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So first we have to update the

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:54.490
<v Speaker 0>thing. That makes sense.

00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:58.250
<v Speaker 0>Let's

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:00.250
<v Speaker 0>take off director. It looks like we have

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:01.690
<v Speaker 0>that in our dataset.

00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:04.250
<v Speaker 0>Not sure.

00:40:05.675 --> 00:40:06.715
<v Speaker 0>Alright. And

00:40:07.115 --> 00:40:08.475
<v Speaker 0>that seems happy.

00:40:09.515 --> 00:40:11.195
<v Speaker 0>I just like running the status of my

00:40:11.195 --> 00:40:12.715
<v Speaker 0>update. Someone

00:40:13.835 --> 00:40:16.315
<v Speaker 0>has answered a question on whether the indices

00:40:16.315 --> 00:40:18.320
<v Speaker 0>have to be rebuilt with a yes. I'm

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.240
<v Speaker 0>assuming they maybe have some knowledge here. I'm

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:20.880
<v Speaker 0>not sure.

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:22.160
<v Speaker 0>Dictomy?

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.200
<v Speaker 0>Dictal Tommy?

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:24.720
<v Speaker 0>Do we know that person?

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:27.040
<v Speaker 0>Nope. Is it It like it it may

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.280
<v Speaker 1>be my boss because he's using a different

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:31.520
<v Speaker 1>username everywhere he goes, so I never know

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:32.080
<v Speaker 1>if it's him.

00:40:33.755 --> 00:40:35.595
<v Speaker 1>Do you know if it's Tommy? If if

00:40:35.595 --> 00:40:37.195
<v Speaker 1>it's Thomas? I don't know.

00:40:38.235 --> 00:40:41.355
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe it's my maybe it's my tech

00:40:41.355 --> 00:40:42.075
<v Speaker 1>writer.

00:40:42.555 --> 00:40:43.755
<v Speaker 2>Yes. Tommy.

00:40:43.915 --> 00:40:45.595
<v Speaker 0>Or it could just be a random YouTuber

00:40:45.595 --> 00:40:47.740
<v Speaker 0>who's like, sure. Whatever. Yes. Like, yeah. Trust

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:49.900
<v Speaker 0>me. Alright. That's what we're continuing. And you

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:50.460
<v Speaker 1>know what?

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:54.060
<v Speaker 1>This is this is something I like because,

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:56.540
<v Speaker 1>like, I'm I'm totally fine with having, like,

00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:59.180
<v Speaker 1>users that know more than me because, like,

00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:01.260
<v Speaker 1>that means that they're using it. Like, it's

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:01.580
<v Speaker 1>perfect.

00:41:02.495 --> 00:41:04.815
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. 99.90.5%

00:41:04.815 --> 00:41:06.415
<v Speaker 0>of all users know more than me. So

00:41:06.415 --> 00:41:08.495
<v Speaker 0>I'm I'm quite comfortable with that now.

00:41:08.975 --> 00:41:09.535
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:41:09.935 --> 00:41:13.055
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we've added our attributes for faceting.

00:41:13.215 --> 00:41:16.580
<v Speaker 0>Now we wanna do a search returning only

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:18.340
<v Speaker 0>the genre that I want.

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:21.380
<v Speaker 0>Someone else has commented saying, I think it

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:22.660
<v Speaker 0>is Madden post.

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:24.900

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:45.520
<v Speaker 1>our tech writer.

00:41:46.319 --> 00:41:48.960
<v Speaker 0>Nice. Well, thank you for helping out. Okay.

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:51.440
<v Speaker 0>So we've got a carload request here now

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:51.920
<v Speaker 0>and

00:41:52.799 --> 00:41:54.400
<v Speaker 0>this is doing a search against our movies

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:57.520
<v Speaker 0>databases, we've added genres as a faceted filter.

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:00.585
<v Speaker 0>We're passing on Thriller as the query.

00:42:01.385 --> 00:42:04.585
<v Speaker 0>We don't have a director in our dataset,

00:42:04.505 --> 00:42:06.505
<v Speaker 0>don't think so I'm just gonna remove that.

00:42:07.865 --> 00:42:08.825
<v Speaker 0>So we're searching for

00:42:09.545 --> 00:42:11.465
<v Speaker 0>let me see if I've got this right.

00:42:11.625 --> 00:42:14.185
<v Speaker 0>We're filtering on where the genre is horror

00:42:14.185 --> 00:42:14.985
<v Speaker 0>or mystery

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.680
<v Speaker 0>and thriller

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:19.640
<v Speaker 0>exists on the title or the overview.

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:22.520
<v Speaker 0>Is that what we expect here?

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:23.800
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:24.760
<v Speaker 0>Maybe?

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.040
<v Speaker 2>Yes.

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:27.960
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:30.040
<v Speaker 0>And let's see if we can confirm that.

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:31.775
<v Speaker 1>Jiku is your friend.

00:42:32.575 --> 00:42:33.455
<v Speaker 0>It is.

00:42:34.255 --> 00:42:35.695
<v Speaker 0>So we got

00:42:36.495 --> 00:42:38.335
<v Speaker 0>the genre match. Now do we have a

00:42:38.335 --> 00:42:40.895
<v Speaker 0>thrill? Yeah. And thrill and the overview. Works

00:42:40.895 --> 00:42:42.975
<v Speaker 0>exactly like we thought it was gonna work.

00:42:43.375 --> 00:42:45.135
<v Speaker 0>That's

00:42:45.135 --> 00:42:47.030
<v Speaker 0>really cool. I mean I've got to say

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:49.350
<v Speaker 0>even though we can just throw together some

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:50.630
<v Speaker 0>really trampled

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:53.430
<v Speaker 0>trivial JSON and apply it to change the

00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:55.270
<v Speaker 0>way the software works. I'm always really happy.

00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:56.950
<v Speaker 0>Like I don't have to dig around and

00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:57.910
<v Speaker 0>work stuff out.

00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:59.350
<v Speaker 0>Think the

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:02.335
<v Speaker 0>u UX, DX, the intuitive works rather than

00:43:02.335 --> 00:43:05.775
<v Speaker 0>having to have preexisting knowledge always amazes me.

00:43:05.775 --> 00:43:06.815
<v Speaker 0>I think that's great.

00:43:07.214 --> 00:43:08.575
<v Speaker 1>That that's one of the goal we have

00:43:08.575 --> 00:43:10.415
<v Speaker 1>when, you know, we build a platform

00:43:11.454 --> 00:43:13.859
<v Speaker 1>to as you saw, like to work out,

00:43:13.859 --> 00:43:15.220
<v Speaker 1>like, out of the box.

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:17.299
<v Speaker 1>So you don't need to change your setting.

00:43:17.299 --> 00:43:19.700
<v Speaker 1>Obviously, you probably want to at some point

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:22.100
<v Speaker 1>to, like, get better results to your users,

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:23.859
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have to. And you can

00:43:23.859 --> 00:43:25.859
<v Speaker 1>already try it and and and see how

00:43:25.859 --> 00:43:26.900
<v Speaker 1>it's worked really easily.

00:43:27.435 --> 00:43:29.675
<v Speaker 1>So, you know, there's something like, there are

00:43:29.675 --> 00:43:30.155
<v Speaker 1>some some

00:43:30.875 --> 00:43:32.955
<v Speaker 1>what's what's the word in English? Like, is

00:43:33.595 --> 00:43:35.355
<v Speaker 1>snobbish snobbish

00:43:35.355 --> 00:43:37.515
<v Speaker 1>a word in English? Or some some, let's

00:43:37.515 --> 00:43:38.555
<v Speaker 1>say, pretentious

00:43:38.555 --> 00:43:40.715
<v Speaker 1>people that are like, hey. You know, software

00:43:40.715 --> 00:43:43.059
<v Speaker 1>should be complicated to be powerful.

00:43:43.059 --> 00:43:45.780
<v Speaker 1>And I I'm, like, I'm totally like, after

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:48.020
<v Speaker 1>all these years of software development on my

00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:50.660
<v Speaker 1>side, I'm like, no. Like, the simpler you

00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:52.420
<v Speaker 1>make it, the better it is for the

00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:54.740
<v Speaker 1>users. Even if users are developer and they

00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:57.220
<v Speaker 1>know how to use those tools, but

00:43:57.535 --> 00:43:59.535
<v Speaker 1>be sure that they can configure it. Like

00:43:59.695 --> 00:44:02.255
<v Speaker 1>and they can do, like, more sophisticated

00:44:02.255 --> 00:44:04.975
<v Speaker 1>or more complicated things. But, you know, when

00:44:04.975 --> 00:44:06.815
<v Speaker 1>you look at Meilisearch, it it seems like,

00:44:06.815 --> 00:44:09.695
<v Speaker 1>yeah, it's it's simple. Like, it's there's no

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.680
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot of much work done.

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:13.920
<v Speaker 1>And but believe me, there's a lot of

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.760
<v Speaker 1>work behind the scene to make it that

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:17.280
<v Speaker 1>easy. But I I think it's one of

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:20.000
<v Speaker 1>the strong point of of using Meilisearch too.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.280
<v Speaker 1>Like, you don't need to be an expert.

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:23.440
<v Speaker 1>Like, if you know how to do HTTP

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:26.005
<v Speaker 1>requests and and use a framework

00:44:26.085 --> 00:44:26.805
<v Speaker 1>or

00:44:27.125 --> 00:44:29.685
<v Speaker 1>like just use Carol even to test it,

00:44:29.685 --> 00:44:31.525
<v Speaker 1>like you know how to use the software.

00:44:32.405 --> 00:44:35.205
<v Speaker 0>Cool. Awesome. And you are right. Snobbish or

00:44:35.205 --> 00:44:38.660
<v Speaker 0>snobby is another perfectly term Okay. Pretentious. Awesome.

00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:40.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Because English English is not my first

00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:43.299
<v Speaker 1>language too, so sometimes I speak French and

00:44:43.299 --> 00:44:46.260
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I use French word and I say

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:48.100
<v Speaker 1>them with English accent

00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:49.940
<v Speaker 1>hoping that it's a real word.

00:44:51.755 --> 00:44:52.395
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:44:52.955 --> 00:44:55.195
<v Speaker 0>I I speak Scots English, but I do

00:44:55.195 --> 00:44:56.875
<v Speaker 0>my best not to inflict the Scottish on

00:44:56.875 --> 00:44:57.755
<v Speaker 0>people. So

00:44:58.395 --> 00:45:00.075
<v Speaker 0>it gets me into You have you have

00:45:00.075 --> 00:45:01.835
<v Speaker 1>no accent, by the way. I was I

00:45:01.835 --> 00:45:03.115
<v Speaker 1>was expecting like a

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:05.400
<v Speaker 1>strong Scottish accent.

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:06.840
<v Speaker 0>No. No. No. I keep that for the

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:07.480
<v Speaker 0>weekend.

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:08.200
<v Speaker 0>But

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.920
<v Speaker 0>I've got my my work voice that just

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.360
<v Speaker 0>it keeps things easier.

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:15.800
<v Speaker 0>Anyway,

00:45:17.085 --> 00:45:17.645
<v Speaker 0>cool.

00:45:18.045 --> 00:45:19.724
<v Speaker 0>Let's do a couple more things and then

00:45:19.724 --> 00:45:21.724
<v Speaker 0>I'll let us get back to our our

00:45:21.724 --> 00:45:22.445
<v Speaker 0>days.

00:45:23.805 --> 00:45:25.645
<v Speaker 0>One of the things I'm thinking of here

00:45:25.805 --> 00:45:27.885
<v Speaker 0>is we have the genres.

00:45:27.885 --> 00:45:29.805
<v Speaker 0>Right? Let me search for

00:45:30.285 --> 00:45:32.845
<v Speaker 0>yeah. Science fiction. Do we also have

00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:34.520
<v Speaker 0>push the wrong button.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000
<v Speaker 0>I'm not very good with computers. There we

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.120
<v Speaker 0>go. We

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:41.720
<v Speaker 0>don't have sci fi like now maybe I'm

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:44.120
<v Speaker 0>pushing something that's not gonna work here, but

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:44.920
<v Speaker 0>I'm thinking

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:47.080
<v Speaker 0>do we have synonym support

00:45:48.395 --> 00:45:50.955
<v Speaker 0>for faceted search as well?

00:45:54.954 --> 00:45:55.995
<v Speaker 2>No. Maybe.

00:45:57.195 --> 00:45:58.395
<v Speaker 0>No. We're not sure.

00:45:58.795 --> 00:46:00.875
<v Speaker 1>Actually, I have no idea to be honest.

00:46:01.595 --> 00:46:03.230
<v Speaker 0>Shall we try and see what happens?

00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:04.270
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

00:46:04.829 --> 00:46:08.109
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Let's break things. Alright. So I'm gonna

00:46:08.109 --> 00:46:10.349
<v Speaker 0>use your search is really good on this,

00:46:10.349 --> 00:46:12.270
<v Speaker 0>I've got to tell you. I'm gonna add

00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:13.390
<v Speaker 0>this to my blog,

00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:15.230
<v Speaker 0>which has got three articles in it over

00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:16.190
<v Speaker 0>ten years, but still.

00:46:18.165 --> 00:46:19.845
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we can add

00:46:20.005 --> 00:46:22.565
<v Speaker 0>synonym. Where's my car request? I'm sure it's

00:46:22.565 --> 00:46:24.565
<v Speaker 0>in oh, it's not in here. Oh, let's

00:46:24.565 --> 00:46:25.525
<v Speaker 0>try another page.

00:46:25.765 --> 00:46:27.685
<v Speaker 0>Setting

00:46:27.685 --> 00:46:28.645
<v Speaker 0>synonyms.

00:46:28.965 --> 00:46:30.085
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

00:46:30.485 --> 00:46:32.005
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'm gonna try and add a synonym

00:46:32.005 --> 00:46:33.605
<v Speaker 0>for science fiction to sci fi.

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.360
<v Speaker 0>Hey John.

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:39.240
<v Speaker 0>I mean I appreciate the vote of confidence

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:41.720
<v Speaker 0>but I'm definitely winging it. So

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:43.880
<v Speaker 0>okay.

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:46.360
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:48.935
<v Speaker 0>And I don't wanna add a sweater jumper,

00:46:48.935 --> 00:46:50.775
<v Speaker 0>but I do appreciate that example.

00:46:51.575 --> 00:46:54.135
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna add science fiction

00:46:55.415 --> 00:46:56.935
<v Speaker 0>and we'll add

00:46:57.095 --> 00:46:58.295
<v Speaker 0>sci fi

00:46:59.015 --> 00:47:00.375
<v Speaker 0>sci fi

00:47:00.855 --> 00:47:03.890
<v Speaker 0>and sci fi, the weird TV version two.

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:07.810
<v Speaker 0>That look okay?

00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:09.890
<v Speaker 1>So

00:47:10.369 --> 00:47:12.609
<v Speaker 1>yeah. Look good. And now I just need

00:47:12.609 --> 00:47:14.369
<v Speaker 0>to make sure I update the rate

00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:17.145
<v Speaker 0>and then Yes. I was going to save

00:47:17.145 --> 00:47:18.425
<v Speaker 2>it. Oh, sorry.

00:47:18.825 --> 00:47:19.385
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:47:19.865 --> 00:47:21.865
<v Speaker 0>We've got we're getting loads of waves today.

00:47:21.865 --> 00:47:24.025
<v Speaker 0>Hi, Thomas. We're getting away from Thomas too.

00:47:24.425 --> 00:47:25.145
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:47:25.545 --> 00:47:26.025
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

00:47:26.905 --> 00:47:29.130
<v Speaker 1>so Thomas is my boss. And the other

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:31.530
<v Speaker 1>Tommy, I I I checked with him, and

00:47:31.530 --> 00:47:33.770
<v Speaker 1>he is he is the tech driver, the

00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:36.010
<v Speaker 1>to me. And I I was just been

00:47:36.010 --> 00:47:39.049
<v Speaker 1>told that it won't work, but let's try

00:47:39.049 --> 00:47:39.609
<v Speaker 1>it.

00:47:40.809 --> 00:47:43.210
<v Speaker 0>Oh, well. Let's let's try it. That's fine.

00:47:43.895 --> 00:47:46.135
<v Speaker 0>Alright, well we got our update ID, I

00:47:46.135 --> 00:47:48.214
<v Speaker 0>won't bother looking that up. I'm gonna

00:47:49.175 --> 00:47:51.815
<v Speaker 0>okay, here's a question. I have this movies.JSON

00:47:51.815 --> 00:47:54.055
<v Speaker 0>that we've been working with. If I were

00:47:54.055 --> 00:47:55.415
<v Speaker 0>to then

00:47:57.415 --> 00:47:58.694
<v Speaker 0>change

00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:03.470
<v Speaker 0>this sci fi and then reapply that document

00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:04.830
<v Speaker 0>over the top. Am I gonna end up

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:07.790
<v Speaker 0>with two copies of Captain Marvel or will

00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:09.630
<v Speaker 0>it know and update that record?

00:48:11.535 --> 00:48:13.295
<v Speaker 1>If if you keep the if you keep

00:48:13.295 --> 00:48:14.415
<v Speaker 1>the same Heidi,

00:48:14.655 --> 00:48:15.935
<v Speaker 1>that's gonna be replaced.

00:48:16.255 --> 00:48:19.295
<v Speaker 0>Yes. Alright. And I'm gonna change this to

00:48:19.535 --> 00:48:21.775
<v Speaker 0>the weird sci fi. Okay.

00:48:22.895 --> 00:48:25.055
<v Speaker 0>We're getting away from Sangam too. Hey man,

00:48:25.055 --> 00:48:25.900
<v Speaker 0>how's it going?

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:29.500
<v Speaker 0>Sangam. People are chatting today. It's nice.

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:32.060
<v Speaker 0>Obviously everyone's here to learn about Meilisearch.

00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:36.300
<v Speaker 0>I forgot what I was doing so we

00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:37.020
<v Speaker 0>should just chat.

00:48:38.475 --> 00:48:40.475
<v Speaker 0>Oh the movies, there we go. Yeah.

00:48:41.195 --> 00:48:41.595
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:48:42.075 --> 00:48:42.795
<v Speaker 0>The song.

00:48:44.395 --> 00:48:45.275
<v Speaker 0>It

00:48:45.915 --> 00:48:48.155
<v Speaker 0>was this one, the post request to index

00:48:48.155 --> 00:48:51.515
<v Speaker 0>movies documents pass that to JSON

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:53.400
<v Speaker 0>and that I'm assuming that maybe it's updating

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:55.080
<v Speaker 0>in the background so we can do the

00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:55.800
<v Speaker 0>update

00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:59.320
<v Speaker 0>for and we also have a question that

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:00.680
<v Speaker 0>we can tackle too.

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:04.040
<v Speaker 0>John asks does this run on stable rust

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:05.080
<v Speaker 0>or nightly rust?

00:49:06.425 --> 00:49:09.305
<v Speaker 1>Stable. Stable, awesome. Even better.

00:49:09.465 --> 00:49:10.105
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:49:12.984 --> 00:49:14.905
<v Speaker 0>Moment of truth. The thing that we already

00:49:14.905 --> 00:49:16.585
<v Speaker 0>been told isn't gonna work but I'm gonna

00:49:16.585 --> 00:49:16.905
<v Speaker 0>try and

00:49:21.145 --> 00:49:23.210
<v Speaker 0>The actual channel showed up. Well,

00:49:26.569 --> 00:49:29.210
<v Speaker 0>that was a nice idea. So the synonyms

00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:31.690
<v Speaker 0>work within the text search but not on

00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:34.890
<v Speaker 0>the faceted level. And I guess that's probably

00:49:34.305 --> 00:49:36.625
<v Speaker 0>be expected you you suspected that as well.

00:49:37.105 --> 00:49:38.945
<v Speaker 1>But you know you know what, David?

00:49:39.345 --> 00:49:41.345
<v Speaker 1>If you really want this to be added

00:49:41.345 --> 00:49:42.385
<v Speaker 1>to Meilisearch,

00:49:42.385 --> 00:49:44.704
<v Speaker 1>I would suggest you to either do a

00:49:44.704 --> 00:49:45.425
<v Speaker 1>PR

00:49:45.505 --> 00:49:48.385
<v Speaker 1>or, worst case, then submit an idea, create

00:49:48.385 --> 00:49:48.865
<v Speaker 1>an issue.

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:52.320
<v Speaker 0>And roadmap. Be yeah.

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:53.280
<v Speaker 1>You

00:49:53.599 --> 00:49:56.319
<v Speaker 1>know? But I I certainly see you because

00:49:56.319 --> 00:49:58.720
<v Speaker 1>you you know, Rawkode, and you like it.

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:00.559
<v Speaker 1>I I'm pretty sure you're you're you're good

00:50:00.559 --> 00:50:01.280
<v Speaker 1>to do a PR.

00:50:01.905 --> 00:50:03.505
<v Speaker 0>Oh yeah. Definitely.

00:50:04.625 --> 00:50:06.865
<v Speaker 0>I just feel pop out for five minutes.

00:50:07.345 --> 00:50:07.985
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:50:08.145 --> 00:50:10.065
<v Speaker 0>I I I would definitely love to explore

00:50:10.065 --> 00:50:11.265
<v Speaker 0>the code base. I think I I will

00:50:11.265 --> 00:50:12.625
<v Speaker 0>be doing that at some point.

00:50:13.025 --> 00:50:13.585
<v Speaker 0>But

00:50:14.065 --> 00:50:15.825
<v Speaker 0>knows that I'm even thinking about our lives

00:50:15.825 --> 00:50:17.745
<v Speaker 0>like would we want synonyms on a facet?

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:20.080
<v Speaker 0>I'm not entirely sure maybe, but

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:23.600
<v Speaker 0>I'll think about it. Okay.

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:28.480
<v Speaker 0>All right, let's try and cover one more

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:30.465
<v Speaker 0>thing before we finish up for today then.

00:50:30.465 --> 00:50:33.105
<v Speaker 0>Is there anything that either of you have

00:50:33.185 --> 00:50:35.425
<v Speaker 0>you're particularly partial to that you'd like to

00:50:35.425 --> 00:50:37.345
<v Speaker 0>show off or should I just pick something

00:50:37.345 --> 00:50:39.665
<v Speaker 0>at random again at my random head?

00:50:40.945 --> 00:50:42.625
<v Speaker 0>Tell me you have something.

00:50:42.705 --> 00:50:44.545
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Go where I'm done. Let let's have

00:50:44.545 --> 00:50:44.705
<v Speaker 1>fun.

00:50:45.609 --> 00:50:46.810
<v Speaker 2>Yes. Alright.

00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:49.210
<v Speaker 0>So

00:50:49.930 --> 00:50:52.250
<v Speaker 0>what's a distinct attribute?

00:50:52.330 --> 00:50:53.210
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

00:50:55.369 --> 00:50:56.330
<v Speaker 1>Like,

00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:58.570
<v Speaker 1>oh, you should have Susan down or, oh,

00:50:58.570 --> 00:50:59.609
<v Speaker 1>that's gonna be interesting.

00:51:00.174 --> 00:51:03.295
<v Speaker 2>Oh, it's interesting, but you can

00:51:03.615 --> 00:51:06.415
<v Speaker 2>showcase that with the this dataset.

00:51:06.734 --> 00:51:08.494
<v Speaker 2>It's just like for

00:51:08.815 --> 00:51:10.095
<v Speaker 2>when you have the

00:51:11.375 --> 00:51:12.655
<v Speaker 2>a document with

00:51:13.375 --> 00:51:15.930
<v Speaker 2>for instance, it's more for ecommerce.

00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:18.730
<v Speaker 2>Like, you have a jacket. It's the same

00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:20.970
<v Speaker 2>jacket, and you have in white and in

00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:23.770
<v Speaker 2>black. And you want when you search for

00:51:23.770 --> 00:51:25.690
<v Speaker 2>that jacket, you want just one

00:51:27.355 --> 00:51:28.795
<v Speaker 2>document to be

00:51:31.275 --> 00:51:31.995
<v Speaker 2>returned.

00:51:33.755 --> 00:51:35.195
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Do you understand?

00:51:35.595 --> 00:51:37.675
<v Speaker 2>You don't I think that I think that

00:51:37.675 --> 00:51:40.360
<v Speaker 0>makes sense. Yeah. So if I've got, like,

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:41.240
<v Speaker 0>assume

00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:43.480
<v Speaker 0>say we had in our database, I don't

00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:44.680
<v Speaker 0>know why we would have this, but I'm

00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:46.040
<v Speaker 0>gonna try and stick to the movies example

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:49.400
<v Speaker 0>anyway. Like if we had different variations of

00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:51.320
<v Speaker 0>each movie for the format it was released

00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:54.359
<v Speaker 0>like you know VHS, DVD, Blu ray, we'd

00:51:54.359 --> 00:51:56.875
<v Speaker 0>maybe use a distinct attribute there that when

00:51:56.875 --> 00:51:58.474
<v Speaker 0>I search for the metrics, you don't return

00:51:58.474 --> 00:52:00.315
<v Speaker 0>four of them. You just say, you know,

00:52:00.315 --> 00:52:02.395
<v Speaker 0>there's one and then there's other variations of

00:52:02.395 --> 00:52:03.915
<v Speaker 0>it. Does that make is that right?

00:52:04.234 --> 00:52:05.035
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

00:52:05.275 --> 00:52:07.595
<v Speaker 1>You you can see, like, if you scroll

00:52:07.595 --> 00:52:08.795
<v Speaker 1>up just a little bit, you can see

00:52:08.795 --> 00:52:10.875
<v Speaker 1>the example, like, you have a JSON where,

00:52:10.875 --> 00:52:12.660
<v Speaker 1>like, it's the two same product. But in

00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:14.260
<v Speaker 1>that case, as capital said,

00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:16.980
<v Speaker 1>the only difference is the color. So we're

00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:18.900
<v Speaker 1>gonna say, like, if you set up the

00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:20.500
<v Speaker 1>distinct attribute being,

00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:22.900
<v Speaker 1>like, product ID right after you have, like,

00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:23.619
<v Speaker 1>that curl

00:52:25.015 --> 00:52:27.175
<v Speaker 1>curl, like, code, if you scroll down just

00:52:27.175 --> 00:52:27.895
<v Speaker 1>a little bit,

00:52:28.375 --> 00:52:30.775
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna set up, like, distinct attributes of

00:52:30.775 --> 00:52:33.255
<v Speaker 1>product ID because this is, like, what's gonna

00:52:33.255 --> 00:52:35.575
<v Speaker 1>be distinct between those two product when you're

00:52:35.575 --> 00:52:37.895
<v Speaker 1>gonna search for it. You're just gonna get,

00:52:37.895 --> 00:52:39.575
<v Speaker 1>like, the letter jacket.

00:52:41.789 --> 00:52:43.710
<v Speaker 0>Okay. And what would the search result look

00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:46.029
<v Speaker 0>like on that? Like I'm getting one back,

00:52:46.029 --> 00:52:47.630
<v Speaker 0>does it give me any indication of which

00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:51.310
<v Speaker 0>variations exist? Are they omitted from the the

00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:53.555
<v Speaker 0>results or does it just pick the one

00:52:53.555 --> 00:52:55.075
<v Speaker 0>that it finds and return that?

00:52:57.395 --> 00:52:59.395
<v Speaker 2>We don't have an example on that. We

00:52:59.395 --> 00:53:00.035
<v Speaker 2>should.

00:53:00.675 --> 00:53:01.475
<v Speaker 2>PR

00:53:01.635 --> 00:53:02.355
<v Speaker 2>issue.

00:53:03.875 --> 00:53:06.770
<v Speaker 0>Well, let's find out. Okay. Let's find out.

00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:08.530
<v Speaker 0>Hold on. Let's see. What's our first movie?

00:53:08.530 --> 00:53:10.930
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna copy and paste Shazam and

00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:13.570
<v Speaker 0>then we can use the I is the

00:53:13.570 --> 00:53:15.890
<v Speaker 0>ID a Meilisearch special thing or is that

00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:17.490
<v Speaker 0>just part of the dataset ID?

00:53:19.005 --> 00:53:20.445
<v Speaker 2>You need the ID.

00:53:21.805 --> 00:53:24.445
<v Speaker 2>Each document must have a unique identifier.

00:53:25.244 --> 00:53:27.885
<v Speaker 2>Alright. So for the link, you should choose

00:53:27.885 --> 00:53:29.085
<v Speaker 2>another one

00:53:29.325 --> 00:53:30.045
<v Speaker 2>because

00:53:30.765 --> 00:53:33.400
<v Speaker 2>you can't have the Okay. The same. I'm

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:36.120
<v Speaker 0>gonna apply this dataset over the top and

00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:37.800
<v Speaker 0>we'll see that there's also a Shazam, which

00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:39.560
<v Speaker 0>is an action and there's one that's a

00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:41.720
<v Speaker 0>fantasy because, you know, this is contrived, so

00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:43.000
<v Speaker 0>I'm just gonna make this work.

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:45.240
<v Speaker 0>We now have two Shazams with different IDs

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:47.960
<v Speaker 0>and then I'm gonna apply a distinct setting

00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:49.685
<v Speaker 0>update to this index

00:53:49.685 --> 00:53:51.285
<v Speaker 0>to do title,

00:53:51.605 --> 00:53:53.045
<v Speaker 0>and then we'll see what happens.

00:53:57.845 --> 00:53:59.285
<v Speaker 1>And, you know, just looking back to the

00:53:59.285 --> 00:54:00.005
<v Speaker 1>ID,

00:54:00.725 --> 00:54:04.005
<v Speaker 1>by default, Meilisearch will use as your,

00:54:04.165 --> 00:54:06.170
<v Speaker 1>like, document unique ID,

00:54:06.490 --> 00:54:07.210
<v Speaker 1>any,

00:54:07.369 --> 00:54:08.650
<v Speaker 1>like, the first,

00:54:09.289 --> 00:54:12.329
<v Speaker 1>attribute that's gonna have the word ID or,

00:54:12.329 --> 00:54:14.490
<v Speaker 1>like, the the choose label ID.

00:54:14.490 --> 00:54:16.970
<v Speaker 1>No matter if it's, like, UID or, like,

00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:18.490
<v Speaker 1>this is my ID

00:54:18.490 --> 00:54:19.985
<v Speaker 1>or it's also non

00:54:21.105 --> 00:54:23.665
<v Speaker 1>case sensitive. It's non case sensitive, but you

00:54:23.665 --> 00:54:24.945
<v Speaker 1>can also define

00:54:25.265 --> 00:54:26.625
<v Speaker 1>what's gonna be your

00:54:26.785 --> 00:54:29.265
<v Speaker 1>your unique ID if you want to.

00:54:31.345 --> 00:54:33.585
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Cool. So I can if I want

00:54:33.585 --> 00:54:35.000
<v Speaker 0>to, I can say use something else as

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:35.960
<v Speaker 0>a unique attribute.

00:54:37.559 --> 00:54:39.880
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, we're now in a situation where

00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:43.400
<v Speaker 0>I'm pretty sure I've applied a distinct attribute.

00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:45.640
<v Speaker 0>In fact, I'm really curious now to see

00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:46.920
<v Speaker 0>what our

00:54:48.119 --> 00:54:50.015
<v Speaker 0>if I just pull out these settings now

00:54:50.015 --> 00:54:52.015
<v Speaker 0>and take a look at what we're what

00:54:52.015 --> 00:54:52.735
<v Speaker 0>we have.

00:54:53.055 --> 00:54:54.975
<v Speaker 0>I'll change this to get request.

00:54:58.255 --> 00:55:00.975
<v Speaker 0>So we we set our attributes for faceting,

00:55:00.975 --> 00:55:02.175
<v Speaker 0>we added some synonyms,

00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:04.700
<v Speaker 0>we got our searchable stuff and we have

00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:07.180
<v Speaker 0>our distinct attributes set now. Okay. So

00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:09.660
<v Speaker 0>in theory, if I

00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:11.420
<v Speaker 0>Well I should be able to see this

00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:12.619
<v Speaker 0>through the web interface, right?

00:55:15.035 --> 00:55:16.555
<v Speaker 0>Shazam.

00:55:18.315 --> 00:55:19.675
<v Speaker 0>I only got one.

00:55:20.715 --> 00:55:22.075
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So at least I guess just picked

00:55:22.075 --> 00:55:23.835
<v Speaker 0>one of them and returned it.

00:55:24.235 --> 00:55:25.355
<v Speaker 0>But I guess we could always

00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:28.120
<v Speaker 0>confirm that.

00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:30.200
<v Speaker 2>Yes. It's

00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:34.200
<v Speaker 1>it's the case. It's gonna return only the

00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:35.000
<v Speaker 1>first one.

00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:40.575
<v Speaker 1>That that's like with the example capital set

00:55:40.575 --> 00:55:42.735
<v Speaker 1>in ecommerce, it's probably because you want you

00:55:42.735 --> 00:55:44.335
<v Speaker 1>know, when you go into Amazon and you

00:55:44.335 --> 00:55:46.655
<v Speaker 1>have, like, different size of the bottle, like,

00:55:46.655 --> 00:55:48.095
<v Speaker 1>you just return one bottle. And when you

00:55:48.095 --> 00:55:49.535
<v Speaker 1>click on it, now you get, like, all

00:55:49.535 --> 00:55:52.100
<v Speaker 1>the information in your product. So I assume

00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:54.420
<v Speaker 1>it's for those kind of use cases.

00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:58.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure where when you would like

00:55:58.340 --> 00:55:59.300
<v Speaker 1>to use

00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:01.220
<v Speaker 1>that setting

00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:03.860
<v Speaker 1>not in that type of scenario.

00:56:06.045 --> 00:56:07.885
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That makes sense, I guess.

00:56:08.605 --> 00:56:10.685
<v Speaker 0>I'll I'll I'll stop trying to do weird

00:56:10.685 --> 00:56:12.365
<v Speaker 0>and random things there. I promise.

00:56:13.085 --> 00:56:15.484
<v Speaker 1>No. Actually, it's no. It's fine. It's it's

00:56:15.484 --> 00:56:17.005
<v Speaker 1>it's what I love. And it it's also

00:56:17.005 --> 00:56:19.085
<v Speaker 1>why I'm happy Carol is there because she's

00:56:19.085 --> 00:56:20.960
<v Speaker 1>way more brilliant than me. So.

00:56:22.799 --> 00:56:24.480
<v Speaker 0>Alright, well why don't I see.

00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:27.200
<v Speaker 0>So anyone that's watching, please feel free if

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:28.720
<v Speaker 0>you've got any questions drop them into the

00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:29.359
<v Speaker 0>YouTube.

00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:31.440
<v Speaker 0>We're gonna be finishing shortly, so we'll handle

00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:33.200
<v Speaker 0>any questions we can before we do.

00:56:33.599 --> 00:56:35.234
<v Speaker 0>Why don't we talk a little bit about

00:56:35.234 --> 00:56:37.954
<v Speaker 0>the operational side then of Meilisearch? I think

00:56:37.954 --> 00:56:40.674
<v Speaker 0>we've covered a really good what it is,

00:56:40.674 --> 00:56:42.595
<v Speaker 0>what it does, know, we'll kick the tires

00:56:42.595 --> 00:56:43.875
<v Speaker 0>on a few of these settings, we'll work

00:56:43.875 --> 00:56:46.275
<v Speaker 0>with the API, everything really just does what

00:56:46.275 --> 00:56:48.220
<v Speaker 0>I expect which I think is fantastic.

00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:50.140
<v Speaker 0>You know, now I'm

00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:51.580
<v Speaker 0>at the stage where I'm like, okay, I

00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:53.020
<v Speaker 0>played with it, I kicked it, I like

00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:55.500
<v Speaker 0>it, I wanna ship it into production. Like

00:56:57.340 --> 00:57:00.060
<v Speaker 0>I just, let's assume I'm thrown onto Kubernetes

00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:01.740
<v Speaker 0>with that helm chart and it does its

00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:03.260
<v Speaker 0>thing. What about

00:57:03.744 --> 00:57:04.545
<v Speaker 0>backup

00:57:04.545 --> 00:57:05.665
<v Speaker 0>and restore?

00:57:05.665 --> 00:57:07.505
<v Speaker 0>Is that something that's relatively easy to put

00:57:07.505 --> 00:57:09.345
<v Speaker 0>together if something were to go wrong?

00:57:11.265 --> 00:57:13.984
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Can you repeat please because I didn't

00:57:13.984 --> 00:57:14.545
<v Speaker 2>understand

00:57:15.025 --> 00:57:17.710
<v Speaker 2>you. Yeah. So now I've got Meilisearch and

00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:20.349
<v Speaker 0>production, and I'm curious. Like, I wanna be

00:57:20.349 --> 00:57:22.670
<v Speaker 0>able to build out backup and restore processes.

00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:24.269
<v Speaker 0>So what would that look like to make

00:57:24.269 --> 00:57:25.710
<v Speaker 0>sure that I never lose data?

00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:28.910
<v Speaker 1>You can you can search for snapshots

00:57:28.910 --> 00:57:29.710
<v Speaker 1>or dump.

00:57:30.105 --> 00:57:31.785
<v Speaker 1>Dump. There's two way to

00:57:32.825 --> 00:57:35.385
<v Speaker 1>to to kind of, like, get your data.

00:57:39.065 --> 00:57:42.025
<v Speaker 1>So creating a creating a dump will oh,

00:57:42.025 --> 00:57:43.970
<v Speaker 1>do you want to go, Kettle? No. It's

00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:45.490
<v Speaker 2>just a dump is

00:57:45.809 --> 00:57:46.450
<v Speaker 2>now

00:57:49.010 --> 00:57:52.210
<v Speaker 2>the database is not compatible between versions,

00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:53.970
<v Speaker 2>but when you create a dump,

00:57:55.185 --> 00:57:56.145
<v Speaker 2>you can

00:57:56.545 --> 00:57:59.505
<v Speaker 2>change from versions without problems.

00:57:59.505 --> 00:58:01.265
<v Speaker 2>But and snapshots

00:58:01.265 --> 00:58:03.345
<v Speaker 2>are you have to use the same version

00:58:03.345 --> 00:58:04.065
<v Speaker 2>for now.

00:58:05.105 --> 00:58:07.599
<v Speaker 0>So I'm gonna Yeah. So throw out my

00:58:07.599 --> 00:58:09.599
<v Speaker 0>naive understanding of that. Please feel free to

00:58:09.599 --> 00:58:10.560
<v Speaker 0>go. Oh, please go.

00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:12.720
<v Speaker 0>When you when you talk about dumps, I'm

00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:14.880
<v Speaker 0>assuming that I'm actually just getting the JSON

00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:16.960
<v Speaker 0>representation of all the objects which can be

00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:19.200
<v Speaker 0>imported to whatever and the index and is

00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:21.945
<v Speaker 0>performed again when I import it. I'm assuming

00:58:21.945 --> 00:58:24.185
<v Speaker 0>the snapshot is actually like a

00:58:24.585 --> 00:58:26.185
<v Speaker 0>database representation

00:58:26.185 --> 00:58:27.785
<v Speaker 0>of all of those documents that can be

00:58:27.785 --> 00:58:30.665
<v Speaker 0>migrated to another copy of that database.

00:58:31.945 --> 00:58:32.905
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Yep.

00:58:33.225 --> 00:58:36.470
<v Speaker 1>Exactly. Exactly. And right now for people that

00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:38.869
<v Speaker 1>are listening, we suggest that when you move

00:58:38.869 --> 00:58:41.190
<v Speaker 1>from one version to the next version of

00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Meilisearch right now, you probably want to use

00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:44.950
<v Speaker 1>the dumps because

00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:47.589
<v Speaker 1>we're not at v one, so we are

00:58:47.589 --> 00:58:49.349
<v Speaker 1>still making some breaking changes.

00:58:50.075 --> 00:58:52.075
<v Speaker 1>So it's probably the easiest way to go

00:58:52.075 --> 00:58:53.355
<v Speaker 1>if you want to be sure you're gonna

00:58:53.355 --> 00:58:54.555
<v Speaker 1>retrieve your data.

00:58:55.194 --> 00:58:57.755
<v Speaker 1>Starting from v one, we're gonna be really

00:58:57.755 --> 00:59:00.234
<v Speaker 1>careful when we're gonna introduce new breaking changes.

00:59:00.234 --> 00:59:02.234
<v Speaker 1>But right now, we're still concerned that's, like,

00:59:02.234 --> 00:59:04.660
<v Speaker 1>we we like, there's still a lot of

00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:06.340
<v Speaker 1>good things to do with the product.

00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:07.060
<v Speaker 1>So

00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:09.700
<v Speaker 1>we're we're not totally good citizen when it

00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:11.460
<v Speaker 1>comes to breaking change right now.

00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:13.700
<v Speaker 0>Is

00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:15.700
<v Speaker 0>Meilisearch embeddable

00:59:15.935 --> 00:59:17.855
<v Speaker 0>or is only can I only run it

00:59:17.855 --> 00:59:19.775
<v Speaker 0>as its own binary? Do we know?

00:59:22.494 --> 00:59:24.975
<v Speaker 1>Say that again, sorry. Can I embed

00:59:25.215 --> 00:59:27.455
<v Speaker 0>like as exposed as like a rust crate

00:59:27.455 --> 00:59:29.455
<v Speaker 0>that I can embed into my own

00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:31.920
<v Speaker 0>and not have to operate, like, run it

00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:34.080
<v Speaker 0>separately or is it always expected to be

00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:35.680
<v Speaker 0>run as its own process?

00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:39.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so. I think I took

00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:41.680
<v Speaker 1>suspected that you run it

00:59:42.325 --> 00:59:44.245
<v Speaker 1>as an external application.

00:59:44.245 --> 00:59:45.685
<v Speaker 1>So as a service

00:59:47.365 --> 00:59:48.725
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question, actually.

00:59:49.445 --> 00:59:51.365
<v Speaker 1>And and to be honest, I have no

00:59:51.365 --> 00:59:54.005
<v Speaker 1>idea because I don't know Rust at all.

00:59:54.645 --> 00:59:56.645
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I can get the answer before the

00:59:56.645 --> 00:59:57.605
<v Speaker 1>end of the

00:59:59.530 --> 01:00:01.770
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, we have a couple of questions

01:00:01.770 --> 01:00:04.329
<v Speaker 0>from John in the audience. So let's throw

01:00:04.329 --> 01:00:07.050
<v Speaker 0>them out just now. His first question is,

01:00:08.010 --> 01:00:10.970
<v Speaker 0>does Meilisearch or does Meilis mean anything?

01:00:12.315 --> 01:00:13.195
<v Speaker 2>Yes.

01:00:14.075 --> 01:00:15.515
<v Speaker 2>It's

01:00:15.515 --> 01:00:16.235
<v Speaker 2>the

01:00:16.315 --> 01:00:18.795
<v Speaker 2>Nordic god of oblivion

01:00:18.795 --> 01:00:20.715
<v Speaker 2>according to an historian.

01:00:21.355 --> 01:00:21.915
<v Speaker 2>So

01:00:22.635 --> 01:00:25.670
<v Speaker 2>that's why maybe search you need

01:00:25.829 --> 01:00:29.349
<v Speaker 2>a search engine to look for the forget

01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:31.589
<v Speaker 2>the things you forgot.

01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:35.830
<v Speaker 0>Ah, nice. It is it is brilliant, though.

01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:37.595
<v Speaker 1>I was not part. You you would think

01:00:37.595 --> 01:00:39.275
<v Speaker 1>that I was part of the decision. I

01:00:39.275 --> 01:00:41.755
<v Speaker 1>was not there because it's brilliant. But, yeah,

01:00:41.755 --> 01:00:43.115
<v Speaker 1>I really like the idea. The the thing

01:00:43.115 --> 01:00:44.875
<v Speaker 1>is that what we've seen is is people

01:00:44.875 --> 01:00:48.714
<v Speaker 1>struggle to say the name sometimes. So, yeah,

01:00:48.714 --> 01:00:49.595
<v Speaker 1>that's another thing.

01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:52.210
<v Speaker 1>Just to go back to the unbendable

01:00:52.210 --> 01:00:53.890
<v Speaker 1>question I asked

01:00:54.049 --> 01:00:54.849
<v Speaker 1>Marie,

01:00:54.930 --> 01:00:57.569
<v Speaker 1>and he said, basically, no. It's not unbendable.

01:00:57.569 --> 01:00:59.730
<v Speaker 1>So I was not wrong, but it it

01:00:59.730 --> 01:01:01.970
<v Speaker 1>was just an assumption. I would like I

01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:02.849
<v Speaker 1>had no idea.

01:01:04.225 --> 01:01:06.465
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, I'm not even sure if it's a

01:01:06.465 --> 01:01:07.185
<v Speaker 0>completely

01:01:07.345 --> 01:01:09.665
<v Speaker 0>valid use case for this kind of thing,

01:01:09.665 --> 01:01:11.185
<v Speaker 0>but I guess it's always

01:01:11.985 --> 01:01:13.745
<v Speaker 0>something that I think is interesting

01:01:14.545 --> 01:01:16.545
<v Speaker 0>because databases are difficult, but

01:01:17.610 --> 01:01:19.530
<v Speaker 0>okay. Let's go back to another question from

01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:22.250
<v Speaker 0>John. He's asked, when is v one planned?

01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Good

01:01:24.330 --> 01:01:26.010
<v Speaker 1>good question. So

01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:28.250
<v Speaker 0>yeah.

01:01:28.650 --> 01:01:30.650
<v Speaker 1>Actually, I I don't even know what I

01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:33.185
<v Speaker 1>could say right now. I said we're, like,

01:01:33.185 --> 01:01:35.505
<v Speaker 1>really open with the process, but until we

01:01:35.505 --> 01:01:37.745
<v Speaker 1>we won, we kept a little some of

01:01:37.745 --> 01:01:39.425
<v Speaker 1>the stuff a little more secret.

01:01:39.745 --> 01:01:41.825
<v Speaker 1>Actually, we're in the process of hiring a

01:01:41.825 --> 01:01:44.145
<v Speaker 1>PM that will really help us to have,

01:01:44.145 --> 01:01:45.745
<v Speaker 1>like, a a better road map, and we're

01:01:45.745 --> 01:01:48.300
<v Speaker 1>gonna make that road map public. But let's

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:49.180
<v Speaker 1>say that

01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:53.660
<v Speaker 1>it should be around q three.

01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:56.460
<v Speaker 1>So we're gonna have, like, alpha and and

01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:59.100
<v Speaker 1>even alpha and beta that's gonna be available

01:01:59.100 --> 01:01:59.580
<v Speaker 1>before.

01:02:00.365 --> 01:02:03.405
<v Speaker 1>Right now, we're assuming that around q three,

01:02:03.565 --> 01:02:05.085
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna have to v one.

01:02:05.325 --> 01:02:06.924
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that people need to understand

01:02:06.924 --> 01:02:08.765
<v Speaker 1>also is that it's not because we're not

01:02:08.765 --> 01:02:10.285
<v Speaker 1>a v one that you cannot use it

01:02:10.285 --> 01:02:12.365
<v Speaker 1>in production. Like, there's we we have a

01:02:12.365 --> 01:02:12.924
<v Speaker 1>lot of, like,

01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:16.780
<v Speaker 1>let's say, customers that

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:19.180
<v Speaker 1>are using the product in production.

01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:22.060
<v Speaker 1>So it's it's working right now. It's just

01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:23.740
<v Speaker 1>that we want to be sure that we're

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.580
<v Speaker 1>gonna give and they've done better

01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:28.085
<v Speaker 1>experiments with, as an example, with the new

01:02:28.085 --> 01:02:30.165
<v Speaker 1>engine, and that we're gonna be sure that,

01:02:30.165 --> 01:02:31.285
<v Speaker 1>like, the structure

01:02:31.525 --> 01:02:34.405
<v Speaker 1>of our endpoint and everything is, like, quote,

01:02:34.405 --> 01:02:36.645
<v Speaker 1>unquote, set in stone for, like, a v

01:02:36.645 --> 01:02:39.125
<v Speaker 1>one. But, it's it's coming faster than we

01:02:39.125 --> 01:02:41.525
<v Speaker 1>think, and and, seriously, I'm really exciting

01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:43.370
<v Speaker 1>excited about that.

01:02:43.690 --> 01:02:46.250
<v Speaker 1>You know, I've I started to work the,

01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:48.250
<v Speaker 1>quote, unquote, marketing

01:02:48.250 --> 01:02:50.010
<v Speaker 1>plan, if I can say, like, what are

01:02:50.010 --> 01:02:51.370
<v Speaker 1>we gonna share on Twitter and those kind

01:02:51.370 --> 01:02:53.850
<v Speaker 1>of things. I'm like, like, I cannot wait.

01:02:53.850 --> 01:02:55.785
<v Speaker 1>Like, I'm like, I I guess the developer

01:02:55.785 --> 01:02:57.465
<v Speaker 1>find me a little bit annoying because I'm

01:02:57.465 --> 01:02:59.545
<v Speaker 1>trying to, like, move

01:02:59.945 --> 01:03:02.744
<v Speaker 1>her earlier when I'm gonna release the version.

01:03:02.744 --> 01:03:04.905
<v Speaker 1>So yeah. Because I I want people to

01:03:04.905 --> 01:03:07.020
<v Speaker 1>use it as as fast as possible. Possible.

01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:09.980
<v Speaker 1>And, like, people that may not be confident

01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:11.580
<v Speaker 1>in Meilisearch because

01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:15.020
<v Speaker 1>we don't have, like, an official stable version.

01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:17.580
<v Speaker 1>So I want to be sure that you

01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:18.940
<v Speaker 1>can use it right now, but I want

01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:20.780
<v Speaker 1>to have a v one for that exact

01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:21.180
<v Speaker 1>reasons.

01:03:22.825 --> 01:03:25.305
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I think I'll I'll just gonna summarize

01:03:25.305 --> 01:03:26.665
<v Speaker 0>that in my own little way now. So

01:03:26.665 --> 01:03:28.345
<v Speaker 0>I think it's really clear to my head,

01:03:28.345 --> 01:03:31.145
<v Speaker 0>but what you have said there is production

01:03:31.145 --> 01:03:33.305
<v Speaker 0>ready to use. People should be using it.

01:03:33.305 --> 01:03:34.905
<v Speaker 0>It's fantastic. However,

01:03:35.145 --> 01:03:36.849
<v Speaker 0>you may need to do a dump and

01:03:36.849 --> 01:03:39.890
<v Speaker 0>reimport your data because it's the underlying

01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:43.170
<v Speaker 0>database format may change before v one. Is

01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:45.170
<v Speaker 0>it safe to assume as the API is

01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:48.130
<v Speaker 0>relatively stable? Like if I start building against

01:03:48.130 --> 01:03:50.369
<v Speaker 0>them, am I gonna be okay for v

01:03:50.369 --> 01:03:50.609
<v Speaker 0>one?

01:03:51.885 --> 01:03:53.085
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Relatively.

01:03:53.085 --> 01:03:54.765
<v Speaker 1>So so yeah. Because,

01:03:54.845 --> 01:03:56.685
<v Speaker 1>again, we're kind of, like,

01:03:57.805 --> 01:03:59.485
<v Speaker 1>making us assumption

01:03:59.485 --> 01:04:00.845
<v Speaker 1>would would we're

01:04:01.085 --> 01:04:03.805
<v Speaker 1>how can I say that? We're making us

01:04:03.805 --> 01:04:06.365
<v Speaker 1>ourselves some caution when it comes to that.

01:04:06.365 --> 01:04:08.990
<v Speaker 1>So I would say I would say it's

01:04:08.990 --> 01:04:12.590
<v Speaker 1>mostly stable, but maybe things can change before

01:04:12.590 --> 01:04:14.990
<v Speaker 1>v one. But, you know, we've been running,

01:04:15.310 --> 01:04:17.950
<v Speaker 1>we've we've been duck footing and our

01:04:18.830 --> 01:04:20.270
<v Speaker 1>actually, I didn't see a lot of change

01:04:20.270 --> 01:04:21.865
<v Speaker 1>when comes to the API. So I think

01:04:21.865 --> 01:04:24.105
<v Speaker 1>we're pretty solid. I just want to, like,

01:04:24.105 --> 01:04:26.744
<v Speaker 1>put a little asterisk that's yeah. That may

01:04:26.744 --> 01:04:27.704
<v Speaker 1>change, but

01:04:28.105 --> 01:04:29.224
<v Speaker 1>no. Anyhow,

01:04:29.384 --> 01:04:30.904
<v Speaker 1>you you you get a guess of of

01:04:30.904 --> 01:04:32.345
<v Speaker 1>what I wanna say. Alright.

01:04:32.744 --> 01:04:34.585
<v Speaker 0>It sounds to me that people should be

01:04:34.585 --> 01:04:36.839
<v Speaker 0>checking that out if you need search across

01:04:36.839 --> 01:04:39.640
<v Speaker 0>any of your applications, Meilisearch is definitely ticking

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.000
<v Speaker 0>a lot of these boxes.

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:44.680
<v Speaker 0>I think we've covered a lot with really

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:46.359
<v Speaker 0>showing off the product, we've seen how it

01:04:46.359 --> 01:04:47.799
<v Speaker 0>works, we've done a few things that we

01:04:47.799 --> 01:04:50.039
<v Speaker 0>probably weren't supposed to do, but fortunately most

01:04:50.039 --> 01:04:51.695
<v Speaker 0>of it worked, so that was really cool.

01:04:52.015 --> 01:04:54.015
<v Speaker 0>Do you have any final remarks before we

01:04:54.015 --> 01:04:55.215
<v Speaker 0>finish up for today?

01:04:58.015 --> 01:05:00.015
<v Speaker 1>Mean, you know what? Like,

01:05:00.415 --> 01:05:03.535
<v Speaker 1>try it, see if it's if it's good

01:05:03.535 --> 01:05:04.975
<v Speaker 1>for you because it may not be the

01:05:04.975 --> 01:05:06.700
<v Speaker 1>software for you. But,

01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:08.620
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that we would like

01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:12.300
<v Speaker 1>your feedback, either positive or constructive feedback.

01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:15.100
<v Speaker 1>And, we have a pretty awesome community too.

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:17.740
<v Speaker 1>So, obviously, I would say, Kevin, right now,

01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:20.620
<v Speaker 1>is is answering most of the

01:05:20.205 --> 01:05:21.885
<v Speaker 1>support question we have,

01:05:22.285 --> 01:05:23.245
<v Speaker 1>but also,

01:05:23.725 --> 01:05:26.685
<v Speaker 1>in in terms of, like, the Meilisearch employee,

01:05:26.925 --> 01:05:28.845
<v Speaker 1>but we have a a awesome community. So

<v Speaker 1>and it's just nice to get a feedback

01:05:36.550 --> 01:05:38.630
<v Speaker 1>and and see where that's going.
