00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.270
<v Speaker 0>Hello.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.630
<v Speaker 0>Hello, everyone.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:31.670
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.510
<v Speaker 0>Let me share my screen, and we will

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.389
<v Speaker 0>get started.

00:04:41.135 --> 00:04:42.895
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:04:46.895 --> 00:04:47.535
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:04:48.495 --> 00:04:49.375
<v Speaker 0>So

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:51.530
<v Speaker 0>what we're gonna do today

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.370
<v Speaker 0>is I am going

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:55.770
<v Speaker 0>to do my damnedest

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.250
<v Speaker 0>to build a custom image

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.050
<v Speaker 0>for deployment to packet.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.250
<v Speaker 0>Now

00:05:04.815 --> 00:05:07.615
<v Speaker 0>if you're not familiar with what packet is,

00:05:07.775 --> 00:05:08.735
<v Speaker 0>that's fine.

00:05:09.135 --> 00:05:11.855
<v Speaker 0>We are going to quickly deploy a vanilla

00:05:11.855 --> 00:05:15.135
<v Speaker 0>server using one of the already supported distributions,

00:05:16.095 --> 00:05:17.375
<v Speaker 0>and just take a look at the flow

00:05:17.375 --> 00:05:20.415
<v Speaker 0>of how that works. And we're gonna use

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.640
<v Speaker 0>the UI today rather than any sort of

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.440
<v Speaker 0>automation

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.360
<v Speaker 0>just to keep this relatively quick so that

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.960
<v Speaker 0>we can go on to the watching me

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.120
<v Speaker 0>potentially feel miserably to build my own custom

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.760
<v Speaker 0>image.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.560
<v Speaker 0>Now

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.040
<v Speaker 0>what I'm starting with today is

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.960
<v Speaker 0>what we'd say in Scotland is heehaw.

00:05:34.845 --> 00:05:37.005
<v Speaker 0>So nothing, nada, zilch.

00:05:37.565 --> 00:05:39.405
<v Speaker 0>And we're just gonna work our way through

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:41.565
<v Speaker 0>this custom image doc

00:05:42.365 --> 00:05:45.325
<v Speaker 0>and see if we can first and

00:05:45.485 --> 00:05:47.485
<v Speaker 0>kind of take the dev in 10 image,

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.690
<v Speaker 0>make a couple of tweaks to it,

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.530
<v Speaker 0>and then push that up to get that

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.530
<v Speaker 0>up, and then try and deploy that onto

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:55.250
<v Speaker 0>packet.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.690
<v Speaker 0>And assuming that works, I wanna try something

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.770
<v Speaker 0>that's a little bit more adventurous,

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.290
<v Speaker 0>which is to actually try and add a

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:03.010
<v Speaker 0>new distribution.

00:06:04.414 --> 00:06:06.655
<v Speaker 0>I'm a kind of a an Arch Linux

00:06:06.655 --> 00:06:08.495
<v Speaker 0>fan, and I think it would be really

00:06:08.495 --> 00:06:10.175
<v Speaker 0>cool if I were able to deploy Arch

00:06:10.175 --> 00:06:12.655
<v Speaker 0>Linux onto a Packet machine.

00:06:14.974 --> 00:06:15.695
<v Speaker 0>So

00:06:16.255 --> 00:06:18.414
<v Speaker 0>let's first just start by

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.360
<v Speaker 0>kinda covering what Packet is. So Packet is

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.000
<v Speaker 0>a compute provider or a cloud provider depending

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.360
<v Speaker 0>on how you wanna look at it.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.479
<v Speaker 0>And that

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.280
<v Speaker 0>you can provision your own infrastructure,

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:33.719
<v Speaker 0>you know, one machine, 10 machines, a hundred

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:34.199
<v Speaker 0>machines,

00:06:34.745 --> 00:06:37.465
<v Speaker 0>and multiple data centers and regions around the

00:06:37.465 --> 00:06:39.785
<v Speaker 0>world so that you can deploy your application

00:06:39.785 --> 00:06:41.385
<v Speaker 0>in an elastic manner.

00:06:42.185 --> 00:06:44.585
<v Speaker 0>What's different from packet from other cloud providers

00:06:44.585 --> 00:06:46.985
<v Speaker 0>is that there is no virtualization whatsoever.

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.430
<v Speaker 0>There's a lot of really cool automation going

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.030
<v Speaker 0>on, but no virtualization.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:52.950
<v Speaker 0>And that just means that you're working with

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.870
<v Speaker 0>the bare metal machine. There's no different to

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.070
<v Speaker 0>having a, you know, sixteen year rack

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.150
<v Speaker 0>and your own data center somewhere running your

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:01.510
<v Speaker 0>deploying your own software to it.

00:07:02.325 --> 00:07:04.085
<v Speaker 0>So it's a really cool way of being

00:07:04.085 --> 00:07:05.365
<v Speaker 0>able to get a little bit more bang

00:07:05.365 --> 00:07:07.765
<v Speaker 0>for your buck rather than being surrounded by

00:07:07.765 --> 00:07:10.245
<v Speaker 0>noisy neighbors and virtualization and paying the small

00:07:10.245 --> 00:07:12.485
<v Speaker 0>performance hit that you would get in other

00:07:12.485 --> 00:07:13.125
<v Speaker 0>cloud providers.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.810
<v Speaker 0>So I come in here and just click

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.330
<v Speaker 0>get me a new server.

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:20.889
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna spend something up on demand.

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:24.810
<v Speaker 0>And these are the regions that we have

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:26.169
<v Speaker 0>available in packet.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:27.130
<v Speaker 0>There's,

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.210
<v Speaker 0>yeah, a good few there.

00:07:30.305 --> 00:07:33.025
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna go with Amsterdam since that's closest

00:07:33.025 --> 00:07:33.745
<v Speaker 0>to me.

00:07:35.985 --> 00:07:36.625
<v Speaker 0>And

00:07:36.865 --> 00:07:40.465
<v Speaker 0>we will spin up a c one small.

00:07:40.945 --> 00:07:42.465
<v Speaker 0>So you can kinda see the specs here.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.400
<v Speaker 0>Now this c one small has actually got,

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.320
<v Speaker 0>you know, 32 gig of RAM on it.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.200
<v Speaker 0>That small, really.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.040
<v Speaker 0>And then we have

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.160
<v Speaker 0>our

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:53.880
<v Speaker 0>images.

00:07:55.495 --> 00:07:56.935
<v Speaker 0>So for today,

00:07:57.015 --> 00:07:59.335
<v Speaker 0>let's spin up Debbie and Tan,

00:08:00.455 --> 00:08:01.815
<v Speaker 0>or at least for just now, I should

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:02.455
<v Speaker 0>say.

00:08:03.335 --> 00:08:05.335
<v Speaker 0>And I'm just gonna call this Debbie and

00:08:05.335 --> 00:08:06.055
<v Speaker 0>Tan

00:08:06.135 --> 00:08:06.695
<v Speaker 0>demo.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.310
<v Speaker 0>We

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:10.830
<v Speaker 0>can provide user data,

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.270
<v Speaker 0>which is a,

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.590
<v Speaker 0>you know, a script so that would be

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:15.390
<v Speaker 0>executed

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.150
<v Speaker 0>when the machine has been provisioned, and I

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:18.670
<v Speaker 0>could just solve a little bit of software

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:20.830
<v Speaker 0>there, you know, something like an app get

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.750
<v Speaker 0>update and app install.

00:08:23.365 --> 00:08:24.165
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

00:08:25.205 --> 00:08:26.245
<v Speaker 0>NGINX

00:08:26.245 --> 00:08:28.324
<v Speaker 0>would give me an NGINX server.

00:08:31.365 --> 00:08:33.684
<v Speaker 0>But we're only spending up this up as

00:08:33.684 --> 00:08:35.524
<v Speaker 0>a demo, and we're gonna use the custom

00:08:35.524 --> 00:08:38.005
<v Speaker 0>image build to provide the software that we

00:08:38.005 --> 00:08:39.980
<v Speaker 0>need. The reason I wanna try and do

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.740
<v Speaker 0>the custom image thing is, also, I wanna

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:43.100
<v Speaker 0>be able to play with it and understand

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.460
<v Speaker 0>how it works and and get good at

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.940
<v Speaker 0>providing these sorts of images. But because the

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.420
<v Speaker 0>speed of deployment will be substantially faster if

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:50.460
<v Speaker 0>I can remove

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.420
<v Speaker 0>a certain level of the provisioning step that

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.645
<v Speaker 0>would have to happen after the machine had

00:08:55.645 --> 00:08:56.285
<v Speaker 0>booted.

00:08:57.325 --> 00:08:59.005
<v Speaker 0>You know, I'm a big fan of SaltStack,

00:08:59.005 --> 00:09:00.765
<v Speaker 0>and that's a great system. But if I

00:09:00.765 --> 00:09:02.365
<v Speaker 0>can have my machine already

00:09:02.365 --> 00:09:04.605
<v Speaker 0>kinda ready to run Salt on first boot

00:09:04.605 --> 00:09:05.965
<v Speaker 0>instead of me having to get it up

00:09:05.965 --> 00:09:08.240
<v Speaker 0>to up to speed, then that's gonna be

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.800
<v Speaker 0>much faster for my elasticity and scale and

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.720
<v Speaker 0>all these other challenges that we may have.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.520
<v Speaker 0>I'm not gonna configure the IP, and I'm

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.400
<v Speaker 0>not gonna configure the SSH access either. That'll

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.760
<v Speaker 0>all use my

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.485
<v Speaker 0>my account's SSH key, So I should still

00:09:23.485 --> 00:09:25.645
<v Speaker 0>be able to SSH onto the machine.

00:09:26.765 --> 00:09:27.725
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:09:28.365 --> 00:09:29.725
<v Speaker 0>So that's gonna take

00:09:31.485 --> 00:09:34.525
<v Speaker 0>depends on the availability and there being 10.

00:09:34.525 --> 00:09:35.885
<v Speaker 0>I don't think I've actually spun that up

00:09:35.885 --> 00:09:37.085
<v Speaker 0>before. I do believe it's one of the

00:09:37.085 --> 00:09:40.050
<v Speaker 0>faster operating systems to provision. So let's just

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.650
<v Speaker 0>say five minutes, and we'll maybe come back

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:43.170
<v Speaker 0>to that and see how we're getting on.

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:47.410
<v Speaker 0>So with regards to custom images,

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:51.010
<v Speaker 0>I kinda skimmed this document. I mean, as

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:52.895
<v Speaker 0>as more sensible person

00:09:53.695 --> 00:09:55.855
<v Speaker 0>may have tried this before streaming.

00:09:56.175 --> 00:09:57.455
<v Speaker 0>But I'm trying to,

00:09:59.135 --> 00:10:01.695
<v Speaker 0>I don't know, learn more in public and,

00:10:01.695 --> 00:10:04.495
<v Speaker 0>you know, make mistakes so other people can

00:10:04.495 --> 00:10:05.615
<v Speaker 0>see that too. You know, there's a lot

00:10:05.615 --> 00:10:06.255
<v Speaker 0>of value

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.940
<v Speaker 0>in seeing trials and tribulations of things that

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:09.660
<v Speaker 0>go wrong.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:10.779
<v Speaker 0>And

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:11.660
<v Speaker 0>then,

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:13.980
<v Speaker 0>you know, anyone that doesn't wanna persevere with

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.820
<v Speaker 0>however long this takes me, we will condense

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.580
<v Speaker 0>this down to smaller formats,

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.899
<v Speaker 0>which was feedback I got on Twitter. Thank

00:10:19.899 --> 00:10:20.060
<v Speaker 0>you.

00:10:22.055 --> 00:10:24.134
<v Speaker 0>So what do I need to do? I

00:10:24.134 --> 00:10:26.055
<v Speaker 0>need to get LFS.

00:10:26.694 --> 00:10:29.815
<v Speaker 0>So do we have get LFS?

00:10:31.735 --> 00:10:32.695
<v Speaker 0>We do not.

00:10:32.935 --> 00:10:34.615
<v Speaker 0>Let's try

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.580
<v Speaker 0>and install it. So

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.140
<v Speaker 0>but not that work. I'm just I'm just

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:41.780
<v Speaker 0>guessing.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.300
<v Speaker 0>What is GetLFS? Well, this, I do know.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.540
<v Speaker 0>I have used this before. So

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.700
<v Speaker 0>if you've ever been in a position if

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:52.055
<v Speaker 0>well, if you're using GET, right, you may

00:10:52.055 --> 00:10:54.454
<v Speaker 0>have been in a position where you've actually

00:10:54.694 --> 00:10:58.055
<v Speaker 0>added a really large file to your repository.

00:10:58.535 --> 00:11:01.095
<v Speaker 0>And because of how GET works, even if

00:11:01.095 --> 00:11:03.574
<v Speaker 0>you delete that file from the repository,

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:06.210
<v Speaker 0>it still existed at a point in time,

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.370
<v Speaker 0>which means the size of your repository will

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:10.770
<v Speaker 0>always be cumulative to all the files that

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:11.730
<v Speaker 0>you've ever added.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.330
<v Speaker 0>You know, people always add large images that

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:16.690
<v Speaker 0>haven't been compressed for the web or they

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:19.010
<v Speaker 0>add PDFs or, worse, they add zips, etcetera.

00:11:19.475 --> 00:11:20.195
<v Speaker 0>Now

00:11:21.635 --> 00:11:24.355
<v Speaker 0>nobody wants a large Git repository because it

00:11:24.355 --> 00:11:26.035
<v Speaker 0>means that cloning it can take a lot

00:11:26.035 --> 00:11:28.035
<v Speaker 0>of time. Obviously, there are other loopholes there.

00:11:28.035 --> 00:11:29.955
<v Speaker 0>You can do shell clones, etcetera. But,

00:11:30.915 --> 00:11:31.475
<v Speaker 0>really,

00:11:32.115 --> 00:11:34.355
<v Speaker 0>Git is not that great as storing binary

00:11:34.355 --> 00:11:34.915
<v Speaker 0>blobs.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:37.110
<v Speaker 0>And by binary, I mean, those are files

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.990
<v Speaker 0>and images.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.790
<v Speaker 0>And custom images is definitely gonna affect that

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:42.310
<v Speaker 0>there because the custom images we're gonna be

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:44.150
<v Speaker 0>building today, I'm assuming they're targets.

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:45.350
<v Speaker 0>So

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:49.285
<v Speaker 0>what LFS does is it actually creates a

00:11:49.285 --> 00:11:52.165
<v Speaker 0>really small file inside of the GET tree,

00:11:52.644 --> 00:11:54.964
<v Speaker 0>which is a pointer to an external resource.

00:11:56.005 --> 00:11:58.565
<v Speaker 0>So when I add these images to GET,

00:11:58.644 --> 00:12:00.485
<v Speaker 0>it's gonna say, hey. You have added this

00:12:00.485 --> 00:12:00.805
<v Speaker 0>image,

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:03.850
<v Speaker 0>which lives on GitLab or GitHub over here

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:05.850
<v Speaker 0>on this special LFS store,

00:12:06.089 --> 00:12:07.769
<v Speaker 0>and we can reference that image. And if

00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:09.130
<v Speaker 0>we ever change it, a new version will

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.970
<v Speaker 0>be uploaded, the shall will be updated in

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:12.570
<v Speaker 0>the reference. So it's kinda like a pointer

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:13.529
<v Speaker 0>to a fail elsewhere,

00:12:14.324 --> 00:12:16.084
<v Speaker 0>but still with the same semantics and make

00:12:16.084 --> 00:12:17.445
<v Speaker 0>sure the fail hasn't changed.

00:12:18.165 --> 00:12:18.884
<v Speaker 0>So

00:12:19.605 --> 00:12:21.445
<v Speaker 0>we have this now. Perfect.

00:12:22.725 --> 00:12:24.964
<v Speaker 0>Now it wants me to grab

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:28.590
<v Speaker 0>get a bit to image.

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:33.150
<v Speaker 0>So let's go and see what that is.

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:36.190
<v Speaker 0>This is on GitHub.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:38.750
<v Speaker 0>Packet host. Packet images.

00:12:41.225 --> 00:12:42.825
<v Speaker 0>So packet

00:12:43.065 --> 00:12:44.585
<v Speaker 0>oh, first one. Perfect.

00:12:46.185 --> 00:12:47.785
<v Speaker 0>I've had peek at this

00:12:48.105 --> 00:12:49.785
<v Speaker 0>when I was doing my research,

00:12:49.945 --> 00:12:51.945
<v Speaker 0>my very, very brief research,

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.680
<v Speaker 0>But I don't think I clicked on any

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:56.800
<v Speaker 0>of the scripts.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:57.520
<v Speaker 0>So

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.839
<v Speaker 0>get a bit to image.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:05.839
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.720
<v Speaker 0>works out which arch

00:13:09.565 --> 00:13:10.525
<v Speaker 0>architecture,

00:13:10.525 --> 00:13:12.045
<v Speaker 0>not arch distro.

00:13:13.404 --> 00:13:15.165
<v Speaker 0>And I just specify a version of the

00:13:15.165 --> 00:13:16.685
<v Speaker 0>bintle that we wanna fetch.

00:13:17.245 --> 00:13:17.885
<v Speaker 0>And

00:13:18.285 --> 00:13:19.405
<v Speaker 0>ah, okay.

00:13:19.965 --> 00:13:21.965
<v Speaker 0>This is just a helper script that actually

00:13:21.965 --> 00:13:23.085
<v Speaker 0>downloads

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:26.130
<v Speaker 0>the Ubuntu base ISO

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:27.810
<v Speaker 0>or base image

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:30.530
<v Speaker 0>from Ubuntu website.

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:33.490
<v Speaker 0>Cool. Okay.

00:13:35.195 --> 00:13:37.435
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. We'll we'll get it if it's gonna

00:13:37.435 --> 00:13:39.355
<v Speaker 0>make my life a little bit easier today.

00:13:39.915 --> 00:13:41.275
<v Speaker 0>So let's curl.

00:13:43.355 --> 00:13:46.154
<v Speaker 0>We'll get the printer

00:13:47.195 --> 00:13:47.675
<v Speaker 0>image.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.940
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's make that a bit bigger.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.260
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:00.660
<v Speaker 0>Next.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:03.620
<v Speaker 0>So it also make that executable.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:04.820
<v Speaker 0>Yep. That would make sense.

00:14:11.035 --> 00:14:13.275
<v Speaker 0>Packet save to image.

00:14:13.355 --> 00:14:15.355
<v Speaker 0>Let's just see what that is too.

00:14:17.355 --> 00:14:19.915
<v Speaker 0>So that's ah, okay. So this

00:14:20.899 --> 00:14:23.139
<v Speaker 0>takes a docker image charcoal

00:14:24.259 --> 00:14:27.300
<v Speaker 0>and explodes into a root fail system. Cool.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.180
<v Speaker 0>That makes sense?

00:14:32.019 --> 00:14:32.899
<v Speaker 0>Let's download it.

00:14:36.795 --> 00:14:38.315
<v Speaker 0>But you never thought you'd be sitting watching

00:14:38.315 --> 00:14:39.835
<v Speaker 0>me download some images.

00:14:41.595 --> 00:14:42.235
<v Speaker 0>Oops.

00:14:44.235 --> 00:14:47.115
<v Speaker 0>And I'm assuming we're gonna wanna make that

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:48.740
<v Speaker 0>beautiful.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.220
<v Speaker 0>Next. See, it is easy.

00:14:52.899 --> 00:14:54.180
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.339
<v Speaker 0>this is

00:14:56.339 --> 00:14:58.100
<v Speaker 0>the NRD system

00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:59.139
<v Speaker 0>for

00:15:00.954 --> 00:15:04.714
<v Speaker 0>Buntu 16 o four c one small.

00:15:05.274 --> 00:15:06.074
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:15:08.314 --> 00:15:10.074
<v Speaker 0>A lot to unpack there.

00:15:10.394 --> 00:15:13.435
<v Speaker 0>So Linux systems have a kernel

00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:16.399
<v Speaker 0>and our and a RD, which is a

00:15:16.399 --> 00:15:18.560
<v Speaker 0>RAM disk image, which is loaded prior to

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.560
<v Speaker 0>the kernel that provides,

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.959
<v Speaker 0>you know, the drivers that your machine needs

00:15:24.959 --> 00:15:26.639
<v Speaker 0>for the kernel to start, like,

00:15:27.305 --> 00:15:29.785
<v Speaker 0>you know, decrypting the desk, mounting the desk,

00:15:30.904 --> 00:15:33.225
<v Speaker 0>So I guess that's gonna be quite specific

00:15:33.225 --> 00:15:34.904
<v Speaker 0>to the c one small. So I'm gonna

00:15:34.904 --> 00:15:36.665
<v Speaker 0>have to make sure I download the right

00:15:36.745 --> 00:15:37.625
<v Speaker 0>NRD

00:15:37.625 --> 00:15:39.625
<v Speaker 0>for the machine that we wanna spin up.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:43.030
<v Speaker 0>A kernel

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:44.790
<v Speaker 0>and the modules

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:46.710
<v Speaker 0>or the modules will be specific to the

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:48.310
<v Speaker 0>c one small two. So those two, we

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:49.430
<v Speaker 0>need to make sure we get the correct

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.990
<v Speaker 0>one.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.310
<v Speaker 0>In fact, I guess they're all gonna be

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:54.950
<v Speaker 0>specific, but not specific to the Ubuntu.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:56.470
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure

00:15:57.084 --> 00:15:59.085
<v Speaker 0>why that's part of it.

00:16:01.725 --> 00:16:03.245
<v Speaker 0>But we'll grab the ones that we wanna

00:16:03.245 --> 00:16:04.045
<v Speaker 0>modify,

00:16:04.685 --> 00:16:06.605
<v Speaker 0>and we will

00:16:07.165 --> 00:16:09.325
<v Speaker 0>maybe try and break it afterwards.

00:16:09.325 --> 00:16:11.165
<v Speaker 0>Let's get it working first. So

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:15.850
<v Speaker 0>those were branches.

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:19.130
<v Speaker 0>See, this is packet host, packet images raw,

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.050
<v Speaker 0>and then this is a branch name.

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:23.210
<v Speaker 1>So

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:24.410
<v Speaker 1>if I

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:27.450
<v Speaker 0>confirm that yeah.

00:16:30.144 --> 00:16:31.265
<v Speaker 0>Wrong scroll.

00:16:31.745 --> 00:16:33.825
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. There we go. Cool. Now it

00:16:33.825 --> 00:16:35.665
<v Speaker 0>looks like the generic ones as well. Not

00:16:35.665 --> 00:16:36.545
<v Speaker 0>through me.

00:16:36.945 --> 00:16:38.145
<v Speaker 0>That mean 10.

00:16:39.105 --> 00:16:40.385
<v Speaker 0>How much you do that? It's been up

00:16:40.385 --> 00:16:42.865
<v Speaker 0>here. Oh, my machine's ready, so that's good.

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:45.790
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. C one small. So I stick with

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:47.230
<v Speaker 0>C 1 smalls.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.029
<v Speaker 0>And we have

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:54.830
<v Speaker 0>two different timestamped ones.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:57.630
<v Speaker 0>So this one is the latter.

00:16:58.764 --> 00:16:59.325
<v Speaker 0>So

00:17:00.204 --> 00:17:01.325
<v Speaker 0>let's download

00:17:02.125 --> 00:17:03.165
<v Speaker 0>these.

00:17:03.485 --> 00:17:04.125
<v Speaker 0>So

00:17:05.484 --> 00:17:07.565
<v Speaker 0>I don't think it told me to download

00:17:07.645 --> 00:17:10.365
<v Speaker 0>an image. Yeah. Let's just get the kernel.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:15.910
<v Speaker 0>Mine doesn't have a Docker file.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:19.030
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It'll be fine.

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:21.190
<v Speaker 0>Let's download the NRD.

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:24.390
<v Speaker 0>Can I just

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:25.590
<v Speaker 0>there we go?

00:17:28.725 --> 00:17:29.684
<v Speaker 0>Save.

00:17:32.965 --> 00:17:34.085
<v Speaker 0>And the kernel.

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.829
<v Speaker 0>And the modules.

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:49.750
<v Speaker 0>It's not really confirmed that people can even

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:52.549
<v Speaker 0>hear or see me. Let's just do that.

00:17:54.905 --> 00:17:56.424
<v Speaker 0>Oh, we have comments too.

00:17:58.585 --> 00:18:00.025
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Yeah.

00:18:00.025 --> 00:18:00.664
<v Speaker 0>So

00:18:01.225 --> 00:18:03.545
<v Speaker 0>a smarter person who is streaming would have

00:18:03.945 --> 00:18:05.705
<v Speaker 0>let me just switch back to myself for

00:18:05.705 --> 00:18:06.025
<v Speaker 0>a moment.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.400
<v Speaker 0>A smart person that would be streaming would

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.040
<v Speaker 0>not have this view up and shared at

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.000
<v Speaker 0>the moment, but

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.600
<v Speaker 0>my MacBook Pro isn't compatible with my monitor,

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.920
<v Speaker 0>and I'm currently wait my external monitor, and

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.760
<v Speaker 0>I'm currently waiting on Apple engineering to fix

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.040
<v Speaker 0>that for me. So,

00:18:24.535 --> 00:18:26.615
<v Speaker 0>yeah, you're just gonna have to see everything

00:18:26.615 --> 00:18:29.175
<v Speaker 0>as I do it. So I will pop

00:18:29.175 --> 00:18:30.934
<v Speaker 0>back to the questions randomly.

00:18:32.055 --> 00:18:34.455
<v Speaker 0>So what is SaltStack was a question

00:18:36.135 --> 00:18:37.015
<v Speaker 0>by Steve.

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:41.990
<v Speaker 0>So SaltStack is a provisioning system much

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:44.790
<v Speaker 0>like a chef, Ansible, if you're familiar with

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:45.830
<v Speaker 0>them, or Puppet.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:48.470
<v Speaker 0>I'm particularly fond of Salt because it has

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:50.230
<v Speaker 0>a few traits that the other systems don't

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:50.390
<v Speaker 0>have.

00:18:51.154 --> 00:18:52.595
<v Speaker 0>The first one, which I think is the

00:18:52.595 --> 00:18:54.835
<v Speaker 0>most important, is just the communication method. And

00:18:54.835 --> 00:18:58.115
<v Speaker 0>that salt is event driven and communicates over

00:18:58.115 --> 00:19:01.154
<v Speaker 0>zero in queue, and the communication is entirely

00:19:01.154 --> 00:19:01.955
<v Speaker 0>one way.

00:19:03.075 --> 00:19:04.914
<v Speaker 0>That means that all of your worker nodes

00:19:04.914 --> 00:19:06.355
<v Speaker 0>or so called the minions

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:08.570
<v Speaker 0>only have to be able to speak to

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:09.770
<v Speaker 0>the the master

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:12.170
<v Speaker 0>node. That's it. So the the when it

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:14.730
<v Speaker 0>comes to my networking, security, and ports,

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:17.130
<v Speaker 0>really, really simple. As long as your minion

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:18.410
<v Speaker 0>and worker can reach the master,

00:19:19.095 --> 00:19:20.455
<v Speaker 0>the system just works.

00:19:20.855 --> 00:19:22.855
<v Speaker 0>What happens is this salt master will post

00:19:22.855 --> 00:19:24.695
<v Speaker 0>a message onto zero m q, which will

00:19:24.695 --> 00:19:26.294
<v Speaker 0>be picked up by one or more worker

00:19:26.294 --> 00:19:27.095
<v Speaker 0>minions.

00:19:27.174 --> 00:19:28.855
<v Speaker 0>They will execute a task, and then they

00:19:28.855 --> 00:19:30.695
<v Speaker 0>will publish a message back on the queue,

00:19:30.695 --> 00:19:32.054
<v Speaker 0>which the master will pick up and say,

00:19:32.054 --> 00:19:33.575
<v Speaker 0>hey. This was done and this wasn't done,

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:35.990
<v Speaker 0>and it's super, super fast.

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.470
<v Speaker 0>That method of working is insane.

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:41.430
<v Speaker 0>Unlike Ansible, which I believe the SSH is

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:43.110
<v Speaker 0>the default transport, which means you have to

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:45.430
<v Speaker 0>have all of these SSH ports open between

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:46.790
<v Speaker 0>all of your machines, and I am a

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:47.670
<v Speaker 0>bit of an advocate

00:19:48.154 --> 00:19:50.554
<v Speaker 0>for never having SSH on any machine in

00:19:50.554 --> 00:19:53.034
<v Speaker 0>production ever, and this is a jump boxer.

00:19:58.955 --> 00:19:59.594
<v Speaker 0>Rick

00:19:59.914 --> 00:20:02.360
<v Speaker 0>is saying he likes to see me fumble.

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.360
<v Speaker 0>Thank you. Yeah. I think it's a really

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.200
<v Speaker 0>good way to learn as well. I think

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:06.919
<v Speaker 0>seeing

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.760
<v Speaker 0>people make mistakes means that you don't have

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.760
<v Speaker 0>to make that mistake too. Seeing something that's

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.200
<v Speaker 0>polished is nice if I wanna do a

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.935
<v Speaker 0>thirty minute tutorial or learning thing, but it's

00:20:14.935 --> 00:20:17.255
<v Speaker 0>nice to nice to see mistakes happen too.

00:20:18.135 --> 00:20:20.215
<v Speaker 0>And we'll just share that because that's an

00:20:20.215 --> 00:20:20.775
<v Speaker 0>awesome.

00:20:21.495 --> 00:20:21.975
<v Speaker 0>You.

00:20:22.535 --> 00:20:23.255
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:20:24.375 --> 00:20:26.455
<v Speaker 0>So, like, Terraform then?

00:20:27.679 --> 00:20:28.880
<v Speaker 0>No. Terraform

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.480
<v Speaker 0>is for provisioning

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:33.919
<v Speaker 0>resources

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.600
<v Speaker 0>rather than operating

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.399
<v Speaker 0>systems.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:40.559
<v Speaker 0>Although SaltStack can also do infrastructure provisioning through

00:20:40.559 --> 00:20:41.760
<v Speaker 0>something called SaltCloud,

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.215
<v Speaker 0>and Ansible actually has something for doing that

00:20:44.215 --> 00:20:46.294
<v Speaker 0>too. So it gets a little bit murky

00:20:46.294 --> 00:20:47.335
<v Speaker 0>in a way that you're gonna talk about

00:20:47.335 --> 00:20:48.455
<v Speaker 0>them. So I guess the answer is yes

00:20:48.455 --> 00:20:50.695
<v Speaker 0>and no. Maybe we can do a deeper

00:20:50.695 --> 00:20:52.374
<v Speaker 0>dive into that another point.

00:20:54.534 --> 00:20:56.774
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. How did you get the question on

00:20:56.774 --> 00:20:57.174
<v Speaker 0>the screen?

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:01.090
<v Speaker 0>So I'm using streamyard.com,

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:03.810
<v Speaker 0>which actually has in fact, if I share

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:05.170
<v Speaker 0>my screen again in a second, you'll see

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:07.250
<v Speaker 0>it. But I can actually see all the

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:09.330
<v Speaker 0>questions from the three different platforms I'm streaming

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.570
<v Speaker 0>to. So I'm streaming to YouTube, Periscope slash

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:12.850
<v Speaker 0>Twitter, and Twitch,

00:21:13.355 --> 00:21:15.755
<v Speaker 0>and it allows me just to click show.

00:21:15.755 --> 00:21:16.794
<v Speaker 0>So let me

00:21:18.475 --> 00:21:20.155
<v Speaker 0>I I know you've got the infinite void

00:21:20.155 --> 00:21:22.794
<v Speaker 0>right now, but I can click show,

00:21:24.155 --> 00:21:26.440
<v Speaker 0>and it's cool. I like it. If only

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.680
<v Speaker 0>I had a second monitor so

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.200
<v Speaker 0>that we don't have to look at the

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.080
<v Speaker 0>end to avoid.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.280
<v Speaker 0>So let's go back to Firefox.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.080
<v Speaker 0>Right.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:39.400
<v Speaker 0>So I did download all those files. Right?

00:21:40.775 --> 00:21:41.894
<v Speaker 0>One theory.

00:21:46.695 --> 00:21:48.375
<v Speaker 0>We have our NRB,

00:21:48.375 --> 00:21:51.254
<v Speaker 0>our kernel, and our modules.

00:21:52.294 --> 00:21:52.775
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:54.149
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:56.950
<v Speaker 0>So what we're gonna build? That's a good

00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:57.509
<v Speaker 0>question.

00:21:58.309 --> 00:22:00.309
<v Speaker 0>So we're gonna do a dev in 10,000,000,

00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.990
<v Speaker 0>and

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:03.109
<v Speaker 0>we will

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:06.470
<v Speaker 0>do something relatively trivial just now. Let's just

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:09.429
<v Speaker 0>try and see if we can get it

00:22:08.465 --> 00:22:10.865
<v Speaker 0>pre provisioned or bit strapped with NGINX.

00:22:13.425 --> 00:22:16.465
<v Speaker 0>I wanna move these g z's into that

00:22:16.465 --> 00:22:17.345
<v Speaker 0>folder.

00:22:17.665 --> 00:22:19.665
<v Speaker 0>I will make that repo public as well

00:22:20.225 --> 00:22:21.265
<v Speaker 0>and hopefully,

00:22:21.505 --> 00:22:23.960
<v Speaker 0>with more useful images. Like, right now, kind

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.400
<v Speaker 0>of what I'm thinking about is

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.560
<v Speaker 0>as I learn how to do this is

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.480
<v Speaker 0>that we can try to provide custom images

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.240
<v Speaker 0>that anyone can use for a variety of

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.120
<v Speaker 0>use cases.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.200
<v Speaker 0>One of them, which seems really obvious to

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.120
<v Speaker 0>me, is a, providing a Docker Swarm setup

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:39.065
<v Speaker 0>or a Kubernetes setup or a HashiCorp Nomad

00:22:39.065 --> 00:22:39.785
<v Speaker 0>setup

00:22:40.105 --> 00:22:42.425
<v Speaker 0>to allow people to take advantage of container

00:22:42.425 --> 00:22:44.905
<v Speaker 0>technologies on top of the bare metal compute.

00:22:44.905 --> 00:22:46.585
<v Speaker 0>Right? There's a

00:22:47.465 --> 00:22:48.505
<v Speaker 0>almost like a

00:22:49.705 --> 00:22:49.865
<v Speaker 0>just

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.879
<v Speaker 0>container technologies

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.960
<v Speaker 0>are great because we can, you know, hook

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.759
<v Speaker 0>into the kernel without the virtualization aspect. So

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.600
<v Speaker 0>the bare metal just gives you that extra

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.799
<v Speaker 0>bang for your buck as well.

00:23:02.559 --> 00:23:03.120
<v Speaker 0>Right.

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.080
<v Speaker 0>Docs.

00:23:05.935 --> 00:23:07.934
<v Speaker 0>Just mumbling there. Right.

00:23:08.895 --> 00:23:10.735
<v Speaker 0>I don't have a Docker file.

00:23:12.095 --> 00:23:15.054
<v Speaker 0>So let's go see what this is doing

00:23:15.055 --> 00:23:17.054
<v Speaker 0>and then maybe

00:23:17.215 --> 00:23:18.415
<v Speaker 0>hack our own together.

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:24.649
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:26.330
<v Speaker 0>Cool. There are nothing that have been too

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:28.730
<v Speaker 0>specific there other than all the app stuff,

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:30.169
<v Speaker 0>and I'm using Debian.

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:33.130
<v Speaker 0>So other than a few package hiccups,

00:23:35.095 --> 00:23:36.854
<v Speaker 0>I don't see any problems.

00:23:38.294 --> 00:23:40.934
<v Speaker 0>So from scratch, the special thing in Docker,

00:23:40.934 --> 00:23:42.695
<v Speaker 0>let's see if I can get that right.

00:23:44.455 --> 00:23:47.414
<v Speaker 0>It means that you want a container image

00:23:47.414 --> 00:23:49.174
<v Speaker 0>with nothing that's old to nada.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.480
<v Speaker 0>Really good well, not good. Actually, it's really

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.200
<v Speaker 0>painful.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.360
<v Speaker 0>Because what a lot of people do is

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.600
<v Speaker 0>because Go and Rust and all these other

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.840
<v Speaker 0>compared languages have the ability to provide a

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.520
<v Speaker 0>static binary with no dependencies,

00:24:02.014 --> 00:24:04.174
<v Speaker 0>If they generally copy that binary,

00:24:05.695 --> 00:24:08.094
<v Speaker 0>this and then you have an entry point,

00:24:08.174 --> 00:24:09.774
<v Speaker 0>which is just binary,

00:24:10.095 --> 00:24:11.614
<v Speaker 0>and then they ship it to production.

00:24:12.735 --> 00:24:14.575
<v Speaker 0>It's really cool. I mean, your image is

00:24:14.575 --> 00:24:16.409
<v Speaker 0>gonna be super teeny. You know, the size

00:24:16.409 --> 00:24:18.250
<v Speaker 0>of your binaries, I'm assuming a few hundred

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:20.409
<v Speaker 0>kilobytes, maybe a few mega worst case.

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:22.809
<v Speaker 0>The problem with that is you have absolutely

00:24:22.809 --> 00:24:24.809
<v Speaker 0>no way to debug that container.

00:24:25.769 --> 00:24:27.850
<v Speaker 0>You cannot get into that container because there's

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:30.875
<v Speaker 0>no there's no bash. There's no there's no

00:24:30.875 --> 00:24:32.155
<v Speaker 0>new quartiles.

00:24:32.155 --> 00:24:33.835
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna core you to us.

00:24:34.955 --> 00:24:37.355
<v Speaker 0>There's no observability into that system unless your

00:24:37.355 --> 00:24:39.915
<v Speaker 0>application itself exposes its metrics, so it can

00:24:39.915 --> 00:24:41.595
<v Speaker 0>be a black box depending on what you're

00:24:41.595 --> 00:24:42.155
<v Speaker 0>you're doing.

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:44.950
<v Speaker 0>Now Kubernetes is trying to make this a

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:46.870
<v Speaker 0>lot better. I think

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:48.950
<v Speaker 0>it was pushed from the 01/19 release, but

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:51.190
<v Speaker 0>the 01/20 release will have the concept of

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:53.350
<v Speaker 0>a debug container or debug

00:24:55.695 --> 00:24:58.095
<v Speaker 0>yeah. It's a container. Yeah. So you can

00:24:58.095 --> 00:24:59.374
<v Speaker 0>do kubectl

00:25:00.015 --> 00:25:03.455
<v Speaker 0>debug, and it'll actually inject a sidecar into

00:25:03.455 --> 00:25:05.934
<v Speaker 0>the pod, which gives you bash and other

00:25:05.934 --> 00:25:08.255
<v Speaker 0>debugging utens so you can take advantage of

00:25:08.255 --> 00:25:10.015
<v Speaker 0>the small binary size of a scratch image.

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.240
<v Speaker 0>But that's really early stuff, so let's not

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.200
<v Speaker 0>focus on that.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.920
<v Speaker 0>We don't have a root effect yet. I'm

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.720
<v Speaker 0>assuming

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:22.080
<v Speaker 0>our packet safe to image is or image,

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.605
<v Speaker 0>whatever that was, is gonna provide that based

00:25:24.605 --> 00:25:27.164
<v Speaker 0>on the modules and RD and the kernel.

00:25:28.845 --> 00:25:30.764
<v Speaker 0>Maintainer is an old flag.

00:25:30.924 --> 00:25:32.445
<v Speaker 0>It shouldn't be used anymore.

00:25:34.765 --> 00:25:36.845
<v Speaker 0>And the labels I'm gonna assume these aren't

00:25:36.845 --> 00:25:39.960
<v Speaker 0>particularly important, but on the all chance that

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:40.519
<v Speaker 0>the

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:46.360
<v Speaker 0>packet subsystems are gonna use them, then we

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.559
<v Speaker 0>will call this

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.840
<v Speaker 0>I don't have a space on it, so

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:51.720
<v Speaker 0>let's just go for that.

00:25:53.184 --> 00:25:55.825
<v Speaker 0>I will be the vendor. Sure. MIT is

00:25:55.825 --> 00:25:56.945
<v Speaker 0>the only license.

00:25:58.384 --> 00:26:00.225
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, I'm not gonna bother changing the build

00:26:00.225 --> 00:26:02.384
<v Speaker 0>date. I don't think that's gonna be important.

00:26:02.544 --> 00:26:05.460
<v Speaker 0>Although, I'm gonna do it myself. So fuck.

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.139
<v Speaker 0>Can you believe it's August already?

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:10.100
<v Speaker 0>Oh, wait.

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:11.940
<v Speaker 0>Oh, '6.

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:12.659
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:16.179
<v Speaker 0>But they'll be in front end noninteractive.

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:17.860
<v Speaker 0>Yep. I prefer that syntax.

00:26:22.895 --> 00:26:24.655
<v Speaker 0>We're doing an update, which I would always

00:26:24.655 --> 00:26:27.375
<v Speaker 0>recommend. You wanna keep your thing that's secure.

00:26:27.375 --> 00:26:29.135
<v Speaker 0>You wanna make sure you're always getting security

00:26:29.135 --> 00:26:29.934
<v Speaker 0>patches.

00:26:31.135 --> 00:26:33.295
<v Speaker 0>We're doing the upgrade. Nice. And then we're

00:26:33.295 --> 00:26:34.095
<v Speaker 0>doing an install.

00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:38.710
<v Speaker 0>And we have

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:40.950
<v Speaker 0>bash past completion.

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:44.149
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.909
<v Speaker 0>That's weird.

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:50.549
<v Speaker 0>I assume that's

00:26:50.985 --> 00:26:52.985
<v Speaker 0>an artifact of copy and paste, but there's

00:26:52.985 --> 00:26:55.544
<v Speaker 0>definitely no need to run the update twice.

00:26:58.025 --> 00:27:00.825
<v Speaker 0>Oh, let's just remove that. And then that's

00:27:00.825 --> 00:27:02.585
<v Speaker 0>installing kernel index.

00:27:03.065 --> 00:27:03.465
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.260
<v Speaker 0>And the locales here, that is, you know,

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.299
<v Speaker 0>pretty standard

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:10.460
<v Speaker 0>on the bootstrapping stuff.

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.740
<v Speaker 0>And then it's doing a clean.

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:18.335
<v Speaker 0>And because these are all multiple layers, where

00:27:18.335 --> 00:27:20.335
<v Speaker 0>image is still gonna be relatively large, but

00:27:20.335 --> 00:27:21.855
<v Speaker 0>then I don't know what save to image

00:27:21.855 --> 00:27:22.575
<v Speaker 0>is doing.

00:27:23.135 --> 00:27:25.135
<v Speaker 0>So maybe it flattens it,

00:27:25.775 --> 00:27:27.695
<v Speaker 0>but there's a good chance this is

00:27:28.495 --> 00:27:30.735
<v Speaker 0>a little bit redundant. But there's also a

00:27:30.735 --> 00:27:31.775
<v Speaker 0>better chance I'm wrong.

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:35.460
<v Speaker 0>So let's test this.

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:37.540
<v Speaker 0>This is Docker. Right?

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:42.260
<v Speaker 0>But, really, I can test if this works

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.220
<v Speaker 0>by changing it from scratch to be Debbie

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:46.980
<v Speaker 0>and 10 and doing a build. And if

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:49.445
<v Speaker 0>any of it fails, it's gonna be because

00:27:49.445 --> 00:27:51.845
<v Speaker 0>the package names are different from the Bundu

00:27:51.845 --> 00:27:52.804
<v Speaker 0>to Debian,

00:27:53.125 --> 00:27:54.565
<v Speaker 0>and we can fix that.

00:27:56.085 --> 00:27:57.605
<v Speaker 0>So let's

00:27:58.405 --> 00:27:59.525
<v Speaker 0>go to Debian.

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:02.350
<v Speaker 0>I think

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:04.190
<v Speaker 0>what we want is that.

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:09.550
<v Speaker 0>Do we have a 10? We do. Nice.

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:10.750
<v Speaker 0>So let's

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:11.790
<v Speaker 0>do a build.

00:28:14.275 --> 00:28:15.634
<v Speaker 0>Third directory,

00:28:15.635 --> 00:28:16.514
<v Speaker 0>docker

00:28:16.515 --> 00:28:20.355
<v Speaker 0>image build, and let's call us deviant ten

00:28:20.355 --> 00:28:21.715
<v Speaker 0>engine x

00:28:22.835 --> 00:28:23.874
<v Speaker 0>and go.

00:28:25.715 --> 00:28:27.155
<v Speaker 0>And start docker.

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:31.840
<v Speaker 0>I'll just take a moment. So let's jump

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.840
<v Speaker 0>back over here, see if we have any

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:34.799
<v Speaker 0>more questions.

00:28:37.679 --> 00:28:38.480
<v Speaker 0>StreamYard,

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:39.440
<v Speaker 0>love. Awesome.

00:28:42.275 --> 00:28:44.914
<v Speaker 0>And some annual stuff. Alright. Cool. Nothing I

00:28:44.914 --> 00:28:47.394
<v Speaker 0>need to get involved with yet. So

00:28:48.115 --> 00:28:49.715
<v Speaker 0>we spun up the server.

00:28:50.995 --> 00:28:52.835
<v Speaker 0>It didn't take very long. In fact, before

00:28:52.835 --> 00:28:54.515
<v Speaker 0>I even got through kind of my preamble

00:28:54.515 --> 00:28:56.275
<v Speaker 0>about what we're doing, it was kinda ready,

00:28:56.275 --> 00:28:56.995
<v Speaker 0>which is nice.

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:00.860
<v Speaker 0>Docker has started, so let's actually

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:01.820
<v Speaker 0>so

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.300
<v Speaker 0>we can use this Mac keyboard.

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.460
<v Speaker 0>Let's run that Docker build again and then

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:09.580
<v Speaker 0>spin up a new tab and SSH

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:11.820
<v Speaker 0>onto this machine

00:29:12.975 --> 00:29:16.335
<v Speaker 0>and tap the YubiKey. Knock

00:29:16.335 --> 00:29:17.455
<v Speaker 0>the YubiKey.

00:29:19.215 --> 00:29:19.934
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:29:20.095 --> 00:29:22.815
<v Speaker 0>I'm on a bare metal Debian 10.

00:29:23.135 --> 00:29:25.054
<v Speaker 0>It's in cloud supercomputer.

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:28.070
<v Speaker 0>But it could get a RAM and it's

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.470
<v Speaker 0>a small

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:31.190
<v Speaker 0>that's to me, it's just phenomenal.

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:34.630
<v Speaker 0>It's a solid connect. This is kinda what

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:35.669
<v Speaker 0>we're gonna try and,

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:38.470
<v Speaker 0>you know, probably like a golden image or

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:40.070
<v Speaker 0>it's not gonna go then, where we have

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:42.155
<v Speaker 0>Internet prebaked so that we can skip a

00:29:42.155 --> 00:29:42.875
<v Speaker 0>few minutes.

00:29:43.595 --> 00:29:45.195
<v Speaker 0>Obviously, it's a few seconds because we're not

00:29:45.195 --> 00:29:46.075
<v Speaker 0>doing anything

00:29:47.195 --> 00:29:48.794
<v Speaker 0>grand or elaborate yet.

00:29:51.115 --> 00:29:53.195
<v Speaker 0>And assuming

00:29:53.755 --> 00:29:55.755
<v Speaker 0>system being may have started that.

00:29:56.899 --> 00:29:57.700
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:00.739
<v Speaker 0>Local host.

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:01.700
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:06.339
<v Speaker 0>So

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:08.899
<v Speaker 0>this is what we wanna accomplish with our

00:30:09.539 --> 00:30:10.419
<v Speaker 0>custom image.

00:30:12.525 --> 00:30:13.965
<v Speaker 0>Let's close that.

00:30:14.525 --> 00:30:16.924
<v Speaker 0>Oh, we're already having the errors.

00:30:19.965 --> 00:30:21.085
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:30:21.085 --> 00:30:22.044
<v Speaker 0>So

00:30:22.045 --> 00:30:23.164
<v Speaker 0>what is

00:30:23.565 --> 00:30:25.885
<v Speaker 0>BIOS dev name on Debian?

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:33.080
<v Speaker 0>What I'll do is so that we don't

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.880
<v Speaker 0>have to watch me change 54 package names

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:36.679
<v Speaker 0>potentially

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:37.480
<v Speaker 0>is

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.760
<v Speaker 0>I will spin this box back up first.

00:30:41.565 --> 00:30:43.325
<v Speaker 0>I'll try and fix a few of them.

00:30:43.645 --> 00:30:45.484
<v Speaker 0>And if it's just getting too cumbersome,

00:30:45.485 --> 00:30:48.364
<v Speaker 0>I will retreat when using Debian 10,

00:30:49.485 --> 00:30:50.924
<v Speaker 0>or we can always go look in the

00:30:50.924 --> 00:30:54.364
<v Speaker 0>GitHub repository for the Debian 10 Docker file,

00:30:55.005 --> 00:30:55.885
<v Speaker 0>which could work.

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:01.300
<v Speaker 0>All those issues have been through.

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:04.660
<v Speaker 0>So BIOS.

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:05.540
<v Speaker 0>That then.

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:08.180
<v Speaker 0>BIOS.

00:31:12.945 --> 00:31:15.105
<v Speaker 0>Let's try and just redirect that a little

00:31:15.105 --> 00:31:16.705
<v Speaker 0>bit. Starts with BIOS.

00:31:25.799 --> 00:31:28.359
<v Speaker 0>Alright. And don't by asking

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:28.679
<v Speaker 0>them.

00:31:37.415 --> 00:31:39.414
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:31:41.815 --> 00:31:42.455
<v Speaker 0>Susie.

00:31:42.855 --> 00:31:43.414
<v Speaker 0>Susie

00:31:43.895 --> 00:31:46.215
<v Speaker 0>has it. The printer has it.

00:31:47.815 --> 00:31:50.775
<v Speaker 0>Let's

00:31:50.775 --> 00:31:51.015
<v Speaker 0>see.

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:56.429
<v Speaker 0>This person seems to know what they're talking

00:31:56.429 --> 00:31:57.070
<v Speaker 0>about.

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:01.230
<v Speaker 0>And it's a Cloudflare site.

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:03.149
<v Speaker 0>We will wait.

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:06.029
<v Speaker 0>Wonder if it just exists.

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:06.910
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

00:32:08.325 --> 00:32:09.124
<v Speaker 0>or not.

00:32:11.205 --> 00:32:13.684
<v Speaker 0>Right. That plan's gonna be shit already.

00:32:13.924 --> 00:32:14.565
<v Speaker 0>So

00:32:16.645 --> 00:32:19.764
<v Speaker 0>let's just try and cut that out first.

00:32:20.565 --> 00:32:22.164
<v Speaker 0>See how many of these we're dealing with

00:32:22.164 --> 00:32:23.365
<v Speaker 0>and then

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:25.419
<v Speaker 0>make an executive decision.

00:32:47.175 --> 00:32:48.775
<v Speaker 0>Should have prepared some jokes.

00:32:51.769 --> 00:32:54.090
<v Speaker 0>Open. That means it's installing things. Although it

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:56.090
<v Speaker 0>says reading package list. So

00:33:11.184 --> 00:33:12.145
<v Speaker 0>Oh, come on.

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:22.990
<v Speaker 0>One minute. I may have installed a package

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:23.710
<v Speaker 0>yet.

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:32.590
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's go and see

00:33:33.355 --> 00:33:37.114
<v Speaker 0>if we can find a Dockerfile

00:33:38.475 --> 00:33:40.714
<v Speaker 0>for one of these dev intense

00:33:42.475 --> 00:33:44.715
<v Speaker 0>before I start reinventing the wheel.

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:52.570
<v Speaker 0>What would that mean if three of them

00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:54.090
<v Speaker 0>don't have a Dockerfile?

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:56.409
<v Speaker 0>I guess,

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:00.490
<v Speaker 0>I've been to

00:34:03.295 --> 00:34:04.175
<v Speaker 0>Scroll.

00:34:06.655 --> 00:34:07.215
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

00:34:08.735 --> 00:34:09.295
<v Speaker 0>same.

00:34:11.135 --> 00:34:12.575
<v Speaker 0>You will do.

00:34:13.775 --> 00:34:15.295
<v Speaker 0>So that has a Docker file.

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:23.390
<v Speaker 0>Maybe the Debian images aren't

00:34:23.390 --> 00:34:25.390
<v Speaker 0>built with a Dockerfile,

00:34:25.390 --> 00:34:26.830
<v Speaker 0>and instead everything

00:34:26.910 --> 00:34:28.350
<v Speaker 0>happens in

00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:30.270
<v Speaker 0>the image tar g z.

00:34:32.415 --> 00:34:34.415
<v Speaker 0>Maybe this comes down to the way

00:34:35.535 --> 00:34:37.855
<v Speaker 0>those images are provided because

00:34:40.655 --> 00:34:41.615
<v Speaker 0>we

00:34:42.175 --> 00:34:44.895
<v Speaker 0>take a look at that helper script.

00:34:45.855 --> 00:34:46.335
<v Speaker 0>What

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:47.870
<v Speaker 0>What happened there?

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:53.470
<v Speaker 0>Run the c did not terminate successfully,

00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:55.630
<v Speaker 0>unable to locate a bunch of packages.

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:58.510
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So we'll probably just use a bin

00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:00.270
<v Speaker 0>two and tweak it rather than dev intent,

00:35:04.335 --> 00:35:06.735
<v Speaker 0>which means we can put that back in.

00:35:06.895 --> 00:35:08.335
<v Speaker 0>Let's run

00:35:08.575 --> 00:35:09.855
<v Speaker 0>the Bin two.

00:35:12.495 --> 00:35:14.335
<v Speaker 0>I think I got this from a sixteen

00:35:14.335 --> 00:35:15.215
<v Speaker 0>o four repository.

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:22.660
<v Speaker 1>Just

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:24.820
<v Speaker 1>call it the right name.

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:29.780
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's leave that running. So

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:33.995
<v Speaker 0>this does pull

00:35:34.155 --> 00:35:36.395
<v Speaker 0>an actual base image rather than, like, an

00:35:36.395 --> 00:35:38.475
<v Speaker 0>ISO installer, which I thought was cool when

00:35:38.475 --> 00:35:39.835
<v Speaker 0>I seen that at the start.

00:35:40.315 --> 00:35:42.635
<v Speaker 0>I wonder if the reason the Debian one

00:35:42.635 --> 00:35:43.435
<v Speaker 0>doesn't exist

00:35:46.859 --> 00:35:48.619
<v Speaker 0>is because they take a different approach to

00:35:48.619 --> 00:35:51.099
<v Speaker 0>the bootstrapper installation stage. I mean, this is

00:35:51.099 --> 00:35:52.940
<v Speaker 0>the base system that I'm just tweaking with

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:55.100
<v Speaker 0>some app get updates and installs,

00:35:55.339 --> 00:35:57.420
<v Speaker 0>whereas the Debian one is probably an actual

00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:58.540
<v Speaker 0>installer

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:00.220
<v Speaker 0>that has to

00:36:01.605 --> 00:36:04.405
<v Speaker 0>be run somewhere. I'm not sure. I will

00:36:04.405 --> 00:36:05.285
<v Speaker 0>find out,

00:36:05.925 --> 00:36:06.405
<v Speaker 0>but

00:36:07.685 --> 00:36:10.165
<v Speaker 0>not gonna focus on that now. So we're

00:36:10.165 --> 00:36:11.525
<v Speaker 0>less than a minute, and I can see

00:36:11.525 --> 00:36:12.725
<v Speaker 0>packages being installed.

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:15.260
<v Speaker 0>That's looking a bit better.

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:18.780
<v Speaker 0>But it does mean does mean

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:22.860
<v Speaker 0>the images I downloaded are currently incorrect.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:23.420
<v Speaker 0>So

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:33.325
<v Speaker 0>16O4C1Small.

00:36:36.205 --> 00:36:37.965
<v Speaker 0>I wonder why that one's not gonna change

00:36:37.965 --> 00:36:38.605
<v Speaker 0>that.

00:36:38.765 --> 00:36:39.645
<v Speaker 0>Which

00:36:39.645 --> 00:36:40.605
<v Speaker 0>one's the latest?

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.320
<v Speaker 0>63.

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:46.040
<v Speaker 0>Alright. That'll do. So

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:49.960
<v Speaker 0>same as last time, let's download

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.079
<v Speaker 0>the artifacts.

00:36:56.345 --> 00:36:57.305
<v Speaker 0>And it's

00:36:58.425 --> 00:36:59.385
<v Speaker 0>kernel

00:37:03.224 --> 00:37:04.025
<v Speaker 0>modules.

00:37:04.825 --> 00:37:06.825
<v Speaker 0>I don't really like talking to myself.

00:37:09.145 --> 00:37:11.460
<v Speaker 0>Should have someone come on and join me.

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:15.940
<v Speaker 0>Right.

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:18.340
<v Speaker 0>So give them a moment to download. Give

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:19.940
<v Speaker 0>this docker image a moment. I mean, I'm

00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:21.540
<v Speaker 0>expecting this to work. This is the docker

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:23.700
<v Speaker 0>file that we grabbed from the repository. If

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:26.415
<v Speaker 0>that fails, I'd be confused.

00:37:30.575 --> 00:37:32.255
<v Speaker 0>So I don't expect that to fail, but

00:37:32.255 --> 00:37:34.335
<v Speaker 0>I also have no idea how long it's

00:37:34.335 --> 00:37:35.295
<v Speaker 0>gonna take.

00:37:37.215 --> 00:37:38.735
<v Speaker 0>Let's take a quick peek at it again.

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:46.280
<v Speaker 0>It's not a lot. Management is decent enough.

00:37:47.559 --> 00:37:49.160
<v Speaker 0>So let's just see.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.880
<v Speaker 0>What can we do just now?

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.960
<v Speaker 0>Check

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:54.760
<v Speaker 0>questions.

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.599
<v Speaker 0>Someone asked me cool questions.

00:38:01.215 --> 00:38:02.735
<v Speaker 0>Who has 20 servers?

00:38:03.215 --> 00:38:04.815
<v Speaker 0>Did I did I miss something?

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:15.460
<v Speaker 0>Rick says, I installed Ansible.

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:17.700
<v Speaker 0>I've got my home LAN 20 ish. So

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:19.460
<v Speaker 0>you got 20 servers in your home LAN?

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:22.100
<v Speaker 0>I hope they're all Pais and not actual

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:23.540
<v Speaker 0>servers. Where would you put them?

00:38:28.395 --> 00:38:29.115
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

00:38:29.515 --> 00:38:31.515
<v Speaker 0>So you're saying I hope salt or some

00:38:31.515 --> 00:38:33.435
<v Speaker 0>derivative in the future when it's more mature

00:38:33.435 --> 00:38:35.355
<v Speaker 0>will give me a viable alternative.

00:38:35.995 --> 00:38:37.755
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Salt is old.

00:38:37.915 --> 00:38:40.395
<v Speaker 0>I think I started using salt in twenty

00:38:40.635 --> 00:38:41.435
<v Speaker 0>fifteen,

00:38:41.435 --> 00:38:42.075
<v Speaker 0>twenty fourteen.

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:44.369
<v Speaker 0>It's been around a few years longer than

00:38:44.369 --> 00:38:45.010
<v Speaker 0>that.

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:47.810
<v Speaker 0>And while I would say it's mature, it

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:50.290
<v Speaker 0>also moves that project really fast. Like, there's

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:51.890
<v Speaker 0>a lot of breaking changes, so you really

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:53.089
<v Speaker 0>gotta kinda keep up with that one.

00:38:54.705 --> 00:38:57.345
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's just share our screen again.

00:38:57.825 --> 00:39:00.145
<v Speaker 0>And what can we do? Let's go back

00:39:00.145 --> 00:39:01.425
<v Speaker 0>to our documentation.

00:39:01.505 --> 00:39:02.625
<v Speaker 0>So assuming

00:39:02.625 --> 00:39:04.465
<v Speaker 0>we test the Dockerfile, which they don't even

00:39:04.465 --> 00:39:05.905
<v Speaker 0>want us to do, but, you know, I'm

00:39:05.905 --> 00:39:06.625
<v Speaker 0>gonna do it anyway.

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.800
<v Speaker 0>We can begin to build a custom image.

00:39:11.119 --> 00:39:14.160
<v Speaker 0>So I am welcome, thank you, to add

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.880
<v Speaker 0>or remove packages as I see fit. And

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.320
<v Speaker 0>in this example,

00:39:20.559 --> 00:39:23.204
<v Speaker 0>we have added an additional additional run command

00:39:23.204 --> 00:39:25.285
<v Speaker 0>to prove that our example

00:39:25.684 --> 00:39:26.405
<v Speaker 0>worked.

00:39:28.325 --> 00:39:29.125
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:39:30.805 --> 00:39:31.685
<v Speaker 0>So this

00:39:32.005 --> 00:39:33.605
<v Speaker 0>downloads the image.

00:39:34.644 --> 00:39:36.325
<v Speaker 0>So we still need to do that. Right?

00:39:36.325 --> 00:39:37.444
<v Speaker 0>We've not done that yet.

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:39.850
<v Speaker 0>So

00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:43.370
<v Speaker 0>let's it takes two parameter three parameters.

00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:45.610
<v Speaker 0>Ah,

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:46.810
<v Speaker 0>cool.

00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:48.170
<v Speaker 0>It ran.

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:51.850
<v Speaker 0>So let's

00:39:51.255 --> 00:39:53.255
<v Speaker 0>tweak our image first then. Oh, no. We

00:39:53.255 --> 00:39:55.095
<v Speaker 0>can't because we still need root,

00:39:56.375 --> 00:39:58.214
<v Speaker 0>and we won't scratch. Okay.

00:39:59.174 --> 00:40:01.015
<v Speaker 0>Now we're back to where we should be.

00:40:01.015 --> 00:40:03.414
<v Speaker 0>Let's add on the package that we want.

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:05.240
<v Speaker 0>I want.

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:07.640
<v Speaker 0>We'll just

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:08.840
<v Speaker 0>before

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:11.640
<v Speaker 0>I invalidate the cache, let's make sure

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:15.000
<v Speaker 0>those are all pretty quick steps. That is

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.520
<v Speaker 0>not gonna take long, so I don't mind

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:18.885
<v Speaker 0>invalidating the cache to here. What I could

00:40:18.885 --> 00:40:20.405
<v Speaker 0>do is jump down here and add it

00:40:20.405 --> 00:40:22.405
<v Speaker 0>here, which would keep the cache complete, and

00:40:22.405 --> 00:40:24.005
<v Speaker 0>it would only run my instruction.

00:40:24.245 --> 00:40:24.885
<v Speaker 0>But

00:40:25.205 --> 00:40:27.125
<v Speaker 0>because of that clean step,

00:40:27.365 --> 00:40:28.645
<v Speaker 0>I would have to do the app update

00:40:28.645 --> 00:40:29.365
<v Speaker 0>again,

00:40:29.605 --> 00:40:30.725
<v Speaker 0>which is, you know,

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:34.970
<v Speaker 0>nobody cares, but

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:37.690
<v Speaker 0>there's just no point. And I can just

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:40.730
<v Speaker 0>add it there and sacrifice a few seconds

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:42.330
<v Speaker 0>either way for that to run. I I

00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:44.570
<v Speaker 0>probably spent more time talking about such a

00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:46.994
<v Speaker 0>trivial situation than I have, Then it would

00:40:46.994 --> 00:40:49.474
<v Speaker 0>have been just to run it. So we're

00:40:49.474 --> 00:40:50.835
<v Speaker 0>gonna add in the next

00:40:51.714 --> 00:40:53.234
<v Speaker 0>system d well,

00:40:53.474 --> 00:40:56.595
<v Speaker 0>as we've seen on the live machine,

00:40:56.755 --> 00:40:58.914
<v Speaker 0>system d enabled and started that service for

00:40:58.914 --> 00:41:00.194
<v Speaker 0>us. So

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:03.260
<v Speaker 0>that's a nice thing about this. Even if

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.740
<v Speaker 0>that runs in a Docker container there,

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:08.700
<v Speaker 0>there wouldn't be system d. But

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:10.460
<v Speaker 0>because it's gonna end up on a real

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:11.180
<v Speaker 0>machine,

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:13.580
<v Speaker 0>hopefully, it just works.

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:15.020
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:41:16.335 --> 00:41:16.975
<v Speaker 0>So

00:41:18.015 --> 00:41:19.135
<v Speaker 0>we're here.

00:41:20.415 --> 00:41:22.255
<v Speaker 0>Call our get a bit to image. Paste

00:41:22.255 --> 00:41:24.415
<v Speaker 0>those arguments we copied. So it's 16 o

00:41:24.415 --> 00:41:24.975
<v Speaker 0>four.

00:41:26.494 --> 00:41:27.775
<v Speaker 0>The current architecture

00:41:28.569 --> 00:41:30.970
<v Speaker 0>and the dot is, I'm assuming,

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:32.650
<v Speaker 0>where to download it to.

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:36.650
<v Speaker 0>I don't have GPG.

00:41:38.410 --> 00:41:39.930
<v Speaker 0>Well, we can fix that.

00:41:48.555 --> 00:41:50.315
<v Speaker 0>Maybe. Yeah. There we go.

00:41:51.035 --> 00:41:52.475
<v Speaker 0>So I'm assuming

00:41:52.555 --> 00:41:54.474
<v Speaker 0>again, I'm sure we could pop open that.

00:41:54.474 --> 00:41:56.300
<v Speaker 0>Let's get a bit to a mini script.

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:57.500
<v Speaker 0>It's just gonna verify

00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:59.580
<v Speaker 0>the signature on the download,

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:02.380
<v Speaker 0>make sure it's not been

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:04.140
<v Speaker 0>hijacked by

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:05.820
<v Speaker 0>the serious hackers.

00:42:07.835 --> 00:42:10.395
<v Speaker 0>I'm not doubting whether nefarious is a word.

00:42:12.395 --> 00:42:14.315
<v Speaker 0>And how streaming does funny things to your

00:42:14.315 --> 00:42:14.875
<v Speaker 0>head?

00:42:17.835 --> 00:42:19.674
<v Speaker 0>Kinda like the word friend. Have you ever

00:42:19.674 --> 00:42:21.275
<v Speaker 0>read it and typed it so many times

00:42:21.275 --> 00:42:23.049
<v Speaker 0>that it doesn't have any meaning anymore? I

00:42:23.049 --> 00:42:24.170
<v Speaker 0>did that yesterday.

00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:26.250
<v Speaker 0>Random segue.

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:30.569
<v Speaker 0>I think that with most words with I

00:42:30.569 --> 00:42:32.089
<v Speaker 0>in it, the more you type it and

00:42:32.089 --> 00:42:34.170
<v Speaker 0>read it, it just kinda loses all meaning.

00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:35.210
<v Speaker 0>Doesn't look real.

00:42:37.345 --> 00:42:40.305
<v Speaker 0>There you go. Wonderful news while I wait.

00:42:42.865 --> 00:42:43.505
<v Speaker 0>So

00:42:43.745 --> 00:42:44.705
<v Speaker 0>let's try again.

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:54.920
<v Speaker 0>Launch d. I assume that's a Mac thing.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.920
<v Speaker 0>It wouldn't bother me so much if everyone's

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:01.400
<v Speaker 0>so slow.

00:43:04.665 --> 00:43:06.745
<v Speaker 0>I'm getting this whole Mac thing. I am

00:43:06.745 --> 00:43:07.545
<v Speaker 0>an on

00:43:07.865 --> 00:43:09.865
<v Speaker 0>pretty much every other machine and just type

00:43:09.865 --> 00:43:11.225
<v Speaker 0>in Pac Manor. Yeah.

00:43:12.345 --> 00:43:13.945
<v Speaker 0>It's just super fast.

00:43:17.145 --> 00:43:19.305
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So it fetched the keys.

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:27.359
<v Speaker 0>These were not on the requirements list.

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:33.359
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:43:36.105 --> 00:43:36.665
<v Speaker 0>So

00:43:36.905 --> 00:43:38.265
<v Speaker 0>let's go here.

00:43:40.665 --> 00:43:43.305
<v Speaker 0>Chat two five six.

00:43:46.745 --> 00:43:47.945
<v Speaker 0>Let's just take that. No.

00:43:53.059 --> 00:43:54.099
<v Speaker 0>I

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:57.780
<v Speaker 0>thought it changed my search. Right? Okay.

00:43:58.420 --> 00:43:59.859
<v Speaker 0>So

00:43:59.859 --> 00:44:01.700
<v Speaker 0>someone has asked this before.

00:44:07.615 --> 00:44:09.775
<v Speaker 0>And the package we need,

00:44:13.454 --> 00:44:14.895
<v Speaker 0>core utilities.

00:44:16.175 --> 00:44:17.214
<v Speaker 0>I should've run that.

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:28.300
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:29.260
<v Speaker 0>Let's try

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:30.700
<v Speaker 0>one more time.

00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:34.380
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:44:37.385 --> 00:44:38.985
<v Speaker 0>So what did we get?

00:44:41.305 --> 00:44:42.585
<v Speaker 0>We got

00:44:44.185 --> 00:44:46.425
<v Speaker 0>a bunch of base 16 o four based

00:44:46.425 --> 00:44:47.465
<v Speaker 0>Tarzip,

00:44:47.625 --> 00:44:49.625
<v Speaker 0>and it has created

00:44:49.625 --> 00:44:50.665
<v Speaker 0>a SIM link

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:54.260
<v Speaker 0>called RootFS.

00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:57.940
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:00.260
<v Speaker 0>Let's move

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:03.620
<v Speaker 0>the SIM link and the image. Let's move

00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:07.265
<v Speaker 0>the shares in case It does enter verification

00:45:08.464 --> 00:45:10.545
<v Speaker 0>into our debian directory,

00:45:13.265 --> 00:45:15.744
<v Speaker 0>which means this is now satisfied.

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:22.760
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:24.680
<v Speaker 0>Close all that down.

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:29.640
<v Speaker 0>Maybe.

00:45:32.119 --> 00:45:32.600
<v Speaker 0>I do.

00:45:33.335 --> 00:45:34.535
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We're good.

00:45:37.174 --> 00:45:38.615
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Next.

00:45:39.894 --> 00:45:41.095
<v Speaker 0>We will get there.

00:45:42.375 --> 00:45:44.535
<v Speaker 0>Now we can build

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:46.980
<v Speaker 0>our image.

00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:53.380
<v Speaker 0>Oh, let's do it's been to Internet and

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:55.380
<v Speaker 0>go oh, wrong directory.

00:46:03.275 --> 00:46:06.075
<v Speaker 0>Nice. Let's give that a minute. So once

00:46:06.075 --> 00:46:07.515
<v Speaker 0>that finishes building,

00:46:07.595 --> 00:46:09.915
<v Speaker 0>we're gonna save the image

00:46:11.515 --> 00:46:15.515
<v Speaker 0>as a tar and then use

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:16.380
<v Speaker 0>our packet to image

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:20.620
<v Speaker 0>to do something.

00:46:20.859 --> 00:46:22.540
<v Speaker 0>And so it seems to be just reading

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:23.900
<v Speaker 0>on the tar and giving us a different

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:24.540
<v Speaker 0>tar.

00:46:25.099 --> 00:46:26.380
<v Speaker 0>So let's just

00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:28.300
<v Speaker 0>see if we can work this out.

00:46:32.555 --> 00:46:34.555
<v Speaker 0>So what does it do?

00:46:36.875 --> 00:46:37.675
<v Speaker 0>So it needs

00:46:38.475 --> 00:46:40.875
<v Speaker 0>that's a weird way to check for g

00:46:40.875 --> 00:46:41.835
<v Speaker 0>binaries,

00:46:42.795 --> 00:46:43.995
<v Speaker 0>but I guess it works.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:47.720
<v Speaker 0>See?

00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:49.000
<v Speaker 0>Does

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:50.760
<v Speaker 0>that work in a Mac?

00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:52.520
<v Speaker 0>Sure does.

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:56.200
<v Speaker 0>So we need tar, j q, and make

00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:56.680
<v Speaker 0>temp.

00:46:57.815 --> 00:47:00.055
<v Speaker 0>I'm pretty positive I have them anyway.

00:47:04.214 --> 00:47:06.214
<v Speaker 0>Make temp is a great command, actually.

00:47:06.934 --> 00:47:09.494
<v Speaker 0>I have it aliased kind of to TMP,

00:47:09.494 --> 00:47:11.575
<v Speaker 0>which is a magic function.

00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:15.100
<v Speaker 0>See these end to the main tab. I

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:17.500
<v Speaker 0>do that whenever I wanna remove my bash

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:18.300
<v Speaker 0>history

00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:20.860
<v Speaker 0>from, like, a livestream or something because

00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:22.300
<v Speaker 0>my bash history

00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:23.820
<v Speaker 0>is

00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:24.940
<v Speaker 0>per directory.

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:28.775
<v Speaker 0>K. Nice.

00:47:30.455 --> 00:47:31.095
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:47:31.415 --> 00:47:33.015
<v Speaker 0>What does it do next?

00:47:33.895 --> 00:47:35.895
<v Speaker 0>So

00:47:40.615 --> 00:47:42.855
<v Speaker 0>it

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:44.069
<v Speaker 0>is but it goes yeah. So the docker

00:47:44.069 --> 00:47:45.430
<v Speaker 0>image format works.

00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:48.470
<v Speaker 0>And that if I were to manually extract

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:50.470
<v Speaker 0>this after we do the docker save, if

00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:52.310
<v Speaker 0>I were to manually extract that, we would

00:47:52.310 --> 00:47:54.230
<v Speaker 0>actually get then a different

00:47:54.765 --> 00:47:56.684
<v Speaker 0>kind of whatever it's just directories over different

00:47:56.684 --> 00:47:58.365
<v Speaker 0>tarzets for each layer,

00:47:58.924 --> 00:48:01.325
<v Speaker 0>which can then be exploded and mounted as

00:48:01.325 --> 00:48:02.205
<v Speaker 0>an overlay.

00:48:05.005 --> 00:48:07.760
<v Speaker 0>So what does overlay mean? I think we've

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:09.599
<v Speaker 0>got a few minutes, so I'm just gonna

00:48:09.599 --> 00:48:11.200
<v Speaker 0>use my bad failures.

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:13.760
<v Speaker 0>Let's do it. Make one forget I forget

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:14.880
<v Speaker 0>the commands here.

00:48:15.839 --> 00:48:18.160
<v Speaker 0>What we have is two directories.

00:48:24.305 --> 00:48:25.905
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Potential fails.

00:48:30.225 --> 00:48:32.785
<v Speaker 0>Main main fail. Two directories each of us

00:48:32.785 --> 00:48:34.945
<v Speaker 0>want to fail. Now what an overlay would

00:48:34.945 --> 00:48:36.705
<v Speaker 0>allow me to do

00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:39.880
<v Speaker 0>is

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:42.680
<v Speaker 0>the match t overlay,

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:45.960
<v Speaker 0>one, two, three.

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:47.160
<v Speaker 0>Nope.

00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:49.480
<v Speaker 0>Maybe that's a matching, actually.

00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:51.000
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no. I did

00:48:51.734 --> 00:48:52.775
<v Speaker 0>try.

00:48:56.454 --> 00:48:59.655
<v Speaker 0>Let's do a run r m I p

00:48:59.974 --> 00:49:01.255
<v Speaker 0>three

00:49:01.335 --> 00:49:01.894
<v Speaker 0>dash.

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:05.880
<v Speaker 0>The max angle could just be I forgot

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:07.880
<v Speaker 0>the command. But before I look it up,

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:11.560
<v Speaker 0>we will test. So make one, two, three,

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:13.960
<v Speaker 0>touch one one, two two,

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:15.560
<v Speaker 0>overlay,

00:49:17.545 --> 00:49:19.305
<v Speaker 0>One, two, three.

00:49:20.585 --> 00:49:21.545
<v Speaker 0>I have root.

00:49:24.345 --> 00:49:26.905
<v Speaker 0>Alright. That's

00:49:26.905 --> 00:49:27.785
<v Speaker 0>overlay

00:49:27.865 --> 00:49:28.665
<v Speaker 0>Linux.

00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:34.140
<v Speaker 0>Dash t overlay.

00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:34.940
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:36.859
<v Speaker 0>So the options are lower there, upper down,

00:49:36.859 --> 00:49:37.580
<v Speaker 0>work there.

00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:41.660
<v Speaker 0>Anyway, it makes sense when you see it.

00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:44.619
<v Speaker 0>How are supposed to remember that crap? Let's

00:49:44.619 --> 00:49:46.300
<v Speaker 0>try it on the Mac first then. So

00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:47.260
<v Speaker 0>we're back to here.

00:49:49.075 --> 00:49:50.435
<v Speaker 0>Our loader

00:49:51.875 --> 00:49:52.675
<v Speaker 0>is

00:49:57.795 --> 00:49:59.395
<v Speaker 0>current directory one.

00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:08.710
<v Speaker 0>I haven't started this now.

00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:14.150
<v Speaker 0>Working directory, I don't think it's important,

00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:15.830
<v Speaker 0>and I've narrowed it to three.

00:50:23.595 --> 00:50:25.595
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We will try one more time in

00:50:25.595 --> 00:50:26.315
<v Speaker 0>the container

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:33.180
<v Speaker 0>and done with this demo.

00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:35.180
<v Speaker 0>That's too adventurous.

00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:38.860
<v Speaker 0>I don't know I made that two commands.

00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:39.340
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:43.020
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'm right. Alright.

00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:44.060
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:50:46.395 --> 00:50:47.515
<v Speaker 0>Let's try

00:50:47.515 --> 00:50:49.115
<v Speaker 0>break the last button.

00:50:53.195 --> 00:50:54.475
<v Speaker 0>Last thing. Promise.

00:50:59.339 --> 00:51:00.700
<v Speaker 0>Invalid argument.

00:51:05.339 --> 00:51:06.220
<v Speaker 0>Screw it.

00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:07.900
<v Speaker 0>What would happen

00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:09.660
<v Speaker 0>is you'd be able to type l s

00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:11.660
<v Speaker 0>three, and I would actually see files one

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:13.685
<v Speaker 0>and two because it would overlay them together

00:51:13.685 --> 00:51:16.005
<v Speaker 0>and merge these into the mesh. So you

00:51:16.005 --> 00:51:18.565
<v Speaker 0>get a single unified view of multiple directories.

00:51:18.565 --> 00:51:20.085
<v Speaker 0>It's actually a really cool feature when you

00:51:20.085 --> 00:51:21.125
<v Speaker 0>remember how it works.

00:51:22.165 --> 00:51:23.525
<v Speaker 0>Cool. Image built.

00:51:24.245 --> 00:51:25.205
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Next.

00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:28.810
<v Speaker 0>So yeah. That's what it was. So when

00:51:28.810 --> 00:51:31.690
<v Speaker 0>you explore the target from a Docker image,

00:51:31.690 --> 00:51:33.290
<v Speaker 0>you get all those layers as their own

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:34.970
<v Speaker 0>target fails, I think it is, which can

00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:36.490
<v Speaker 0>then each be extracted down to the home

00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:36.970
<v Speaker 0>directory.

00:51:37.485 --> 00:51:40.845
<v Speaker 0>And what Docker does is provide overlay

00:51:40.845 --> 00:51:42.605
<v Speaker 0>of all of those directories for a single

00:51:42.605 --> 00:51:43.725
<v Speaker 0>unified view.

00:51:44.925 --> 00:51:46.365
<v Speaker 0>And the working directory is for the the

00:51:46.365 --> 00:51:48.125
<v Speaker 0>copy and write stuff, but we can cover

00:51:48.125 --> 00:51:49.325
<v Speaker 0>that in our station.

00:51:49.725 --> 00:51:51.485
<v Speaker 0>So this extracts all of those images.

00:51:53.859 --> 00:51:54.820
<v Speaker 0>And

00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:00.420
<v Speaker 0>just creates a new image.

00:52:02.099 --> 00:52:04.180
<v Speaker 0>That's it. So it's just

00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:08.525
<v Speaker 0>it's just getting all the layers, merge them

00:52:08.525 --> 00:52:10.765
<v Speaker 0>together, and create a single image. Right? Like,

00:52:10.765 --> 00:52:11.805
<v Speaker 0>nothing fancy.

00:52:12.365 --> 00:52:13.645
<v Speaker 0>Cool. So

00:52:16.285 --> 00:52:17.645
<v Speaker 0>let's quickly pop over.

00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:21.800
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Cool.

00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:25.000
<v Speaker 0>If you have questions on that image stuff,

00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:26.280
<v Speaker 0>let me know.

00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:28.760
<v Speaker 0>So let's save

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.120
<v Speaker 0>our image.

00:52:34.875 --> 00:52:37.755
<v Speaker 0>So we called it Aventure

00:52:40.875 --> 00:52:41.995
<v Speaker 0>NGINX,

00:52:43.115 --> 00:52:45.275
<v Speaker 0>and I would just leave that as the

00:52:45.275 --> 00:52:45.915
<v Speaker 0>exact same.

00:52:54.330 --> 00:52:57.130
<v Speaker 0>I don't think it should take too long.

00:52:59.290 --> 00:53:00.490
<v Speaker 0>Give me a moment.

00:53:01.530 --> 00:53:03.530
<v Speaker 0>And then what we wanna do is run

00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:06.185
<v Speaker 0>our packet saved image passing in

00:53:06.265 --> 00:53:07.705
<v Speaker 0>through standard and

00:53:08.265 --> 00:53:10.025
<v Speaker 0>that tar and then

00:53:10.425 --> 00:53:11.945
<v Speaker 0>the exploded version

00:53:12.025 --> 00:53:14.105
<v Speaker 0>to image dot tar dot g t.

00:53:16.745 --> 00:53:18.820
<v Speaker 0>Then what do we do? Then

00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:20.420
<v Speaker 0>we

00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:22.020
<v Speaker 0>can see all that stuff,

00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:24.020
<v Speaker 0>and then we commit it to get and

00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:25.780
<v Speaker 0>push it. Okay.

00:53:28.819 --> 00:53:31.060
<v Speaker 0>So what do we wanna do?

00:53:31.859 --> 00:53:34.915
<v Speaker 0>Let's bring in that packet script first.

00:53:35.635 --> 00:53:37.635
<v Speaker 0>So we're gonna run packet to the image

00:53:37.635 --> 00:53:38.915
<v Speaker 0>standard in

00:53:38.994 --> 00:53:39.955
<v Speaker 0>as

00:53:42.835 --> 00:53:43.555
<v Speaker 0>that,

00:53:43.955 --> 00:53:45.155
<v Speaker 0>and we'll

00:53:45.155 --> 00:53:47.155
<v Speaker 0>call this packet. We're gonna do

00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:50.090
<v Speaker 0>and it does g zipped it, so let's

00:53:50.090 --> 00:53:50.890
<v Speaker 0>do that.

00:53:56.650 --> 00:53:58.010
<v Speaker 0>Not Mac friendly.

00:53:59.770 --> 00:54:02.410
<v Speaker 0>Let's fix that. I'm not Mac friendly either.

00:54:02.410 --> 00:54:03.050
<v Speaker 0>That's okay.

00:54:05.744 --> 00:54:07.425
<v Speaker 0>So it doesn't like

00:54:08.704 --> 00:54:09.985
<v Speaker 0>this flag,

00:54:10.944 --> 00:54:12.465
<v Speaker 0>which I don't believe

00:54:13.825 --> 00:54:14.545
<v Speaker 0>is important.

00:54:19.079 --> 00:54:21.000
<v Speaker 0>I removed you.

00:54:23.079 --> 00:54:24.039
<v Speaker 0>Two of them. Right.

00:54:30.775 --> 00:54:32.535
<v Speaker 0>Oh, does that expect us to run on

00:54:32.535 --> 00:54:34.055
<v Speaker 0>the notes? Why is it

00:54:37.095 --> 00:54:38.615
<v Speaker 0>why is it creating devices?

00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:44.940
<v Speaker 0>Houston, we've had a problem.

00:54:57.954 --> 00:54:58.835
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:54:59.555 --> 00:55:00.755
<v Speaker 0>What can we do?

00:55:04.434 --> 00:55:05.395
<v Speaker 0>Let's cheat.

00:55:06.595 --> 00:55:07.315
<v Speaker 0>So

00:55:07.875 --> 00:55:10.515
<v Speaker 0>we're now getting into I have no idea

00:55:10.515 --> 00:55:12.915
<v Speaker 0>what I'm kidding. Maybe I wanna be doing,

00:55:12.915 --> 00:55:14.970
<v Speaker 0>but I'm gonna try and get around this

00:55:14.970 --> 00:55:16.010
<v Speaker 0>maxing

00:55:16.090 --> 00:55:16.730
<v Speaker 0>by

00:55:17.370 --> 00:55:18.570
<v Speaker 0>using a container.

00:55:21.690 --> 00:55:23.850
<v Speaker 0>Actually, it's been through a 16 o four

00:55:23.850 --> 00:55:26.010
<v Speaker 0>since that's what we have. Yes. Everything so

00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:27.850
<v Speaker 0>far. We're gonna note in

00:55:28.724 --> 00:55:31.444
<v Speaker 0>this directory to code and set the working

00:55:31.444 --> 00:55:33.125
<v Speaker 0>directory to code.

00:55:34.644 --> 00:55:35.525
<v Speaker 0>And

00:55:35.525 --> 00:55:37.765
<v Speaker 0>I wanna run bash.

00:55:40.244 --> 00:55:41.684
<v Speaker 0>And I need to tell it to run

00:55:41.684 --> 00:55:42.164
<v Speaker 0>a container.

00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:48.470
<v Speaker 0>We'll try and run a packet save to

00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:50.390
<v Speaker 0>image thing from here.

00:55:52.310 --> 00:55:53.750
<v Speaker 0>See what happens.

00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.390
<v Speaker 0>So

00:55:58.085 --> 00:55:59.125
<v Speaker 0>why has that

00:55:59.925 --> 00:56:00.725
<v Speaker 0>failed?

00:56:08.085 --> 00:56:09.445
<v Speaker 0>Let's just echo that command.

00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:14.780
<v Speaker 0>Looks fine.

00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:19.580
<v Speaker 0>Oh, wait. It can't

00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:20.300
<v Speaker 0>find

00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:24.220
<v Speaker 0>dolly. I wish it must have come after

00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:26.380
<v Speaker 0>all the parameters, and I definitely

00:56:26.765 --> 00:56:27.725
<v Speaker 0>know that.

00:56:29.565 --> 00:56:30.685
<v Speaker 0>Rawkode

00:56:30.685 --> 00:56:32.365
<v Speaker 0>packet images,

00:56:32.445 --> 00:56:33.325
<v Speaker 0>Debian.

00:56:35.645 --> 00:56:37.165
<v Speaker 0>It's the wrong button.

00:56:37.485 --> 00:56:38.765
<v Speaker 0>Oh, it's Mac.

00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:42.730
<v Speaker 0>Okay. I've been to

00:56:45.690 --> 00:56:47.130
<v Speaker 0>so

00:56:49.530 --> 00:56:50.250
<v Speaker 0>this

00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:52.650
<v Speaker 0>may or may not work.

00:56:56.645 --> 00:56:58.885
<v Speaker 0>And put a bit to

00:57:00.485 --> 00:57:01.525
<v Speaker 0>output.

00:57:02.965 --> 00:57:04.405
<v Speaker 0>Accurate a bit to

00:57:06.565 --> 00:57:08.405
<v Speaker 0>now I don't have all the requirements,

00:57:11.130 --> 00:57:13.049
<v Speaker 0>which is probably not gonna exist in a

00:57:13.049 --> 00:57:15.130
<v Speaker 0>vintage sex female, and I'll be pleasantly surprised

00:57:15.130 --> 00:57:15.849
<v Speaker 0>if it does.

00:57:30.705 --> 00:57:31.505
<v Speaker 0>Yay.

00:57:33.825 --> 00:57:35.825
<v Speaker 0>I feel as excited as I get, by

00:57:35.825 --> 00:57:36.145
<v Speaker 0>the way.

00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:40.619
<v Speaker 0>Working.

00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:47.500
<v Speaker 0>Doctor, you are a wonderful thing sometimes.

00:57:55.755 --> 00:57:56.555
<v Speaker 0>So,

00:57:56.795 --> 00:57:59.355
<v Speaker 0>hopefully, this won't take too long. Probably gonna

00:57:59.355 --> 00:58:00.795
<v Speaker 0>take longer than it would have if I

00:58:00.795 --> 00:58:03.194
<v Speaker 0>was on native Linux because we are going

00:58:03.194 --> 00:58:05.194
<v Speaker 0>through an annoying

00:58:07.930 --> 00:58:09.610
<v Speaker 0>clone of a fail system or sync of

00:58:09.610 --> 00:58:11.850
<v Speaker 0>the fail system. I can't remember what

00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:14.650
<v Speaker 0>Mac OS is using and Docker are using.

00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:18.410
<v Speaker 0>I just remember it being painfully slow when

00:58:18.410 --> 00:58:21.530
<v Speaker 0>working with interpreting languages with Python and PHP.

00:58:23.175 --> 00:58:24.135
<v Speaker 0>So that's me.

00:58:24.775 --> 00:58:26.135
<v Speaker 0>Take a little bit longer than I would

00:58:26.135 --> 00:58:27.015
<v Speaker 0>have expected.

00:58:28.535 --> 00:58:31.735
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's see what's next. So we delete

00:58:31.735 --> 00:58:33.575
<v Speaker 0>all the crud, and then we're doing the

00:58:33.575 --> 00:58:34.375
<v Speaker 0>LFS.

00:58:34.615 --> 00:58:34.855
<v Speaker 0>So

00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:38.190
<v Speaker 0>it

00:58:39.230 --> 00:58:41.630
<v Speaker 0>wants me to store we didn't create a

00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:42.830
<v Speaker 0>get attributes.

00:58:46.270 --> 00:58:47.070
<v Speaker 0>But the

00:58:47.310 --> 00:58:49.390
<v Speaker 0>oh, the fact this LFS track will create

00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:50.510
<v Speaker 0>the get attributes. So I won't have to

00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:51.150
<v Speaker 0>do that manually.

00:58:53.245 --> 00:58:55.005
<v Speaker 0>Then we push all of that.

00:58:55.565 --> 00:58:57.085
<v Speaker 0>And then what do we do? So then

00:58:57.085 --> 00:58:59.085
<v Speaker 0>to deploy our custom image,

00:59:00.685 --> 00:59:04.045
<v Speaker 0>we use a special version of the user

00:59:04.045 --> 00:59:04.845
<v Speaker 0>data

00:59:05.005 --> 00:59:06.685
<v Speaker 0>to tell it to pull it.

00:59:08.310 --> 00:59:09.110
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:15.510
<v Speaker 0>And that's it.

00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:18.710
<v Speaker 0>Fingers

00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:19.430
<v Speaker 0>crossed.

00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:21.590
<v Speaker 0>So let's drop it less.

00:59:22.825 --> 00:59:23.705
<v Speaker 0>Let's

00:59:23.705 --> 00:59:24.425
<v Speaker 0>do

00:59:26.025 --> 00:59:27.545
<v Speaker 0>get LFS

00:59:27.545 --> 00:59:29.705
<v Speaker 0>track start dot.

00:59:31.305 --> 00:59:32.585
<v Speaker 0>I can just

00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:35.880
<v Speaker 0>I'm

00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:37.880
<v Speaker 0>just gonna track one mail.

00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:40.440
<v Speaker 0>Their packet

00:59:41.559 --> 00:59:42.200
<v Speaker 0>one.

00:59:43.079 --> 00:59:45.640
<v Speaker 0>Oh, let's fix that. I don't see how

00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:46.599
<v Speaker 0>to start with nothing.

00:59:48.565 --> 00:59:50.885
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So let's track that. That should create

00:59:50.885 --> 00:59:51.925
<v Speaker 0>the get attributes.

00:59:52.485 --> 00:59:53.285
<v Speaker 0>Perfect.

00:59:54.965 --> 00:59:57.285
<v Speaker 0>I'm not gonna delete stuff. I'm just gonna

00:59:57.285 --> 00:59:59.525
<v Speaker 0>add the files that I think it wanted

00:59:59.525 --> 01:00:00.325
<v Speaker 0>me to add.

01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:07.650
<v Speaker 0>I don't want no. I don't want the

01:00:07.650 --> 01:00:09.970
<v Speaker 0>shadows. The only wanted attributes

01:00:11.090 --> 01:00:13.010
<v Speaker 0>on the Dockerfile.

01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:13.970
<v Speaker 0>Yep. We've got that.

01:00:18.455 --> 01:00:19.095
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

01:00:19.655 --> 01:00:21.335
<v Speaker 0>And what do I do next?

01:00:22.375 --> 01:00:23.495
<v Speaker 0>Just image.

01:00:25.255 --> 01:00:26.775
<v Speaker 0>That I can handle.

01:00:27.655 --> 01:00:29.335
<v Speaker 0>Commit. So

01:00:29.335 --> 01:00:31.410
<v Speaker 0>let's call this feature.

01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:35.170
<v Speaker 0>Open to image with engine x.

01:00:39.730 --> 01:00:41.330
<v Speaker 0>That's the repository

01:00:41.970 --> 01:00:42.849
<v Speaker 0>that exist.

01:00:48.585 --> 01:00:49.385
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

01:00:49.945 --> 01:00:50.905
<v Speaker 0>Which is

01:00:54.105 --> 01:00:55.145
<v Speaker 0>not important.

01:00:56.185 --> 01:00:56.985
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

01:00:57.225 --> 01:00:58.825
<v Speaker 0>Yes. Remote

01:00:58.825 --> 01:01:00.185
<v Speaker 0>and origin.

01:01:12.319 --> 01:01:13.280
<v Speaker 0>We get past.

01:01:15.275 --> 01:01:18.155
<v Speaker 0>I get I get initial

01:01:18.155 --> 01:01:19.275
<v Speaker 0>branch.

01:01:19.755 --> 01:01:21.435
<v Speaker 0>That's

01:01:21.435 --> 01:01:22.395
<v Speaker 0>the thing there.

01:01:24.715 --> 01:01:25.435
<v Speaker 0>Good.

01:01:27.115 --> 01:01:28.075
<v Speaker 0>At LFS

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:29.520
<v Speaker 0>track

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:30.560
<v Speaker 0>Debian

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:32.240
<v Speaker 0>packet. It's been two.

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:37.760
<v Speaker 0>I wanna move that catch because, actually, I

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.520
<v Speaker 0>don't want it to be inside of that

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:40.240
<v Speaker 0>directory.

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:43.200
<v Speaker 0>And then get at Debian

01:01:43.805 --> 01:01:45.325
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Debian.

01:01:48.365 --> 01:01:49.165
<v Speaker 0>And

01:01:50.605 --> 01:01:51.725
<v Speaker 0>save the directory.

01:01:53.645 --> 01:01:55.165
<v Speaker 0>Why am I not oh, no.

01:02:02.910 --> 01:02:04.430
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. And so

01:02:04.830 --> 01:02:06.910
<v Speaker 0>I only tracked the packet one, but I

01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:08.350
<v Speaker 0>actually wanna track those

01:02:08.830 --> 01:02:11.710
<v Speaker 0>other ones. I'm just having a major fail.

01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:13.390
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's go in here.

01:02:14.154 --> 01:02:14.875
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:02:14.954 --> 01:02:16.795
<v Speaker 0>Try there's a reason they use star dot

01:02:16.795 --> 01:02:18.795
<v Speaker 0>tarzip, but I don't want to delete all

01:02:18.795 --> 01:02:19.915
<v Speaker 0>of my tarzips.

01:02:20.714 --> 01:02:23.674
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we're gonna track this one, this

01:02:23.674 --> 01:02:25.275
<v Speaker 0>one, this one, and this one.

01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:30.580
<v Speaker 0>I also want to add a Docker file.

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:34.100
<v Speaker 0>And

01:02:41.215 --> 01:02:42.175
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

01:02:47.055 --> 01:02:48.335
<v Speaker 0>Do I

01:02:49.695 --> 01:02:51.775
<v Speaker 0>need to add those separately?

01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:58.580
<v Speaker 0>Hope I'm doing the right thing here.

01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:03.940
<v Speaker 0>You just don't add them even though we

01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:05.140
<v Speaker 0>got the attributes. Cool.

01:03:05.994 --> 01:03:07.675
<v Speaker 0>That will do the right thing, I'm sure.

01:03:07.675 --> 01:03:08.235
<v Speaker 0>So

01:03:09.275 --> 01:03:12.635
<v Speaker 0>and that kernel devian module devian

01:03:14.234 --> 01:03:15.835
<v Speaker 0>kernel modules

01:03:16.875 --> 01:03:17.675
<v Speaker 0>in it

01:03:17.835 --> 01:03:18.555
<v Speaker 0>and packet.

01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:32.630
<v Speaker 0>It'd be nice to me.

01:03:35.385 --> 01:03:36.265
<v Speaker 0>Commit.

01:03:37.625 --> 01:03:39.545
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Push origin

01:03:40.265 --> 01:03:41.145
<v Speaker 0>latest.

01:03:41.625 --> 01:03:42.825
<v Speaker 0>Update rest.

01:03:44.665 --> 01:03:46.585
<v Speaker 0>Get remote at origin.

01:03:49.650 --> 01:03:51.010
<v Speaker 0>Push YubiKey.

01:03:52.690 --> 01:03:53.650
<v Speaker 0>Push

01:03:54.290 --> 01:03:55.650
<v Speaker 0>YubiKey.

01:03:59.650 --> 01:04:00.050
<v Speaker 0>Wait.

01:04:04.035 --> 01:04:04.915
<v Speaker 0>I mean,

01:04:05.234 --> 01:04:07.235
<v Speaker 0>think it's pushing. My UB keys.

01:04:08.915 --> 01:04:10.115
<v Speaker 0>Oh, there we go. Okay.

01:04:22.010 --> 01:04:23.370
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully, this is

01:04:24.170 --> 01:04:24.730
<v Speaker 0>quickish.

01:04:35.255 --> 01:04:37.415
<v Speaker 0>I was hoping I'd keep this under an

01:04:37.415 --> 01:04:38.055
<v Speaker 0>hour,

01:04:38.535 --> 01:04:39.815
<v Speaker 0>and we're close,

01:04:39.975 --> 01:04:41.415
<v Speaker 0>but we are at the hour.

01:04:43.550 --> 01:04:44.270
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:48.270
<v Speaker 0>So

01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:50.110
<v Speaker 0>when this goes up,

01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:51.230
<v Speaker 0>we should

01:04:51.310 --> 01:04:52.910
<v Speaker 0>be able to refresh this.

01:04:53.230 --> 01:04:54.830
<v Speaker 0>It's not quite there yet

01:04:55.965 --> 01:04:57.645
<v Speaker 0>and deploy

01:04:57.725 --> 01:04:58.765
<v Speaker 0>like so.

01:04:59.805 --> 01:05:02.205
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I really should've shut it down.

01:05:03.325 --> 01:05:04.205
<v Speaker 0>Bye bye.

01:05:06.605 --> 01:05:07.805
<v Speaker 0>So the case doesn't matter,

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.400
<v Speaker 0>but, you know, I asked for it with

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:11.680
<v Speaker 0>a capital d. So

01:05:12.559 --> 01:05:13.440
<v Speaker 0>okay.

01:05:16.319 --> 01:05:17.840
<v Speaker 0>So Amsterdam.

01:05:19.359 --> 01:05:20.640
<v Speaker 0>See one small

01:05:22.855 --> 01:05:23.815
<v Speaker 0>custom.

01:05:23.815 --> 01:05:25.575
<v Speaker 0>Nope. That's custom pixie.

01:05:28.935 --> 01:05:29.815
<v Speaker 0>Does it matter?

01:05:34.299 --> 01:05:35.500
<v Speaker 0>Does it say

01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:43.020
<v Speaker 0>yeah. So I think I just pick Ubuntu,

01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:44.780
<v Speaker 0>but then use my own flavor.

01:05:46.785 --> 01:05:48.705
<v Speaker 0>So let's call this

01:05:48.785 --> 01:05:50.625
<v Speaker 0>Ubuntu NGINX.

01:05:50.865 --> 01:05:53.265
<v Speaker 0>Add the user data that it expects

01:05:54.944 --> 01:05:56.145
<v Speaker 0>and point

01:05:56.145 --> 01:05:58.145
<v Speaker 0>it to the correct repository.

01:05:58.224 --> 01:06:00.224
<v Speaker 0>So getthat.com.

01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:05.900
<v Speaker 0>It was in a supplementary tray.

01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:13.020
<v Speaker 0>Sugar.

01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:14.220
<v Speaker 0>How do I make that work?

01:06:17.065 --> 01:06:19.305
<v Speaker 0>There's a reason these are all branches in

01:06:19.305 --> 01:06:20.505
<v Speaker 0>a root directory. Right?

01:06:42.050 --> 01:06:42.690
<v Speaker 0>Dress.

01:06:45.075 --> 01:06:46.755
<v Speaker 0>So this is just using

01:06:50.115 --> 01:06:51.474
<v Speaker 0>code config

01:06:51.474 --> 01:06:52.595
<v Speaker 0>images.

01:06:52.595 --> 01:06:54.675
<v Speaker 0>I mean, is this a standardized

01:06:55.395 --> 01:06:55.875
<v Speaker 0>thing?

01:06:58.980 --> 01:06:59.620
<v Speaker 0>I

01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:02.980
<v Speaker 0>just click Google, get results that actually make

01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:03.300
<v Speaker 0>sense.

01:07:16.725 --> 01:07:19.045
<v Speaker 0>Let's not fit with this. Let's

01:07:19.925 --> 01:07:21.685
<v Speaker 0>wait for this to finish, create a branch,

01:07:21.685 --> 01:07:23.285
<v Speaker 0>and move the files to the root. Let's

01:07:23.285 --> 01:07:24.485
<v Speaker 0>just push it and test it,

01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:27.510
<v Speaker 0>and then I'll work out if I can

01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:29.830
<v Speaker 0>use a directory approach later.

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:35.190
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I never really thought of that.

01:07:40.404 --> 01:07:42.244
<v Speaker 0>Uploaded 350

01:07:42.244 --> 01:07:42.965
<v Speaker 0>meg.

01:07:44.645 --> 01:07:45.605
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully, not

01:07:46.404 --> 01:07:47.605
<v Speaker 0>lot to go.

01:07:49.605 --> 01:07:50.965
<v Speaker 0>Packet images.

01:07:52.244 --> 01:07:53.285
<v Speaker 0>Let's go into 10.

01:07:57.119 --> 01:07:58.640
<v Speaker 0>So three ninety,

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:00.000
<v Speaker 0>and those are all pretty small.

01:08:07.865 --> 01:08:09.145
<v Speaker 0>So it shouldn't

01:08:09.385 --> 01:08:10.825
<v Speaker 0>have much more to go.

01:08:15.545 --> 01:08:18.745
<v Speaker 0>Not sure why it's larger

01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:23.500
<v Speaker 0>than four fifty so far. All the modules

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:24.940
<v Speaker 0>are actually quite big. Alright. Okay.

01:08:34.375 --> 01:08:35.415
<v Speaker 0>Come on, computer.

01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:50.020
<v Speaker 0>So what I'm gonna do is

01:08:50.899 --> 01:08:52.659
<v Speaker 0>switch. I see.

01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:54.899
<v Speaker 0>Then to engine x.

01:08:55.939 --> 01:08:56.659
<v Speaker 0>Move

01:08:56.979 --> 01:08:58.020
<v Speaker 0>my attributes.

01:08:59.535 --> 01:09:01.694
<v Speaker 0>Let's just go and save that directory.

01:09:02.255 --> 01:09:05.215
<v Speaker 0>Put the attributes and the modules, the kernel,

01:09:05.215 --> 01:09:06.415
<v Speaker 0>and the packet

01:09:06.814 --> 01:09:07.535
<v Speaker 0>image

01:09:08.095 --> 01:09:09.055
<v Speaker 0>of a directory.

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.240
<v Speaker 0>Let's get

01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:15.239
<v Speaker 0>add those files again.

01:09:21.399 --> 01:09:21.880
<v Speaker 0>And commit.

01:09:24.835 --> 01:09:25.474
<v Speaker 0>Correct.

01:09:27.395 --> 01:09:28.834
<v Speaker 0>Keep

01:09:29.234 --> 01:09:32.034
<v Speaker 0>images and rip directory.

01:09:33.154 --> 01:09:35.074
<v Speaker 0>Until I work, I have to make that

01:09:35.074 --> 01:09:35.954
<v Speaker 0>not the case.

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:41.840
<v Speaker 0>Why does it not add the deletions?

01:09:45.199 --> 01:09:46.479
<v Speaker 0>And then the

01:09:46.719 --> 01:09:47.679
<v Speaker 0>the modules,

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:49.760
<v Speaker 0>the the kernel,

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:50.399
<v Speaker 0>and the.

01:09:55.815 --> 01:09:57.574
<v Speaker 0>But I have my alias. No.

01:09:58.215 --> 01:09:59.895
<v Speaker 0>I haven't got them set up yet.

01:10:00.935 --> 01:10:03.014
<v Speaker 0>Commit amend. No

01:10:03.255 --> 01:10:03.974
<v Speaker 0>edit.

01:10:04.695 --> 01:10:06.775
<v Speaker 0>Get came as I normally have the alias

01:10:06.775 --> 01:10:07.255
<v Speaker 0>configured.

01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:09.310
<v Speaker 0>And

01:10:09.710 --> 01:10:11.550
<v Speaker 0>push origin.

01:10:17.310 --> 01:10:18.990
<v Speaker 0>Those files haven't changed.

01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:19.870
<v Speaker 0>So, hopefully

01:10:23.585 --> 01:10:25.505
<v Speaker 0>alright. It's just maybe we keep pitching too

01:10:25.505 --> 01:10:26.385
<v Speaker 0>many times.

01:10:27.185 --> 01:10:29.505
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully, it doesn't upload them all again.

01:10:29.905 --> 01:10:31.745
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So it's down the ref log. It

01:10:31.745 --> 01:10:33.585
<v Speaker 0>should be smart enough to handle that.

01:10:35.265 --> 01:10:36.704
<v Speaker 0>Yep. Perfect.

01:10:37.185 --> 01:10:38.545
<v Speaker 0>And

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:42.760
<v Speaker 0>we have our directory version here

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:46.199
<v Speaker 0>and our Ubuntu version

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:48.760
<v Speaker 0>here.

01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:49.880
<v Speaker 0>What?

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:51.480
<v Speaker 0>Ah, the Dockerfail.

01:10:53.645 --> 01:10:54.685
<v Speaker 0>Is that important?

01:10:57.405 --> 01:10:58.925
<v Speaker 0>We'll find out. So

01:11:01.085 --> 01:11:03.645
<v Speaker 0>oh, but now it's on a branch.

01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:16.620
<v Speaker 0>Is that what it mean? Yeah. Let's just

01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:18.940
<v Speaker 0>use this. I'm assuming that's a commit share

01:11:19.255 --> 01:11:20.775
<v Speaker 0>for the branch.

01:11:23.895 --> 01:11:24.615
<v Speaker 0>So

01:11:25.575 --> 01:11:26.535
<v Speaker 0>let's go with that.

01:11:32.230 --> 01:11:33.189
<v Speaker 0>And

01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:36.949
<v Speaker 0>go.

01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:40.229
<v Speaker 0>It's gonna break, isn't it?

01:11:42.150 --> 01:11:43.270
<v Speaker 0>Definitely gonna break.

01:11:49.995 --> 01:11:52.475
<v Speaker 0>I've got an IP address, but then that

01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:55.835
<v Speaker 0>sets still during its own magic stuff, which

01:11:55.835 --> 01:11:57.195
<v Speaker 0>is setting up networking.

01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:02.150
<v Speaker 0>Where will my bit be?

01:12:04.949 --> 01:12:05.670
<v Speaker 0>Here.

01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:08.150
<v Speaker 0>Step eight.

01:12:15.655 --> 01:12:17.495
<v Speaker 0>So I'm I'm not entirely sure how this

01:12:17.495 --> 01:12:18.535
<v Speaker 0>is working

01:12:23.815 --> 01:12:27.255
<v Speaker 0>because

01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:29.030
<v Speaker 0>a bit

01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:31.110
<v Speaker 0>a bit 21604,

01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:32.790
<v Speaker 0>which we've chosen as a base image and

01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:35.190
<v Speaker 0>our user data as a user data, something

01:12:35.190 --> 01:12:36.550
<v Speaker 0>that happens afterwards.

01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:38.470
<v Speaker 0>So it's using the base system to do

01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:39.430
<v Speaker 0>the install,

01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:41.110
<v Speaker 0>protection the disks,

01:12:42.585 --> 01:12:44.345
<v Speaker 0>and set up the networking, and then the

01:12:44.345 --> 01:12:45.864
<v Speaker 0>clear then that stuff comes in.

01:12:46.265 --> 01:12:47.145
<v Speaker 0>Now

01:12:47.305 --> 01:12:49.304
<v Speaker 0>our image contains

01:12:52.185 --> 01:12:53.785
<v Speaker 0>an entire base system.

01:12:55.530 --> 01:12:57.210
<v Speaker 0>So I'm gonna have to find someone on

01:12:57.210 --> 01:12:58.810
<v Speaker 0>engineering and work out

01:12:59.450 --> 01:13:01.610
<v Speaker 0>what it's actually doing here

01:13:02.010 --> 01:13:03.290
<v Speaker 0>because it's not

01:13:03.690 --> 01:13:06.250
<v Speaker 0>just gonna replace the desk with my image.

01:13:06.250 --> 01:13:07.210
<v Speaker 0>Maybe it does.

01:13:07.610 --> 01:13:08.650
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure.

01:13:09.130 --> 01:13:11.290
<v Speaker 0>But then how would it then get

01:13:11.895 --> 01:13:14.295
<v Speaker 0>the networking config and stuff in? I'm just

01:13:14.295 --> 01:13:16.054
<v Speaker 0>curious how that works.

01:13:16.295 --> 01:13:18.135
<v Speaker 0>I'm I'm gonna work I'll find out.

01:13:20.534 --> 01:13:21.334
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

01:13:21.895 --> 01:13:23.494
<v Speaker 0>I'm hoping it doesn't fail,

01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:25.980
<v Speaker 0>and I'm hoping it works.

01:13:36.795 --> 01:13:38.795
<v Speaker 0>And I will sit in silence until it

01:13:38.795 --> 01:13:39.434
<v Speaker 0>does

01:13:40.475 --> 01:13:41.994
<v Speaker 0>because that's entertaining.

01:13:42.955 --> 01:13:45.355
<v Speaker 0>My failure is much more entertaining. Let's pop

01:13:45.355 --> 01:13:45.915
<v Speaker 0>over here.

01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:50.730
<v Speaker 0>So what do we got?

01:13:51.690 --> 01:13:54.730
<v Speaker 0>Rex gonna look at StreamYard. Lorraine loves StreamYard.

01:13:54.730 --> 01:13:56.650
<v Speaker 0>Let's just show random messages. Cool.

01:14:03.315 --> 01:14:06.034
<v Speaker 0>So back to REx 20 pieces of hardware,

01:14:06.115 --> 01:14:08.195
<v Speaker 0>six real pieces of hardware,

01:14:08.355 --> 01:14:09.474
<v Speaker 0>one pie,

01:14:09.475 --> 01:14:12.515
<v Speaker 0>one net top, four self bolt mini ITX

01:14:12.515 --> 01:14:13.315
<v Speaker 0>machines,

01:14:14.435 --> 01:14:16.595
<v Speaker 0>and LXC containers and all of those.

01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:18.500
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:26.020
<v Speaker 0>Uh-huh.

01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:28.340
<v Speaker 0>Let's just go back and watch the magic

01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:29.460
<v Speaker 0>thing. Oh,

01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:30.500
<v Speaker 0>no way.

01:14:37.545 --> 01:14:38.905
<v Speaker 0>Surely, it didn't work.

01:14:43.305 --> 01:14:44.665
<v Speaker 0>Doesn't look like it worked.

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:55.200
<v Speaker 0>K. It worked.

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:02.400
<v Speaker 0>I can't SSH onto it.

01:15:09.724 --> 01:15:10.525
<v Speaker 0>Definitely

01:15:10.525 --> 01:15:11.405
<v Speaker 0>broken.

01:15:14.284 --> 01:15:16.284
<v Speaker 0>Let's get some debug here.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.519
<v Speaker 0>SSH isn't running.

01:15:24.719 --> 01:15:25.439
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:28.239
<v Speaker 0>I've never had to I've never used a

01:15:28.239 --> 01:15:30.400
<v Speaker 0>abandoned phone. You don't work. Go away.

01:15:31.575 --> 01:15:33.495
<v Speaker 0>But we should be able to get

01:15:38.215 --> 01:15:39.655
<v Speaker 0>it's not going on to the system.

01:16:03.785 --> 01:16:05.865
<v Speaker 0>Yes. I've broken it.

01:16:08.105 --> 01:16:10.905
<v Speaker 0>Serial over SSH. Yes. Give me a thanks.

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.320
<v Speaker 0>Pretty sure I only have one key.

01:16:30.915 --> 01:16:31.635
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

01:16:33.315 --> 01:16:34.114
<v Speaker 0>You'll be key at

01:16:38.195 --> 01:16:38.995
<v Speaker 0>try again.

01:16:42.210 --> 01:16:43.650
<v Speaker 0>Maybe it does work then.

01:16:46.050 --> 01:16:47.890
<v Speaker 0>No. That definitely doesn't. Okay. What about the

01:16:47.890 --> 01:16:48.929
<v Speaker 0>other bad one?

01:16:52.850 --> 01:16:53.410
<v Speaker 0>Better.

01:17:00.614 --> 01:17:01.255
<v Speaker 0>Dreads.

01:17:08.730 --> 01:17:10.410
<v Speaker 0>So it's definitely broken.

01:17:12.730 --> 01:17:13.610
<v Speaker 0>Oh, well.

01:17:17.290 --> 01:17:20.490
<v Speaker 0>Not sure there's anything

01:17:20.490 --> 01:17:21.930
<v Speaker 0>else I can do.

01:17:45.130 --> 01:17:46.010
<v Speaker 0>Ah.

01:17:51.770 --> 01:17:54.250
<v Speaker 0>Well, that's not gonna work. There's no SSH

01:17:54.250 --> 01:17:54.730
<v Speaker 0>on.

01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:13.320
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. This was failing because of the key.

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:21.239
<v Speaker 0>I'm not giving up. Okay. Got a plan.

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:22.120
<v Speaker 0>Let's

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:23.240
<v Speaker 0>spin up

01:18:25.255 --> 01:18:25.975
<v Speaker 0>another

01:18:26.055 --> 01:18:28.455
<v Speaker 0>oh, no. Because this SSH isn't running.

01:18:29.175 --> 01:18:30.935
<v Speaker 0>So I can't even go through the internal

01:18:30.935 --> 01:18:31.735
<v Speaker 0>IP address.

01:18:40.450 --> 01:18:41.489
<v Speaker 0>Run it.

01:18:44.850 --> 01:18:47.730
<v Speaker 0>Got it. Open to Internet bash.

01:18:53.345 --> 01:18:54.945
<v Speaker 0>And SSHD is there.

01:19:06.559 --> 01:19:07.840
<v Speaker 0>Some detail

01:19:08.639 --> 01:19:10.480
<v Speaker 0>for SSH is

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:11.280
<v Speaker 0>there.

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:17.360
<v Speaker 0>Why

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:19.520
<v Speaker 0>is it not running SSH?

01:19:36.810 --> 01:19:38.730
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I'm kind of assuming right now

01:19:38.730 --> 01:19:41.450
<v Speaker 0>that I haven't just broken the entire install.

01:19:47.365 --> 01:19:49.284
<v Speaker 0>Assuming those are the defaults

01:19:51.685 --> 01:19:53.525
<v Speaker 0>and port 22.

01:19:56.325 --> 01:19:57.685
<v Speaker 0>Public key authentication.

01:20:08.219 --> 01:20:10.619
<v Speaker 0>Is there anything I can do?

01:20:14.395 --> 01:20:15.675
<v Speaker 0>So let's try again.

01:20:17.435 --> 01:20:19.195
<v Speaker 0>I can actually refuse this

01:20:20.955 --> 01:20:21.994
<v Speaker 0>pretty quick.

01:20:22.315 --> 01:20:23.354
<v Speaker 0>Would it was

01:20:24.155 --> 01:20:24.954
<v Speaker 0>it running,

01:20:25.675 --> 01:20:27.114
<v Speaker 0>or is this something else?

01:20:37.179 --> 01:20:37.980
<v Speaker 0>I got nothing.

01:20:48.335 --> 01:20:50.735
<v Speaker 0>Why does the band

01:20:50.735 --> 01:20:52.015
<v Speaker 0>console not work?

01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:13.440
<v Speaker 0>Thanks. It could come in. It's a little

01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:14.239
<v Speaker 0>safer.

01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:14.960
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

01:21:19.735 --> 01:21:20.375
<v Speaker 0>No.

01:21:21.655 --> 01:21:23.015
<v Speaker 0>It's actually about right.

01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:36.139
<v Speaker 0>Impression.

01:21:37.739 --> 01:21:39.020
<v Speaker 0>That's a good command.

01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:01.960
<v Speaker 0>You know, like, I should know that.

01:22:13.695 --> 01:22:14.895
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you just

01:22:15.295 --> 01:22:16.255
<v Speaker 0>you just.

01:22:17.135 --> 01:22:18.975
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's try.

01:22:21.295 --> 01:22:22.415
<v Speaker 0>No. Okay.

01:22:22.895 --> 01:22:24.255
<v Speaker 0>So I'm

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:27.920
<v Speaker 0>completely out of ideas.

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:31.840
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to shut this down.

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:33.440
<v Speaker 0>Almost rescue OS.

01:22:42.205 --> 01:22:43.644
<v Speaker 0>I have no idea.

01:22:49.005 --> 01:22:50.364
<v Speaker 0>I don't know

01:22:50.925 --> 01:22:51.645
<v Speaker 0>what I've done.

01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:04.310
<v Speaker 0>Can I use the band now? Is that,

01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.470
<v Speaker 0>like,

01:23:11.565 --> 01:23:12.205
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:23:15.405 --> 01:23:16.125
<v Speaker 0>Destroy.

01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:27.340
<v Speaker 0>So do we have anything in chat?

01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:32.300
<v Speaker 0>So

01:23:32.940 --> 01:23:34.780
<v Speaker 0>Rain has asked if it's possible

01:23:36.065 --> 01:23:37.665
<v Speaker 0>to see the system that it's been bringing

01:23:37.665 --> 01:23:38.225
<v Speaker 0>up.

01:23:39.905 --> 01:23:42.225
<v Speaker 0>I I don't think so. I'm not really

01:23:42.225 --> 01:23:42.864
<v Speaker 0>sure.

01:23:45.905 --> 01:23:48.145
<v Speaker 0>Would be cool. I'm not sure what my

01:23:48.145 --> 01:23:50.305
<v Speaker 0>next steps are actually right now.

01:23:50.785 --> 01:23:52.489
<v Speaker 0>So I'm gonna have to speak to someone

01:23:52.489 --> 01:23:54.090
<v Speaker 0>with more knowledge than me.

01:23:54.570 --> 01:23:57.210
<v Speaker 0>Maybe someone who built a custom image before,

01:23:57.930 --> 01:23:59.530
<v Speaker 0>get them to join me, and I think

01:23:59.530 --> 01:24:00.889
<v Speaker 0>we will try again

01:24:01.770 --> 01:24:05.085
<v Speaker 0>either tomorrow or next week. I don't know

01:24:05.085 --> 01:24:06.685
<v Speaker 0>where I went wrong. I mean, it could

01:24:06.685 --> 01:24:09.485
<v Speaker 0>just be as simple as SSH

01:24:11.645 --> 01:24:14.525
<v Speaker 0>wasn't started, but then I don't even understand.

01:24:15.885 --> 01:24:16.925
<v Speaker 0>There's a disconnect

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:18.520
<v Speaker 0>from

01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:21.640
<v Speaker 0>the image I built with the Docker file,

01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:23.080
<v Speaker 0>you know, adding that root f s and

01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:24.120
<v Speaker 0>then tweaking it,

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:27.480
<v Speaker 0>and how we get to that stage based

01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:30.600
<v Speaker 0>on the cloud and it specifying the repository

01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:33.255
<v Speaker 0>and the which I'm assuming is a. I

01:24:33.255 --> 01:24:35.655
<v Speaker 0>don't even know that right now. I'm assuming

01:24:35.975 --> 01:24:37.655
<v Speaker 0>that was supposed to be a,

01:24:41.895 --> 01:24:42.695
<v Speaker 0>but maybe not.

01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:48.880
<v Speaker 0>It could be there's no visibility from

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.320
<v Speaker 0>the machine booting up and my image being

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.560
<v Speaker 0>replaced onto it somehow. I don't I can't

01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:56.080
<v Speaker 0>see through the GUI, and maybe it could

01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:56.480
<v Speaker 0>have been, like,

01:24:57.255 --> 01:24:57.974
<v Speaker 0>maybe

01:24:58.695 --> 01:24:59.975
<v Speaker 0>if I was a bit more patient, maybe

01:24:59.975 --> 01:25:01.655
<v Speaker 0>it takes time to pull the image from

01:25:01.655 --> 01:25:05.255
<v Speaker 0>GitLab and provision it. And because I popped

01:25:05.255 --> 01:25:07.415
<v Speaker 0>over to check for questions instead of watching

01:25:07.415 --> 01:25:09.895
<v Speaker 0>the steps, I don't even I'm assuming it

01:25:09.895 --> 01:25:10.455
<v Speaker 0>completed.

01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:12.630
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if there was a way

01:25:12.630 --> 01:25:14.230
<v Speaker 0>for me to get other information.

01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:15.830
<v Speaker 0>So

01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:18.310
<v Speaker 0>rather than me trying to spin that up

01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:18.950
<v Speaker 0>again,

01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:22.070
<v Speaker 0>I will solicit some help from someone who

01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:23.590
<v Speaker 0>knows a little bit more about this than

01:25:23.590 --> 01:25:25.270
<v Speaker 0>me, and we will try this again.

01:25:26.455 --> 01:25:27.094
<v Speaker 0>So

01:25:27.415 --> 01:25:28.775
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna leave it there.

01:25:29.094 --> 01:25:31.255
<v Speaker 0>If there's anything else that you want to

01:25:31.255 --> 01:25:33.494
<v Speaker 0>see me cover with regards to

01:25:34.295 --> 01:25:35.094
<v Speaker 0>packet,

01:25:35.495 --> 01:25:37.335
<v Speaker 0>not building custom images,

01:25:37.574 --> 01:25:39.175
<v Speaker 0>reach out to me on Twitter. Let me

01:25:39.175 --> 01:25:41.720
<v Speaker 0>know If you have questions from today's stream

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:43.800
<v Speaker 0>that you would like answered, let me know,

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:45.400
<v Speaker 0>and I will do my best to help.

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:46.199
<v Speaker 0>Anyway,

01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:47.480
<v Speaker 0>thanks for watching.
