00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.799
<v Speaker 0>Let's build a little bit of context here.

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.200
<v Speaker 0>So this session is we are trying to

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.120
<v Speaker 0>show how to take a Laravel application

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.639
<v Speaker 0>from your local machine, produce a container based

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.440
<v Speaker 0>development environment using Docker and Docker Compose,

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.535
<v Speaker 0>and show you the real kind of day

00:00:18.535 --> 00:00:20.695
<v Speaker 0>one deploy to Kubernetes scenario.

00:00:21.095 --> 00:00:23.575
<v Speaker 0>Anyway, it's it's really frustrating,

00:00:23.575 --> 00:00:24.135
<v Speaker 0>actually.

00:00:24.455 --> 00:00:26.375
<v Speaker 0>It's not a nice developer experience. It's not

00:00:26.375 --> 00:00:28.855
<v Speaker 0>really a way to make it nicer. It's

00:00:28.855 --> 00:00:29.095
<v Speaker 0>just

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.220
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's just painful. You

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.340
<v Speaker 1>need package lock as well, I think, depending

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.620
<v Speaker 1>if they're using it.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.100
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna ignore that fail forever.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.180
<v Speaker 0>I don't think we should commit lock fails.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.059
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.335
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's I mean, we have containers. We

00:00:46.335 --> 00:00:48.175
<v Speaker 0>already have immutability.

00:00:48.175 --> 00:00:49.375
<v Speaker 0>We have repeatability.

00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:50.655
<v Speaker 0>We have all of this stuff. It's like

00:00:50.655 --> 00:00:51.774
<v Speaker 0>the lock fail.

00:00:52.094 --> 00:00:54.335
<v Speaker 0>Like, your deployment without containers makes sense, but

00:00:54.335 --> 00:00:54.655
<v Speaker 0>I'm

00:00:56.975 --> 00:00:57.934
<v Speaker 0>I think we have enough.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.520
<v Speaker 0>Don't wanna get too cocky, but I think

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.720
<v Speaker 0>it looks good.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.760
<v Speaker 0>What's it doing there? Upbuilding.

00:01:15.925 --> 00:01:18.725
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So let's assume this works. Right? Of

00:01:19.365 --> 00:01:19.925
<v Speaker 0>course.

00:01:23.205 --> 00:01:25.685
<v Speaker 0>So you're let me clarify what you're saying

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:28.390
<v Speaker 0>there. Is you believe the problem that this

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.189
<v Speaker 0>is failing is because it's missing access

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:32.549
<v Speaker 0>dumping?

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.430
<v Speaker 0>Right. Or let's let's actually read the message.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.950
<v Speaker 0>Ah. Slash public.

00:01:41.445 --> 00:01:44.645
<v Speaker 0>Root fail system public CSS app CSS.

00:01:44.645 --> 00:01:46.884
<v Speaker 0>Not slash node slash public.

00:01:47.924 --> 00:01:49.524
<v Speaker 0>So that's our issue.

00:01:49.924 --> 00:01:50.244
<v Speaker 1>Why?

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.370
<v Speaker 0>So we it has to be a fail.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.130
<v Speaker 0>It works when we change the mode to

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.090
<v Speaker 0>be a dot.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.970
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.850
<v Speaker 0>That's the bet that's really bugging me. We're

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.010
<v Speaker 1>we're good developers. Right? David David, look in

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.410
<v Speaker 1>the chat.

00:02:13.765 --> 00:02:16.084
<v Speaker 1>Has some has this person saved us? They're

00:02:16.084 --> 00:02:16.805
<v Speaker 1>anonymous.

00:02:19.444 --> 00:02:20.165
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:02:22.084 --> 00:02:23.765
<v Speaker 0>I would be very disappointed

00:02:23.765 --> 00:02:26.004
<v Speaker 0>if Maxi's

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.380
<v Speaker 0>wrapper

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.860
<v Speaker 0>around webpack required

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.780
<v Speaker 0>Artisan to exist, which means

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.540
<v Speaker 0>you're probably right.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.580
<v Speaker 1>But maybe it uses the Artisan file

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.659
<v Speaker 1>the presence of the Artisan file for some

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:38.299
<v Speaker 1>sort of

00:02:39.194 --> 00:02:40.235
<v Speaker 1>directory

00:02:40.315 --> 00:02:42.715
<v Speaker 1>relativeness to to find the root. Do know

00:02:42.715 --> 00:02:43.355
<v Speaker 1>what I mean?

00:02:44.955 --> 00:02:46.555
<v Speaker 0>At least the show notes for this episode

00:02:46.555 --> 00:02:49.114
<v Speaker 0>will be really easy. Like, watch Kieran struggle.

00:02:49.114 --> 00:02:51.355
<v Speaker 0>What did Kieran and David struggle for forty

00:02:51.355 --> 00:02:53.035
<v Speaker 0>minutes? I can't believe that worked.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.549
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Why? Why?
