00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.010
<v Speaker 0>Hello.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.850
<v Speaker 0>Welcome to today's stream.

00:03:01.985 --> 00:03:05.505
<v Speaker 0>Right. Let's get my screen shared.

00:03:11.025 --> 00:03:11.985
<v Speaker 0>This

00:03:13.425 --> 00:03:13.825
<v Speaker 0>one.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.000
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:16.880
<v Speaker 0>So

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.000
<v Speaker 0>today,

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.880
<v Speaker 0>I am going to do

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.120
<v Speaker 0>bad things to Linux machine running on Packet

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.439
<v Speaker 0>Cloud.

00:03:26.655 --> 00:03:28.815
<v Speaker 0>As you can see, I have one

00:03:28.894 --> 00:03:32.335
<v Speaker 0>bare metal server running called Breaking Linux.

00:03:33.295 --> 00:03:36.015
<v Speaker 0>And the point of today's stream is

00:03:36.254 --> 00:03:38.575
<v Speaker 0>not for me to fail miserably and make

00:03:38.575 --> 00:03:40.495
<v Speaker 0>an arse of myself, but instead

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.430
<v Speaker 0>to try and

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.430
<v Speaker 0>make some common

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.110
<v Speaker 0>easily made mistakes on a Linux distribution

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.630
<v Speaker 0>and show how packets tooling

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 0>can help you recover from a lot of

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.110
<v Speaker 0>different

00:03:55.665 --> 00:03:57.745
<v Speaker 0>mistakes, failures, etcetera.

00:03:58.465 --> 00:04:00.865
<v Speaker 0>I did solicit some feedback on Twitter

00:04:01.185 --> 00:04:03.185
<v Speaker 0>for things I could do to this machine.

00:04:03.665 --> 00:04:05.265
<v Speaker 0>Y'all are pretty harsh.

00:04:05.425 --> 00:04:08.545
<v Speaker 0>I don't plan on breaking this beyond

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.460
<v Speaker 0>beyond,

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.780
<v Speaker 0>you know, some network errors,

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.100
<v Speaker 0>deleting some core files, things that I can

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.060
<v Speaker 0>fix real quickly.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:18.060
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't mean that

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.460
<v Speaker 0>larger problems or bigger mistakes can't be fixed

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.045
<v Speaker 0>through these tools. It's just I don't want

00:04:25.045 --> 00:04:27.445
<v Speaker 0>you watching me spend an hour

00:04:27.764 --> 00:04:30.485
<v Speaker 0>pulling down dev files from a remote host

00:04:30.485 --> 00:04:33.205
<v Speaker 0>and trying to reprovision a machine online.

00:04:33.445 --> 00:04:35.764
<v Speaker 0>Right? Nobody wants to see that. Well, at

00:04:35.764 --> 00:04:38.085
<v Speaker 0>least not today because we also have KubeCon

00:04:38.085 --> 00:04:40.005
<v Speaker 0>today, and I wanna finish a technical watch

00:04:40.005 --> 00:04:40.245
<v Speaker 0>for that.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.260
<v Speaker 0>So if you do have ideas or things

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.620
<v Speaker 0>you want me to try and break and

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.820
<v Speaker 0>recover from, please leave a comment on Twitch

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.300
<v Speaker 0>or YouTube or tweet me,

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.020
<v Speaker 0>and I will take on as many of

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.435
<v Speaker 0>them as I can. But first, let's get

00:04:56.435 --> 00:04:57.875
<v Speaker 0>a lay of the land.

00:04:59.155 --> 00:05:00.915
<v Speaker 0>And if someone can tell me if I'm

00:05:00.915 --> 00:05:03.875
<v Speaker 0>sounding and broadcasting okay, that would be appreciated.

00:05:05.235 --> 00:05:06.835
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.030
<v Speaker 0>we have

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.150
<v Speaker 0>yeah. Root password is pointless.

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:17.470
<v Speaker 0>You still need the SSH key, so it

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:18.830
<v Speaker 0>doesn't matter if you see it.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.630
<v Speaker 0>So I need to plug in my UV

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.190
<v Speaker 0>key

00:05:23.224 --> 00:05:24.745
<v Speaker 0>to connect to this machine.

00:05:27.145 --> 00:05:27.945
<v Speaker 0>And

00:05:28.025 --> 00:05:29.625
<v Speaker 0>what I want to do

00:05:31.625 --> 00:05:34.185
<v Speaker 0>is grab this IP address,

00:05:34.425 --> 00:05:37.784
<v Speaker 0>and we will just jump onto this machine

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.070
<v Speaker 0>and

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:41.470
<v Speaker 0>try and break it

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:44.590
<v Speaker 0>in a pretty quickly repairable fashion.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.470
<v Speaker 0>So we're gonna go s h dash l

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:48.750
<v Speaker 0>route and

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:50.190
<v Speaker 0>the IP address.

00:05:52.175 --> 00:05:54.495
<v Speaker 0>My project does have a

00:05:54.815 --> 00:05:56.815
<v Speaker 0>we use a lot of IP addresses, so

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:57.535
<v Speaker 0>you just

00:05:57.935 --> 00:05:59.855
<v Speaker 0>I just delete the whole known host. I'm

00:05:59.855 --> 00:06:00.415
<v Speaker 0>not fast.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.990
<v Speaker 0>To say, should we key? Push the button,

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.750
<v Speaker 0>and we are in.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.950
<v Speaker 0>So there's nothing going on

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.830
<v Speaker 0>on this machine. Provisioned it with a Ubuntu

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:16.710
<v Speaker 0>20 o four,

00:06:18.315 --> 00:06:19.275
<v Speaker 0>And

00:06:21.995 --> 00:06:25.195
<v Speaker 0>I think what we'll do is

00:06:25.435 --> 00:06:26.155
<v Speaker 0>has

00:06:26.635 --> 00:06:28.395
<v Speaker 0>I don't really use a Bintu much as

00:06:28.395 --> 00:06:30.475
<v Speaker 0>well, but there's an interesting thing.

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.610
<v Speaker 0>Is the network configured

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.330
<v Speaker 0>where I would expect it to be?

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.250
<v Speaker 0>If you look at interfaces.

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.050
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. There we go. So do I have

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.450
<v Speaker 0>them?

00:06:46.165 --> 00:06:48.325
<v Speaker 0>Oh, we're off the client's stuff. Okay.

00:06:49.925 --> 00:06:50.565
<v Speaker 0>So

00:06:51.205 --> 00:06:54.245
<v Speaker 0>packet when you provision a server,

00:06:55.685 --> 00:06:56.805
<v Speaker 0>it figures

00:06:57.205 --> 00:06:59.525
<v Speaker 0>the networking for you. So you get depending

00:06:59.525 --> 00:07:01.045
<v Speaker 0>on how you provision the server, of course.

00:07:01.045 --> 00:07:02.620
<v Speaker 0>So in fact, let's just back up a

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.060
<v Speaker 0>little minute and take a look at this

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.260
<v Speaker 0>new server page.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:06.300
<v Speaker 0>So

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.900
<v Speaker 0>we can say Amsterdam,

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.460
<v Speaker 0>c one large ARM, you pick your OS.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.700
<v Speaker 0>And then down here, you have the ability

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.700
<v Speaker 0>to kind of, you know, disable

00:07:17.685 --> 00:07:20.485
<v Speaker 0>public I p I p v four address

00:07:21.685 --> 00:07:23.925
<v Speaker 0>and I p v six. So by default,

00:07:23.925 --> 00:07:26.085
<v Speaker 0>you get one of each. You can disable

00:07:26.085 --> 00:07:26.725
<v Speaker 0>them,

00:07:27.525 --> 00:07:30.245
<v Speaker 0>and that's what we have in our interfaces

00:07:30.245 --> 00:07:31.044
<v Speaker 0>file.

00:07:31.525 --> 00:07:33.125
<v Speaker 0>So we can see

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.320
<v Speaker 0>this is the IP address that I actually

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.240
<v Speaker 0>use to SSH into this machine.

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:42.240
<v Speaker 0>There's my IPv six,

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.080
<v Speaker 0>and then we have my local

00:07:47.005 --> 00:07:49.165
<v Speaker 0>local subnet for this facility.

00:07:50.205 --> 00:07:52.125
<v Speaker 0>So that's Amsterdam One.

00:07:54.044 --> 00:07:55.485
<v Speaker 0>So let's break it.

00:07:56.125 --> 00:07:58.285
<v Speaker 0>What I wanna do is put this in

00:07:58.285 --> 00:07:59.085
<v Speaker 0>a position

00:07:59.245 --> 00:08:01.565
<v Speaker 0>where it's probably gonna cut me off of

00:08:01.565 --> 00:08:02.205
<v Speaker 0>SSH,

00:08:04.419 --> 00:08:06.500
<v Speaker 0>and then we will try and go through

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.260
<v Speaker 0>the debugging steps or the

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.419
<v Speaker 0>the steps that we need to actually fix

00:08:10.419 --> 00:08:11.780
<v Speaker 0>this. We don't need to debug it. I

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.380
<v Speaker 0>know what I'm breaking, hopefully.

00:08:14.419 --> 00:08:15.940
<v Speaker 0>What if

00:08:17.845 --> 00:08:20.005
<v Speaker 0>we just change the IP address?

00:08:24.565 --> 00:08:25.845
<v Speaker 0>I would suspect

00:08:26.245 --> 00:08:27.605
<v Speaker 0>that will break things,

00:08:28.405 --> 00:08:29.925
<v Speaker 0>and

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.059
<v Speaker 0>we could restart networking.

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:35.940
<v Speaker 0>So system b, restart.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.220
<v Speaker 0>Is it system b network or is it

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.260
<v Speaker 0>network manager?

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:42.420
<v Speaker 0>Just do that.

00:08:44.435 --> 00:08:45.155
<v Speaker 0>And

00:08:45.475 --> 00:08:47.715
<v Speaker 0>it is broken. Perfect.

00:08:48.195 --> 00:08:50.595
<v Speaker 0>I never thought I'd be so happy to

00:08:50.595 --> 00:08:52.115
<v Speaker 0>break a machine.

00:08:53.635 --> 00:08:56.595
<v Speaker 0>So let's copy this IP address

00:08:56.675 --> 00:08:57.715
<v Speaker 0>and

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.480
<v Speaker 0>eventually, that will kick me off. We'll jump

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.800
<v Speaker 0>into a new temporary directory

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.880
<v Speaker 0>and

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.840
<v Speaker 0>we are out.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.880
<v Speaker 0>I would not expect this to work,

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.000
<v Speaker 0>yeah, because that's not the IP address that

00:09:14.515 --> 00:09:15.715
<v Speaker 0>packet gave me.

00:09:16.755 --> 00:09:20.195
<v Speaker 0>So right now, we are completely locked out

00:09:20.195 --> 00:09:21.955
<v Speaker 0>of this machine.

00:09:22.675 --> 00:09:23.635
<v Speaker 0>Wonderful.

00:09:24.995 --> 00:09:26.195
<v Speaker 0>Okay. What can we do?

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:30.500
<v Speaker 0>So

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:31.860
<v Speaker 0>we have

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.220
<v Speaker 0>a packet provided,

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.980
<v Speaker 0>the serial console over SSH,

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.300
<v Speaker 0>which means that I can click on this

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.860
<v Speaker 0>out of band console, copy this link,

00:09:44.454 --> 00:09:45.735
<v Speaker 0>pop over here,

00:09:46.855 --> 00:09:48.055
<v Speaker 0>and hit go.

00:09:52.774 --> 00:09:55.334
<v Speaker 0>Push the b key. I just have a

00:09:55.334 --> 00:09:57.815
<v Speaker 0>a weird SSH failure to try to inject

00:09:57.815 --> 00:09:59.255
<v Speaker 0>some term info. So I just need to

00:09:59.255 --> 00:09:59.975
<v Speaker 0>escape that.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.620
<v Speaker 0>We are in. So this is

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.100
<v Speaker 0>the

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.020
<v Speaker 0>okay. I always panic.

00:10:13.345 --> 00:10:14.065
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Definitely

00:10:14.704 --> 00:10:15.505
<v Speaker 0>panicking.

00:10:15.665 --> 00:10:17.824
<v Speaker 0>Because I just missed the root password. So

00:10:17.824 --> 00:10:20.225
<v Speaker 0>I actually probably have two things that I

00:10:20.225 --> 00:10:21.425
<v Speaker 0>need to fix now.

00:10:22.065 --> 00:10:23.024
<v Speaker 0>Because I

00:10:24.144 --> 00:10:26.384
<v Speaker 0>do not believe I can log in to

00:10:26.384 --> 00:10:28.630
<v Speaker 0>this machine. Oh, no. It's back.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:30.230
<v Speaker 0>So

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:33.030
<v Speaker 0>that's good that if you dismiss it, you

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.990
<v Speaker 0>can get it back.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:34.630
<v Speaker 0>Anyway

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:36.070
<v Speaker 0>so

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:37.750
<v Speaker 0>next to networking,

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:38.710
<v Speaker 0>we can

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:40.550
<v Speaker 0>log in to this machine.

00:10:43.815 --> 00:10:44.695
<v Speaker 0>Networking.

00:10:45.655 --> 00:10:47.975
<v Speaker 0>Network. And modify

00:10:48.855 --> 00:10:50.775
<v Speaker 0>our interfaces file again.

00:10:52.055 --> 00:10:54.055
<v Speaker 0>We can put back to seven,

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:57.820
<v Speaker 0>and we will restart

00:10:59.020 --> 00:10:59.820
<v Speaker 0>working.

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:02.780
<v Speaker 0>And,

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:04.700
<v Speaker 0>hopefully,

00:11:07.335 --> 00:11:08.295
<v Speaker 0>we're back.

00:11:08.935 --> 00:11:09.655
<v Speaker 0>Good.

00:11:10.375 --> 00:11:11.095
<v Speaker 0>So

00:11:11.815 --> 00:11:13.495
<v Speaker 0>that was, like, what?

00:11:14.295 --> 00:11:16.135
<v Speaker 0>Ten minutes I've been in? So

00:11:17.415 --> 00:11:21.095
<v Speaker 0>the serial over SSH is a a really

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.600
<v Speaker 0>a really great way to get back into

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.399
<v Speaker 0>your machine.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.320
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:11:27.959 --> 00:11:29.320
<v Speaker 0>What's next?

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.240
<v Speaker 0>Well, what if

00:11:35.665 --> 00:11:37.185
<v Speaker 0>What if I didn't

00:11:37.345 --> 00:11:39.265
<v Speaker 0>know that root password?

00:11:39.585 --> 00:11:41.425
<v Speaker 0>Let's tackle that. So

00:11:43.105 --> 00:11:44.625
<v Speaker 0>if I refresh the screen,

00:11:45.265 --> 00:11:47.185
<v Speaker 0>the password's gonna come back. Right? Okay. So

00:11:47.185 --> 00:11:48.465
<v Speaker 0>for twenty four hours,

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.480
<v Speaker 0>Packet is very kindly going to show me

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.720
<v Speaker 0>that this root password is available should I

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.360
<v Speaker 0>need it.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.360
<v Speaker 0>However,

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.960
<v Speaker 0>what am I feeling

00:12:03.295 --> 00:12:04.975
<v Speaker 0>pretty silly?

00:12:05.055 --> 00:12:05.774
<v Speaker 0>So

00:12:06.574 --> 00:12:08.415
<v Speaker 0>I can't just type anything

00:12:09.055 --> 00:12:11.055
<v Speaker 0>because I need to type it twice.

00:12:11.214 --> 00:12:13.134
<v Speaker 0>So let's just copy

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.000
<v Speaker 0>that IPv6 address I can get back. Right?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:16.640
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.200
<v Speaker 0>Let's go random

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.080
<v Speaker 0>string.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.320
<v Speaker 0>I'm putting far too much effort into this,

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:22.720
<v Speaker 0>but

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:25.440
<v Speaker 0>get

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:26.480
<v Speaker 0>you

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.720
<v Speaker 0>and then

00:12:29.195 --> 00:12:30.395
<v Speaker 0>paste, paste,

00:12:31.115 --> 00:12:31.915
<v Speaker 0>and then

00:12:32.315 --> 00:12:33.355
<v Speaker 0>copy.

00:12:33.515 --> 00:12:34.555
<v Speaker 0>So it's gone.

00:12:35.035 --> 00:12:36.075
<v Speaker 0>I

00:12:36.075 --> 00:12:38.475
<v Speaker 0>now do not know the password even if

00:12:38.475 --> 00:12:40.395
<v Speaker 0>I really genuinely needed it.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:42.640
<v Speaker 0>Let's

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.760
<v Speaker 0>remodify

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.000
<v Speaker 0>our interfaces fail.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.440
<v Speaker 0>And we're gonna break that again

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.600
<v Speaker 0>and restart networking

00:12:58.075 --> 00:12:59.275
<v Speaker 0>Got my history.

00:13:05.835 --> 00:13:06.635
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:13:08.475 --> 00:13:10.555
<v Speaker 0>So I'm still logged in there in here.

00:13:11.035 --> 00:13:11.755
<v Speaker 0>So

00:13:12.155 --> 00:13:13.115
<v Speaker 0>let's log out.

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:18.209
<v Speaker 0>And I'm now

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:23.970
<v Speaker 0>100% locked out of the system.

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:26.290
<v Speaker 0>And I do not know the root password,

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:29.730
<v Speaker 0>so the the CDL over SSH

00:13:31.625 --> 00:13:33.705
<v Speaker 0>isn't gonna do anything for me.

00:13:36.025 --> 00:13:37.145
<v Speaker 0>That's a pickle.

00:13:37.385 --> 00:13:40.025
<v Speaker 0>So what what options do we have there?

00:13:40.985 --> 00:13:41.305
<v Speaker 0>Well,

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.800
<v Speaker 0>what do we have available to us? Well,

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.240
<v Speaker 0>I still have my YubiKey.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.560
<v Speaker 0>So I still have a way

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.040
<v Speaker 0>to authenticate

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.200
<v Speaker 0>with

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.160
<v Speaker 0>c l over SSH. I just

00:13:55.655 --> 00:13:57.575
<v Speaker 0>I just don't have the root password.

00:13:58.775 --> 00:13:59.495
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:14:00.215 --> 00:14:02.055
<v Speaker 0>What we're gonna do is we're gonna keep

00:14:02.055 --> 00:14:04.375
<v Speaker 0>our serial over SSH connection alive,

00:14:04.695 --> 00:14:06.615
<v Speaker 0>and that should actually allow us

00:14:08.455 --> 00:14:08.935
<v Speaker 0>to

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:12.630
<v Speaker 0>track the reboot that I'm about to initiate,

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.710
<v Speaker 0>which means I I'm hoping and

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:17.510
<v Speaker 0>yeah.

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:20.150
<v Speaker 0>Let's forward. I have okay.

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:22.550
<v Speaker 0>And we're gonna see this machine over the

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:23.430
<v Speaker 0>serial console.

00:14:25.634 --> 00:14:27.795
<v Speaker 0>Yep. There we go. It's now rebooting,

00:14:28.915 --> 00:14:30.355
<v Speaker 0>and we're gonna see the

00:14:30.834 --> 00:14:33.555
<v Speaker 0>Bitloader too. We're gonna see Grub.

00:14:34.274 --> 00:14:36.595
<v Speaker 0>And that's really powerful because if I have

00:14:36.595 --> 00:14:39.555
<v Speaker 0>access to Grub, I can modify

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.380
<v Speaker 0>the boot.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.540
<v Speaker 0>And we can do something

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:47.540
<v Speaker 0>to

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.940
<v Speaker 0>modify how the system boots to get us

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:51.540
<v Speaker 0>in a position where

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.305
<v Speaker 0>we can just put it into a shell,

00:14:56.705 --> 00:14:59.265
<v Speaker 0>mount the desk, and change the root password.

00:15:01.745 --> 00:15:03.185
<v Speaker 0>He says, hopefully.

00:15:04.705 --> 00:15:06.225
<v Speaker 0>I'm sure you can all hear the confidence

00:15:06.225 --> 00:15:07.745
<v Speaker 0>in my voice. Now this is something I've

00:15:07.745 --> 00:15:10.145
<v Speaker 0>done a million times with a physical machine.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.160
<v Speaker 0>You know, you run letters long enough, you

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.600
<v Speaker 0>break it to the point where you always

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.440
<v Speaker 0>have a live CD available so that you

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.120
<v Speaker 0>can at least put something on that machine,

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.800
<v Speaker 0>mount a desk, and start

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.040
<v Speaker 0>doing your best to fix things.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.160
<v Speaker 0>And this should, in theory, be no different.

00:15:26.535 --> 00:15:27.175
<v Speaker 0>Should.

00:15:27.495 --> 00:15:28.695
<v Speaker 0>Should have been a could have.

00:15:30.535 --> 00:15:33.415
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So I can see PixiPit now, which

00:15:33.415 --> 00:15:35.095
<v Speaker 0>means Grub is coming.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:46.950
<v Speaker 0>Might as well grab some tea.

00:15:54.645 --> 00:15:56.885
<v Speaker 0>There's grub. So we push the arrow, stop

00:15:56.885 --> 00:15:57.845
<v Speaker 0>the old bit.

00:15:58.725 --> 00:16:01.605
<v Speaker 0>And we've got two options right now. So

00:16:02.325 --> 00:16:04.165
<v Speaker 0>single user mode is

00:16:04.404 --> 00:16:04.965
<v Speaker 0>just

00:16:05.285 --> 00:16:07.045
<v Speaker 0>changing the run level that the machine will

00:16:07.045 --> 00:16:08.965
<v Speaker 0>be up to. I would still need

00:16:09.579 --> 00:16:11.820
<v Speaker 0>the root password. So it's not quite what

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.060
<v Speaker 0>we want. So I'm gonna hit e to

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:14.940
<v Speaker 0>edit

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:15.660
<v Speaker 0>this.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.740
<v Speaker 0>And that's just gonna look really crappy just

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:18.380
<v Speaker 0>because,

00:16:18.779 --> 00:16:19.500
<v Speaker 0>you know,

00:16:20.139 --> 00:16:22.060
<v Speaker 0>see a little or SSH is not gonna

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:23.020
<v Speaker 0>be fantastic,

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:24.700
<v Speaker 0>but definitely functional enough.

00:16:26.685 --> 00:16:29.245
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we wanna find the kernel line.

00:16:29.245 --> 00:16:32.205
<v Speaker 0>Here we go. So we wanna modify this.

00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:40.430
<v Speaker 0>It's gonna be a little bit slow, but

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:42.430
<v Speaker 0>we'll get there. Oh, the first thing I

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:43.949
<v Speaker 0>wanna change is

00:16:47.069 --> 00:16:49.389
<v Speaker 0>I'm pretty sure r o can become r

00:16:49.389 --> 00:16:50.029
<v Speaker 0>w.

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:52.715
<v Speaker 0>I don't know. Maybe not necessary. Oh, come

00:16:52.715 --> 00:16:53.195
<v Speaker 0>on.

00:16:55.035 --> 00:16:56.635
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We're going back now.

00:16:59.035 --> 00:17:00.395
<v Speaker 0>I don't have to push it too many

00:17:00.395 --> 00:17:00.955
<v Speaker 0>times.

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:09.940
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Ah, the

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:12.180
<v Speaker 0>leaked key sequence is not recognized. That's gonna

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:13.140
<v Speaker 0>break the book.

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:16.260
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's try

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:18.659
<v Speaker 0>okay.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:19.619
<v Speaker 0>So

00:17:20.545 --> 00:17:22.224
<v Speaker 0>control e. Good.

00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:23.744
<v Speaker 0>So there's

00:17:25.185 --> 00:17:28.065
<v Speaker 0>parameter we can specify where we see n

00:17:28.065 --> 00:17:29.105
<v Speaker 0>n

00:17:30.865 --> 00:17:31.425
<v Speaker 0>dash.

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:39.330
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's gonna work.

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:44.530
<v Speaker 0>Where is that? Let's

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:46.289
<v Speaker 0>oh, no. We've

00:17:48.825 --> 00:17:50.825
<v Speaker 0>broken it. Alright. So my delete key is

00:17:50.825 --> 00:17:52.825
<v Speaker 0>not gonna do what I want. Oh,

00:17:58.265 --> 00:17:59.705
<v Speaker 0>okay. That's what that's

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:01.860
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So it wasn't enter I want to

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.299
<v Speaker 0>do. It's control x,

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:05.940
<v Speaker 0>and

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.460
<v Speaker 0>we're crossing everything we've got right now.

00:18:12.355 --> 00:18:14.914
<v Speaker 0>A wiser man would have tested this before

00:18:14.914 --> 00:18:17.154
<v Speaker 0>streaming it to an audience of people.

00:18:20.835 --> 00:18:22.835
<v Speaker 0>Let's just close this tab just now so

00:18:22.835 --> 00:18:24.034
<v Speaker 0>we can get a look. Okay.

00:18:25.559 --> 00:18:26.759
<v Speaker 0>So we have

00:18:27.159 --> 00:18:29.080
<v Speaker 0>a bash shell

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.239
<v Speaker 0>and we

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.480
<v Speaker 0>have s t a three mounted.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:36.839
<v Speaker 0>So we are on

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.679
<v Speaker 0>the actual disk.

00:18:39.855 --> 00:18:41.455
<v Speaker 0>Let's

00:18:41.455 --> 00:18:44.095
<v Speaker 0>go take a look first at our

00:18:46.175 --> 00:18:48.255
<v Speaker 0>the basis file is definitely what we expect.

00:18:48.255 --> 00:18:49.455
<v Speaker 0>We have the five.

00:18:50.255 --> 00:18:52.095
<v Speaker 0>So, I mean, let's just text that while

00:18:52.095 --> 00:18:53.940
<v Speaker 0>we're here for the

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.059
<v Speaker 0>just to rule that one out now. Otherwise,

00:18:57.059 --> 00:18:58.660
<v Speaker 0>I'll forget about it later and then be

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:00.019
<v Speaker 0>like, what have I done?

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:01.059
<v Speaker 0>So

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.340
<v Speaker 0>now password.

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.540
<v Speaker 0>So passwords on Linux.

00:19:09.015 --> 00:19:10.695
<v Speaker 0>Level one of two places.

00:19:13.415 --> 00:19:15.255
<v Speaker 0>I wouldn't expect to be here yet, so

00:19:15.255 --> 00:19:17.175
<v Speaker 0>that means password is not in the password

00:19:17.175 --> 00:19:18.295
<v Speaker 0>ID file,

00:19:18.535 --> 00:19:20.215
<v Speaker 0>which means we're gonna find it in

00:19:20.695 --> 00:19:21.175
<v Speaker 0>shadow.

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:26.620
<v Speaker 0>There we go. Our salted password.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:30.860
<v Speaker 0>No. I don't recall.

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:32.059
<v Speaker 0>If I run

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:34.620
<v Speaker 0>this, well, it asked for the old one.

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.220
<v Speaker 0>I definitely when we broke it. Right?

00:19:37.275 --> 00:19:37.915
<v Speaker 0>Good.

00:19:39.035 --> 00:19:41.515
<v Speaker 0>So let's just set it to

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:52.490
<v Speaker 0>Does it matter?

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:54.490
<v Speaker 0>I keep trying to think of anything I

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:55.930
<v Speaker 0>set this to because depending on what I

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:57.210
<v Speaker 0>do next, do do I open up this

00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:58.730
<v Speaker 0>machine to other people? I don't think I

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.490
<v Speaker 0>ever do. So I'm just gonna set it

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:01.610
<v Speaker 0>to password

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:02.810
<v Speaker 0>one, two, three.

00:20:05.975 --> 00:20:08.455
<v Speaker 0>Full end secure and secure because people don't

00:20:08.455 --> 00:20:10.455
<v Speaker 0>try to hack a brute force anymore. That's

00:20:10.455 --> 00:20:11.254
<v Speaker 0>my duty.

00:20:11.575 --> 00:20:12.855
<v Speaker 0>So

00:20:14.295 --> 00:20:17.575
<v Speaker 0>we know a fixed interface has failed. We've

00:20:17.575 --> 00:20:18.855
<v Speaker 0>reset the password,

00:20:19.429 --> 00:20:22.070
<v Speaker 0>and I'm gonna reboot this machine once more.

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:27.910
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. There's no

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:31.269
<v Speaker 0>my pet one is bash. So

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:33.750
<v Speaker 0>let's just reboot this

00:20:35.605 --> 00:20:38.245
<v Speaker 0>from here. Let's just power cycle it.

00:20:42.565 --> 00:20:44.405
<v Speaker 0>We should see this reboot. We're still on

00:20:44.405 --> 00:20:45.925
<v Speaker 0>the CDL over SSH line.

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:51.909
<v Speaker 0>One hoops.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:58.390
<v Speaker 0>One very minor billing.

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:02.630
<v Speaker 0>What else can I do?

00:21:09.105 --> 00:21:10.704
<v Speaker 0>Maybe I just exit it.

00:21:12.784 --> 00:21:15.264
<v Speaker 0>Oh, kernel panic. What have I done?

00:21:15.904 --> 00:21:16.864
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:21:16.865 --> 00:21:19.424
<v Speaker 0>Let's see. Power off, please.

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:25.730
<v Speaker 0>Maybe I'm just being

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:27.730
<v Speaker 0>too impatient.

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:28.370
<v Speaker 0>K.

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:34.184
<v Speaker 0>That's gonna can we get some sort of

00:21:34.184 --> 00:21:36.424
<v Speaker 0>status to tell us if the machine is

00:21:36.825 --> 00:21:37.705
<v Speaker 0>off?

00:21:38.424 --> 00:21:39.945
<v Speaker 0>We got oh, yeah. Then we got the

00:21:39.945 --> 00:21:41.065
<v Speaker 0>pairing off.

00:21:41.705 --> 00:21:42.825
<v Speaker 0>Ta da. Nice.

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:46.340
<v Speaker 0>So

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:48.820
<v Speaker 0>afternoon.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.300
<v Speaker 0>Howdy, hackers.

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:54.420
<v Speaker 0>So this machine

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:55.940
<v Speaker 0>is still

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:59.140
<v Speaker 0>powering off. So we'll to that thirty seconds,

00:21:59.140 --> 00:21:59.460
<v Speaker 0>I guess.

00:22:00.565 --> 00:22:02.485
<v Speaker 0>We'll spin it back up, and then we're

00:22:02.485 --> 00:22:04.725
<v Speaker 0>gonna do one more failure scenario.

00:22:05.445 --> 00:22:07.365
<v Speaker 0>What did we cover? We covered breaking the

00:22:07.365 --> 00:22:09.925
<v Speaker 0>interfaces, using the serial over SSH. We covered

00:22:09.925 --> 00:22:12.165
<v Speaker 0>forgetting the root password or being beyond the

00:22:12.165 --> 00:22:14.325
<v Speaker 0>twenty four hours where packet is kind enough

00:22:14.325 --> 00:22:15.605
<v Speaker 0>to tell us what the root password is.

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:18.530
<v Speaker 0>We reset the root password by modifying the

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:19.410
<v Speaker 0>boot system,

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:21.730
<v Speaker 0>but all of that relied on

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:24.530
<v Speaker 0>this, my ubt.

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:28.610
<v Speaker 0>So let's take this out of the picture.

00:22:30.284 --> 00:22:31.804
<v Speaker 0>I guess we've all done that at one

00:22:31.804 --> 00:22:33.804
<v Speaker 0>point or another. We've generated

00:22:34.125 --> 00:22:35.885
<v Speaker 0>so let's start this back up before I

00:22:35.885 --> 00:22:37.004
<v Speaker 0>ramble at you.

00:22:37.965 --> 00:22:39.645
<v Speaker 0>Push play. Yep. That's the one.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.480
<v Speaker 0>What do we do if I don't have

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.400
<v Speaker 0>access to this key anymore? Or even if

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.200
<v Speaker 0>it's the,

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.200
<v Speaker 0>you know, the key you generate on your

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.520
<v Speaker 0>machine? What's our next steps? So

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.400
<v Speaker 0>we do have an option there too.

00:22:54.755 --> 00:22:55.474
<v Speaker 0>So

00:22:55.635 --> 00:22:57.794
<v Speaker 0>what I'm gonna do is

00:22:57.794 --> 00:23:00.274
<v Speaker 0>assume I've already lost my YubiKey.

00:23:01.715 --> 00:23:04.115
<v Speaker 0>We're gonna try and SSH back into our

00:23:04.115 --> 00:23:04.595
<v Speaker 0>machine.

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:11.350
<v Speaker 0>OS might just not be healthy yet. We'll

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:12.309
<v Speaker 0>just leave that.

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:13.590
<v Speaker 0>Let's

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:17.110
<v Speaker 0>just generate a new key.

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:19.670
<v Speaker 0>That's we've lost our old key. We need

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:20.230
<v Speaker 0>a new key.

00:23:22.285 --> 00:23:26.284
<v Speaker 0>Let's save this here. So local TMP key.

00:23:27.645 --> 00:23:28.924
<v Speaker 0>The pass phrase,

00:23:29.325 --> 00:23:30.605
<v Speaker 0>and we

00:23:30.605 --> 00:23:31.645
<v Speaker 0>now have

00:23:32.765 --> 00:23:33.565
<v Speaker 0>two

00:23:33.565 --> 00:23:35.725
<v Speaker 0>keys. I'll just do that bigger. Maybe I

00:23:35.725 --> 00:23:37.350
<v Speaker 0>should have made that bigger earlier. I need

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:38.870
<v Speaker 0>to remember that. Okay.

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:42.150
<v Speaker 0>And if we come back up here, let's

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:44.309
<v Speaker 0>just turn on some verbosity.

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:49.590
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So our OS is still

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:50.150
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm.

00:23:50.705 --> 00:23:52.705
<v Speaker 0>Still coming to terms with itself.

00:23:57.425 --> 00:24:00.625
<v Speaker 0>It takes networking. Right? I did. Sure. It

00:24:00.625 --> 00:24:01.265
<v Speaker 0>definitely did.

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:14.430
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Totally be fine.

00:24:19.915 --> 00:24:22.715
<v Speaker 0>What are my other options? Other than probably

00:24:22.715 --> 00:24:24.315
<v Speaker 0>just being patient, which

00:24:25.674 --> 00:24:26.554
<v Speaker 0>I'm not doing.

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:32.409
<v Speaker 0>So question from Rain.

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:36.410
<v Speaker 0>Which version of Linux is this running? This

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:38.090
<v Speaker 0>was it'd been '2 '20.

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:41.690
<v Speaker 0>So just as one of the fast operating

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:44.085
<v Speaker 0>systems available on packet fast, I think, means

00:24:44.085 --> 00:24:46.405
<v Speaker 0>that it professions in under one or two

00:24:46.405 --> 00:24:47.924
<v Speaker 0>minutes. I'm sure if we

00:24:48.645 --> 00:24:50.245
<v Speaker 0>let's get that another minute, and we'll come

00:24:50.245 --> 00:24:51.685
<v Speaker 0>back to that. I can always reboot it

00:24:51.685 --> 00:24:53.525
<v Speaker 0>if necessary. But when you have

00:24:54.965 --> 00:24:56.485
<v Speaker 0>when you go to spin up an operating

00:24:56.485 --> 00:24:58.485
<v Speaker 0>system or a server web and operating system,

00:24:58.965 --> 00:25:01.419
<v Speaker 0>some of them do have the star. And

00:25:01.419 --> 00:25:03.179
<v Speaker 0>that just means yeah. There we go. Deploys

00:25:03.179 --> 00:25:05.340
<v Speaker 0>in sixty seconds. So it went to twenty

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:07.340
<v Speaker 0>o four. It's nice and quick, and the

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:08.539
<v Speaker 0>machine gets healthy quickly.

00:25:11.434 --> 00:25:13.914
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So is this still broken?

00:25:20.795 --> 00:25:21.595
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:25:22.635 --> 00:25:24.554
<v Speaker 0>What about my out of band console?

00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:29.210
<v Speaker 0>My SSH.

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:29.690
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:40.090
<v Speaker 0>Machine's still there. How's that SSH?

00:25:40.755 --> 00:25:43.315
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I generated keys earlier.

00:25:46.115 --> 00:25:46.995
<v Speaker 0>Sneaky.

00:25:48.995 --> 00:25:50.914
<v Speaker 0>There is nothing up my sleeves.

00:25:51.155 --> 00:25:51.955
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:25:53.315 --> 00:25:54.835
<v Speaker 0>That machine looks good now. So

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:01.929
<v Speaker 0>I have to quit that.

00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:09.370
<v Speaker 0>Wait.

00:26:13.534 --> 00:26:16.095
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's just get a new tab open.

00:26:16.095 --> 00:26:17.695
<v Speaker 0>I'm not gonna waste time trying to memorize

00:26:17.695 --> 00:26:18.815
<v Speaker 0>a worker terminal.

00:26:19.135 --> 00:26:19.695
<v Speaker 0>So

00:26:20.014 --> 00:26:21.534
<v Speaker 0>go back to my account directory because I

00:26:21.534 --> 00:26:22.734
<v Speaker 0>want these keys.

00:26:22.894 --> 00:26:24.975
<v Speaker 0>What I'm gonna do is just make sure

00:26:24.975 --> 00:26:26.174
<v Speaker 0>this is definitely broken.

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:28.450
<v Speaker 0>Now that I've removed yep. There we go.

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:31.650
<v Speaker 0>So we no longer have serial over SSH

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:32.450
<v Speaker 0>access

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:34.929
<v Speaker 0>and no longer have

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:38.049
<v Speaker 0>standard access.

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:40.530
<v Speaker 0>We we have no way to get on

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:41.170
<v Speaker 0>to this machine.

00:26:43.455 --> 00:26:44.495
<v Speaker 0>So

00:26:45.615 --> 00:26:47.054
<v Speaker 0>let's try

00:26:50.415 --> 00:26:51.294
<v Speaker 0>casting

00:26:52.975 --> 00:26:53.295
<v Speaker 0>this.

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:57.710
<v Speaker 0>We're gonna come to my s z at

00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:58.830
<v Speaker 0>key settings,

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:01.310
<v Speaker 0>and we believe that test one, as I've

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:02.830
<v Speaker 0>already deleted it locally.

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:05.390
<v Speaker 0>We'll add test

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:09.150
<v Speaker 0>test two, wonderful name, and go.

00:27:11.275 --> 00:27:11.995
<v Speaker 0>Now

00:27:12.875 --> 00:27:14.155
<v Speaker 0>maybe this is gonna be a lot easier

00:27:14.155 --> 00:27:15.355
<v Speaker 0>than I thought,

00:27:15.835 --> 00:27:18.715
<v Speaker 0>but I don't think seal over SSH updates

00:27:18.715 --> 00:27:21.355
<v Speaker 0>in real time with those keys, but I

00:27:21.355 --> 00:27:22.315
<v Speaker 0>could

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:25.289
<v Speaker 0>be wrong. Yep. Okay.

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:28.810
<v Speaker 0>Yes. It does not work. So the c

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:30.250
<v Speaker 0>l or SSH,

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:32.649
<v Speaker 0>to the best of my knowledge

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:34.170
<v Speaker 0>excuse

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:36.090
<v Speaker 0>me. And to the best of my knowledge,

00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:37.290
<v Speaker 0>using the keys

00:27:37.795 --> 00:27:39.715
<v Speaker 0>the machine was provisioned with.

00:27:41.075 --> 00:27:41.635
<v Speaker 0>So

00:27:42.035 --> 00:27:44.115
<v Speaker 0>we do have one more tool

00:27:44.435 --> 00:27:46.674
<v Speaker 0>available, which is the Rescue

00:27:47.155 --> 00:27:48.034
<v Speaker 0>OS.

00:27:48.515 --> 00:27:49.875
<v Speaker 0>So when I click okay here,

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:53.889
<v Speaker 0>what happens behind the scenes is

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:56.610
<v Speaker 0>the server is rebooted

00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:57.409
<v Speaker 0>and

00:27:58.530 --> 00:27:59.970
<v Speaker 0>using Pixi,

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:03.009
<v Speaker 0>lose a Alpine operating system

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:04.450
<v Speaker 0>and to RAM.

00:28:07.055 --> 00:28:09.215
<v Speaker 0>And that Rescue OS

00:28:09.455 --> 00:28:11.695
<v Speaker 0>will have access to all of the keys

00:28:11.695 --> 00:28:14.495
<v Speaker 0>that I can manage through my profile.

00:28:16.415 --> 00:28:18.575
<v Speaker 0>So I believe

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:24.100
<v Speaker 0>I don't know how long it takes,

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.059
<v Speaker 0>that we should be able to get into

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:29.460
<v Speaker 0>SQLs.

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.460
<v Speaker 0>And that might just take a moment as

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:31.700
<v Speaker 0>well.

00:28:44.115 --> 00:28:46.195
<v Speaker 0>Maybe if I just hang it for now.

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:56.139
<v Speaker 0>Just click over here.

00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:00.780
<v Speaker 0>It still says I'll ping. So,

00:29:02.164 --> 00:29:04.164
<v Speaker 0>hopefully, it's just a a matter of waiting

00:29:04.164 --> 00:29:05.205
<v Speaker 0>a moment or two.

00:29:09.524 --> 00:29:10.804
<v Speaker 0>I will

00:29:11.924 --> 00:29:13.605
<v Speaker 0>say that I have tried to use the

00:29:13.605 --> 00:29:16.164
<v Speaker 0>rescue mode, rescue OS,

00:29:16.325 --> 00:29:17.125
<v Speaker 0>a few times,

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:20.470
<v Speaker 0>and I have had a lot of complications.

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:24.230
<v Speaker 0>Generally, where it's either kicked me off or

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:26.070
<v Speaker 0>I've had to kind of tell it to

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:27.670
<v Speaker 0>reboot until more than once.

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:30.070
<v Speaker 0>And I'm not sure what's going on behind

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:31.830
<v Speaker 0>the scene, if I'm being too impatient, if

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:33.995
<v Speaker 0>I just need to wait or not. Patience

00:29:33.995 --> 00:29:37.195
<v Speaker 0>is something I'm usually quite good at, but

00:29:38.794 --> 00:29:40.394
<v Speaker 0>the fear is not so much.

00:29:41.434 --> 00:29:43.594
<v Speaker 0>So I'm gonna just refresh,

00:29:43.914 --> 00:29:46.475
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna tell it to reboot into that

00:29:46.475 --> 00:29:48.394
<v Speaker 0>again. And it's gonna tell me it's already

00:29:48.394 --> 00:29:49.195
<v Speaker 0>there, isn't it?

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:51.570
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:52.850
<v Speaker 0>So I think I just

00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:56.290
<v Speaker 0>think I just have to be patient. There

00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:57.730
<v Speaker 0>we go. There's a pen already.

00:29:58.370 --> 00:29:59.570
<v Speaker 0>Time to dance.

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:01.810
<v Speaker 0>I don't have your confidence ring.

00:30:06.645 --> 00:30:07.445
<v Speaker 0>Really should have

00:30:08.085 --> 00:30:10.164
<v Speaker 0>okay.

00:30:14.005 --> 00:30:15.125
<v Speaker 0>It was hangable,

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:19.220
<v Speaker 0>but not SSHable.

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:20.740
<v Speaker 0>Does that mean that if we put it

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:22.100
<v Speaker 0>into a printer again?

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:24.899
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So it says Alpine.

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:30.020
<v Speaker 0>That's a pretty quick

00:30:30.434 --> 00:30:31.315
<v Speaker 0>refusal.

00:30:31.315 --> 00:30:33.715
<v Speaker 0>That's good. The time and out one means

00:30:33.715 --> 00:30:36.195
<v Speaker 0>SSH wasn't running. Now I think it's running.

00:30:36.514 --> 00:30:38.355
<v Speaker 0>I just need to point it to my

00:30:38.355 --> 00:30:38.994
<v Speaker 0>key,

00:30:40.595 --> 00:30:42.195
<v Speaker 0>which is here.

00:30:44.034 --> 00:30:44.674
<v Speaker 0>Who who?

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:49.220
<v Speaker 0>And

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:52.340
<v Speaker 0>now I just have to

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:56.980
<v Speaker 0>rid of that, accept it again,

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:57.940
<v Speaker 0>and then

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:00.260
<v Speaker 0>and then we're in Alpine OS.

00:31:01.635 --> 00:31:02.995
<v Speaker 0>We can mount

00:31:09.155 --> 00:31:10.115
<v Speaker 0>how dare you?

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:21.830
<v Speaker 0>So why is my disk busy?

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:26.230
<v Speaker 0>Potentially, I just don't understand the protection setup,

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:27.350
<v Speaker 0>so let's check.

00:31:30.265 --> 00:31:31.305
<v Speaker 0>SDA

00:31:32.585 --> 00:31:34.745
<v Speaker 0>root partition three.

00:31:35.065 --> 00:31:38.025
<v Speaker 0>Let's

00:31:38.025 --> 00:31:38.745
<v Speaker 0>try again.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.440
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's try.

00:31:52.695 --> 00:31:53.974
<v Speaker 0>64.

00:31:54.375 --> 00:31:56.374
<v Speaker 0>Tab. I see it three.

00:31:56.934 --> 00:31:57.815
<v Speaker 0>Temp.

00:31:58.375 --> 00:32:00.774
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So it's definitely to the base, it's

00:32:00.774 --> 00:32:01.494
<v Speaker 0>busy.

00:32:03.255 --> 00:32:04.294
<v Speaker 0>Why?

00:32:07.809 --> 00:32:08.690
<v Speaker 0>What's going on?

00:32:22.145 --> 00:32:23.744
<v Speaker 0>I'm doing something

00:32:25.424 --> 00:32:26.144
<v Speaker 0>silly.

00:32:27.585 --> 00:32:29.184
<v Speaker 0>The answer is usually

00:32:30.145 --> 00:32:30.625
<v Speaker 0>yes.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.200
<v Speaker 0>Let's take a look.

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.480
<v Speaker 0>Definitely.

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.080
<v Speaker 0>Right? I've seen that.

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:44.880
<v Speaker 0>Can't spell that. Okay.

00:32:52.735 --> 00:32:55.615
<v Speaker 0>Oh, wait. The STP and an SDA. Okay.

00:32:55.615 --> 00:32:56.894
<v Speaker 0>Let's try.

00:32:59.855 --> 00:33:01.615
<v Speaker 0>I have STP

00:33:01.615 --> 00:33:02.095
<v Speaker 0>three.

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:06.830
<v Speaker 0>Why are y'all busy?

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:16.990
<v Speaker 0>I can't

00:33:16.195 --> 00:33:18.355
<v Speaker 0>mount either of my disks.

00:33:18.755 --> 00:33:20.115
<v Speaker 0>That's problematic.

00:33:20.115 --> 00:33:21.395
<v Speaker 0>I will see that.

00:33:23.155 --> 00:33:25.794
<v Speaker 0>Do I have the partition type wrong?

00:33:26.115 --> 00:33:27.555
<v Speaker 0>Resource busy.

00:33:27.555 --> 00:33:29.955
<v Speaker 0>Resource busy. Resource busy.

00:33:29.955 --> 00:33:30.515
<v Speaker 0>How about

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:31.930
<v Speaker 0>swap?

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:33.930
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:33:49.544 --> 00:33:50.504
<v Speaker 0>Well, that's a problem.

00:33:58.039 --> 00:33:58.759
<v Speaker 0>I

00:34:03.159 --> 00:34:04.600
<v Speaker 0>know what we did.

00:34:07.735 --> 00:34:08.535
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:34:08.695 --> 00:34:10.054
<v Speaker 0>Let's try.

00:34:11.895 --> 00:34:14.455
<v Speaker 0>That's not already mounted. Right? Let's have a

00:34:14.455 --> 00:34:14.695
<v Speaker 0>look.

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:22.310
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:25.350
<v Speaker 0>Definitely not mounted.

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:29.110
<v Speaker 0>So why would it be busy?

00:34:34.275 --> 00:34:36.594
<v Speaker 0>I know I know. I should cross out.

00:34:36.594 --> 00:34:38.114
<v Speaker 0>Try and rescue man.

00:34:42.755 --> 00:34:44.435
<v Speaker 0>K. Let's check the docs.

00:34:46.514 --> 00:34:47.315
<v Speaker 0>Rescue.

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:55.790
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we tested that.

00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:00.750
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I've tried that.

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:02.830
<v Speaker 0>Oh, wait. Oh.

00:35:06.265 --> 00:35:08.185
<v Speaker 0>Oh, what's what's that?

00:35:08.585 --> 00:35:09.785
<v Speaker 0>Winter Earth.

00:35:11.385 --> 00:35:12.505
<v Speaker 0>Oh, okay.

00:35:14.025 --> 00:35:15.785
<v Speaker 0>Let's

00:35:15.785 --> 00:35:16.265
<v Speaker 0>try.

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.960
<v Speaker 0>See, no one ever asks for your help.

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:27.920
<v Speaker 0>DevME127.

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:29.280
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

00:35:30.435 --> 00:35:32.115
<v Speaker 0>well, there we go. It helps if you

00:35:32.115 --> 00:35:33.635
<v Speaker 0>use the right device.

00:35:33.635 --> 00:35:34.115
<v Speaker 0>So

00:35:34.915 --> 00:35:36.915
<v Speaker 0>now we're in slash mount.

00:35:37.555 --> 00:35:38.755
<v Speaker 0>We want to

00:35:38.915 --> 00:35:40.355
<v Speaker 0>reprovision this

00:35:40.435 --> 00:35:41.635
<v Speaker 0>with my

00:35:41.635 --> 00:35:43.875
<v Speaker 0>key, which means I just have to go

00:35:43.875 --> 00:35:45.715
<v Speaker 0>into

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:47.320
<v Speaker 0>slash slash slash

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.040
<v Speaker 0>slash

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:49.640
<v Speaker 0>s s h,

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.600
<v Speaker 0>and we're gonna see my authorized key file

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:53.240
<v Speaker 0>here.

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.880
<v Speaker 0>I had the two previous keys. Have a

00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:59.400
<v Speaker 0>Yubi key and a test one which we

00:35:59.400 --> 00:35:59.800
<v Speaker 0>deleted,

00:36:01.065 --> 00:36:03.225
<v Speaker 0>which means now I need to

00:36:03.385 --> 00:36:05.385
<v Speaker 0>what was that temp directory?

00:36:11.545 --> 00:36:11.945
<v Speaker 0>There.

00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:15.610
<v Speaker 0>I get to put my key.

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:17.770
<v Speaker 0>My key is in the temp directory.

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:20.090
<v Speaker 0>Let's

00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:21.450
<v Speaker 0>copy this,

00:36:25.944 --> 00:36:28.184
<v Speaker 0>And we'll see the end to it just

00:36:28.184 --> 00:36:30.345
<v Speaker 0>so that I can copy that to you

00:36:30.345 --> 00:36:31.305
<v Speaker 0>once more.

00:36:32.345 --> 00:36:34.425
<v Speaker 0>We're just going into echo.

00:36:37.385 --> 00:36:37.625
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:39.930
<v Speaker 0>We're just gonna then

00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:41.770
<v Speaker 0>I

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:43.930
<v Speaker 0>there we go. We can there. We can.

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:47.130
<v Speaker 0>And we're gonna paste that key in.

00:36:49.369 --> 00:36:52.170
<v Speaker 0>Now I can jump out. I can view

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:52.890
<v Speaker 0>a moment

00:36:57.845 --> 00:36:59.045
<v Speaker 0>reboot.

00:37:04.885 --> 00:37:05.925
<v Speaker 0>And then

00:37:06.245 --> 00:37:08.805
<v Speaker 0>our final task is to SSH back in

00:37:08.805 --> 00:37:10.810
<v Speaker 0>with our temporary key.

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:14.810
<v Speaker 0>So grab this IP. I will hang it

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:16.090
<v Speaker 0>and be very patient

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:19.530
<v Speaker 0>as I wait for my machine to be

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:20.410
<v Speaker 0>healthy again

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:23.690
<v Speaker 0>and recovered from the destruction of my SSH

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:24.010
<v Speaker 0>keys.

00:37:25.005 --> 00:37:27.005
<v Speaker 0>And still in time for me to catch

00:37:27.005 --> 00:37:29.885
<v Speaker 0>the opening talk at q QConn.

00:37:30.125 --> 00:37:30.765
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:37:36.204 --> 00:37:36.684
<v Speaker 0>Yay.

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:40.550
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. If I can access it onto my

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:42.390
<v Speaker 0>machine, I will I I I will get

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:44.550
<v Speaker 0>back to the booking very briefly before I

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:45.190
<v Speaker 0>quick

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:46.950
<v Speaker 0>close all of it.

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:50.070
<v Speaker 0>And I'll drink some tea.

00:37:53.885 --> 00:37:55.645
<v Speaker 0>Oh, nice. Give me a large cup.

00:38:03.005 --> 00:38:05.165
<v Speaker 0>Machines should read a bit faster, though.

00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:16.430
<v Speaker 0>Let's see what we have here. I should

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:18.110
<v Speaker 0>start seeing a bit in a

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:19.069
<v Speaker 0>bit.

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:39.750
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Come on. Be faster.

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:46.150
<v Speaker 0>Maybe if I

00:38:45.444 --> 00:38:47.045
<v Speaker 0>stop pinging it,

00:38:47.684 --> 00:38:50.405
<v Speaker 0>it'll fill it into thinking I've given up.

00:38:50.405 --> 00:38:52.405
<v Speaker 0>And then when I ping it again,

00:38:56.484 --> 00:38:57.444
<v Speaker 0>it was arbitrary.

00:38:58.430 --> 00:39:00.109
<v Speaker 0>What I find is, like, if you just

00:39:00.109 --> 00:39:02.829
<v Speaker 0>hit return with a little bit more force,

00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:04.589
<v Speaker 0>you know, computers cannot

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:07.070
<v Speaker 0>you know, they they try harder, I think.

00:39:08.349 --> 00:39:08.829
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:39:15.605 --> 00:39:21.845
<v Speaker 0>It's

00:39:21.845 --> 00:39:24.165
<v Speaker 0>definitely gonna come back online. I definitely haven't

00:39:24.165 --> 00:39:24.885
<v Speaker 0>broken anything.

00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:26.730
<v Speaker 0>Right?

00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:29.610
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if that was a statement

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:30.330
<v Speaker 0>or a question.

00:39:37.785 --> 00:39:38.585
<v Speaker 0>About being

00:39:39.545 --> 00:39:41.224
<v Speaker 0>what's that been? Two minutes? Or is that

00:39:41.224 --> 00:39:41.785
<v Speaker 0>actually about

00:39:44.825 --> 00:39:46.585
<v Speaker 0>okay. So what did I change?

00:39:47.545 --> 00:39:49.145
<v Speaker 0>Which is into rescue OS,

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:53.700
<v Speaker 0>and all I did was modify my authorized

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:54.980
<v Speaker 0>key fail.

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:01.780
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'm confident I haven't broken it.

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:04.500
<v Speaker 0>What we can do

00:40:05.675 --> 00:40:08.315
<v Speaker 0>is maybe watch the machine booting up. Oh,

00:40:08.955 --> 00:40:10.075
<v Speaker 0>there we go.

00:40:10.475 --> 00:40:12.315
<v Speaker 0>I need patience. I just

00:40:12.795 --> 00:40:14.475
<v Speaker 0>I need more patience.

00:40:16.315 --> 00:40:17.915
<v Speaker 0>So if we SSH

00:40:17.915 --> 00:40:18.715
<v Speaker 0>using

00:40:18.715 --> 00:40:19.275
<v Speaker 0>new key,

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.560
<v Speaker 0>deleting the known host,

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:28.760
<v Speaker 0>SSH section in.

00:40:37.065 --> 00:40:38.665
<v Speaker 0>I will do my bookie.

00:40:41.464 --> 00:40:43.545
<v Speaker 0>Cool. I'm pretty chilled through that.

00:40:43.785 --> 00:40:44.425
<v Speaker 0>So

00:40:44.585 --> 00:40:46.345
<v Speaker 0>I hope that's beneficial.

00:40:46.345 --> 00:40:47.465
<v Speaker 0>I hope you have

00:40:47.785 --> 00:40:50.665
<v Speaker 0>learned how you can really recover from some

00:40:50.665 --> 00:40:51.464
<v Speaker 0>serious failures.

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.780
<v Speaker 0>None of the ones none of the failures

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:56.020
<v Speaker 0>scenarios I covered today were particularly

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:57.300
<v Speaker 0>too daunting.

00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:58.900
<v Speaker 0>You know, some of the suggestions were to

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.380
<v Speaker 0>delete and destroy most of my disk. And

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:02.820
<v Speaker 0>I think it was definitely a call for

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:05.025
<v Speaker 0>me to do videos where we do some

00:41:05.025 --> 00:41:06.305
<v Speaker 0>kind of more

00:41:08.145 --> 00:41:11.585
<v Speaker 0>more intricate recovery processes that aren't as superficial

00:41:11.585 --> 00:41:13.825
<v Speaker 0>as SSH keys and root passwords. Those are

00:41:13.825 --> 00:41:15.825
<v Speaker 0>really easy to fix because, you know, we

00:41:15.825 --> 00:41:17.505
<v Speaker 0>have the tools available to do that.

00:41:19.105 --> 00:41:20.670
<v Speaker 0>And and the off chance that you do

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:22.030
<v Speaker 0>do something like,

00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:25.710
<v Speaker 0>know, say you've got some I don't know

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:26.910
<v Speaker 0>why you were using

00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:27.790
<v Speaker 0>DD

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:30.430
<v Speaker 0>on a machine like this, but,

00:41:31.895 --> 00:41:34.135
<v Speaker 0>you know, it is possible to

00:41:35.175 --> 00:41:36.535
<v Speaker 0>to accidentally

00:41:36.935 --> 00:41:38.375
<v Speaker 0>destroy partitions.

00:41:38.775 --> 00:41:40.055
<v Speaker 0>And we will go through some of those

00:41:40.055 --> 00:41:42.214
<v Speaker 0>filler scenarios where either it's a case of

00:41:42.214 --> 00:41:44.055
<v Speaker 0>using the tools that we have, the seal

00:41:44.055 --> 00:41:46.440
<v Speaker 0>over SSH or the rescue operating system in

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:48.280
<v Speaker 0>order to just get data off to migrate

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:50.599
<v Speaker 0>it to another machine that isn't is completely

00:41:50.599 --> 00:41:52.360
<v Speaker 0>so far or just

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:55.160
<v Speaker 0>been able to reprovision sometimes.

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:56.680
<v Speaker 0>You know, Linux

00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.640
<v Speaker 0>is is quite nice at helping you with

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:00.839
<v Speaker 0>some of this stuff, and that if we

00:42:00.839 --> 00:42:02.359
<v Speaker 0>come to our app cache

00:42:04.895 --> 00:42:06.175
<v Speaker 0>our cache

00:42:08.175 --> 00:42:08.895
<v Speaker 0>okay.

00:42:11.055 --> 00:42:12.255
<v Speaker 0>Maybe not then.

00:42:13.295 --> 00:42:14.895
<v Speaker 0>So the I guess the base images won't

00:42:14.895 --> 00:42:16.200
<v Speaker 0>come with an app cache. But if you

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.200
<v Speaker 0>have been updating your packages over time, the

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:19.960
<v Speaker 0>chances are those devs are still available on

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:21.480
<v Speaker 0>the system, which will speed up the process.

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.880
<v Speaker 0>We can reprovision that that way. And, of

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:25.480
<v Speaker 0>course, there ways we can pull those files

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:27.975
<v Speaker 0>from other machines on the project. So we've

00:42:27.975 --> 00:42:29.655
<v Speaker 0>all looked at those kind of failure scenarios.

00:42:29.655 --> 00:42:31.095
<v Speaker 0>We will get a bit more adventurous. But

00:42:31.095 --> 00:42:32.695
<v Speaker 0>today was a nice brief

00:42:32.935 --> 00:42:35.495
<v Speaker 0>kind of introduction into what's available as things

00:42:35.495 --> 00:42:37.575
<v Speaker 0>go wrong. So thank you very much for

00:42:37.575 --> 00:42:38.135
<v Speaker 0>watching.

00:42:38.535 --> 00:42:40.295
<v Speaker 0>Have a great day. And if you're at

00:42:40.295 --> 00:42:40.855
<v Speaker 0>KubeCon,

00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:43.050
<v Speaker 0>feel free to drop me a message on

00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:45.130
<v Speaker 0>Twitter, and we can chat about what we've

00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:46.650
<v Speaker 0>seen. Alright. Cheers.
