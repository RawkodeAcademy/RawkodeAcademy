00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.760
<v Speaker 0>Hello, and welcome to today's episode of Rawkode

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.840
<v Speaker 0>Live. I'm your host, Rawkode.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.840
<v Speaker 0>Before we get started, I just wanna take

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.080
<v Speaker 0>ten seconds to say thank you to Equinix

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.600
<v Speaker 0>Medal. They are my employer,

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.080
<v Speaker 0>and they provide the time and resources for

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.840
<v Speaker 0>me to put the show together and find

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.705
<v Speaker 0>the people to present all of these awesome

00:01:14.705 --> 00:01:16.545
<v Speaker 0>cloud native technologies so that we can all

00:01:16.545 --> 00:01:17.424
<v Speaker 0>learn together.

00:01:17.905 --> 00:01:19.505
<v Speaker 0>Today, we're gonna be taking a look at

00:01:19.505 --> 00:01:22.305
<v Speaker 0>Teleport. Teleport is a application

00:01:22.305 --> 00:01:25.585
<v Speaker 0>for providing secure access to servers, Kubernetes, and

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:27.970
<v Speaker 0>applications. And to tell us more about that,

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.250
<v Speaker 0>I am joined by

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.170
<v Speaker 0>Steven Martin, a solutions engineer for Teleport. Hey,

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.090
<v Speaker 0>Steven. How are you? Hi. I'm great, David.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.410
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for having us. Oh, my pleasure.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.890
<v Speaker 0>Do you want to kick us off by

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.704
<v Speaker 0>just spending a little bit of time to

00:01:41.704 --> 00:01:43.465
<v Speaker 0>first introduce yourself, tell us a little bit

00:01:43.465 --> 00:01:45.465
<v Speaker 0>about you, and then we'll talk about what

00:01:45.465 --> 00:01:47.305
<v Speaker 0>Teleport is a problem that solves and why

00:01:47.305 --> 00:01:48.104
<v Speaker 0>we want it.

00:01:48.825 --> 00:01:49.545
<v Speaker 1>Sure.

00:01:49.625 --> 00:01:52.344
<v Speaker 1>I and I myself, I joined Teleport,

00:01:52.744 --> 00:01:54.850
<v Speaker 1>about a year ago. Most most folks knew

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.290
<v Speaker 1>us as Gravitational.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.090
<v Speaker 1>We just recently changed our name to Focal

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.810
<v Speaker 1>Fully Teleport as that's our, you know, ongoing

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.890
<v Speaker 1>focus, as we've seen a lot of response

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:04.770
<v Speaker 1>in the market.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.010
<v Speaker 1>And myself, I came from, you know, a

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.890
<v Speaker 1>mix of

00:02:08.235 --> 00:02:09.195
<v Speaker 1>legacy

00:02:09.514 --> 00:02:10.315
<v Speaker 1>cloud,

00:02:10.715 --> 00:02:12.475
<v Speaker 1>on prem hosted environments,

00:02:12.475 --> 00:02:14.235
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of SSH,

00:02:14.235 --> 00:02:15.515
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes, Docker.

00:02:16.635 --> 00:02:19.515
<v Speaker 1>And, you know, excited me about joining Teleport

00:02:19.515 --> 00:02:20.235
<v Speaker 1>was,

00:02:20.475 --> 00:02:21.915
<v Speaker 1>you know, the ability to provide that kind

00:02:21.915 --> 00:02:24.430
<v Speaker 1>of access and also in a secure and

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.670
<v Speaker 1>audit

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.430
<v Speaker 1>auditable way.

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's what really Teleport is doing is

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.830
<v Speaker 1>trying to provide access to resources

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.150
<v Speaker 1>that enterprises and individuals,

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.950
<v Speaker 1>want,

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.474
<v Speaker 1>and making sure that it's, you know, easily

00:02:37.474 --> 00:02:38.035
<v Speaker 1>done,

00:02:38.355 --> 00:02:39.555
<v Speaker 1>though very secure.

00:02:40.035 --> 00:02:41.235
<v Speaker 1>And I think as you go through this,

00:02:41.235 --> 00:02:42.675
<v Speaker 1>you'll see, you know, the checks and balances

00:02:42.675 --> 00:02:43.475
<v Speaker 1>we have,

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:45.474
<v Speaker 1>to make sure that that that is the

00:02:45.474 --> 00:02:45.875
<v Speaker 1>case.

00:02:46.275 --> 00:02:47.474
<v Speaker 1>But I, yeah, I can step through a

00:02:47.474 --> 00:02:49.235
<v Speaker 1>little die high level of diagram of, you

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:50.970
<v Speaker 1>know, how it works and maybe make it

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.210
<v Speaker 1>more clear about what we're doing. Yeah. It'd

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.490
<v Speaker 0>be awesome. Okay.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.410
<v Speaker 1>So Wait. Go ahead. Teleport, you know, we're

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.050
<v Speaker 1>calling it the unified

00:03:06.005 --> 00:03:07.365
<v Speaker 1>access plane,

00:03:07.445 --> 00:03:10.565
<v Speaker 1>and, essentially, that's, again, providing that access to

00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:11.845
<v Speaker 1>multiple resources.

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:13.685
<v Speaker 1>And as you can see on the right,

00:03:14.085 --> 00:03:15.765
<v Speaker 1>you know, we have these set of

00:03:16.005 --> 00:03:17.365
<v Speaker 1>typically, your SSH

00:03:17.365 --> 00:03:19.870
<v Speaker 1>nodes, those can be, you know, bare metal

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.670
<v Speaker 1>machines. Those can be e c two instances,

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Google VMs,

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.190
<v Speaker 1>you know, whatever you're running,

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.750
<v Speaker 1>and we provide those specifically for,

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.190
<v Speaker 1>Linux machines.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.455
<v Speaker 1>Also, typically popular is getting access to Kubernetes

00:03:34.455 --> 00:03:35.335
<v Speaker 1>clusters.

00:03:35.895 --> 00:03:37.335
<v Speaker 1>That could be micro

00:03:37.335 --> 00:03:39.495
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes. That could be EKS,

00:03:39.575 --> 00:03:40.535
<v Speaker 1>AKS.

00:03:41.655 --> 00:03:43.175
<v Speaker 1>And, you know, we have one of the

00:03:43.175 --> 00:03:46.055
<v Speaker 1>most in-depth coverage of that, providing access to

00:03:46.055 --> 00:03:46.615
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.050
<v Speaker 1>And in terms of beyond writing access, we're

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.490
<v Speaker 1>also recording activity both for SSH

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.810
<v Speaker 1>activity as well as Kubernetes. So whether a

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.130
<v Speaker 1>person's getting a list of pods,

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.770
<v Speaker 1>executing a session, you know, we can record

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:02.090
<v Speaker 1>it all.

00:04:03.145 --> 00:04:05.065
<v Speaker 1>And then lastly, we just added in our

00:04:05.065 --> 00:04:06.105
<v Speaker 1>5.0

00:04:06.105 --> 00:04:08.025
<v Speaker 1>web application access.

00:04:08.265 --> 00:04:10.745
<v Speaker 1>So that's the ability to, you know, provide

00:04:10.745 --> 00:04:13.705
<v Speaker 1>either to public URLs or internal URLs.

00:04:14.345 --> 00:04:16.730
<v Speaker 1>And, David, you probably have better list of,

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.730
<v Speaker 1>you know, those kind of applications to do.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.890
<v Speaker 1>But if you're exposing Grafana,

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.050
<v Speaker 1>Jenkins, whatever,

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.090
<v Speaker 1>you can now expose that through Teleport.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.970
<v Speaker 1>And the way we secure that is through

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.810
<v Speaker 1>using, short lived certificates.

00:04:31.235 --> 00:04:33.635
<v Speaker 1>So a user would authenticate

00:04:33.875 --> 00:04:36.115
<v Speaker 1>through our proxy that works with the auth

00:04:36.115 --> 00:04:36.835
<v Speaker 1>service,

00:04:37.635 --> 00:04:39.875
<v Speaker 1>and receive a short lived certificate,

00:04:40.275 --> 00:04:42.355
<v Speaker 1>whether they're using that in the web,

00:04:42.595 --> 00:04:44.540
<v Speaker 1>or in the command line. And the reason

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.100
<v Speaker 1>we specifically went with short lived certificates

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.820
<v Speaker 1>instead of some folks were using static keys,

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.620
<v Speaker 1>the certificates allow us to designate a time,

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.020
<v Speaker 1>which for users is a max of twelve

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.580
<v Speaker 1>hours,

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.580
<v Speaker 1>as well as other metadata,

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.340
<v Speaker 1>you know, what roles and users do they

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.015
<v Speaker 1>have, and the other other relevant information

00:05:02.495 --> 00:05:04.175
<v Speaker 1>to control their access.

00:05:04.815 --> 00:05:07.055
<v Speaker 1>Now when a user connects to a particular

00:05:07.055 --> 00:05:07.855
<v Speaker 1>resource,

00:05:08.255 --> 00:05:10.735
<v Speaker 1>they go to the proxy. The proxy is

00:05:10.735 --> 00:05:13.695
<v Speaker 1>the same Go based Teleport binary running on

00:05:13.695 --> 00:05:15.790
<v Speaker 1>the proxy in the auth as well as

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.270
<v Speaker 1>in, like, in the node and Kubernetes cluster

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.990
<v Speaker 1>access.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.150
<v Speaker 1>And, essentially,

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:23.230
<v Speaker 1>you know, they pass through the proxy.

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:24.830
<v Speaker 1>The proxy confirms,

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.430
<v Speaker 1>going through the auth to the node,

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.665
<v Speaker 1>and they're they're allowed in. So it's a

00:05:30.665 --> 00:05:32.025
<v Speaker 1>very secure environment,

00:05:32.745 --> 00:05:34.585
<v Speaker 1>and it go there's a way with, you

00:05:34.585 --> 00:05:37.305
<v Speaker 1>know, static keys or ways that people could

00:05:37.305 --> 00:05:38.105
<v Speaker 1>potentially,

00:05:38.425 --> 00:05:41.705
<v Speaker 1>you know, circumvent environments or use keys that

00:05:41.705 --> 00:05:43.770
<v Speaker 1>have been laying around for years. And we

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.130
<v Speaker 1>think this is this is the best way

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.810
<v Speaker 1>to go for these kind of resources.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.930
<v Speaker 1>In the case of Kubernetes,

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.250
<v Speaker 1>you know, beyond what you typically do with

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.130
<v Speaker 1>SSH,

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.130
<v Speaker 1>we have a number of ways you can

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.125
<v Speaker 1>access. We can have the kube config from

00:05:58.125 --> 00:06:00.205
<v Speaker 1>the cluster. We can run, you know, as

00:06:00.205 --> 00:06:02.285
<v Speaker 1>I think we're gonna do today, David, is,

00:06:02.285 --> 00:06:04.685
<v Speaker 1>you know, run a service within the cluster

00:06:04.685 --> 00:06:06.044
<v Speaker 1>that allows access,

00:06:06.525 --> 00:06:08.525
<v Speaker 1>and really try to provide multiple ways to

00:06:08.525 --> 00:06:09.245
<v Speaker 1>give that access.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.550
<v Speaker 1>And lastly, with the with the web app,

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.430
<v Speaker 1>you can have a Teleport agent that runs

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.230
<v Speaker 1>within,

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.990
<v Speaker 1>a single deployment or outside that's connecting in

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.990
<v Speaker 1>and providing that web app access.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.324
<v Speaker 1>And that's really, again, to allow you to

00:06:25.324 --> 00:06:27.725
<v Speaker 1>connect to services that may not always be

00:06:27.725 --> 00:06:30.125
<v Speaker 1>publicly available or directly available,

00:06:30.285 --> 00:06:31.725
<v Speaker 1>from the user's environment.

00:06:32.044 --> 00:06:33.725
<v Speaker 1>And then all of this is tracked in

00:06:33.725 --> 00:06:35.884
<v Speaker 1>terms of, you know, when these access happen,

00:06:35.884 --> 00:06:38.700
<v Speaker 1>tracking an audit log. You can control the

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.940
<v Speaker 1>number of connections people have the nodes. You

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.860
<v Speaker 1>know, there's a whole host of detailed connect

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.340
<v Speaker 1>configurations you can do. But often, it's you

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.380
<v Speaker 1>know, the best thing is you can get

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.140
<v Speaker 1>this up and going, you know, very shortly.

00:06:49.995 --> 00:06:52.155
<v Speaker 0>Nice. Yeah. I was actually going through the

00:06:52.155 --> 00:06:53.675
<v Speaker 0>documentation, and I said earlier, and I was

00:06:53.675 --> 00:06:55.595
<v Speaker 0>trying to, you know, equate it to tools

00:06:55.595 --> 00:06:57.115
<v Speaker 0>that I'm familiar with from my past. You

00:06:57.115 --> 00:06:58.235
<v Speaker 0>know? And the first thing when I see

00:06:58.235 --> 00:06:59.835
<v Speaker 0>an SSH and the server access was to

00:06:59.835 --> 00:07:00.955
<v Speaker 0>go, it's like a jump box or a

00:07:00.955 --> 00:07:02.315
<v Speaker 0>bastion box that gives me a way to

00:07:02.315 --> 00:07:02.875
<v Speaker 0>secure

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.450
<v Speaker 0>and restrict access to my customers which we

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.850
<v Speaker 0>all want. We all want better security and

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.370
<v Speaker 0>then it later done the Kubernetes stuff and

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:10.970
<v Speaker 0>I was oh, this is getting quite interesting

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.370
<v Speaker 0>and then the the web app one that

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.050
<v Speaker 0>was this like wow because

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.130
<v Speaker 0>so many times just in the last three

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:17.610
<v Speaker 0>months alone,

00:07:18.225 --> 00:07:20.225
<v Speaker 0>I like to build static sites from YAML

00:07:20.225 --> 00:07:21.665
<v Speaker 0>files and get and then host them as

00:07:21.665 --> 00:07:23.265
<v Speaker 0>websites and like JavaScript

00:07:23.265 --> 00:07:23.825
<v Speaker 0>things.

00:07:24.145 --> 00:07:26.225
<v Speaker 0>They never come without any authentication because it's

00:07:26.225 --> 00:07:28.145
<v Speaker 0>just a static site and I do this

00:07:28.145 --> 00:07:30.705
<v Speaker 0>for loads of internal stuff within Equinix Medal

00:07:30.705 --> 00:07:32.190
<v Speaker 0>and I end up sticking NGINX in front

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:33.950
<v Speaker 0>of it was like this really crappy basic

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.550
<v Speaker 0>off just to try and keep it a

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.150
<v Speaker 0>little bit secure even though it's not really

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.550
<v Speaker 0>secure and I thought this could be what

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.950
<v Speaker 0>I need inside of our clusters or bare

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.265
<v Speaker 0>metal machines to just actually secure that in

00:07:44.265 --> 00:07:46.345
<v Speaker 0>a slightly better fashion. So I'm really excited

00:07:46.345 --> 00:07:47.705
<v Speaker 0>to see how this is gonna work out

00:07:47.705 --> 00:07:48.345
<v Speaker 0>today.

00:07:48.665 --> 00:07:49.705
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Great.

00:07:50.585 --> 00:07:52.265
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Is there anything else you wanna share

00:07:52.265 --> 00:07:53.705
<v Speaker 0>or should we get over to my screen

00:07:53.705 --> 00:07:54.985
<v Speaker 1>and No. Let's let's get into it and

00:07:54.985 --> 00:07:56.665
<v Speaker 1>I think we'll, you know, we'll discuss more

00:07:56.665 --> 00:07:59.240
<v Speaker 1>of the technical as we go. Alright. Awesome.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.440
<v Speaker 0>Cool. So

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.760
<v Speaker 0>one of the things I'm really

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.520
<v Speaker 0>I advocate a lot in this show is

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.280
<v Speaker 0>I don't really wanna do anything upfront, but

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.720
<v Speaker 0>at the same time, I also don't want

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.480
<v Speaker 0>people sitting watching me spin up a Kubernetes

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.695
<v Speaker 0>cluster. So

00:08:13.254 --> 00:08:14.935
<v Speaker 0>what I have done is I got a

00:08:14.935 --> 00:08:17.014
<v Speaker 0>six node Kubernetes cluster, three control planes, three

00:08:17.014 --> 00:08:18.615
<v Speaker 0>working on. Hopefully, that should be enough for

00:08:18.615 --> 00:08:20.775
<v Speaker 0>us to play around with us today and

00:08:21.335 --> 00:08:22.694
<v Speaker 0>just in case we need it or if

00:08:22.694 --> 00:08:24.375
<v Speaker 0>we choose to do this first, I've also

00:08:24.375 --> 00:08:26.694
<v Speaker 0>got just a standard machine running Ubuntu as

00:08:26.694 --> 00:08:28.770
<v Speaker 0>well. Not a Kubernetes cluster which we could

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:29.330
<v Speaker 0>play with I

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.850
<v Speaker 0>also have access to the documentation

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:33.409
<v Speaker 0>here

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.330
<v Speaker 0>and I believe today

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.529
<v Speaker 0>are we going through the getting started guide?

00:08:38.529 --> 00:08:40.850
<v Speaker 1>Yes. Right. Okay. So quick start.

00:08:41.725 --> 00:08:43.725
<v Speaker 0>The website for anyone who wants to check

00:08:43.725 --> 00:08:44.925
<v Speaker 0>us out in their own time which is

00:08:44.925 --> 00:08:46.605
<v Speaker 0>goteleport.com.

00:08:48.125 --> 00:08:49.325
<v Speaker 0>So let's see.

00:08:50.365 --> 00:08:51.245
<v Speaker 0>Do you wanna start

00:08:51.805 --> 00:08:54.180
<v Speaker 0>with Ubuntu box or do you wanna go

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.540
<v Speaker 0>straight to the Kubernetes box? Do have that?

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:56.980
<v Speaker 1>Start with the Ubuntu

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.820
<v Speaker 1>because I I you certainly could do it

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.020
<v Speaker 1>on Kubernetes.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:00.980
<v Speaker 1>I think it's gonna be a little more

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.300
<v Speaker 1>straightforward to see it from the the Teleport

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:03.940
<v Speaker 1>instance.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.060
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's just get myself on this.

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:09.265
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:09:09.905 --> 00:09:10.705
<v Speaker 0>Easy.

00:09:10.785 --> 00:09:11.425
<v Speaker 0>So

00:09:15.105 --> 00:09:17.025
<v Speaker 0>the easiest way to get this installed is

00:09:17.025 --> 00:09:18.625
<v Speaker 0>just gonna be the Linux tarpaul. Alright?

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:26.310
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully, it's nice and fast. There we go.

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:30.630
<v Speaker 0>Did that do it? It did. Yep. You're

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:32.070
<v Speaker 1>you've you've got installed, so you do a

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Teleport version, and let's see what

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.070
<v Speaker 1>have Well, that

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.254
<v Speaker 0>I was messing around with my transparency earlier,

00:09:39.254 --> 00:09:41.014
<v Speaker 0>and now that's really painful to read.

00:09:43.415 --> 00:09:45.814
<v Speaker 1>Now we can I I would like to

00:09:45.814 --> 00:09:47.415
<v Speaker 1>come back and probably make this a Linux

00:09:47.415 --> 00:09:49.254
<v Speaker 1>service as that system d has?

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.600
<v Speaker 1>But before that, we can continue with the

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.200
<v Speaker 1>other steps and then

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.200
<v Speaker 1>do the configuration.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.080
<v Speaker 0>Okay. No problem. So

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.320
<v Speaker 0>let's just cut this and then I'll go

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.040
<v Speaker 0>through it.

00:10:04.335 --> 00:10:05.135
<v Speaker 0>So

00:10:06.735 --> 00:10:08.895
<v Speaker 0>I'm struggling to talk and type. Is so

00:10:08.895 --> 00:10:10.815
<v Speaker 0>cold in Scotland today.

00:10:11.375 --> 00:10:13.215
<v Speaker 1>So I think and and this is the

00:10:13.215 --> 00:10:15.695
<v Speaker 1>point, when we'd want to decide

00:10:16.095 --> 00:10:18.095
<v Speaker 1>what public address. We wanna put here the

00:10:18.095 --> 00:10:19.560
<v Speaker 1>DNS entry.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.880
<v Speaker 1>So that proxy service, that's where you put

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:22.440
<v Speaker 1>the

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.040
<v Speaker 1>the DNS.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.560
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So down here? Yeah.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.560
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Is this in the docs or am

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.160
<v Speaker 0>I just I think there's a if you

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.360
<v Speaker 1>go down a little further, I think it

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:32.759
<v Speaker 1>has it.

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:35.535
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So

00:10:37.775 --> 00:10:39.695
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. See that public address part?

00:10:41.535 --> 00:10:43.535
<v Speaker 1>So we we can use those instructions. I

00:10:43.535 --> 00:10:44.815
<v Speaker 1>think I was jumping a little bit ahead

00:10:44.975 --> 00:10:47.375
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Because well, because of the TLS part.

00:10:47.375 --> 00:10:48.770
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I was saying it's good

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:49.730
<v Speaker 1>for us to decide,

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:52.850
<v Speaker 1>what we wanna what DNS entry we wanna

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:53.650
<v Speaker 1>use for this.

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:56.370
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Well, let's get that in the right

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:57.250
<v Speaker 0>directory.

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:00.130
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Now it's telling me I wanna set

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:00.370
<v Speaker 0>up.

00:11:01.815 --> 00:11:03.575
<v Speaker 1>And it's giving you you see that the

00:11:03.575 --> 00:11:05.895
<v Speaker 1>the DNS while yeah. It's using it's doing

00:11:05.895 --> 00:11:06.855
<v Speaker 1>a wildcard

00:11:06.855 --> 00:11:07.975
<v Speaker 1>certs there.

00:11:09.575 --> 00:11:10.535
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

00:11:10.535 --> 00:11:13.255
<v Speaker 0>Now I barely just grab cert bot.

00:11:19.779 --> 00:11:20.580
<v Speaker 0>Software

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:21.540
<v Speaker 0>on.

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:24.500
<v Speaker 1>I think

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.180
<v Speaker 0>Oh, there we go.

00:11:30.185 --> 00:11:32.025
<v Speaker 0>Do I need to pick something here?

00:11:34.745 --> 00:11:36.985
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Command lane. That's what I want. Okay.

00:11:40.425 --> 00:11:43.305
<v Speaker 0>It's telling me what command lane means. Oh,

00:11:43.305 --> 00:11:43.865
<v Speaker 0>there we go.

00:11:47.879 --> 00:11:48.600
<v Speaker 0>Snap.

00:11:48.839 --> 00:11:50.600
<v Speaker 0>Do I really need to snap it?

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.160
<v Speaker 0>Let's just see. App to update.

00:12:01.915 --> 00:12:03.035
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

00:12:04.795 --> 00:12:05.515
<v Speaker 0>Maybe.

00:12:07.835 --> 00:12:09.035
<v Speaker 0>Yes. There we go.

00:12:11.355 --> 00:12:13.675
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we just want to generate some

00:12:13.675 --> 00:12:14.635
<v Speaker 0>certificates

00:12:14.635 --> 00:12:15.515
<v Speaker 0>and

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:21.459
<v Speaker 0>use the correct DNS names. So Yep.

00:12:22.899 --> 00:12:24.339
<v Speaker 0>We're just gonna use

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:25.620
<v Speaker 0>the NetBIOS

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.899
<v Speaker 0>service. So I just need the IP address

00:12:28.899 --> 00:12:30.420
<v Speaker 0>of this machine again

00:12:31.025 --> 00:12:33.345
<v Speaker 0>and format it with

00:12:34.865 --> 00:12:36.305
<v Speaker 0>oh, it doesn't matter if it's dashes or

00:12:36.305 --> 00:12:38.225
<v Speaker 0>dots. Perfect. Okay. We'll do dashes so that

00:12:38.225 --> 00:12:38.945
<v Speaker 0>we can

00:12:40.465 --> 00:12:41.185
<v Speaker 0>do this.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:48.630
<v Speaker 0>And then we'll do the star version.

00:12:57.665 --> 00:12:59.345
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if cert bot will complain

00:12:59.345 --> 00:13:02.305
<v Speaker 0>at me if I don't update this too.

00:13:08.385 --> 00:13:09.265
<v Speaker 0>Did I break it?

00:13:11.529 --> 00:13:13.130
<v Speaker 1>I haven't gone from rendered again.

00:13:15.209 --> 00:13:16.889
<v Speaker 0>It's took off the

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:21.050
<v Speaker 0>I I knew that I should have just

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.050
<v Speaker 0>put that into a file and modified it.

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:24.569
<v Speaker 1>I I sometimes do that. Yeah.

00:13:26.295 --> 00:13:29.015
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's do that again. So

00:13:29.575 --> 00:13:31.255
<v Speaker 0>I need my IP address.

00:13:35.415 --> 00:13:37.015
<v Speaker 0>So where are you joining me from today,

00:13:37.015 --> 00:13:39.255
<v Speaker 0>Steven? I live outside of Annapolis, Maryland.

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:41.740
<v Speaker 0>And what's the weather like for you?

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.460
<v Speaker 1>We're we're getting into winter, so we're we're

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.060
<v Speaker 1>seeing the forties and fifties. I think today

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.180
<v Speaker 1>it's a little warmer.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.620
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. We are just below freezing today and

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.620
<v Speaker 0>this office is not is not good at

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.180
<v Speaker 0>containing heat anyway. I'm sitting here literally

00:13:55.485 --> 00:13:57.325
<v Speaker 0>shipping in and shaking, but

00:13:58.445 --> 00:13:59.325
<v Speaker 0>unrecognized

00:13:59.325 --> 00:14:00.285
<v Speaker 0>arguments.

00:14:02.285 --> 00:14:04.445
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna put this into a fail.

00:14:06.925 --> 00:14:08.445
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that slash

00:14:08.524 --> 00:14:08.925
<v Speaker 1>there.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.640
<v Speaker 0>Yep. You're correct,

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.440
<v Speaker 0>I think.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.080
<v Speaker 0>Getting tripped up by Sherpa. Okay. Command.

00:14:27.884 --> 00:14:30.365
<v Speaker 0>So that looks okay. Let's go along, make

00:14:30.365 --> 00:14:32.045
<v Speaker 0>sure there's no weird new lanes.

00:14:32.285 --> 00:14:33.404
<v Speaker 0>Change this.

00:14:35.245 --> 00:14:37.644
<v Speaker 0>Oh, there's commands here twice. Emails. I don't

00:14:37.644 --> 00:14:39.084
<v Speaker 1>know if that makes a difference, but oh,

00:14:39.084 --> 00:14:40.285
<v Speaker 1>I see. Oh, it oh, got in there

00:14:40.285 --> 00:14:40.925
<v Speaker 1>twice. How weird.

00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:44.470
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.589
<v Speaker 0>Right. Okay. So

00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:51.029
<v Speaker 0>well, that is really weird. Right.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.470
<v Speaker 0>So cert bot let me just make sure

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:55.350
<v Speaker 0>I got this right.

00:14:55.875 --> 00:14:58.355
<v Speaker 0>Cert only before the manual. Right. We're good

00:14:58.355 --> 00:15:01.555
<v Speaker 0>now. Yeah. I'm seeing this with confidence.

00:15:07.075 --> 00:15:08.035
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.790
<v Speaker 1>Okay. We don't we actually,

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:23.709
<v Speaker 1>we can do it without it and then

00:15:23.709 --> 00:15:25.665
<v Speaker 1>I can because it it's we can go

00:15:25.665 --> 00:15:26.545
<v Speaker 1>insecure.

00:15:29.265 --> 00:15:31.105
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Yeah. Alright.

00:15:31.585 --> 00:15:33.905
<v Speaker 0>That's annoying. That would've been good. So

00:15:35.185 --> 00:15:37.025
<v Speaker 0>so what what does that mean then for

00:15:37.025 --> 00:15:39.345
<v Speaker 0>Teleport? Is it it's just gonna be serving

00:15:39.345 --> 00:15:40.625
<v Speaker 0>over regular HTTP?

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.160
<v Speaker 1>It it'll automatically generate

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:44.760
<v Speaker 1>a

00:15:45.639 --> 00:15:46.760
<v Speaker 1>self signed

00:15:46.839 --> 00:15:48.279
<v Speaker 1>key TLS,

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.279
<v Speaker 1>and then and then you can you can

00:15:50.279 --> 00:15:51.639
<v Speaker 1>still connect to it from the command line

00:15:51.639 --> 00:15:53.800
<v Speaker 1>or the web. You'll simply have to confirm

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:53.959
<v Speaker 1>it.

00:15:54.635 --> 00:15:56.555
<v Speaker 1>In this case, you know, I I don't

00:15:56.555 --> 00:15:59.355
<v Speaker 1>believe you can use the the application part,

00:15:59.675 --> 00:16:01.435
<v Speaker 1>but I can demo that myself and just

00:16:01.435 --> 00:16:03.355
<v Speaker 1>show you some examples. Oh, yeah. That would

00:16:03.355 --> 00:16:04.795
<v Speaker 0>be cool. Okay. Let's do that.

00:16:05.275 --> 00:16:06.955
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So that's one rep that's a one

00:16:06.955 --> 00:16:09.250
<v Speaker 1>place you do need the TLSI link. But,

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:10.930
<v Speaker 1>otherwise, it's we we try to make it

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:12.209
<v Speaker 1>so you can still use it. We we,

00:16:12.209 --> 00:16:13.889
<v Speaker 1>of course, wouldn't recommend that in production. But

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:16.690
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:20.290
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So I need the IP address again.

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:21.170
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:16:27.965 --> 00:16:28.845
<v Speaker 0>Nip.

00:16:30.365 --> 00:16:32.445
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I've been bitten by that less encrypt

00:16:32.445 --> 00:16:33.085
<v Speaker 1>limit before.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:37.410
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I I've never actually tried to do

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:39.570
<v Speaker 0>it before for an IP address. Just thought

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:40.850
<v Speaker 0>it would be okay. Do you wanna go

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:43.170
<v Speaker 1>in and remove those those key pairs?

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:45.410
<v Speaker 1>Because it'll it'll generate it for us.

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:47.090
<v Speaker 0>Gotcha.

00:16:50.615 --> 00:16:52.375
<v Speaker 0>So if those are missing, it does a

00:16:52.375 --> 00:16:53.655
<v Speaker 0>self signed certificate.

00:16:53.735 --> 00:16:55.735
<v Speaker 1>Yes. And I think we wanna line up

00:16:56.295 --> 00:16:57.975
<v Speaker 1>it may not matter, but may wanna

00:16:58.775 --> 00:17:00.695
<v Speaker 1>yeah. Just move yeah. It's fine.

00:17:02.135 --> 00:17:04.135
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's see. So we don't have a

00:17:04.135 --> 00:17:06.200
<v Speaker 0>system to service, do we? We just installed

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.119
<v Speaker 0>a That's where I wanted to go. If

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:10.839
<v Speaker 1>you go into the examples part of the

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.240
<v Speaker 1>when you extracted the tar,

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.320
<v Speaker 1>there'll be an example of a Teleport service.

00:17:21.234 --> 00:17:22.755
<v Speaker 1>Example system d.

00:17:25.635 --> 00:17:28.835
<v Speaker 0>K. So we just copy this teleport.service

00:17:30.515 --> 00:17:31.475
<v Speaker 0>here.

00:17:32.675 --> 00:17:33.875
<v Speaker 0>Daemon reload

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:37.190
<v Speaker 0>and restart Teleport.

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:44.390
<v Speaker 0>Okay to go? Yeah. It should should be

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:45.029
<v Speaker 1>running.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.750
<v Speaker 1>You can and then we could let yeah.

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:49.555
<v Speaker 1>Let's check the status. Or or you already

00:17:49.555 --> 00:17:50.755
<v Speaker 1>did? You already did?

00:17:51.235 --> 00:17:52.915
<v Speaker 1>Or you We we can check the status

00:17:52.915 --> 00:17:55.075
<v Speaker 0>explicitly, but it seems to be it seems

00:17:55.075 --> 00:17:56.355
<v Speaker 0>to be running. Yeah. There we go. Active

00:17:56.355 --> 00:17:58.035
<v Speaker 0>and running. So So why why don't we

00:17:58.035 --> 00:17:58.915
<v Speaker 1>see if

00:17:59.315 --> 00:18:00.915
<v Speaker 1>from from the web, let's see if we

00:18:00.915 --> 00:18:02.675
<v Speaker 1>can access that site, and then we can

00:18:02.675 --> 00:18:04.035
<v Speaker 1>create it then we'll create a user.

00:18:06.909 --> 00:18:07.710
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:11.869
<v Speaker 0>So Teleport runs a web interface?

00:18:12.029 --> 00:18:14.029
<v Speaker 1>Yes. On port thirty eighty.

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:15.870
<v Speaker 0>On port thirty eighty.

00:18:19.245 --> 00:18:20.525
<v Speaker 1>And it's secure.

00:18:27.005 --> 00:18:27.725
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

00:18:30.779 --> 00:18:32.620
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Chrome gets a bit funny with those.

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. We may may may may need we

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:35.659
<v Speaker 1>use Safari.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.700
<v Speaker 0>I don't think I've ever opened Safari before.

00:18:43.595 --> 00:18:44.395
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:18:44.875 --> 00:18:46.395
<v Speaker 0>View this

00:18:46.555 --> 00:18:47.195
<v Speaker 0>set.

00:18:48.875 --> 00:18:50.315
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure you're sure?

00:18:52.155 --> 00:18:52.635
<v Speaker 0>Wow.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.200
<v Speaker 1>There we go.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.120
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We made it. Okay.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.520
<v Speaker 1>We don't we don't have a user yet,

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.440
<v Speaker 1>and let's go back to the command line,

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.240
<v Speaker 1>and we can and I can show you

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.800
<v Speaker 1>how to create one. Okay. So run

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.320
<v Speaker 1>t CTL

00:19:10.585 --> 00:19:12.425
<v Speaker 1>or t what we call t cuddle.

00:19:15.065 --> 00:19:15.865
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:19:16.025 --> 00:19:18.985
<v Speaker 1>So t cuddle is essentially your, you know

00:19:19.705 --> 00:19:23.545
<v Speaker 1>that that's your command line tool to interface

00:19:23.545 --> 00:19:25.785
<v Speaker 1>with the actual settings within Teleport.

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:27.650
<v Speaker 1>And you can do things like step like

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:29.010
<v Speaker 1>t cuddle status.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:33.970
<v Speaker 1>So in there, you'll see the CA pin.

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:35.409
<v Speaker 1>So as part of that installation,

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:38.610
<v Speaker 1>it went ahead and generated a certificate.

00:19:39.125 --> 00:19:41.045
<v Speaker 1>And there you can see the CA pin.

00:19:41.525 --> 00:19:43.765
<v Speaker 1>So when you do things like install to

00:19:43.765 --> 00:19:44.645
<v Speaker 1>a node,

00:19:44.885 --> 00:19:47.605
<v Speaker 1>two things are done there. One is if

00:19:47.605 --> 00:19:50.485
<v Speaker 1>you if you saw on the Teleport YAML,

00:19:50.645 --> 00:19:52.245
<v Speaker 1>there was a token

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:54.850
<v Speaker 1>that was part that was listed.

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:02.050
<v Speaker 1>And so that token is gonna be used

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:04.530
<v Speaker 1>by the nodes or other services to register

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:05.330
<v Speaker 1>themselves

00:20:05.635 --> 00:20:07.394
<v Speaker 1>with the auth service.

00:20:07.635 --> 00:20:09.234
<v Speaker 1>Now as you can imagine,

00:20:09.554 --> 00:20:11.475
<v Speaker 1>that's just like regular SSH.

00:20:11.554 --> 00:20:14.035
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Well, if I SSH in to a

00:20:14.035 --> 00:20:15.554
<v Speaker 1>machine and give a password,

00:20:15.794 --> 00:20:17.955
<v Speaker 1>well, I then I'm then I in a

00:20:17.955 --> 00:20:19.794
<v Speaker 1>lot of cases, you then trust that machine.

00:20:19.794 --> 00:20:20.035
<v Speaker 1>Right?

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:22.899
<v Speaker 1>If you use the CA pin as well,

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.539
<v Speaker 1>if you do a Teleport configure I'll I'll

00:20:25.539 --> 00:20:26.739
<v Speaker 1>show you where it's set.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.099
<v Speaker 1>So if you scroll up a bit,

00:20:34.179 --> 00:20:35.460
<v Speaker 1>see that CA pin?

00:20:36.575 --> 00:20:39.135
<v Speaker 0>Yep. Here. Yep. So you would take that

00:20:39.135 --> 00:20:41.215
<v Speaker 1>same CA pin, and you would put you

00:20:41.215 --> 00:20:42.815
<v Speaker 1>can see the auth token is there.

00:20:43.215 --> 00:20:45.135
<v Speaker 1>I'm pointing at a different location.

00:20:45.535 --> 00:20:46.975
<v Speaker 1>You can see it has the auth token,

00:20:46.975 --> 00:20:47.775
<v Speaker 1>the auth server,

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.600
<v Speaker 1>and then the CA pin. So that's that's

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:51.720
<v Speaker 1>a secure way

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.480
<v Speaker 1>of connecting in.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.759
<v Speaker 1>And tokens can either be dynamic or static.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.639
<v Speaker 1>For production, we'd recommend using that dynamic

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.200
<v Speaker 1>and periodically pulling down the latest token.

00:21:02.794 --> 00:21:04.554
<v Speaker 1>You can always use static as well.

00:21:04.875 --> 00:21:07.355
<v Speaker 1>If you in this case, it's the thirty

00:21:07.355 --> 00:21:10.554
<v Speaker 1>twenty five is the default off service port.

00:21:11.115 --> 00:21:13.995
<v Speaker 1>You can also point at the thirty eighty,

00:21:13.995 --> 00:21:15.995
<v Speaker 1>the same as the web uses, and that

00:21:15.995 --> 00:21:18.010
<v Speaker 1>will use a reverse tunnel. So then you

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:20.170
<v Speaker 1>don't need to expose a port on the

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:21.370
<v Speaker 1>SSH node.

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:25.610
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So just so I understand what's happened

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:28.330
<v Speaker 0>here. When we downloaded the Teleport binary, created

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:30.090
<v Speaker 0>the system d service and started it.

00:21:31.125 --> 00:21:33.525
<v Speaker 0>Teleport is running a web interface, which I'm

00:21:33.525 --> 00:21:35.765
<v Speaker 0>assuming has some admin functions. It runs on

00:21:35.765 --> 00:21:36.885
<v Speaker 0>off service,

00:21:36.965 --> 00:21:39.205
<v Speaker 0>and it runs on SSH server. Is that

00:21:39.445 --> 00:21:40.164
<v Speaker 0>right?

00:21:40.325 --> 00:21:42.965
<v Speaker 1>An SSH service. Yes. And that sits by

00:21:42.965 --> 00:21:44.965
<v Speaker 1>d it doesn't have it here, but that

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:47.929
<v Speaker 1>sits by default on port thirty twenty two

00:21:48.169 --> 00:21:50.970
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm. Or uses the reverse tunnel approach and

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:53.210
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have to expose a port. And we

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:55.929
<v Speaker 1>use thirty twenty two because SSH is 22.

00:21:56.649 --> 00:21:59.065
<v Speaker 0>So is it common practice for Teleport customers,

00:21:59.065 --> 00:22:01.065
<v Speaker 0>once they have Teleport running on their infrastructure

00:22:01.065 --> 00:22:03.785
<v Speaker 0>to just uninstall open SSH and just remove

00:22:03.785 --> 00:22:07.065
<v Speaker 0>that from existence? So some completely uninstall it.

00:22:07.065 --> 00:22:08.264
<v Speaker 1>We do have

00:22:08.505 --> 00:22:10.184
<v Speaker 1>clients who will

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:13.350
<v Speaker 1>they'll have it start up briefly

00:22:13.429 --> 00:22:15.990
<v Speaker 1>on the machine and then shut down just

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:17.830
<v Speaker 1>just in case they want to keep that.

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:20.629
<v Speaker 1>So everyone has a a different preference there.

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:23.830
<v Speaker 1>I think, you know, most most would make

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Teleport their primary

00:22:25.905 --> 00:22:26.945
<v Speaker 1>interaction.

00:22:27.265 --> 00:22:29.825
<v Speaker 1>Now the what you've done when you've installed

00:22:29.825 --> 00:22:30.785
<v Speaker 1>it this way,

00:22:31.185 --> 00:22:33.585
<v Speaker 1>it's it's storing its configuration.

00:22:33.585 --> 00:22:35.825
<v Speaker 1>And if you go into the Varlib Teleport

00:22:35.825 --> 00:22:36.705
<v Speaker 1>directory

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.639
<v Speaker 1>So this

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:45.000
<v Speaker 1>this is using a local directory storage. So

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.080
<v Speaker 1>we have things like a back end directory,

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.039
<v Speaker 1>a cache,

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.840
<v Speaker 1>and that's and then those those TLS

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.760
<v Speaker 1>self signed TLS, as I mentioned, those are

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.065
<v Speaker 1>generated here. So this is an example of

00:22:55.065 --> 00:22:56.904
<v Speaker 1>a local directory storage.

00:22:57.145 --> 00:22:58.425
<v Speaker 1>If we used,

00:22:58.745 --> 00:23:00.105
<v Speaker 1>either etcd

00:23:00.185 --> 00:23:01.065
<v Speaker 1>or,

00:23:01.465 --> 00:23:02.585
<v Speaker 1>DynamoDB

00:23:02.585 --> 00:23:04.985
<v Speaker 1>or the Google Firestore, you would not see

00:23:04.985 --> 00:23:06.825
<v Speaker 1>the back end, for example. So those would

00:23:06.825 --> 00:23:09.240
<v Speaker 1>be stored off. And in this case, you

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.800
<v Speaker 1>have a proxy off and SSH on one

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:12.440
<v Speaker 1>machine.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.080
<v Speaker 1>As you in the diagram I showed,

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.360
<v Speaker 1>you saw that it would separate out, and

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.920
<v Speaker 1>you would typically have a different node running

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:21.880
<v Speaker 1>each of those services.

00:23:22.675 --> 00:23:24.115
<v Speaker 1>And we have, you know, we have that

00:23:24.115 --> 00:23:26.115
<v Speaker 1>full details on our documentation,

00:23:26.355 --> 00:23:28.115
<v Speaker 1>you know, in terms of a high availability

00:23:28.115 --> 00:23:29.475
<v Speaker 1>kind of configuration.

00:23:29.555 --> 00:23:30.515
<v Speaker 1>But the good thing is you can get

00:23:30.515 --> 00:23:31.715
<v Speaker 1>this up and going quickly.

00:23:32.595 --> 00:23:34.035
<v Speaker 1>And then from here, we can we can

00:23:34.035 --> 00:23:35.475
<v Speaker 1>go ahead and create a user to get

00:23:35.475 --> 00:23:35.795
<v Speaker 1>you in.

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:39.850
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:41.930
<v Speaker 1>users

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:43.210
<v Speaker 1>We go back to the

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:45.210
<v Speaker 1>the instructions you're in. I think I had

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:46.730
<v Speaker 1>a little bit more info on that.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.690
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. The docs. Our friendly

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:52.330
<v Speaker 0>I'm busy going off script there. Yeah. Yeah.

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:53.424
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So

00:23:53.585 --> 00:23:54.945
<v Speaker 0>okay. Let's do this.

00:23:55.505 --> 00:23:57.505
<v Speaker 1>So he yeah. Here'd be good to know

00:23:57.505 --> 00:23:58.625
<v Speaker 1>on your other

00:23:59.105 --> 00:24:01.105
<v Speaker 1>machines what users you'd wanna go in, whether

00:24:01.105 --> 00:24:01.985
<v Speaker 1>you wanna I don't know if you have

00:24:01.985 --> 00:24:04.145
<v Speaker 1>a David user or, you know, what what's

00:24:04.145 --> 00:24:06.305
<v Speaker 1>your typical usernames you use on those other

00:24:06.305 --> 00:24:06.625
<v Speaker 1>machines?

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:11.830
<v Speaker 0>So all the machines are only have a

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:13.509
<v Speaker 0>a root user at the moment.

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:14.470
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:16.549
<v Speaker 0>So I should just be doing

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:17.590
<v Speaker 0>root?

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:20.309
<v Speaker 1>You can do root you can add other

00:24:20.309 --> 00:24:20.630
<v Speaker 1>users,

00:24:21.175 --> 00:24:22.615
<v Speaker 1>and I can show you how it can

00:24:22.615 --> 00:24:23.414
<v Speaker 1>automatically

00:24:23.415 --> 00:24:24.455
<v Speaker 1>add users.

00:24:25.415 --> 00:24:27.575
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So this first parameter here to users

00:24:27.575 --> 00:24:29.815
<v Speaker 0>add is my Teleport username for logging in

00:24:29.815 --> 00:24:31.335
<v Speaker 0>to the admin interface, and then this is

00:24:31.335 --> 00:24:34.390
<v Speaker 0>the users on the other on the servers

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:35.750
<v Speaker 0>that I want to support?

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:38.550
<v Speaker 1>Yes. Exactly. So that user would have access

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:39.190
<v Speaker 1>to that.

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:41.750
<v Speaker 1>We'll also come back. Let's go ahead and

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.350
<v Speaker 1>create this, and I'll show you in a

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.909
<v Speaker 1>bit

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:47.190
<v Speaker 1>how we will update it for your Kubernetes

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.910
<v Speaker 1>setting as well.

00:24:51.325 --> 00:24:53.245
<v Speaker 0>Opened in the wrong browser.

00:24:53.565 --> 00:24:55.245
<v Speaker 0>Let's get Safari back.

00:24:57.885 --> 00:24:58.445
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:25:05.039 --> 00:25:06.960
<v Speaker 0>My two factor talk? Oh, I have to

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.159
<v Speaker 0>scan the thing. Yeah.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.320
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.679
<v Speaker 0>I just have one password to it then.

00:25:22.405 --> 00:25:23.284
<v Speaker 0>Sure.

00:25:24.325 --> 00:25:25.284
<v Speaker 0>Save it.

00:25:26.085 --> 00:25:30.725
<v Speaker 0>Teleport.

00:25:31.924 --> 00:25:36.245
<v Speaker 0>And that should allow me to

00:25:34.679 --> 00:25:37.239
<v Speaker 0>choose a button here, right, for scanning a

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.799
<v Speaker 0>thing. Oh, yes.

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:45.639
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:25:47.895 --> 00:25:50.135
<v Speaker 1>I I I tend to use my phone,

00:25:50.135 --> 00:25:51.255
<v Speaker 1>but I, yeah, I thought there was a

00:25:51.255 --> 00:25:53.015
<v Speaker 1>way to do that. Yeah. There I'll just

00:25:53.015 --> 00:25:54.375
<v Speaker 0>do I'll use my phone.

00:25:57.415 --> 00:25:59.415
<v Speaker 0>The Teleport is pretty secure by default then

00:25:59.415 --> 00:26:00.055
<v Speaker 0>if it's

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:03.190
<v Speaker 1>That you can disable that, but it's on

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:04.149
<v Speaker 1>by default.

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:07.909
<v Speaker 1>And there's other options like, you know, UTF,

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:09.429
<v Speaker 1>the UV key thing.

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:12.870
<v Speaker 1>We've also if we have time, I'll show

00:26:13.085 --> 00:26:15.485
<v Speaker 1>know, there's an option for using, like, Duo

00:26:15.485 --> 00:26:17.085
<v Speaker 1>when you go into a node,

00:26:17.565 --> 00:26:19.885
<v Speaker 1>in addition to this initial, you know, user

00:26:19.885 --> 00:26:20.845
<v Speaker 1>authentication.

00:26:24.605 --> 00:26:25.805
<v Speaker 0>I'm in. There we go.

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So what you're seeing now is

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:32.049
<v Speaker 1>that SSH

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:35.169
<v Speaker 1>note the SSH service for your that is

00:26:35.169 --> 00:26:36.690
<v Speaker 1>part of that one installation.

00:26:37.809 --> 00:26:40.770
<v Speaker 1>Typically, when you have your full

00:26:41.275 --> 00:26:43.515
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't expose the SSH on that. But

00:26:43.515 --> 00:26:45.914
<v Speaker 1>for initial startup, that's that's very typical.

00:26:46.715 --> 00:26:48.715
<v Speaker 1>And then if you connect,

00:26:48.795 --> 00:26:50.875
<v Speaker 1>you can open up a a session there.

00:26:52.715 --> 00:26:54.154
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.480
<v Speaker 0>I've got my choice of user. So let's

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.360
<v Speaker 0>just do it.

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:04.720
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:27:08.075 --> 00:27:09.995
<v Speaker 0>What happens if I try Rawkode? Will it

00:27:09.995 --> 00:27:10.635
<v Speaker 0>fail?

00:27:10.955 --> 00:27:13.595
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Okay. And on user and then and

00:27:13.595 --> 00:27:15.755
<v Speaker 1>then well, let's go look at the activity

00:27:15.755 --> 00:27:17.514
<v Speaker 1>so we can see what's been happening.

00:27:18.075 --> 00:27:20.155
<v Speaker 1>And we can see the session we can

00:27:20.155 --> 00:27:21.995
<v Speaker 1>see the session then session recordings

00:27:22.075 --> 00:27:23.340
<v Speaker 1>so you can replay.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:24.700
<v Speaker 0>Ah,

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:26.620
<v Speaker 0>k.

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:30.860
<v Speaker 1>And you can move that back and forth.

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:32.220
<v Speaker 1>You should be able to copy and you

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.620
<v Speaker 1>should be able to select the text. Woah.

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:36.380
<v Speaker 1>Hey. Is that great?

00:27:37.195 --> 00:27:38.715
<v Speaker 0>That's not a video.

00:27:39.195 --> 00:27:41.115
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. No. It it plays like that.

00:27:41.115 --> 00:27:42.715
<v Speaker 1>And it will if you have, like, a

00:27:42.715 --> 00:27:46.075
<v Speaker 1>twenty minute hour long session and it's idle,

00:27:46.075 --> 00:27:48.315
<v Speaker 1>it will skip ahead in a replay, but

00:27:48.315 --> 00:27:49.035
<v Speaker 1>it's still recording.

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That's a that's a big feature people

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:54.630
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna I'm gonna need a minute to

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:56.630
<v Speaker 0>process this. That's

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:57.350
<v Speaker 0>wild.

00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. If you go if you if you

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:01.430
<v Speaker 1>go back in and, like, do a top

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:03.910
<v Speaker 1>and, you know, or h top, whatever colors,

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:06.275
<v Speaker 1>it'll it'll show. Looks just like whatever you

00:28:06.275 --> 00:28:06.835
<v Speaker 1>see.

00:28:08.115 --> 00:28:08.915
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:28:08.915 --> 00:28:10.275
<v Speaker 0>Let's do that again. Yeah. Let's do

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.380
<v Speaker 0>In fact, I'm curious now. So hold on.

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:24.100
<v Speaker 0>Let's do two. So if I do read

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:24.500
<v Speaker 0>the

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.780
<v Speaker 0>what's is there not a password flag on

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:30.020
<v Speaker 0>read?

00:28:31.795 --> 00:28:33.555
<v Speaker 0>I was wondering if if if I have

00:28:33.555 --> 00:28:35.875
<v Speaker 0>to take the input of Teleport which I

00:28:35.875 --> 00:28:37.475
<v Speaker 0>know about it and I thought it was

00:28:37.555 --> 00:28:38.674
<v Speaker 0>dash p.

00:28:40.275 --> 00:28:41.635
<v Speaker 0>It's not important.

00:28:41.955 --> 00:28:43.875
<v Speaker 0>A prompt. Let's

00:28:43.875 --> 00:28:44.115
<v Speaker 0>see.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.400
<v Speaker 0>No. Alright. Never mind. Okay. So let's try

00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:00.799
<v Speaker 0>the htop recorded session. So how is that

00:29:00.325 --> 00:29:03.045
<v Speaker 0>working? Oh, that's the red one. I mean,

00:29:03.205 --> 00:29:05.125
<v Speaker 0>I seen on the documentation when I was

00:29:05.125 --> 00:29:06.325
<v Speaker 0>having a look earlier.

00:29:06.485 --> 00:29:08.485
<v Speaker 0>I mentioned e b p f. Is that

00:29:08.485 --> 00:29:10.405
<v Speaker 0>what's powering this or is it That because

00:29:10.405 --> 00:29:12.679
<v Speaker 0>I'm going through the the terminal session. If

00:29:12.679 --> 00:29:14.440
<v Speaker 0>I ask the session normally, does that still

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:16.119
<v Speaker 0>get recorded as a session?

00:29:16.679 --> 00:29:18.760
<v Speaker 1>You the the so there are various options

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:19.480
<v Speaker 1>for that.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:20.759
<v Speaker 1>If

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:21.639
<v Speaker 1>you're

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:25.240
<v Speaker 1>the what by default, it's gonna record

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.845
<v Speaker 1>the session text you do, whether colors and

00:29:28.845 --> 00:29:30.765
<v Speaker 1>everything, just put all the characters.

00:29:31.245 --> 00:29:33.565
<v Speaker 1>There is the option to use EPF,

00:29:33.565 --> 00:29:34.685
<v Speaker 1>and maybe we wanna go back to the

00:29:34.845 --> 00:29:36.605
<v Speaker 1>we can go back to the documentation.

00:29:37.325 --> 00:29:38.765
<v Speaker 1>We can highlight a couple things there.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:42.100
<v Speaker 0>Okay. And and I don't know if you

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.500
<v Speaker 0>answered that there, I I was still confused

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.020
<v Speaker 0>and shocked at how awesome that was. If

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:48.980
<v Speaker 0>I SSHN normally, does that get recorded as

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:50.260
<v Speaker 0>a session, or is it only going through

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.180
<v Speaker 0>the SSH service? Oh, it it would be

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:52.900
<v Speaker 1>recorded.

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:55.475
<v Speaker 1>The difference is when you set up an

00:29:55.475 --> 00:29:56.675
<v Speaker 1>open SSH

00:29:56.675 --> 00:29:57.475
<v Speaker 1>server,

00:29:57.955 --> 00:30:00.115
<v Speaker 1>which can still be recorded, there's just a

00:30:00.115 --> 00:30:01.715
<v Speaker 1>little bit of a different setting.

00:30:02.115 --> 00:30:03.475
<v Speaker 1>For SSH,

00:30:03.555 --> 00:30:05.795
<v Speaker 1>we would have to set up if you

00:30:05.795 --> 00:30:07.715
<v Speaker 1>go there is on our documentation, there is

00:30:07.715 --> 00:30:10.970
<v Speaker 1>a method on how you do SSH. Alright.

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:12.730
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So that's something I would enable afterwards

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:14.170
<v Speaker 0>then. Oh, you I mean, you could do

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:16.090
<v Speaker 1>it quickly, but it it it the difference

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:17.929
<v Speaker 1>is you have to send in

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:23.674
<v Speaker 1>you're using the certificate that's been issued locally,

00:30:24.235 --> 00:30:25.355
<v Speaker 1>and and, yeah, yeah, this is a good

00:30:25.355 --> 00:30:26.875
<v Speaker 1>point to use your command line,

00:30:27.995 --> 00:30:30.475
<v Speaker 1>but you're using a local issue

00:30:30.795 --> 00:30:34.075
<v Speaker 1>certificate to authenticate yourself. So the SSH has

00:30:34.075 --> 00:30:36.315
<v Speaker 1>to has to also present that, which our

00:30:36.315 --> 00:30:37.595
<v Speaker 1>TSH does automatically.

00:30:38.929 --> 00:30:40.369
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Nice.

00:30:40.929 --> 00:30:42.610
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, the audit log is gonna I

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:43.809
<v Speaker 1>mean, it's gonna have the session, but it's

00:30:43.809 --> 00:30:45.250
<v Speaker 1>also gonna have all of the you know,

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:47.249
<v Speaker 1>when do you start, when did you disconnect.

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:49.249
<v Speaker 1>If you enabled,

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:50.370
<v Speaker 1>the

00:30:50.705 --> 00:30:51.585
<v Speaker 1>eBPF,

00:30:51.585 --> 00:30:53.105
<v Speaker 1>then you would see every command here as

00:30:53.105 --> 00:30:54.544
<v Speaker 1>well that people are running.

00:30:55.105 --> 00:30:56.705
<v Speaker 0>Wow. That's pretty cool.

00:30:58.385 --> 00:31:00.785
<v Speaker 0>I'm always impressed by stuff to integrate eBPF

00:31:00.785 --> 00:31:02.625
<v Speaker 0>into the technologies because it just seems so

00:31:02.625 --> 00:31:04.225
<v Speaker 0>cutting. Well, I mean, it is cutting edge.

00:31:04.225 --> 00:31:05.980
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. And and people can you know, if

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:07.659
<v Speaker 1>you obfuscate, if you

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:09.900
<v Speaker 1>doing net if you're doing weird network stuff,

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:11.580
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna catch that. So it it is

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:13.660
<v Speaker 1>very helpful for those kind of environments.

00:31:17.425 --> 00:31:18.225
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:31:18.305 --> 00:31:20.545
<v Speaker 0>Should we go back to our our guide

00:31:20.545 --> 00:31:22.625
<v Speaker 0>then? I mean, we're we've only executed, like,

00:31:22.625 --> 00:31:24.865
<v Speaker 0>half of this getting started thing, haven't we?

00:31:24.865 --> 00:31:27.025
<v Speaker 0>And I'm already just like, wow. So let's

00:31:27.025 --> 00:31:28.544
<v Speaker 0>see what else comes. Yeah.

00:31:28.865 --> 00:31:30.145
<v Speaker 0>So we did the user.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.880
<v Speaker 0>We looked at the note. Okay. So this

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.400
<v Speaker 0>is just walking through some of the stuff.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. This is this would be a good

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.519
<v Speaker 1>point to get a a local client,

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.359
<v Speaker 1>the TSH.

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.600
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Do I have this command? Is that

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.465
<v Speaker 0>something I have to If it's on your

00:31:45.465 --> 00:31:47.145
<v Speaker 1>Mac, you'd want to get yeah. You'd wanna

00:31:47.145 --> 00:31:49.065
<v Speaker 1>get the the actual TSH client.

00:31:54.665 --> 00:31:56.105
<v Speaker 0>MacOS.

00:32:00.049 --> 00:32:02.130
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure what the difference between these

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:03.330
<v Speaker 0>is. So I just click.

00:32:10.865 --> 00:32:12.865
<v Speaker 0>So this is just a Teleport SSH client

00:32:12.865 --> 00:32:14.945
<v Speaker 0>for Yeah. My command line access. Alright. Got

00:32:14.945 --> 00:32:15.424
<v Speaker 0>it.

00:32:17.745 --> 00:32:20.304
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I think that's installed.

00:32:22.865 --> 00:32:23.424
<v Speaker 0>Let's go.

00:32:24.139 --> 00:32:25.659
<v Speaker 0>Oh, where's the docs?

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:32.139
<v Speaker 0>Copy this.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:36.779
<v Speaker 1>And then you'd wanna do that in your

00:32:36.779 --> 00:32:39.365
<v Speaker 1>own Yeah. Yeah. Oh, is that your local

00:32:39.365 --> 00:32:40.004
<v Speaker 1>environment?

00:32:40.404 --> 00:32:42.484
<v Speaker 0>This bottom one is now.

00:32:42.884 --> 00:32:45.524
<v Speaker 0>Although I lost my paste buffer. There we

00:32:45.524 --> 00:32:46.084
<v Speaker 0>go.

00:32:48.884 --> 00:32:49.764
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:32:49.764 --> 00:32:51.684
<v Speaker 0>So we need

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:57.309
<v Speaker 0>147Dash7532.

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:00.590
<v Speaker 0>I wish I had prepared a nice DNS

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:02.109
<v Speaker 0>name in advance now.

00:33:04.029 --> 00:33:06.190
<v Speaker 0>And I called my username Rawkode.

00:33:08.345 --> 00:33:10.345
<v Speaker 1>And we do we do because it's running

00:33:10.345 --> 00:33:12.505
<v Speaker 1>insecure, we need to pass in the command

00:33:12.505 --> 00:33:14.105
<v Speaker 1>dash dash insecure.

00:33:14.665 --> 00:33:16.505
<v Speaker 0>Does dash k work with curl?

00:33:16.745 --> 00:33:17.305
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:33:19.065 --> 00:33:21.065
<v Speaker 0>There's a feature request. Oh, sure. Yeah. Oh,

00:33:21.065 --> 00:33:21.625
<v Speaker 1>that's kinda good.

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:24.340
<v Speaker 1>So the same password you put in wait.

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.179
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You copy maybe copy it from there.

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.820
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It was randomly generated.

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:30.900
<v Speaker 0>I flashed my password enough on the stream

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:31.460
<v Speaker 0>now. So

00:33:38.745 --> 00:33:40.585
<v Speaker 1>And now if you do, type t s

00:33:40.585 --> 00:33:41.225
<v Speaker 1>h.

00:33:43.545 --> 00:33:45.065
<v Speaker 1>Just, yeah, just t s h so we

00:33:45.065 --> 00:33:46.105
<v Speaker 1>can look at the options.

00:33:47.304 --> 00:33:48.505
<v Speaker 1>So

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.040
<v Speaker 1>this gives you and and we'll come back

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.799
<v Speaker 1>to this for the Kubernetes part.

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:54.919
<v Speaker 1>But you can see the

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.320
<v Speaker 1>the SSH,

00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:59.080
<v Speaker 1>so then we connect to a node.

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.640
<v Speaker 1>Typically, you use, like, LS to list the

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.520
<v Speaker 1>nodes that are available.

00:34:03.365 --> 00:34:05.685
<v Speaker 1>You can join an active session. That'll that'll

00:34:05.685 --> 00:34:07.605
<v Speaker 1>be something, I think, good

00:34:07.685 --> 00:34:08.965
<v Speaker 1>that we can show there,

00:34:09.685 --> 00:34:10.485
<v Speaker 1>SCP,

00:34:11.285 --> 00:34:12.565
<v Speaker 1>navigating clusters.

00:34:12.645 --> 00:34:13.685
<v Speaker 1>So a cluster

00:34:13.925 --> 00:34:15.925
<v Speaker 1>is in this case, you've installed one Teleport

00:34:15.925 --> 00:34:16.324
<v Speaker 1>instance.

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:19.349
<v Speaker 1>Mhmm. And then that has nodes, Kubernetes applications

00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:21.270
<v Speaker 1>that are available. In a lot of cases,

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:23.429
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason just to install

00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:26.389
<v Speaker 1>another Teleport instance that has its own set

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:28.310
<v Speaker 1>of SSH nodes,

00:34:28.469 --> 00:34:29.429
<v Speaker 1>apps, and Kubernetes,

00:34:29.685 --> 00:34:30.965
<v Speaker 1>but then you want to be able to

00:34:30.965 --> 00:34:31.845
<v Speaker 1>access that.

00:34:32.885 --> 00:34:35.285
<v Speaker 1>And and you that other instance can trust

00:34:35.285 --> 00:34:36.805
<v Speaker 1>back to your instance,

00:34:36.965 --> 00:34:39.285
<v Speaker 1>map its roles, and the user can then

00:34:39.285 --> 00:34:40.165
<v Speaker 1>go through

00:34:40.485 --> 00:34:43.125
<v Speaker 1>that Teleport that root Teleport instance to get

00:34:43.125 --> 00:34:44.245
<v Speaker 1>access to those resources.

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:47.100
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:48.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:50.060
<v Speaker 1>Fun stuff.

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:52.940
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. And and that uses reverse

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:55.020
<v Speaker 1>tunneling. Usually, it's in case of either a

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:56.060
<v Speaker 1>network issue

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.380
<v Speaker 1>of why they wanna do that or regional

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:00.464
<v Speaker 1>based. You know, if you're Eastern Western US

00:35:00.464 --> 00:35:01.425
<v Speaker 1>or Europe,

00:35:01.505 --> 00:35:03.825
<v Speaker 1>you know, you don't necessarily want one instance

00:35:03.825 --> 00:35:04.545
<v Speaker 1>having

00:35:04.625 --> 00:35:07.505
<v Speaker 1>all thousands of the SSH nodes or something.

00:35:07.905 --> 00:35:09.185
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

00:35:10.145 --> 00:35:12.750
<v Speaker 0>So what what should I be? Yeah. Let's

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:13.950
<v Speaker 1>let's do a t s h l s

00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:15.230
<v Speaker 1>so we can see the nodes that are

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:15.870
<v Speaker 1>available.

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:19.070
<v Speaker 0>And then just s s h entered.

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:24.590
<v Speaker 1>We have to use the the root at.

00:35:27.275 --> 00:35:28.795
<v Speaker 0>I'll try dashing on there.

00:35:29.194 --> 00:35:30.555
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Cool. And

00:35:31.434 --> 00:35:32.555
<v Speaker 1>now if you go if you go back

00:35:32.555 --> 00:35:34.954
<v Speaker 1>to the webs the app the web version

00:35:34.954 --> 00:35:35.595
<v Speaker 1>of it.

00:35:35.994 --> 00:35:36.715
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:35:37.194 --> 00:35:39.434
<v Speaker 1>Oh, okay. Active sessions. You can join that

00:35:39.434 --> 00:35:39.755
<v Speaker 1>session.

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:44.890
<v Speaker 1>And if you put if you wanna overlay

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:46.570
<v Speaker 1>them, if that's possible

00:35:47.849 --> 00:35:49.849
<v Speaker 1>Yes. Whatever you type, they'll see whatever they

00:35:49.849 --> 00:35:50.809
<v Speaker 1>type, you'll you'll see.

00:35:55.184 --> 00:35:56.145
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's fine.

00:36:01.025 --> 00:36:02.305
<v Speaker 1>See, I'm I'm still But

00:36:03.105 --> 00:36:04.065
<v Speaker 1>if you as you go back and forth,

00:36:04.065 --> 00:36:05.665
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that, you know, it's the same

00:36:06.145 --> 00:36:06.464
<v Speaker 1>view.

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:09.329
<v Speaker 0>I'm still learning how to Mac. I'm a

00:36:09.329 --> 00:36:11.569
<v Speaker 0>Linux user, like, a forced I

00:36:11.569 --> 00:36:13.170
<v Speaker 1>I I keep giving the option to do

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:15.010
<v Speaker 1>Mac, and I've I've I've stuck with Linux

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:17.809
<v Speaker 1>PCs for now. Alright. So I think I

00:36:17.809 --> 00:36:19.410
<v Speaker 0>should now be able to yeah. There we

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:20.609
<v Speaker 0>go. Okay. So

00:36:23.485 --> 00:36:25.325
<v Speaker 1>There you go. And you notice that number

00:36:25.325 --> 00:36:26.925
<v Speaker 1>two in the upper left?

00:36:27.325 --> 00:36:28.765
<v Speaker 1>So you can hover over that

00:36:30.765 --> 00:36:32.285
<v Speaker 1>on the on the on the web.

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.560
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. Oh, okay. So that's telling you

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.320
<v Speaker 1>there's two people in the system. If you

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.680
<v Speaker 1>go back if you go back to the

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.040
<v Speaker 1>sessions tab,

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.240
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the audit log,

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.320
<v Speaker 1>it'll it'll

00:36:46.434 --> 00:36:48.595
<v Speaker 1>indicate that someone else has joined. So all

00:36:48.595 --> 00:36:49.795
<v Speaker 1>that's being tracked.

00:36:50.434 --> 00:36:52.275
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not the session's being recorded, which

00:36:52.275 --> 00:36:53.875
<v Speaker 1>is something you can turn off, you don't

00:36:53.875 --> 00:36:55.234
<v Speaker 1>have to have session recordings.

00:36:55.474 --> 00:36:57.555
<v Speaker 1>Some of our clients decide to disable that.

00:36:57.555 --> 00:36:59.315
<v Speaker 1>They're more worried about just access,

00:36:59.474 --> 00:37:01.714
<v Speaker 1>and they don't necessarily wanna record the sessions.

00:37:02.369 --> 00:37:04.690
<v Speaker 1>But you're still getting those events recorded. So

00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:06.609
<v Speaker 1>each of those are events. You know, who's

00:37:06.609 --> 00:37:08.530
<v Speaker 1>joined, where did they join from,

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:11.250
<v Speaker 1>because each of you are individual logins that

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:12.210
<v Speaker 1>are being tracked.

00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:15.010
<v Speaker 0>So, you know, when,

00:37:15.329 --> 00:37:17.089
<v Speaker 0>you know, when we talk about security,

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:20.744
<v Speaker 0>like, it's normally much more something we can

00:37:20.905 --> 00:37:22.905
<v Speaker 0>there's usually tell when something's been breached about

00:37:22.905 --> 00:37:24.985
<v Speaker 0>understanding and doing the

00:37:25.945 --> 00:37:27.865
<v Speaker 0>the detective work to work out what was

00:37:27.865 --> 00:37:29.785
<v Speaker 0>compromised can be really difficult. And I can

00:37:29.785 --> 00:37:31.705
<v Speaker 0>see why session recording here can actually get

00:37:31.705 --> 00:37:33.369
<v Speaker 0>people they say, oh, this is, you know,

00:37:33.369 --> 00:37:35.050
<v Speaker 0>they go in through here and this is

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:36.330
<v Speaker 0>all the files they accessed.

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:38.650
<v Speaker 0>When we enable the BPF integration,

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:41.290
<v Speaker 0>do we have the ability to restrict what

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:42.810
<v Speaker 0>is audited? Like, can we just say, oh,

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:44.250
<v Speaker 0>this is the file that was opened rather

00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:46.890
<v Speaker 0>than the actual full playback or can we

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:47.130
<v Speaker 0>see

00:37:48.165 --> 00:37:49.765
<v Speaker 0>just a list of the commands? Like or

00:37:49.765 --> 00:37:51.125
<v Speaker 0>do you need to do the recording? How

00:37:51.125 --> 00:37:52.645
<v Speaker 0>does that kinda work together?

00:37:53.125 --> 00:37:56.165
<v Speaker 1>The the so the the will

00:37:56.565 --> 00:37:57.365
<v Speaker 1>log

00:37:57.365 --> 00:37:58.005
<v Speaker 1>to

00:37:58.565 --> 00:38:01.925
<v Speaker 1>the audit log, the act the individual commands,

00:38:02.005 --> 00:38:04.779
<v Speaker 1>network, and file activity. Those are three options

00:38:04.779 --> 00:38:05.900
<v Speaker 1>that you can log.

00:38:06.539 --> 00:38:09.580
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't actually restrict the commands,

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:12.619
<v Speaker 1>but that can be fed in real time

00:38:12.859 --> 00:38:14.940
<v Speaker 1>to, like, an Elastic or Splunk,

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:17.339
<v Speaker 1>and you could have something monitoring for that.

00:38:17.339 --> 00:38:19.660
<v Speaker 1>I'd say the other option that people and

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:21.315
<v Speaker 1>we just released this as well,

00:38:21.715 --> 00:38:23.955
<v Speaker 1>is limiting the number of connections you have.

00:38:24.515 --> 00:38:27.315
<v Speaker 1>So you can restrict how many connection like,

00:38:27.315 --> 00:38:29.235
<v Speaker 1>you could just say five max connections

00:38:29.315 --> 00:38:30.595
<v Speaker 1>based on their role.

00:38:31.235 --> 00:38:33.315
<v Speaker 1>And that way, you're you're both you're monitoring

00:38:33.315 --> 00:38:34.915
<v Speaker 1>at that, but then you're being proactive and

00:38:34.915 --> 00:38:37.260
<v Speaker 1>saying, well, if someone compromised you,

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:40.140
<v Speaker 1>then you can't they can't just explode and

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:41.740
<v Speaker 1>do a hundred connections across all of your

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:43.980
<v Speaker 1>nodes and then start downloading things or, you

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:46.380
<v Speaker 1>know, altering data. So those are some of

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:47.340
<v Speaker 1>the active productions.

00:38:48.075 --> 00:38:50.395
<v Speaker 1>I'd say in terms of, you know, monitoring

00:38:50.395 --> 00:38:52.635
<v Speaker 1>and usage, that's where, yeah, we would have

00:38:52.635 --> 00:38:53.195
<v Speaker 1>people

00:38:53.675 --> 00:38:55.035
<v Speaker 1>doing real time

00:38:57.275 --> 00:39:00.234
<v Speaker 1>controls through their Splunk or Elastic and then

00:39:00.234 --> 00:39:01.195
<v Speaker 1>alerting admins.

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.580
<v Speaker 1>And it's pretty it's one of the things

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:05.500
<v Speaker 1>I did was I set up an Elastic

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:06.300
<v Speaker 1>service

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:08.940
<v Speaker 1>that my app service sits in front of

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:11.180
<v Speaker 1>and gives me access to that Elastic. So

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:13.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't expose that. I don't I don't

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:14.940
<v Speaker 1>wanna go through all the all all the

00:39:15.695 --> 00:39:17.695
<v Speaker 1>controls of Elastic, but then I run that

00:39:17.695 --> 00:39:20.175
<v Speaker 1>behind it, and then my Teleport actually exposes

00:39:20.175 --> 00:39:20.735
<v Speaker 1>that.

00:39:21.775 --> 00:39:23.295
<v Speaker 1>Nice. Something you could do.

00:39:25.455 --> 00:39:26.255
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:39:27.455 --> 00:39:29.215
<v Speaker 1>So we got this going, and we can

00:39:29.215 --> 00:39:30.980
<v Speaker 1>we can close that we can close those

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:33.059
<v Speaker 1>sessions, and then maybe you wanna add one

00:39:33.059 --> 00:39:34.260
<v Speaker 1>of those other nodes.

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:39.540
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Sure. Okay.

00:39:43.724 --> 00:39:44.525
<v Speaker 0>So

00:39:44.525 --> 00:39:45.724
<v Speaker 0>it's just

00:39:46.444 --> 00:39:48.365
<v Speaker 0>SSH into this one.

00:39:49.404 --> 00:39:50.285
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:39:54.525 --> 00:39:55.244
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

00:39:57.490 --> 00:39:59.410
<v Speaker 0>So we're just gonna install

00:40:00.049 --> 00:40:01.410
<v Speaker 0>Teleport on this one the same way we

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:02.210
<v Speaker 0>did before?

00:40:02.609 --> 00:40:04.049
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. We can just we can download it

00:40:04.049 --> 00:40:05.410
<v Speaker 1>and just run the install.

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:07.009
<v Speaker 1>And I'll I'll show you. There's a there's

00:40:07.009 --> 00:40:08.690
<v Speaker 1>a quick way to to get it up

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:09.329
<v Speaker 1>and

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:10.210
<v Speaker 1>running.

00:40:11.855 --> 00:40:14.495
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So it did the downloaded thing.

00:40:15.615 --> 00:40:16.895
<v Speaker 0>CD in there.

00:40:17.694 --> 00:40:19.855
<v Speaker 0>And do we still run install again? Yep.

00:40:19.855 --> 00:40:21.055
<v Speaker 1>Yes. Okay.

00:40:22.974 --> 00:40:25.055
<v Speaker 1>And then from if you go back to

00:40:25.055 --> 00:40:26.095
<v Speaker 1>the

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:27.950
<v Speaker 1>the

00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:29.150
<v Speaker 1>proxy auth,

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:32.109
<v Speaker 1>and you can do it in here or

00:40:32.109 --> 00:40:34.510
<v Speaker 1>or from the SSH already had opened.

00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:38.349
<v Speaker 0>Oh, alright. Okay. I gotcha. So from here.

00:40:39.705 --> 00:40:41.705
<v Speaker 1>And then run that run t cuddle again,

00:40:41.705 --> 00:40:43.225
<v Speaker 1>and we'll see the list of commands.

00:40:43.465 --> 00:40:44.425
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:40:45.225 --> 00:40:47.865
<v Speaker 1>So there's a t cuddle nodes add.

00:40:50.025 --> 00:40:50.585
<v Speaker 0>That.

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:57.550
<v Speaker 1>Now we just wanna make sure that that's

00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:59.390
<v Speaker 1>the IP that you think it can reach

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:00.910
<v Speaker 1>that, or does it we might need to

00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:03.230
<v Speaker 1>change that to the the DNS entry. No.

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:04.510
<v Speaker 0>It's okay. I can go over the private

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:05.070
<v Speaker 0>network. Okay.

00:41:09.194 --> 00:41:10.474
<v Speaker 1>And you're off.

00:41:12.075 --> 00:41:13.115
<v Speaker 1>That's it. Go back if we go back

00:41:13.115 --> 00:41:14.474
<v Speaker 1>to the web service, it should should be

00:41:14.474 --> 00:41:15.195
<v Speaker 1>available.

00:41:15.914 --> 00:41:17.195
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:41:17.434 --> 00:41:18.075
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:24.150
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's too cool.

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.670
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's I mean, that's that's the fast

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:29.510
<v Speaker 1>that's the fastest way to do it.

00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:33.190
<v Speaker 1>You know, it's typically, you'd also have like,

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:35.190
<v Speaker 1>if you notice that there's a labeling for

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.750
<v Speaker 1>the

00:41:36.225 --> 00:41:37.905
<v Speaker 1>the Teleport Linux one.

00:41:38.145 --> 00:41:40.145
<v Speaker 1>So often you would have you'd use that

00:41:40.145 --> 00:41:42.865
<v Speaker 1>Teleport YAML, put in the SSH service,

00:41:43.905 --> 00:41:45.425
<v Speaker 1>and then you could also and then you

00:41:45.425 --> 00:41:46.785
<v Speaker 1>can also put in things like our PAM

00:41:46.785 --> 00:41:49.425
<v Speaker 1>control, our PAM configuration to automatically like, you

00:41:49.425 --> 00:41:51.780
<v Speaker 1>can create users or other kind of things

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:53.940
<v Speaker 1>like setting up, you know, dual integration, things

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:56.020
<v Speaker 1>like that. So there's a you know, you

00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:58.100
<v Speaker 1>start off very small, and then you can,

00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:00.100
<v Speaker 1>you know, quickly do all these hoops and

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:01.300
<v Speaker 1>things that people wanna do.

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:04.420
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I like it. Mhmm.

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:07.135
<v Speaker 0>What do you wanna do next, Toby? Is

00:42:07.135 --> 00:42:09.295
<v Speaker 0>there more on this quick start? Let's see.

00:42:10.175 --> 00:42:10.975
<v Speaker 1>I think

00:42:12.095 --> 00:42:14.095
<v Speaker 1>that's most of it. I think the

00:42:15.055 --> 00:42:17.695
<v Speaker 1>you know, from here, I think for SSH,

00:42:17.695 --> 00:42:19.775
<v Speaker 1>you would tip and I think they're doing

00:42:19.775 --> 00:42:21.460
<v Speaker 1>the same thing there. Let me go back

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:22.660
<v Speaker 1>go up a little bit.

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:27.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Oh, the one thing I didn't oh,

00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:28.980
<v Speaker 1>so that's a that's a good example they

00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:30.660
<v Speaker 1>have there on that Teleport start

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:32.420
<v Speaker 1>where they actually show you can put a

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:32.980
<v Speaker 1>label in.

00:42:34.095 --> 00:42:35.935
<v Speaker 1>So you could've you could've put a label

00:42:35.935 --> 00:42:36.575
<v Speaker 1>in there,

00:42:37.615 --> 00:42:39.775
<v Speaker 1>directly as well. So that's very helpful.

00:42:40.335 --> 00:42:42.494
<v Speaker 0>And those labels could be things like,

00:42:42.975 --> 00:42:45.455
<v Speaker 0>what region my machine is in, what its

00:42:45.455 --> 00:42:47.295
<v Speaker 0>use case is, who the owner is, what

00:42:47.455 --> 00:42:49.560
<v Speaker 0>just any arbitrary key value pairs I want.

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:51.000
<v Speaker 1>Well, if if we go back to the

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.800
<v Speaker 1>to the TSH command line, you can use

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:55.240
<v Speaker 1>that to search for nodes.

00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.520
<v Speaker 1>So from your Oh, from my machine. Okay.

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Your your machine.

00:43:03.925 --> 00:43:05.925
<v Speaker 0>Is there a search command? Oh, I'm sorry.

00:43:05.925 --> 00:43:07.925
<v Speaker 1>The l s. When you do l s

00:43:08.085 --> 00:43:09.285
<v Speaker 1>t s h l s.

00:43:09.845 --> 00:43:11.605
<v Speaker 1>And if you do t s h l

00:43:11.605 --> 00:43:14.725
<v Speaker 1>s environment equal staging, it should only return

00:43:14.885 --> 00:43:15.765
<v Speaker 1>that one line.

00:43:20.599 --> 00:43:21.800
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.720
<v Speaker 0>Cool. Yeah. And you can actually you you

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:25.960
<v Speaker 1>can use that to also open an SSH

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:28.119
<v Speaker 1>session. So you could say, go find me

00:43:28.119 --> 00:43:30.615
<v Speaker 1>this, you know, label. Maybe maybe instead you

00:43:30.615 --> 00:43:31.415
<v Speaker 1>used a

00:43:33.495 --> 00:43:36.295
<v Speaker 1>you used a ID like, machine ID,

00:43:36.615 --> 00:43:37.895
<v Speaker 1>you know, addition. That's usually what I do

00:43:37.895 --> 00:43:39.255
<v Speaker 1>is I have machine ID,

00:43:39.575 --> 00:43:42.535
<v Speaker 1>the environment, and then some any other relevant

00:43:42.535 --> 00:43:42.855
<v Speaker 1>information.

00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:46.510
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Very cool. Yeah.

00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:50.030
<v Speaker 0>Which one what what do we what do

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:51.550
<v Speaker 0>we do next? I think the the Kubernetes

00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:52.670
<v Speaker 1>setup would be good.

00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:53.870
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:57.310
<v Speaker 0>So let's see.

00:44:00.755 --> 00:44:01.555
<v Speaker 0>So

00:44:02.595 --> 00:44:04.435
<v Speaker 0>there we go. Okay. Yep.

00:44:05.475 --> 00:44:07.075
<v Speaker 0>Helm repo ads.

00:44:11.955 --> 00:44:13.875
<v Speaker 0>We don't need these other machines anymore, do

00:44:13.875 --> 00:44:15.530
<v Speaker 0>we? If I just close these tabs so

00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:17.210
<v Speaker 0>I don't get too confused. Yeah. Yeah.

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:20.170
<v Speaker 0>I'm easily confused. Oh, I know. It it

00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:21.210
<v Speaker 1>it adds up.

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:26.810
<v Speaker 0>That it's Oh, I'm actually wanted the in

00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:27.770
<v Speaker 1>terms of the

00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:30.090
<v Speaker 1>getting access to that Kubernetes,

00:44:30.705 --> 00:44:33.025
<v Speaker 1>I I wanted to deploy it through one

00:44:33.025 --> 00:44:33.905
<v Speaker 1>of our other

00:44:34.785 --> 00:44:35.505
<v Speaker 1>charts,

00:44:37.425 --> 00:44:38.945
<v Speaker 1>which if you pull if you go to

00:44:38.945 --> 00:44:41.665
<v Speaker 1>our our I I think this is not

00:44:41.905 --> 00:44:43.105
<v Speaker 1>yet out yet. So what

00:44:43.745 --> 00:44:45.585
<v Speaker 1>unless you go go to the multiple Kubernetes

00:44:45.585 --> 00:44:46.065
<v Speaker 1>clusters.

00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:50.030
<v Speaker 1>I think there's on the right. Oh, yep.

00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:51.470
<v Speaker 0>That's

00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:52.110
<v Speaker 0>fine.

00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:56.510
<v Speaker 1>That's,

00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:58.510
<v Speaker 1>yeah. Let's let's do,

00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:01.395
<v Speaker 1>oh, I I yeah. That that. So there's

00:45:01.555 --> 00:45:03.155
<v Speaker 1>if you go to our GitHub,

00:45:03.555 --> 00:45:05.235
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you the the the chart, I

00:45:05.235 --> 00:45:07.555
<v Speaker 1>I mean. Is it GoTeleport?

00:45:07.875 --> 00:45:10.195
<v Speaker 1>Grab so gravitational. Gravitational. Gravitational.

00:45:10.915 --> 00:45:12.355
<v Speaker 1>It'll it'll change eventually.

00:45:12.675 --> 00:45:13.235
<v Speaker 1>Teleport,

00:45:14.109 --> 00:45:16.110
<v Speaker 1>that'll come up. First one.

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:21.790
<v Speaker 1>And then go if you go into oh,

00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:23.710
<v Speaker 1>look. There I am. I just added something.

00:45:25.869 --> 00:45:26.910
<v Speaker 1>And you go to examples,

00:45:32.055 --> 00:45:32.935
<v Speaker 1>chart,

00:45:36.295 --> 00:45:37.415
<v Speaker 1>and then the Teleport,

00:45:37.655 --> 00:45:38.295
<v Speaker 1>cube agent.

00:45:47.349 --> 00:45:49.270
<v Speaker 0>So I should probably clone this down?

00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Yes. And then the one other thing we'll

00:45:51.590 --> 00:45:53.190
<v Speaker 1>have to add a Cube token. Right now,

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:54.390
<v Speaker 1>we do not have a Cube token.

00:45:56.645 --> 00:45:58.725
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's grab this first.

00:46:09.925 --> 00:46:10.885
<v Speaker 0>And what?

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:14.800
<v Speaker 0>Teleport examples

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:15.840
<v Speaker 0>chart.

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:17.280
<v Speaker 0>Teleport

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:18.960
<v Speaker 0>cube agent. Alright.

00:46:25.115 --> 00:46:28.155
<v Speaker 0>Always goes to the wrong window. So let's

00:46:28.155 --> 00:46:29.994
<v Speaker 0>get the read me which had an install

00:46:29.994 --> 00:46:30.875
<v Speaker 0>command.

00:46:31.835 --> 00:46:33.355
<v Speaker 0>And we need to drop a few things

00:46:33.355 --> 00:46:34.715
<v Speaker 0>in here. So

00:46:37.355 --> 00:46:39.595
<v Speaker 0>can these just be done through values fail?

00:46:39.595 --> 00:46:39.835
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:41.350
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:44.230
<v Speaker 0>So this off token is just a join

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:47.270
<v Speaker 0>token. Right? Yes. And in in our

00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:51.030
<v Speaker 1>if you go back to our service, we'll

00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:53.270
<v Speaker 1>we'll wanna add a new line of a

00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:54.230
<v Speaker 1>a cube token.

00:46:56.355 --> 00:46:57.875
<v Speaker 1>Right right now, it does not. It only

00:46:57.875 --> 00:46:59.875
<v Speaker 1>has app proxy and node.

00:47:01.955 --> 00:47:04.035
<v Speaker 0>So we need to go back to

00:47:04.915 --> 00:47:07.395
<v Speaker 0>the existing Teleport that we set up? Yes.

00:47:08.355 --> 00:47:09.875
<v Speaker 0>On the

00:47:10.275 --> 00:47:11.315
<v Speaker 0>or via the UI?

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:13.080
<v Speaker 1>We can do either way.

00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:15.319
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I'm sorry. No. From here, you'd have

00:47:15.319 --> 00:47:16.920
<v Speaker 1>to open up an SSH session to do

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:17.640
<v Speaker 1>it. Yeah.

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:21.079
<v Speaker 0>Unfortunately, that's trivial now. So

00:47:21.799 --> 00:47:24.039
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. If you do that you can do

00:47:24.039 --> 00:47:24.920
<v Speaker 1>it remotely,

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:25.960
<v Speaker 1>but I I was

00:47:26.865 --> 00:47:28.065
<v Speaker 1>through a t cuddle.

00:47:28.385 --> 00:47:30.705
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yep. Oh, you know what you're doing?

00:47:31.425 --> 00:47:33.105
<v Speaker 1>So the yeah. The if we do a

00:47:33.105 --> 00:47:34.385
<v Speaker 1>t cuddle if we do a t cuddle

00:47:34.385 --> 00:47:35.345
<v Speaker 1>tokens l s,

00:47:38.559 --> 00:47:39.760
<v Speaker 1>You can see we don't we don't have

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:40.720
<v Speaker 1>a queue one.

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:42.320
<v Speaker 1>So if we go into the

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:45.599
<v Speaker 1>Etsy Teleport YAML, we can add a new

00:47:45.599 --> 00:47:46.480
<v Speaker 1>queue line.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:48.880
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:52.480
<v Speaker 0>So is that just a new service here?

00:47:52.559 --> 00:47:54.865
<v Speaker 0>Or or is that a token here? Yeah.

00:47:54.865 --> 00:47:55.905
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Just dash

00:47:57.345 --> 00:47:58.224
<v Speaker 1>cube

00:47:59.345 --> 00:48:00.224
<v Speaker 1>colon

00:48:00.944 --> 00:48:02.865
<v Speaker 1>and then a then a token.

00:48:04.464 --> 00:48:06.385
<v Speaker 0>And that's the join token from my Kubernetes

00:48:06.385 --> 00:48:07.904
<v Speaker 0>cluster? Yes. For the yeah.

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:11.350
<v Speaker 1>Because you're basic you can basically give different

00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:12.470
<v Speaker 1>types of

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:15.030
<v Speaker 1>tokens. You don't you don't always want them

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:16.470
<v Speaker 1>to be the same the same.

00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:21.830
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let me just jump onto one of

00:48:21.830 --> 00:48:23.510
<v Speaker 0>these machines and grab that then.

00:48:27.964 --> 00:48:29.005
<v Speaker 0>Curl.

00:48:32.365 --> 00:48:34.684
<v Speaker 0>There should be a join token available in

00:48:34.684 --> 00:48:35.805
<v Speaker 0>the metadata.

00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:40.710
<v Speaker 0>I know the user data. Oh oh, usually

00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:42.470
<v Speaker 1>just make it up. It doesn't or or

00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:43.750
<v Speaker 1>have it generate

00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:44.790
<v Speaker 1>one through a

00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:46.950
<v Speaker 1>randomizer.

00:48:47.590 --> 00:48:49.990
<v Speaker 0>Oh, so it's not actually a real No.

00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:51.590
<v Speaker 1>No. I'm sorry. Not not that. No. It's

00:48:51.590 --> 00:48:53.430
<v Speaker 1>it's just it's a it's a random

00:48:53.645 --> 00:48:55.165
<v Speaker 1>ID, like a password.

00:48:56.365 --> 00:48:57.964
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Okay. Thought you actually went to the

00:48:57.964 --> 00:49:00.444
<v Speaker 0>cube ADM No. No. No. That that is

00:48:59.964 --> 00:49:02.045
<v Speaker 1>good distinction. No. That that does not have

00:49:02.045 --> 00:49:03.405
<v Speaker 1>to be related to that.

00:49:04.525 --> 00:49:05.565
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:49:06.285 --> 00:49:07.645
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So

00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:10.750
<v Speaker 0>let's come back over here and I can

00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:11.390
<v Speaker 0>enter

00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:15.790
<v Speaker 0>like so. Yeah. Sure.

00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:18.750
<v Speaker 1>But a b c of one two three

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:20.350
<v Speaker 0>work. Does this maybe overkill?

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:20.990
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:49:21.875 --> 00:49:23.875
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's save that. Do I need to

00:49:23.875 --> 00:49:25.155
<v Speaker 0>restart Teleport?

00:49:25.155 --> 00:49:26.435
<v Speaker 1>In order to tell it can be found.

00:49:26.435 --> 00:49:27.875
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It'll probably it might kick you out

00:49:27.875 --> 00:49:29.795
<v Speaker 1>of the web, but let's it'll probably that's

00:49:29.795 --> 00:49:30.355
<v Speaker 1>fine.

00:49:30.994 --> 00:49:31.955
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Okay.

00:49:32.595 --> 00:49:34.930
<v Speaker 0>But but then then right back up.

00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:37.090
<v Speaker 0>And

00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:40.290
<v Speaker 0>we ran TCTL tokens LS.

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:42.930
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Now we have a cube token. Yep.

00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:46.210
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So that has to go into our

00:49:46.210 --> 00:49:47.090
<v Speaker 0>Helm chart

00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:48.370
<v Speaker 0>here.

00:49:50.755 --> 00:49:52.915
<v Speaker 0>The proxy address, is that the same IP

00:49:52.915 --> 00:49:55.235
<v Speaker 0>address that we're browsing to? Yes. With with

00:49:55.235 --> 00:49:56.195
<v Speaker 1>the 3080.

00:49:56.355 --> 00:49:57.795
<v Speaker 0>With the 3080.

00:49:58.915 --> 00:50:00.675
<v Speaker 1>And you you don't need the HTTPS part,

00:50:00.675 --> 00:50:01.875
<v Speaker 1>just the Yep. DNS.

00:50:03.819 --> 00:50:05.260
<v Speaker 0>A cube cluster name, could that be any

00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:07.900
<v Speaker 0>name? Any name. Yep. Alright. So let's do

00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:08.620
<v Speaker 0>Rawkode.

00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:12.940
<v Speaker 0>And that's it. Easy.

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:14.540
<v Speaker 0>He says.

00:50:16.555 --> 00:50:19.275
<v Speaker 0>So that means we don't actually need these.

00:50:21.275 --> 00:50:22.635
<v Speaker 0>We can just do

00:50:24.395 --> 00:50:25.035
<v Speaker 0>that.

00:50:26.475 --> 00:50:27.595
<v Speaker 0>Where'd my terminal go?

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:34.440
<v Speaker 1>You seem pretty good with that Mac, David.

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:37.640
<v Speaker 0>Well, when I'm within Versus code in my

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:39.640
<v Speaker 0>terminal, yeah, not much has to change. So

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:42.135
<v Speaker 0>that's that's alright. Alright. Right. But

00:50:42.135 --> 00:50:43.255
<v Speaker 0>yeah. As a matter I have to actually

00:50:43.255 --> 00:50:45.255
<v Speaker 0>do anything with a moving window, then yeah.

00:50:45.255 --> 00:50:46.455
<v Speaker 0>Things get a little painful.

00:50:46.695 --> 00:50:47.255
<v Speaker 0>So

00:50:49.975 --> 00:50:50.935
<v Speaker 0>let's try.

00:50:52.775 --> 00:50:53.815
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That should work.

00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:59.480
<v Speaker 0>My q config which is now there.

00:51:10.964 --> 00:51:13.765
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So that created a namespace.

00:51:15.125 --> 00:51:16.725
<v Speaker 0>We can run get pods,

00:51:17.685 --> 00:51:19.685
<v Speaker 0>and we'll run a watch on that. Already

00:51:19.685 --> 00:51:21.830
<v Speaker 0>almost there. Okay. Yeah. If we if we

00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:23.110
<v Speaker 1>look at the logs, we should see that

00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:24.550
<v Speaker 1>it it was able to connect

00:51:25.110 --> 00:51:25.990
<v Speaker 0>successfully.

00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:28.070
<v Speaker 0>So the logs

00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:30.950
<v Speaker 1>From here, what if you go back to

00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:32.950
<v Speaker 1>the command line, the t cuddle.

00:51:36.885 --> 00:51:38.405
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. That's There you go. I got

00:51:38.405 --> 00:51:39.525
<v Speaker 0>it. I understand.

00:51:40.085 --> 00:51:42.965
<v Speaker 1>You can always do a get of cube

00:51:42.965 --> 00:51:44.165
<v Speaker 1>underscore service.

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:51.820
<v Speaker 1>So that I don't think it's registered yet.

00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Let's let's go back and see.

00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:58.940
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's get the logs of this, see

00:51:58.940 --> 00:51:59.660
<v Speaker 0>what's going on.

00:52:07.775 --> 00:52:10.735
<v Speaker 0>Timed out trying to reach that IP address

00:52:10.735 --> 00:52:12.015
<v Speaker 0>and port.

00:52:12.655 --> 00:52:13.935
<v Speaker 1>Oh, and I think we do need to

00:52:13.935 --> 00:52:15.295
<v Speaker 1>set I don't I don't think we set

00:52:15.215 --> 00:52:17.295
<v Speaker 0>Unsecure? Yeah. Yeah. I think we need to

00:52:17.295 --> 00:52:17.695
<v Speaker 1>change that.

00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:20.789
<v Speaker 1>In the in the back in the values,

00:52:20.789 --> 00:52:22.470
<v Speaker 1>yeah, but you can it's there it is.

00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:23.349
<v Speaker 1>Insecure.

00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:25.430
<v Speaker 0>Yep. There we go.

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:27.510
<v Speaker 0>Just

00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:29.910
<v Speaker 0>quickly remove that. It might be easier.

00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.750
<v Speaker 0>Maybe that.

00:52:36.255 --> 00:52:37.055
<v Speaker 1>Upgrade. Correct.

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Do you think I might have trouble getting

00:52:55.310 --> 00:52:56.590
<v Speaker 1>that DNS?

00:52:58.525 --> 00:52:59.885
<v Speaker 0>No. It should be okay. And I don't

00:52:59.885 --> 00:53:01.805
<v Speaker 0>see anything from the logs that suggests an

00:53:01.805 --> 00:53:03.005
<v Speaker 0>error anymore.

00:53:03.085 --> 00:53:05.405
<v Speaker 0>So let's just try it like that.

00:53:10.285 --> 00:53:11.405
<v Speaker 0>Is it thinking about it?

00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's saying it TCP

00:53:23.089 --> 00:53:23.650
<v Speaker 1>timeout.

00:53:27.215 --> 00:53:28.495
<v Speaker 0>Oh. This

00:53:30.255 --> 00:53:32.175
<v Speaker 0>is the right one, isn't it?

00:53:37.775 --> 00:53:40.255
<v Speaker 0>We want dash k h t t p

00:53:40.255 --> 00:53:40.575
<v Speaker 0>s.

00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:45.240
<v Speaker 0>I mean, that's publicly accessible. Yeah. So

00:53:54.625 --> 00:53:56.385
<v Speaker 1>Do we wanna try the IP as well?

00:53:56.385 --> 00:53:57.585
<v Speaker 1>See if we can get to that.

00:53:58.705 --> 00:54:00.785
<v Speaker 1>Because you insecure, it really doesn't matter.

00:54:02.145 --> 00:54:02.785
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Sure.

00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:08.760
<v Speaker 0>Start with the port number?

00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:10.680
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:14.360
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. Address to the Teleport proxy web

00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:15.400
<v Speaker 0>to port. Okay.

00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:19.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. A lot some people change it to

00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:19.800
<v Speaker 1>443.

00:54:28.355 --> 00:54:30.115
<v Speaker 0>I'm just gonna remove it.

00:54:52.575 --> 00:54:53.855
<v Speaker 0>It should start again.

00:54:55.615 --> 00:54:57.375
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Helm install.

00:55:02.175 --> 00:55:03.455
<v Speaker 0>Good.

00:55:03.775 --> 00:55:04.975
<v Speaker 0>From pods.

00:55:06.015 --> 00:55:07.455
<v Speaker 0>I'll grab the logs again.

00:55:10.690 --> 00:55:12.210
<v Speaker 0>User's unsecure.

00:55:16.849 --> 00:55:18.849
<v Speaker 0>It's alright. Is is that good or bad?

00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:22.369
<v Speaker 0>Failed to register to the off server invalid.

00:55:24.204 --> 00:55:26.045
<v Speaker 0>I can probably get a new value.

00:55:28.204 --> 00:55:34.045
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you know what it is? Where's

00:55:34.045 --> 00:55:35.405
<v Speaker 0>that helmets document?

00:55:37.964 --> 00:55:38.765
<v Speaker 0>Dash f.

00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:41.960
<v Speaker 0>Although it shouldn't matter because No. Shouldn't matter.

00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:44.280
<v Speaker 0>The chart. Now. Yeah. Shouldn't matter.

00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:46.599
<v Speaker 0>I thought I was onto something there. Yeah.

00:55:46.599 --> 00:55:47.880
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:53.160
<v Speaker 0>So it seems to be

00:55:55.125 --> 00:55:57.205
<v Speaker 0>I mean, that invalid character seems to be

00:55:57.205 --> 00:55:58.725
<v Speaker 0>like I'm not expecting

00:56:03.125 --> 00:56:05.205
<v Speaker 1>I think that's because well, it first it

00:56:05.205 --> 00:56:06.805
<v Speaker 1>first checks to see if that's the auth

00:56:06.805 --> 00:56:08.485
<v Speaker 1>server. If it's not, it should fall back,

00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:11.560
<v Speaker 1>but it should be able to connect to

00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:12.120
<v Speaker 1>that.

00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:15.000
<v Speaker 1>So

00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:16.600
<v Speaker 1>it's still getting the time out.

00:56:21.734 --> 00:56:23.815
<v Speaker 1>Is there a way we can test that

00:56:23.815 --> 00:56:25.974
<v Speaker 1>it is able to find that IP? Yeah.

00:56:25.974 --> 00:56:27.494
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I'll jump on that machine. So

00:56:27.494 --> 00:56:28.535
<v Speaker 0>let's do that.

00:56:29.015 --> 00:56:29.815
<v Speaker 0>So

00:56:33.095 --> 00:56:33.335
<v Speaker 0>one.

00:56:37.350 --> 00:56:39.110
<v Speaker 0>And then we want the IP address of

00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:39.910
<v Speaker 0>this one.

00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:46.710
<v Speaker 0>And

00:56:46.790 --> 00:56:47.910
<v Speaker 0>3080.

00:56:49.695 --> 00:56:52.015
<v Speaker 0>And then allow the and secure.

00:56:53.935 --> 00:56:55.535
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I mean, that does work.

00:56:56.175 --> 00:56:57.615
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. For and our

00:56:58.415 --> 00:56:59.695
<v Speaker 1>for micro

00:57:00.095 --> 00:57:01.695
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes, I know I just I didn't had

00:57:01.695 --> 00:57:03.375
<v Speaker 1>to install the DNS, but

00:57:04.089 --> 00:57:05.609
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's I assume that's

00:57:05.609 --> 00:57:06.330
<v Speaker 1>enabled.

00:57:09.369 --> 00:57:12.010
<v Speaker 0>Make sure I enabled networking on this thing.

00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:15.609
<v Speaker 0>It does. Yeah. It's got Calico running. Okay.

00:57:15.609 --> 00:57:18.089
<v Speaker 0>Let's try it from one of these pods

00:57:18.089 --> 00:57:19.609
<v Speaker 0>then. Yeah. So

00:57:21.425 --> 00:57:23.025
<v Speaker 0>which one of these will actually have something

00:57:23.025 --> 00:57:24.065
<v Speaker 0>I can get inside?

00:57:28.865 --> 00:57:30.545
<v Speaker 0>Well, let's try that one. Sure.

00:57:37.550 --> 00:57:39.150
<v Speaker 0>O dash I t

00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:43.070
<v Speaker 0>curl h t p s.

00:57:49.375 --> 00:57:51.454
<v Speaker 1>Oh, always. Yeah. I was gonna have like,

00:57:51.454 --> 00:57:52.655
<v Speaker 1>if that works. Yeah.

00:57:56.494 --> 00:57:57.694
<v Speaker 0>Let's see if we can get this command

00:57:57.694 --> 00:57:59.615
<v Speaker 0>in before the probes kick me out and

00:57:59.615 --> 00:58:00.575
<v Speaker 0>restart the container.

00:58:02.369 --> 00:58:04.529
<v Speaker 0>Oh, there's no networking. Yeah. That now I

00:58:04.529 --> 00:58:05.329
<v Speaker 1>think that's the issue.

00:58:15.035 --> 00:58:16.475
<v Speaker 0>Well, it's not good when I give you

00:58:16.475 --> 00:58:18.155
<v Speaker 0>a broken Kubernetes cluster, is it? Oh, no.

00:58:18.155 --> 00:58:20.955
<v Speaker 1>No. I well, getting that in yeah. With

00:58:20.955 --> 00:58:22.475
<v Speaker 1>micro, it's nice, but you always have to

00:58:22.475 --> 00:58:23.835
<v Speaker 1>add like, at the app bar back, you

00:58:23.835 --> 00:58:26.155
<v Speaker 1>have to add DNS. So I it doesn't

00:58:26.155 --> 00:58:26.395
<v Speaker 1>happen.

00:58:28.810 --> 00:58:30.330
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Then we get to play a game

00:58:30.330 --> 00:58:33.130
<v Speaker 0>of can I fix my Kubernetes cluster? So

00:58:33.130 --> 00:58:34.090
<v Speaker 0>let's see.

00:58:37.690 --> 00:58:40.250
<v Speaker 0>Why would that not work? Yeah. They're running.

00:58:46.445 --> 00:58:48.205
<v Speaker 0>That is peculiar.

00:58:49.085 --> 00:58:50.845
<v Speaker 0>I wonder if it is

00:58:51.325 --> 00:58:54.285
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna just quickly do engine x.

00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:06.740
<v Speaker 0>I have had issues before where one namespace

00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:08.980
<v Speaker 0>has lost networking and I don't know why.

00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I see what you mean.

00:59:11.625 --> 00:59:13.945
<v Speaker 0>So I'm gonna apply that to the cluster

00:59:13.945 --> 00:59:15.865
<v Speaker 0>and the default namespace.

00:59:20.425 --> 00:59:22.345
<v Speaker 0>Assume that'll be up by now.

00:59:22.745 --> 00:59:24.265
<v Speaker 0>See if we can get a shell inside

00:59:24.265 --> 00:59:24.665
<v Speaker 0>of it.

00:59:26.369 --> 00:59:28.450
<v Speaker 0>That's got curls, so that's a good start.

00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:32.530
<v Speaker 0>No. Alright.

00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:35.089
<v Speaker 0>Fun. Let's try

00:59:35.329 --> 00:59:36.210
<v Speaker 0>delete

00:59:36.609 --> 00:59:37.329
<v Speaker 0>pod

00:59:37.410 --> 00:59:38.289
<v Speaker 0>l

00:59:38.289 --> 00:59:39.170
<v Speaker 0>k sap.

00:59:40.815 --> 00:59:41.775
<v Speaker 0>Calico.

00:59:42.175 --> 00:59:43.055
<v Speaker 0>Nope.

00:59:45.615 --> 00:59:47.135
<v Speaker 0>Oh, namespace.

00:59:50.015 --> 00:59:51.295
<v Speaker 0>Kube system

00:59:51.295 --> 00:59:52.415
<v Speaker 0>delete

00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:53.960
<v Speaker 0>pod

00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:54.840
<v Speaker 0>l.

00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:57.480
<v Speaker 0>I'm just assuming they use

00:59:57.560 --> 00:59:58.280
<v Speaker 0>this.

00:59:58.760 --> 00:59:59.480
<v Speaker 0>No.

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:03.160
<v Speaker 0>System get pods.

01:00:06.585 --> 01:00:08.185
<v Speaker 0>Describe pod.

01:00:09.225 --> 01:00:10.265
<v Speaker 0>Cali cool.

01:00:12.185 --> 01:00:14.744
<v Speaker 0>Yep. Anyone will do. Hopefully, I got something

01:00:14.744 --> 01:00:16.585
<v Speaker 0>in common. I'm just gonna boot them and

01:00:16.585 --> 01:00:18.505
<v Speaker 0>see if that fixes it. Mhmm.

01:00:18.905 --> 01:00:20.505
<v Speaker 0>K sap calip. Oh, yeah.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.440
<v Speaker 0>So that one's different.

01:00:27.039 --> 01:00:28.960
<v Speaker 0>And call it called node. Okay. Let's try

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:29.200
<v Speaker 0>that.

01:00:37.204 --> 01:00:37.925
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

01:00:39.045 --> 01:00:41.045
<v Speaker 0>System delete part

01:00:41.045 --> 01:00:41.765
<v Speaker 0>and

01:00:41.924 --> 01:00:42.884
<v Speaker 0>that was close.

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.920
<v Speaker 0>Alright. That one gone.

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:58.160
<v Speaker 0>And let's do calico node,

01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.160
<v Speaker 0>which should delete more. Alright.

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:01.840
<v Speaker 0>Fingers crossed.

01:01:13.255 --> 01:01:16.135
<v Speaker 0>Let's just restart engine x just in case.

01:01:32.474 --> 01:01:33.515
<v Speaker 0>No curl.

01:01:38.154 --> 01:01:39.595
<v Speaker 0>What's the backup plan?

01:01:40.234 --> 01:01:42.234
<v Speaker 1>I mean, I I can show my environment,

01:01:42.234 --> 01:01:43.994
<v Speaker 1>you know, show show how that's how that's

01:01:43.994 --> 01:01:44.714
<v Speaker 1>working. Yeah.

01:01:45.930 --> 01:01:48.730
<v Speaker 0>Why is my cluster got no networking? I

01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:49.530
<v Speaker 1>mean, there isn't

01:01:50.089 --> 01:01:51.930
<v Speaker 1>do you think there's some kind of default

01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:52.890
<v Speaker 1>securities

01:01:53.609 --> 01:01:56.410
<v Speaker 1>policy? Or No. This is a vanilla Kubernetes

01:01:56.410 --> 01:01:58.890
<v Speaker 0>cluster I spun up this morning. Mhmm. I

01:01:58.890 --> 01:02:00.330
<v Speaker 0>just threw a calico on it.

01:02:00.984 --> 01:02:02.345
<v Speaker 0>There's nothing

01:02:02.425 --> 01:02:06.425
<v Speaker 0>on it that would be restricting network access.

01:02:09.224 --> 01:02:11.865
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I mean, this is all very vanilla.

01:02:17.789 --> 01:02:18.589
<v Speaker 1>I guess

01:02:18.910 --> 01:02:20.910
<v Speaker 0>I could maybe Yeah. The other way is,

01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:22.109
<v Speaker 1>yeah, my a micro

01:02:22.349 --> 01:02:23.950
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes quickly or

01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:26.829
<v Speaker 0>Well, do you have a working Kubernetes setup

01:02:26.829 --> 01:02:28.269
<v Speaker 0>and you're happy to share your screen? I've

01:02:28.269 --> 01:02:29.869
<v Speaker 1>got all that setup. Yeah. If I if

01:02:29.869 --> 01:02:31.425
<v Speaker 1>I can share it. I don't think it's

01:02:31.425 --> 01:02:33.345
<v Speaker 0>very interesting for people to watch me try

01:02:33.345 --> 01:02:35.905
<v Speaker 0>and fix my my very broken cluster. And

01:02:35.905 --> 01:02:37.905
<v Speaker 0>I really wanna see some more Teleport goodness.

01:02:37.905 --> 01:02:39.985
<v Speaker 0>So let's let's let's do that. Yeah.

01:02:43.390 --> 01:02:45.630
<v Speaker 0>It's a last stream with a few problems.

01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:50.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:52.750
<v Speaker 1>So I've I've I've gone ahead and this

01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:53.790
<v Speaker 1>this is a

01:02:54.350 --> 01:02:57.310
<v Speaker 1>Teleport instance installed in on eight FBOS with

01:02:57.310 --> 01:02:58.030
<v Speaker 1>the EC two.

01:02:58.665 --> 01:03:00.665
<v Speaker 1>I've got some this is the difference

01:03:00.905 --> 01:03:03.065
<v Speaker 1>you would have with, you know, the community

01:03:03.065 --> 01:03:04.105
<v Speaker 1>version you have

01:03:04.585 --> 01:03:05.865
<v Speaker 1>is that one of the things is you

01:03:05.865 --> 01:03:07.305
<v Speaker 1>can have multiple SSOs

01:03:07.305 --> 01:03:08.025
<v Speaker 1>configured,

01:03:08.745 --> 01:03:10.345
<v Speaker 1>and it can support multiple at the same

01:03:10.345 --> 01:03:12.430
<v Speaker 1>time, and you're just mapping it to individual

01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:15.470
<v Speaker 1>roles. What when yours was running,

01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:18.510
<v Speaker 1>you you all have essentially a single role,

01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:20.110
<v Speaker 1>of admin,

01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:22.110
<v Speaker 1>but you do have individual,

01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:23.070
<v Speaker 1>users.

01:03:23.865 --> 01:03:25.785
<v Speaker 1>So when I was saying about going back,

01:03:25.785 --> 01:03:27.785
<v Speaker 1>you can set into it like, remember, you

01:03:27.785 --> 01:03:29.065
<v Speaker 1>added your usernames.

01:03:29.145 --> 01:03:31.225
<v Speaker 1>You can set usernames. You can set Kubernetes

01:03:31.225 --> 01:03:33.945
<v Speaker 1>groups, Kubernetes users. So there are traits that

01:03:33.945 --> 01:03:36.025
<v Speaker 1>you can populate, and I'll show those traits

01:03:36.025 --> 01:03:37.785
<v Speaker 1>as part of the, login.

01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Now I I usually choose this one because

01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:46.500
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to be connected to my Google

01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:48.340
<v Speaker 1>account, and I don't have enter enter passwords.

01:03:51.234 --> 01:03:52.595
<v Speaker 1>And then we we have the set of

01:03:52.595 --> 01:03:54.675
<v Speaker 1>nodes available as we were talking before about

01:03:54.675 --> 01:03:56.675
<v Speaker 1>those labeling. So there's different different ways you

01:03:56.675 --> 01:03:58.515
<v Speaker 1>can do it, but there this way, you

01:03:58.515 --> 01:04:00.355
<v Speaker 1>have, you know, an ID.

01:04:00.755 --> 01:04:02.195
<v Speaker 1>You can also do dynamic.

01:04:03.635 --> 01:04:05.315
<v Speaker 1>Now in this case, I also have one

01:04:05.315 --> 01:04:05.955
<v Speaker 1>where

01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:10.510
<v Speaker 1>I've configured this to require Duo.

01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:12.910
<v Speaker 1>So this requires me to,

01:04:13.790 --> 01:04:14.910
<v Speaker 1>do a second factor.

01:04:23.964 --> 01:04:25.005
<v Speaker 1>Where's my duo?

01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:32.350
<v Speaker 1>So I have to approve it.

01:04:36.030 --> 01:04:37.470
<v Speaker 1>And the first time you come in, like,

01:04:37.470 --> 01:04:39.390
<v Speaker 1>you came at the Rawkode ID, it would

01:04:39.390 --> 01:04:41.310
<v Speaker 1>push you to go sign that up,

01:04:41.550 --> 01:04:43.790
<v Speaker 1>to make it a second factor. So every

01:04:43.790 --> 01:04:46.430
<v Speaker 1>different every user would have a different

01:04:46.105 --> 01:04:48.025
<v Speaker 1>second factor to confirm.

01:04:49.145 --> 01:04:51.065
<v Speaker 1>Now in terms of the applications,

01:04:51.145 --> 01:04:52.825
<v Speaker 1>because I have I have two configured, I

01:04:52.825 --> 01:04:55.145
<v Speaker 1>have a just a Hacker News, which forwards

01:04:55.145 --> 01:04:57.945
<v Speaker 1>directly to Hacker News, but it's using our,

01:04:57.945 --> 01:04:59.785
<v Speaker 1>you know, our certificate. As you mentioned, having

01:04:59.785 --> 01:05:01.170
<v Speaker 1>something in front of it, know, if it

01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:03.250
<v Speaker 1>was an HTTP or an insecure setting, you

01:05:03.250 --> 01:05:04.770
<v Speaker 1>could do that. And then you're you are

01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:06.610
<v Speaker 1>using a secure connection.

01:05:07.329 --> 01:05:09.490
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise, you know, in this case, I'm running

01:05:09.569 --> 01:05:10.690
<v Speaker 1>an Elastic,

01:05:11.490 --> 01:05:12.050
<v Speaker 1>service

01:05:13.404 --> 01:05:14.045
<v Speaker 1>behind

01:05:14.204 --> 01:05:17.404
<v Speaker 1>that my my machines that's not publicly available,

01:05:17.404 --> 01:05:19.244
<v Speaker 1>and then you then you can connect to

01:05:19.244 --> 01:05:20.045
<v Speaker 1>it directly.

01:05:21.565 --> 01:05:23.484
<v Speaker 1>So this is running just like with the

01:05:23.484 --> 01:05:24.445
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes,

01:05:24.525 --> 01:05:27.790
<v Speaker 1>there's another app service running that uses an

01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:29.870
<v Speaker 1>app token and registers itself.

01:05:30.349 --> 01:05:32.430
<v Speaker 1>You can also put labeling on these to

01:05:32.430 --> 01:05:34.750
<v Speaker 1>say, well, not everyone can access this. I'm

01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:37.070
<v Speaker 1>gonna label this service, and only in your

01:05:37.070 --> 01:05:37.710
<v Speaker 1>role,

01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:39.950
<v Speaker 1>could you have access to that particular service.

01:05:43.035 --> 01:05:43.915
<v Speaker 0>Pretty cool.

01:05:44.075 --> 01:05:46.475
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Now in terms of the Kubernetes, and

01:05:46.475 --> 01:05:47.994
<v Speaker 1>I'll I'll because we were just in that,

01:05:47.994 --> 01:05:49.195
<v Speaker 1>I want to get to it. So this

01:05:49.195 --> 01:05:51.275
<v Speaker 1>is the type of configuration you usually have

01:05:51.275 --> 01:05:51.915
<v Speaker 1>where,

01:05:52.075 --> 01:05:53.755
<v Speaker 1>you know, you have a particular group come

01:05:53.755 --> 01:05:56.180
<v Speaker 1>in. In this case, I'm using external, so

01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:58.019
<v Speaker 1>I can use the meta tags from my

01:05:58.019 --> 01:05:59.859
<v Speaker 1>SSO to populate it,

01:06:00.339 --> 01:06:02.019
<v Speaker 1>and then labeling. Now in terms of your

01:06:02.019 --> 01:06:04.180
<v Speaker 1>individual user, you can put the same you

01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:06.180
<v Speaker 1>can put their groups in there as well.

01:06:08.259 --> 01:06:10.099
<v Speaker 1>So here, I went ahead and and logged

01:06:10.099 --> 01:06:10.660
<v Speaker 1>in locally.

01:06:13.484 --> 01:06:15.805
<v Speaker 1>Let me clear that because it's gonna be

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:16.365
<v Speaker 1>a little confusing.

01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:30.380
<v Speaker 1>So this user maps to that dev role.

01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:31.740
<v Speaker 1>And when I see the status, I can

01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:32.860
<v Speaker 1>see my Kubernetes.

01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:35.260
<v Speaker 1>I can see what cluster I'm in, what

01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:36.140
<v Speaker 1>groups do I have,

01:06:39.914 --> 01:06:41.035
<v Speaker 1>and then my

01:06:41.755 --> 01:06:43.675
<v Speaker 1>you know, I I can look at,

01:06:44.075 --> 01:06:45.515
<v Speaker 1>you know, namespace,

01:06:46.154 --> 01:06:49.355
<v Speaker 1>because that that particular group has that permission,

01:06:49.755 --> 01:06:52.154
<v Speaker 1>but I I do not have

01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:55.860
<v Speaker 1>exact permission.

01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:02.340
<v Speaker 0>I

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:05.460
<v Speaker 1>think it just denied it.

01:07:06.525 --> 01:07:08.685
<v Speaker 1>But, essentially, that's a way of, you know,

01:07:08.685 --> 01:07:10.605
<v Speaker 1>giving people default access,

01:07:10.685 --> 01:07:13.244
<v Speaker 1>like logging and watching as opposed to, you

01:07:13.244 --> 01:07:15.885
<v Speaker 1>know, just giving them system masters or, you

01:07:15.885 --> 01:07:17.964
<v Speaker 1>know you know, a lot more privilege than

01:07:17.964 --> 01:07:20.190
<v Speaker 1>they probably need. So that's typically how we

01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:22.350
<v Speaker 1>recommend setting it up. And then this user

01:07:22.350 --> 01:07:22.910
<v Speaker 1>can

01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:26.030
<v Speaker 1>they can request other roles that have that

01:07:26.030 --> 01:07:28.750
<v Speaker 1>kind of other namespace or other exact access.

01:07:30.510 --> 01:07:32.975
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So this YAML is just configuring all

01:07:32.975 --> 01:07:34.575
<v Speaker 0>of the RBAC for me on the Kubernetes

01:07:34.575 --> 01:07:36.575
<v Speaker 0>side. Yeah. And it and this is what

01:07:36.575 --> 01:07:38.495
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned before about the max connections,

01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:40.495
<v Speaker 1>and you can say whether or not someone

01:07:40.495 --> 01:07:41.695
<v Speaker 1>can port forward.

01:07:42.335 --> 01:07:43.935
<v Speaker 1>So in this case, if I look at

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.800
<v Speaker 1>you know, my these are the nodes that

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:47.880
<v Speaker 1>are available. And because it has that tiered

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:49.480
<v Speaker 1>equal dev labeling,

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:52.200
<v Speaker 1>that's restricting what nodes I've accessed just like

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:54.040
<v Speaker 1>if I wanted to restrict well, they can't

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:55.400
<v Speaker 1>see that elastic link,

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:56.840
<v Speaker 1>I I can do it through that.

01:07:57.755 --> 01:07:59.995
<v Speaker 1>And then in this case, I do have

01:07:59.995 --> 01:08:02.555
<v Speaker 1>NGX server running here, so someone can

01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:20.550
<v Speaker 1>So I'm essentially saying I wanna open up

01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:22.470
<v Speaker 1>an SSH connection. I don't want it to

01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:23.429
<v Speaker 1>be interactive,

01:08:23.670 --> 01:08:25.830
<v Speaker 1>but I wanna forward I want my local

01:08:25.830 --> 01:08:27.990
<v Speaker 1>port eighty eighty to forward to their local

01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:29.874
<v Speaker 1>host 80 on that machine.

01:08:35.074 --> 01:08:36.515
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm seeing the web server on

01:08:36.515 --> 01:08:38.354
<v Speaker 1>that on that machine running locally.

01:08:38.675 --> 01:08:40.194
<v Speaker 1>But that is something you can turn off.

01:08:40.194 --> 01:08:41.875
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to give them access because

01:08:41.875 --> 01:08:42.995
<v Speaker 1>it's great to be able to do that,

01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:44.710
<v Speaker 1>but you don't always wanna give someone that

01:08:44.710 --> 01:08:47.349
<v Speaker 1>open access to beyond that node.

01:08:48.389 --> 01:08:49.189
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:08:49.989 --> 01:08:52.149
<v Speaker 1>Now another thing we mentioned was about, you

01:08:52.149 --> 01:08:53.670
<v Speaker 1>know, I said about PAM.

01:08:53.670 --> 01:08:55.954
<v Speaker 1>So each of these environments, and this is

01:08:55.954 --> 01:08:57.635
<v Speaker 1>also I'll I'll show you example of that

01:08:57.635 --> 01:08:59.154
<v Speaker 1>BPF we were talking about.

01:09:00.194 --> 01:09:02.114
<v Speaker 1>This environment has that this machine has that

01:09:02.114 --> 01:09:02.914
<v Speaker 1>enabled.

01:09:07.234 --> 01:09:08.594
<v Speaker 1>So every command I'm doing

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:12.920
<v Speaker 1>is being logged here, the session command,

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:15.800
<v Speaker 1>which includes the arguments,

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:17.240
<v Speaker 1>you know, the path.

01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:19.640
<v Speaker 1>And this is available in the OSS version.

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:22.040
<v Speaker 1>It's not Pacific Enterprise. So any anyone can

01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:23.400
<v Speaker 1>install that and the PAM

01:09:24.045 --> 01:09:26.524
<v Speaker 1>as well as it's auto creating my user.

01:09:29.485 --> 01:09:30.845
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at if you look

01:09:30.845 --> 01:09:31.965
<v Speaker 1>at the Teleport

01:09:32.045 --> 01:09:33.085
<v Speaker 1>configuration,

01:09:33.805 --> 01:09:35.645
<v Speaker 1>I have PAM enabled, and I say go

01:09:35.645 --> 01:09:36.525
<v Speaker 1>to this service name.

01:09:42.110 --> 01:09:43.870
<v Speaker 1>And I'm saying where to where to get

01:09:44.189 --> 01:09:46.189
<v Speaker 1>what what to execute when this PAM

01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:47.070
<v Speaker 1>loaded.

01:09:51.324 --> 01:09:54.044
<v Speaker 1>And so this enters into this environment.

01:09:54.204 --> 01:09:55.804
<v Speaker 1>It will check to see if the user

01:09:55.804 --> 01:09:57.965
<v Speaker 1>exists or not. If they don't exist, it

01:09:57.965 --> 01:10:01.405
<v Speaker 1>it automatically creates it, including some headers like

01:10:01.405 --> 01:10:03.324
<v Speaker 1>you wanna create a home, things like that.

01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:06.200
<v Speaker 1>And then I have some additional checking here

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:08.520
<v Speaker 1>where this is actually adding them. It's looking

01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:10.920
<v Speaker 1>in their Teleport role that come in and

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:12.680
<v Speaker 1>says, okay. Based on their role,

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.080
<v Speaker 1>add them or or don't add them to

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:16.520
<v Speaker 1>the SIS admin group to give them that

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:18.835
<v Speaker 1>pseudo rights. So that's something something you could

01:10:18.835 --> 01:10:19.955
<v Speaker 1>do as well as have those kind of

01:10:19.955 --> 01:10:21.315
<v Speaker 1>scripting built in.

01:10:21.715 --> 01:10:22.435
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

01:10:24.835 --> 01:10:26.995
<v Speaker 1>But, yeah, this this is so and then

01:10:26.995 --> 01:10:28.995
<v Speaker 1>all all of these things you're seeing here,

01:10:28.995 --> 01:10:31.075
<v Speaker 1>that is being fed, you know, in real

01:10:31.075 --> 01:10:33.680
<v Speaker 1>time into my Elastic service. So That's part

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:35.360
<v Speaker 1>of part of why I usually have that

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:35.920
<v Speaker 1>running.

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:37.680
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna it's gonna look ugly because I

01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:39.120
<v Speaker 1>haven't made it pretty yet, but, you know,

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:41.120
<v Speaker 1>all that data is coming in. So every

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:42.960
<v Speaker 1>log entry is going in.

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:44.880
<v Speaker 0>Is that something you have to build custom

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:47.680
<v Speaker 0>or does Teleport support various syncs for for

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:50.085
<v Speaker 0>that stuff like that? Well, it there's

01:10:50.645 --> 01:10:51.765
<v Speaker 1>it writes to

01:10:52.405 --> 01:10:54.965
<v Speaker 1>you can have it two ways. One is

01:10:55.285 --> 01:10:57.445
<v Speaker 1>it can write to the directory files on

01:10:57.445 --> 01:10:59.045
<v Speaker 1>your on your auth service

01:10:59.365 --> 01:11:02.085
<v Speaker 1>as well as writing to, like, DynamoDB.

01:11:02.245 --> 01:11:03.605
<v Speaker 1>You can have it do both too.

01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:05.850
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a log aggregator that

01:11:05.850 --> 01:11:08.090
<v Speaker 1>you all you don't like, yeah, DynamoDB is

01:11:08.090 --> 01:11:10.090
<v Speaker 1>great, but I don't wanna write a Lambda.

01:11:10.730 --> 01:11:12.970
<v Speaker 1>You could just have a file a log

01:11:12.970 --> 01:11:15.290
<v Speaker 1>aggregator running locally. I'm using Filebeat.

01:11:15.850 --> 01:11:18.250
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Okay. Pretty, yeah, pretty simple configuration.

01:11:20.205 --> 01:11:21.245
<v Speaker 1>And, essentially,

01:11:22.125 --> 01:11:23.885
<v Speaker 1>you know, you just you just look for

01:11:23.885 --> 01:11:27.085
<v Speaker 1>the log files. They're JSON formatted as you

01:11:27.085 --> 01:11:27.805
<v Speaker 1>saw here,

01:11:29.165 --> 01:11:30.285
<v Speaker 1>and you just pass that through,

01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:33.150
<v Speaker 1>you know, to Elastic and Kibana.

01:11:33.150 --> 01:11:34.350
<v Speaker 1>The only part I didn't do a lot

01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:36.510
<v Speaker 1>of security again, so that's why why I

01:11:36.510 --> 01:11:39.150
<v Speaker 1>wanna hide it behind this and not necessarily,

01:11:39.150 --> 01:11:40.670
<v Speaker 1>you know, have all all all that good

01:11:40.670 --> 01:11:42.910
<v Speaker 1>stuff. Can you just show the add application

01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:44.590
<v Speaker 0>dialogue? I mean, how easy is it to

01:11:44.590 --> 01:11:46.190
<v Speaker 0>add new applications? Okay.

01:11:50.855 --> 01:11:51.894
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.

01:11:52.534 --> 01:11:53.415
<v Speaker 1>I'll just do it.

01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:01.989
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Two.

01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:08.390
<v Speaker 1>We'll just point back to itself.

01:12:12.655 --> 01:12:15.455
<v Speaker 1>So this, I would, you know, just run

01:12:15.455 --> 01:12:17.215
<v Speaker 1>run on a particular machine.

01:12:17.775 --> 01:12:19.135
<v Speaker 1>And one second. I'll

01:12:20.335 --> 01:12:21.775
<v Speaker 1>I have a machine here I can use.

01:13:14.675 --> 01:13:15.954
<v Speaker 1>Sorry. I was

01:13:16.355 --> 01:13:17.715
<v Speaker 1>doing nerd stuff by myself.

01:13:21.670 --> 01:13:23.430
<v Speaker 0>So I've seen when you were doing that

01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:25.670
<v Speaker 0>that add application dialogue, there was the automatic

01:13:25.670 --> 01:13:27.750
<v Speaker 0>which has some sort of curl scripted version

01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:29.909
<v Speaker 0>of doing this and there was manual.

01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:31.030
<v Speaker 0>So What's that?

01:13:33.155 --> 01:13:35.075
<v Speaker 0>When you run that application, this was the

01:13:35.075 --> 01:13:37.315
<v Speaker 0>automatic way. This this curl command, there was

01:13:37.315 --> 01:13:40.035
<v Speaker 0>also manual steps. What's actually happening to proxy

01:13:40.035 --> 01:13:42.594
<v Speaker 0>one of these applications? Is it doing something

01:13:43.715 --> 01:13:46.195
<v Speaker 0>on a host? Like Yeah. I mean, it's

01:13:46.195 --> 01:13:47.795
<v Speaker 1>it's acting as

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:50.280
<v Speaker 1>a a proxy for it.

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:54.600
<v Speaker 1>Essentially, this is running as a separate just

01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:56.920
<v Speaker 1>like the SSH service, it's running as a

01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:58.039
<v Speaker 1>separate agent.

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:01.960
<v Speaker 1>And then it's it's able to then from

01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:03.000
<v Speaker 1>this particular node,

01:14:03.615 --> 01:14:05.295
<v Speaker 1>it's this is where you would get the

01:14:05.295 --> 01:14:07.695
<v Speaker 1>access. You know, it's doing the DNS connection

01:14:07.695 --> 01:14:09.695
<v Speaker 1>to that to that service.

01:14:11.775 --> 01:14:14.255
<v Speaker 0>And does that work differently for Kubernetes services?

01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:17.430
<v Speaker 1>Is it It's just it's just actually the

01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:18.389
<v Speaker 1>same concept.

01:14:18.710 --> 01:14:20.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean, the I'd say the biggest difference

01:14:20.710 --> 01:14:21.349
<v Speaker 1>is

01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:23.829
<v Speaker 1>when we're running inside of,

01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:26.469
<v Speaker 1>you know, Kubernetes,

01:14:26.710 --> 01:14:27.510
<v Speaker 1>we're

01:14:27.670 --> 01:14:29.190
<v Speaker 1>you know, when Teleport

01:14:29.190 --> 01:14:29.909
<v Speaker 1>is

01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.950
<v Speaker 1>impersonating

01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:31.590
<v Speaker 1>a

01:14:32.034 --> 01:14:32.914
<v Speaker 1>user

01:14:32.914 --> 01:14:33.714
<v Speaker 1>or group

01:14:34.275 --> 01:14:35.874
<v Speaker 1>within Kubernetes,

01:14:36.195 --> 01:14:37.874
<v Speaker 1>it's just the difference in

01:14:38.275 --> 01:14:41.155
<v Speaker 1>for the app access, it's actually connecting out

01:14:41.155 --> 01:14:43.715
<v Speaker 1>to another application. So we're not running inside

01:14:43.715 --> 01:14:44.434
<v Speaker 1>that application,

01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:47.900
<v Speaker 1>but we're we're a lot we're essentially providing

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:49.260
<v Speaker 1>the forwarding to it.

01:14:49.739 --> 01:14:52.780
<v Speaker 1>We do also send in a j JWS

01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:55.180
<v Speaker 1>token, a JSON web token, so that can

01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:57.420
<v Speaker 1>be used for automatic authentication.

01:14:58.540 --> 01:14:59.020
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:15:02.475 --> 01:15:04.235
<v Speaker 1>Let's see. I think

01:15:09.995 --> 01:15:12.075
<v Speaker 1>sorry. I didn't I didn't clear this environment

01:15:12.235 --> 01:15:12.795
<v Speaker 1>previously.

01:15:43.309 --> 01:15:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Sorry. I thought that was a different environment.

01:15:45.630 --> 01:15:46.590
<v Speaker 1>Sorry about that.

01:15:47.630 --> 01:15:49.149
<v Speaker 1>So now I've added that,

01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:51.229
<v Speaker 1>and we can see that has shown up.

01:15:51.949 --> 01:15:54.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm just pointing back at myself, but it's

01:15:54.030 --> 01:15:56.094
<v Speaker 1>not really loud. But yeah.

01:15:56.495 --> 01:15:57.775
<v Speaker 1>And if we look at what it did

01:15:57.935 --> 01:15:59.055
<v Speaker 1>let's let's see what

01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:13.510
<v Speaker 1>that added that app service here. It added

01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:15.670
<v Speaker 1>the auth token, the CA pin. We talked

01:16:15.670 --> 01:16:16.710
<v Speaker 1>about that before.

01:16:17.190 --> 01:16:18.710
<v Speaker 1>It's opened up a connection to the auth

01:16:18.710 --> 01:16:19.430
<v Speaker 1>server,

01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:21.510
<v Speaker 1>and let's make that a little more friendly.

01:16:26.324 --> 01:16:28.005
<v Speaker 0>So another way I could do this is

01:16:28.005 --> 01:16:30.005
<v Speaker 0>just by modifying my Teleport.YAML

01:16:30.005 --> 01:16:31.844
<v Speaker 0>and filling that apps array at the bottom

01:16:31.844 --> 01:16:33.925
<v Speaker 0>with whatever I wanted to proxy. Right? Yeah.

01:16:33.925 --> 01:16:35.844
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Okay. I'd say the big the biggest

01:16:35.844 --> 01:16:37.844
<v Speaker 1>difference why you'd wanna run that in different

01:16:37.844 --> 01:16:39.445
<v Speaker 1>locations is, again,

01:16:39.970 --> 01:16:41.890
<v Speaker 1>you know, who has access to what? Where

01:16:41.890 --> 01:16:44.610
<v Speaker 1>is it accessing? Because not every node has

01:16:44.610 --> 01:16:46.850
<v Speaker 1>access to the same set of services. You

01:16:46.850 --> 01:16:47.890
<v Speaker 1>know, as you said before, there may be

01:16:47.890 --> 01:16:50.610
<v Speaker 1>something you wanna expose from a specific machine.

01:16:50.610 --> 01:16:52.290
<v Speaker 1>So you would you would you would,

01:16:52.690 --> 01:16:53.810
<v Speaker 1>add add that in.

01:16:55.245 --> 01:16:57.324
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Thanks. Very cool.

01:16:58.765 --> 01:17:00.285
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Sorry sorry I didn't have that up

01:17:00.285 --> 01:17:01.485
<v Speaker 1>and running already.

01:17:03.965 --> 01:17:05.725
<v Speaker 0>I brought a broken Kubernetes cluster to the

01:17:05.725 --> 01:17:06.365
<v Speaker 0>party. So

01:17:07.085 --> 01:17:07.405
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:10.960
<v Speaker 0>Is there anything else you you'd like to

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.639
<v Speaker 0>show us before we wrap up? Oh, I

01:17:12.639 --> 01:17:13.840
<v Speaker 1>keep going back to this. This is a

01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:15.199
<v Speaker 1>bad I

01:17:17.679 --> 01:17:20.400
<v Speaker 1>mean, essentially, you know, the the other

01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:24.000
<v Speaker 1>part was in terms of our our cloud

01:17:24.115 --> 01:17:25.074
<v Speaker 1>interaction,

01:17:25.395 --> 01:17:27.155
<v Speaker 1>and, essentially, it's the same

01:17:29.075 --> 01:17:31.155
<v Speaker 1>very similar environment. In this case, I've got

01:17:31.235 --> 01:17:33.395
<v Speaker 1>I've already got a cloud deployed here.

01:17:33.635 --> 01:17:35.075
<v Speaker 1>I configure with off zero.

01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:41.980
<v Speaker 0>So with the cloud product, like, because it's

01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:44.060
<v Speaker 0>using Auth0, that can connect to, like, my

01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:46.060
<v Speaker 0>GitHub and Google authentication and all these other

01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:48.700
<v Speaker 0>things. Yeah. It And it's the same version.

01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:50.220
<v Speaker 1>It's five five o o.

01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:52.620
<v Speaker 1>You know, we're it's we it is a,

01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:54.614
<v Speaker 1>you know, software service,

01:17:54.775 --> 01:17:56.934
<v Speaker 1>but we're maintaining the same version. I'd say

01:17:56.934 --> 01:17:59.175
<v Speaker 1>the the one of the minor differences is

01:17:59.175 --> 01:18:02.454
<v Speaker 1>that we we use reverse tunneling by default

01:18:02.534 --> 01:18:03.814
<v Speaker 1>for your SSH.

01:18:03.815 --> 01:18:05.655
<v Speaker 1>So instead of exposing

01:18:05.655 --> 01:18:07.335
<v Speaker 1>a port as you saw, like the thirty

01:18:07.335 --> 01:18:09.260
<v Speaker 1>twenty two, it would always be a reverse

01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:11.020
<v Speaker 1>tunnel. That way, we don't have to worry

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:12.380
<v Speaker 1>about you opening

01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:14.460
<v Speaker 1>to your network or v p you know,

01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:15.980
<v Speaker 1>VPC, any of those kind of complications.

01:18:21.365 --> 01:18:22.965
<v Speaker 1>And just like before, I'm I'm in this

01:18:22.965 --> 01:18:23.765
<v Speaker 1>environment,

01:18:27.845 --> 01:18:29.765
<v Speaker 1>and I I can open up

01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:37.180
<v Speaker 1>Open up connections. Again, I use I use

01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:39.100
<v Speaker 1>the PAM configuration, so it automatically created my

01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:40.380
<v Speaker 1>user if it wasn't there.

01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:42.060
<v Speaker 1>So a lot a lot of people find

01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:43.740
<v Speaker 1>that very useful. Yep. So they don't have

01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:45.820
<v Speaker 1>to worry about creating users or or changing

01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:46.460
<v Speaker 1>their permissions.

01:18:47.655 --> 01:18:49.735
<v Speaker 1>But, yeah, we're we're just we're just, starting

01:18:49.735 --> 01:18:51.334
<v Speaker 1>to bring clients on the cloud.

01:18:51.815 --> 01:18:53.815
<v Speaker 1>And part of it is, you know, as,

01:18:53.815 --> 01:18:55.094
<v Speaker 1>you know, we've seen, we we think this

01:18:55.094 --> 01:18:57.094
<v Speaker 1>is a lot faster way to get things

01:18:57.094 --> 01:18:57.974
<v Speaker 1>up and going,

01:18:59.255 --> 01:19:00.770
<v Speaker 1>and it makes, you know again, you can

01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:02.850
<v Speaker 1>use those add server buttons, the add application

01:19:02.850 --> 01:19:04.530
<v Speaker 1>buttons, and it makes it makes it a

01:19:04.530 --> 01:19:06.530
<v Speaker 1>lot faster, you know, from your environment to

01:19:06.530 --> 01:19:08.690
<v Speaker 1>do those as opposed to having to install

01:19:08.850 --> 01:19:10.370
<v Speaker 1>the proxy and the auth.

01:19:10.690 --> 01:19:12.290
<v Speaker 1>We're we're just gonna maintain that for you.

01:19:13.545 --> 01:19:15.625
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Very cool. K.

01:19:17.145 --> 01:19:18.425
<v Speaker 0>So I I mean,

01:19:19.864 --> 01:19:20.425
<v Speaker 0>I

01:19:20.665 --> 01:19:22.185
<v Speaker 0>think I've just been impressed so many times

01:19:22.185 --> 01:19:24.265
<v Speaker 0>now. Like, there's a lot of really cool

01:19:24.265 --> 01:19:26.185
<v Speaker 0>features. I'm I'm struggling in my head to

01:19:26.185 --> 01:19:27.545
<v Speaker 0>think why I wouldn't want to be running

01:19:27.545 --> 01:19:29.530
<v Speaker 0>a Teleport in my cluster now or even

01:19:29.530 --> 01:19:30.969
<v Speaker 0>any of my infrastructure

01:19:31.050 --> 01:19:33.850
<v Speaker 0>with the security benefits and the all the

01:19:33.850 --> 01:19:36.570
<v Speaker 0>authentication and rules and groups and stuff. Like,

01:19:36.570 --> 01:19:39.449
<v Speaker 0>it's a pretty solid setup. Great. Yeah. No.

01:19:39.449 --> 01:19:42.090
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that view and, Tom, I I

01:19:42.090 --> 01:19:43.675
<v Speaker 1>think there then there's, you know, you have

01:19:43.675 --> 01:19:45.355
<v Speaker 1>the developers that wanna use it because they're

01:19:45.355 --> 01:19:47.755
<v Speaker 1>gonna be moving through environments, deploying things.

01:19:48.395 --> 01:19:50.235
<v Speaker 1>You might have service users that you want

01:19:50.235 --> 01:19:54.075
<v Speaker 1>to migrate migrate various resources or access them,

01:19:55.355 --> 01:19:57.420
<v Speaker 1>and then, you know, tracking activity. Like, I

01:19:57.420 --> 01:19:59.820
<v Speaker 1>mean, auditors usually love us because what did

01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:01.020
<v Speaker 1>you do in that machine? What did you

01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:02.060
<v Speaker 1>do in that Kubernetes?

01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:04.940
<v Speaker 1>You know, when when were you logging in?

01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Why did you have 10 sessions open? So

01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:09.580
<v Speaker 1>all of those things really, really help. But

01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:11.875
<v Speaker 1>as you see, it's, you know, you can

01:20:11.875 --> 01:20:13.395
<v Speaker 1>do one or two commands and get a

01:20:13.395 --> 01:20:14.915
<v Speaker 1>get a SSH node available,

01:20:15.955 --> 01:20:18.115
<v Speaker 1>and that's that can be really helpful, especially

01:20:18.115 --> 01:20:20.195
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a, you know, production outage

01:20:20.675 --> 01:20:22.195
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You know, being able to get that

01:20:22.195 --> 01:20:23.155
<v Speaker 1>access but securely.

01:20:24.679 --> 01:20:26.920
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Awesome. Well, thank you for joining me

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:28.760
<v Speaker 0>today and walking me through that and the

01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:30.600
<v Speaker 0>demo at the end was definitely appreciated as

01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:32.360
<v Speaker 0>well. Was good to see that running in

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:34.600
<v Speaker 0>the Kubernetes context and how that works with

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:37.560
<v Speaker 0>restricting the access to namespaces and exact permissions.

01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:39.125
<v Speaker 0>Like, there's just lots lots to love about

01:20:39.125 --> 01:20:40.485
