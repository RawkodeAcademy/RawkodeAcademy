00:02:26.735 --> 00:02:29.935
<v Speaker 0>Hello. Welcome to today's episode of Rawkode live.

00:02:29.935 --> 00:02:32.629
<v Speaker 0>This is the clustered series. A show in

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:33.110
<v Speaker 0>which

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.310
<v Speaker 0>me and a friend and guests will do

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.430
<v Speaker 0>our best to fix broken Kubernetes clusters. The

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.590
<v Speaker 0>catch is they are broken by members of

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.190
<v Speaker 0>the Kubernetes community

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.390
<v Speaker 0>and weird, wild, wonderful, and scary ways.

00:02:47.064 --> 00:02:48.825
<v Speaker 0>Now, before we can begin

00:02:48.825 --> 00:02:49.545
<v Speaker 0>today,

00:02:49.864 --> 00:02:52.105
<v Speaker 0>I've got a little bit of housekeeping. First,

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:54.424
<v Speaker 0>please subscribe and click the bell on YouTube

00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:56.584
<v Speaker 0>so you get alerts and notifications for more

00:02:56.584 --> 00:02:58.665
<v Speaker 0>episodes of Clustered and the other cloud native

00:02:58.665 --> 00:02:59.784
<v Speaker 0>content that I am producing.

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.730
<v Speaker 0>Also, if you are Discordian

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 0>inclined and like to chat, we always have

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.129
<v Speaker 0>an active community of people chatting about cloud

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:08.810
<v Speaker 0>native Kubernetes and a whole bunch of other

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.370
<v Speaker 0>stuff. Come and join us. And finally,

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.129
<v Speaker 0>I need to thank and want to thank

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:14.730
<v Speaker 0>my employer Equinix Medal.

00:03:15.275 --> 00:03:17.355
<v Speaker 0>They provide the time and resources for me

00:03:17.355 --> 00:03:18.795
<v Speaker 0>to invest in this show

00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:21.115
<v Speaker 0>and hopefully produce learning materials so that we

00:03:21.115 --> 00:03:22.715
<v Speaker 0>can all learn together. If you wanna check

00:03:22.715 --> 00:03:24.235
<v Speaker 0>out Equinix Medal, you can use the code

00:03:24.235 --> 00:03:26.395
<v Speaker 0>to Rawkode live. It will get you $50

00:03:26.395 --> 00:03:28.715
<v Speaker 0>in credit, which is around one hundred hours

00:03:28.795 --> 00:03:30.395
<v Speaker 0>of compute. So enjoy.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.739
<v Speaker 0>Let's see if I remember how to make

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.140
<v Speaker 0>that disappear. Hey. There we go. Alright. Now

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.980
<v Speaker 0>today, I am joined by.

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.380
<v Speaker 0>Hey, Duffy. How's it going?

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.525
<v Speaker 1>Quite well. Quite well. It's going great. I'm

00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:45.805
<v Speaker 1>looking forward to this one. This will be

00:03:45.805 --> 00:03:47.485
<v Speaker 1>super fun. Great to see such an awesome

00:03:47.485 --> 00:03:50.045
<v Speaker 1>audience. Good to see you, Sam and Rich.

00:03:50.045 --> 00:03:52.045
<v Speaker 1>I think Sam might be giggling glee in

00:03:52.045 --> 00:03:53.565
<v Speaker 1>the background, but I'm not sure.

00:03:54.765 --> 00:03:57.340
<v Speaker 0>Yes. Definitely. We've got loads of comments coming

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.459
<v Speaker 0>in. I'll get a few more of those

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.060
<v Speaker 0>on while we chat. Do you wanna just

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.140
<v Speaker 0>give us the quick TLDR on Duffy, who

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.500
<v Speaker 0>you are, what you're up to, and then

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.380
<v Speaker 0>we'll get started.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.739
<v Speaker 1>Sure. I'm a I'm a CNCF ambassador. I

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.420
<v Speaker 1>was actually

00:04:08.715 --> 00:04:10.875
<v Speaker 1>pulled in as a CNCF ambassador last year

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:12.635
<v Speaker 1>after applying for quite a while, and I'm

00:04:12.635 --> 00:04:14.795
<v Speaker 1>I'm super excited about being here and helping

00:04:15.035 --> 00:04:17.595
<v Speaker 1>kinda get the word out for Kubernetes technologies,

00:04:17.595 --> 00:04:19.595
<v Speaker 1>cloud native technologies, that sort of stuff. In

00:04:19.595 --> 00:04:22.794
<v Speaker 1>the past, I've worked for companies like and

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.280
<v Speaker 1>and and really helped a number of of

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.120
<v Speaker 1>folks just kind of learn about things through

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.520
<v Speaker 1>things like TGIK and stuff like that. It

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.240
<v Speaker 1>was like

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.400
<v Speaker 1>it it was such a blast, and I'm

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm really looking forward to doing more of

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.120
<v Speaker 1>it. So I'm really glad to be here.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.135
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for having me on. Oh, no.

00:04:37.135 --> 00:04:40.095
<v Speaker 0>It's definitely my pleasure. You're a font of

00:04:40.095 --> 00:04:41.695
<v Speaker 0>knowledge when it comes to all of this

00:04:41.695 --> 00:04:44.895
<v Speaker 0>stuff and you've been not only just helping

00:04:44.895 --> 00:04:47.215
<v Speaker 0>me in in private for DMs whenever I

00:04:47.215 --> 00:04:48.815
<v Speaker 0>get stuck on stuff, but also you come

00:04:48.815 --> 00:04:50.495
<v Speaker 0>on and, you know, join the comments and

00:04:50.495 --> 00:04:51.910
<v Speaker 0>help us all out during the episode. So

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.750
<v Speaker 0>I'm I'm soaked for today's episode.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:55.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.150
<v Speaker 0>Let's I think we just need to dive

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.990
<v Speaker 0>right in. Our first cluster is in fact,

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.550
<v Speaker 0>we have a comment from Siam already. So,

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.264
<v Speaker 0>Siam. Siam is the first breaker cluster 11.

00:05:06.745 --> 00:05:09.065
<v Speaker 0>So we're gonna pop the screen share on.

00:05:09.065 --> 00:05:11.944
<v Speaker 0>We're gonna use my my I think it's

00:05:11.944 --> 00:05:14.664
<v Speaker 0>my favorite tool for doing this, but teleport,

00:05:14.664 --> 00:05:16.264
<v Speaker 0>which just gives us the ability to share

00:05:16.264 --> 00:05:16.985
<v Speaker 0>a session

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.580
<v Speaker 0>and pair on this in real time while

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.419
<v Speaker 0>showing and sharing it with people that are

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:22.060
<v Speaker 1>watching.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.860
<v Speaker 0>So Duffy Yeah. Yeah. Do you Oh my

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.380
<v Speaker 1>goodness. Do you have it opened?

00:05:31.264 --> 00:05:32.865
<v Speaker 0>I can't believe I I don't know if

00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:33.985
<v Speaker 0>you have this word in The US. Do

00:05:33.985 --> 00:05:34.865
<v Speaker 0>you have to do you know what a

00:05:34.865 --> 00:05:35.745
<v Speaker 0>is?

00:05:35.745 --> 00:05:37.505
<v Speaker 0>Is that a Scottish word maybe?

00:05:38.465 --> 00:05:40.705
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure. Okay. What this is? Like

00:05:40.705 --> 00:05:41.505
<v Speaker 0>a tag. Alright.

00:05:43.345 --> 00:05:45.985
<v Speaker 0>Siam is definitely is really pretty.

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:50.419
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that was done with, like

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.060
<v Speaker 1>is that under bash, I see? I'm not

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.699
<v Speaker 1>curious. Anyway, never mind. Alright. So Siam has

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:57.139
<v Speaker 0>broken our first cluster,

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.979
<v Speaker 0>and we're we're gonna do our best to

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:00.419
<v Speaker 0>fix it. How how do you wanna start?

00:06:00.875 --> 00:06:03.755
<v Speaker 0>What have you got? I'm gonna I'm gonna

00:06:03.755 --> 00:06:04.715
<v Speaker 1>link in.

00:06:05.595 --> 00:06:07.035
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. Let's confirm you can type it,

00:06:07.035 --> 00:06:07.755
<v Speaker 0>type it.

00:06:08.235 --> 00:06:10.075
<v Speaker 0>That's me. Let's see if we can see

00:06:10.075 --> 00:06:12.795
<v Speaker 0>you. I'm gonna do I'm connected and typing

00:06:12.795 --> 00:06:15.320
<v Speaker 1>in cluster 11. Do you probably click connect?

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.400
<v Speaker 0>Can you go to active sessions and join

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.440
<v Speaker 0>my session?

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.080
<v Speaker 1>Sure. So we should have covered this. That's

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.800
<v Speaker 0>my fault.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.320
<v Speaker 0>Oh, and Sam is there. So while you

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.360
<v Speaker 0>join that session, Sam has told us that

00:06:27.585 --> 00:06:29.585
<v Speaker 0>each node has something different. So I'm gonna

00:06:29.585 --> 00:06:30.625
<v Speaker 0>quickly just

00:06:30.944 --> 00:06:32.145
<v Speaker 0>share

00:06:32.145 --> 00:06:33.585
<v Speaker 0>that. What we got here?

00:06:34.944 --> 00:06:38.065
<v Speaker 1>Where do I see session? Subscribe to Rawkode.

00:06:39.185 --> 00:06:40.625
<v Speaker 0>So if you look at my screen here,

00:06:40.625 --> 00:06:41.985
<v Speaker 0>you'll see there's activity

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:44.400
<v Speaker 0>then on activity, there's active sessions.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.360
<v Speaker 1>I gotcha. Alright. Okay. Let's just see what

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.360
<v Speaker 0>these other two notes say. We got

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:55.360
<v Speaker 0>welcome Duffy. Nice.

00:06:56.255 --> 00:06:57.855
<v Speaker 0>And the last one,

00:07:00.014 --> 00:07:03.055
<v Speaker 0>Duffy rocks. Duffy does rock. Definitely. Is this

00:07:03.055 --> 00:07:05.775
<v Speaker 1>working? Do you see me saying hi? Yeah.

00:07:05.775 --> 00:07:07.215
<v Speaker 0>There's a there's a bug when you joined

00:07:07.215 --> 00:07:09.455
<v Speaker 0>that it means that I have to reload,

00:07:09.455 --> 00:07:10.975
<v Speaker 0>but I can see it. You're typing. We

00:07:10.975 --> 00:07:12.410
<v Speaker 0>are good. So

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.009
<v Speaker 0>you're some linking something.

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:20.490
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:07:27.194 --> 00:07:29.275
<v Speaker 0>Normally I just export it but it's nice

00:07:29.275 --> 00:07:30.955
<v Speaker 0>to see other ways of doing this.

00:07:34.555 --> 00:07:36.155
<v Speaker 1>Oh, we're already good. See there's already four

00:07:36.155 --> 00:07:37.595
<v Speaker 1>nodes. We're finished. Yeah.

00:07:40.715 --> 00:07:42.930
<v Speaker 0>As you were on this show that we

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:44.530
<v Speaker 0>are able to even run and get notes

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.210
<v Speaker 0>at the box. So, you know, thank you

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:46.770
<v Speaker 0>for

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:48.610
<v Speaker 0>taking that easy on us maybe as I

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:49.970
<v Speaker 0>am. Although we don't know what's in store,

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.250
<v Speaker 0>so I shouldn't I shouldn't cut my check

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:51.730
<v Speaker 0>engine.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:55.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh, it's not looking good for Rawk. They're

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:55.730
<v Speaker 1>not happy.

00:07:57.004 --> 00:07:58.285
<v Speaker 1>See if that's okay.

00:07:58.925 --> 00:08:00.444
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm looking right now what I'm

00:08:00.444 --> 00:08:01.965
<v Speaker 1>doing right now is I'm kinda, like, doing

00:08:01.965 --> 00:08:04.444
<v Speaker 1>a a look around just to see what

00:08:04.444 --> 00:08:06.445
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at and that kind of thing.

00:08:06.764 --> 00:08:08.685
<v Speaker 1>One of the things a lot about these

00:08:08.685 --> 00:08:10.444
<v Speaker 1>sessions that I think is super interesting is

00:08:10.444 --> 00:08:13.350
<v Speaker 1>that because we're using cluster API

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.069
<v Speaker 1>and cube ADM together, we can make a

00:08:16.069 --> 00:08:18.550
<v Speaker 1>bunch of assumptions about how things work. And

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:20.150
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to, like, talk about that for

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:21.750
<v Speaker 1>a minute because I remember, like, really being

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:22.790
<v Speaker 1>surprised by this.

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:25.190
<v Speaker 1>It is actually

00:08:25.875 --> 00:08:27.795
<v Speaker 1>real it would be really really

00:08:28.515 --> 00:08:29.955
<v Speaker 1>a fast fix

00:08:30.355 --> 00:08:33.395
<v Speaker 1>to do a thing like grab the the

00:08:33.395 --> 00:08:36.195
<v Speaker 1>cube ADM configuration from the config map inside

00:08:36.195 --> 00:08:37.075
<v Speaker 1>the cluster

00:08:37.395 --> 00:08:39.715
<v Speaker 1>and then leverage that to just reset all

00:08:39.715 --> 00:08:40.595
<v Speaker 1>the manifests.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.400
<v Speaker 1>So if what we were doing was, like,

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.280
<v Speaker 1>erasing the clock to get this cluster back

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:45.760
<v Speaker 1>up,

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.240
<v Speaker 1>that is exactly how it would approach this.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.920
<v Speaker 1>Right? I would jump into the I would

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.720
<v Speaker 1>I'd grab the the kubeadm configuration

00:08:53.025 --> 00:08:55.585
<v Speaker 1>from the cluster, and I would leverage that,

00:08:55.585 --> 00:08:57.825
<v Speaker 1>do Kube ATM reset, do Kube ATM and

00:08:57.825 --> 00:09:00.225
<v Speaker 1>hit, and just blow everything way back blow

00:09:00.225 --> 00:09:02.865
<v Speaker 1>everything back to a healthy space.

00:09:03.745 --> 00:09:05.345
<v Speaker 1>But we don't do that here. Right? Here,

00:09:05.345 --> 00:09:07.345
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to figure out how it broke.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.720
<v Speaker 1>So I kinda dig that actually.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.560
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Definitely. It's

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.560
<v Speaker 0>you know, I I I like I like

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.400
<v Speaker 0>to think that it's not just about fixing

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.400
<v Speaker 0>the clusters, but it's about really trying to

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.240
<v Speaker 0>dig in and see what went wrong and

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.760
<v Speaker 0>and understand

00:09:21.315 --> 00:09:23.555
<v Speaker 0>flags. Like, one of the really cool things

00:09:23.555 --> 00:09:25.475
<v Speaker 0>for me on this five episodes and those

00:09:25.475 --> 00:09:28.275
<v Speaker 0>six episodes is I've discovered flags on the

00:09:28.275 --> 00:09:30.115
<v Speaker 0>controllers. I had no idea that existed. And

00:09:30.115 --> 00:09:32.275
<v Speaker 0>just exploring the API and the configuration in

00:09:32.275 --> 00:09:34.035
<v Speaker 0>that way, I find super interesting.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:36.990
<v Speaker 0>It's just Very cool. And part fun, you

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.350
<v Speaker 0>know, definitely part fun.

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:40.990
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's talk about what you're typing right

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:42.350
<v Speaker 0>now. So we ran a get node, so

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:44.030
<v Speaker 0>we seem we had two unready and one

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.790
<v Speaker 0>looked like it possibly had a taint on

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.550
<v Speaker 0>it. We've ran a get pods. We're seeing

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:48.270
<v Speaker 0>that Rawkode is

00:09:49.675 --> 00:09:52.714
<v Speaker 0>pretty unhappy. I'm assuming possibly due to the

00:09:52.714 --> 00:09:53.915
<v Speaker 0>not ready nodes.

00:09:54.795 --> 00:09:56.315
<v Speaker 0>Then you're taking a look at the pods

00:09:56.315 --> 00:09:58.555
<v Speaker 0>in the default namespace and we can see

00:10:00.315 --> 00:10:02.315
<v Speaker 0>my my workload

00:10:02.199 --> 00:10:03.639
<v Speaker 0>appear to be working, but we've got a

00:10:03.639 --> 00:10:06.279
<v Speaker 0>couple of random workloads also setting there. And

00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:08.360
<v Speaker 0>then you've run a cry control p s

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.560
<v Speaker 0>as well. Yeah.

00:10:10.279 --> 00:10:11.959
<v Speaker 1>And then I was gonna make cry control

00:10:11.959 --> 00:10:13.480
<v Speaker 1>p s work real quick. So let me

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.240
<v Speaker 1>just pull up the thing for that. What

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:15.639
<v Speaker 0>should I do?

00:10:16.985 --> 00:10:18.185
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.

00:10:20.105 --> 00:10:22.425
<v Speaker 1>There's a thing that we did in

00:10:23.145 --> 00:10:24.985
<v Speaker 0>I swear I swear I know what I'm

00:10:24.985 --> 00:10:26.505
<v Speaker 0>doing. I've hit the wrong button.

00:10:28.745 --> 00:10:30.665
<v Speaker 1>There's a thing we did in kind, which

00:10:30.665 --> 00:10:31.465
<v Speaker 1>I think

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:33.850
<v Speaker 1>is super handy, and I wanted to share

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:34.810
<v Speaker 1>that with you.

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:44.730
<v Speaker 1>See if I paste in here.

00:10:46.725 --> 00:10:47.525
<v Speaker 1>Copy.

00:10:49.765 --> 00:10:50.485
<v Speaker 1>K.

00:10:52.405 --> 00:10:52.805
<v Speaker 1>K.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:05.980
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Sweet.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.540
<v Speaker 0>Rory McKeon is saying we should take off

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.540
<v Speaker 0>a nuclear cluster from orbit. It's on the

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.180
<v Speaker 0>way to be sure.

00:11:15.035 --> 00:11:17.275
<v Speaker 1>Exactly. But looking at would be, like, super

00:11:17.275 --> 00:11:19.435
<v Speaker 1>fast, but it wouldn't really be super educational.

00:11:19.595 --> 00:11:20.875
<v Speaker 1>So what's it what I'm doing now is

00:11:20.875 --> 00:11:22.315
<v Speaker 1>I'm setting a configuration

00:11:22.395 --> 00:11:24.635
<v Speaker 1>file in Etsy called c r I kettle

00:11:24.635 --> 00:11:25.515
<v Speaker 1>dot yaml.

00:11:25.675 --> 00:11:27.195
<v Speaker 1>And if you conf and if you populate

00:11:27.195 --> 00:11:29.040
<v Speaker 1>this, like, with with something that looks like

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.720
<v Speaker 1>this, runtime endpoint, and then you point it

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.160
<v Speaker 1>at the container d socket,

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.560
<v Speaker 1>then you can just use c r I

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.480
<v Speaker 1>kettle p s, c r kettle pods.

00:11:40.845 --> 00:11:42.524
<v Speaker 0>Could you I think there was also some

00:11:42.524 --> 00:11:44.125
<v Speaker 0>news this week as well, wasn't there? I

00:11:44.125 --> 00:11:45.085
<v Speaker 0>think that

00:11:45.245 --> 00:11:47.725
<v Speaker 0>NerdControl was donated to the container d and

00:11:47.725 --> 00:11:49.245
<v Speaker 0>cloud data foundation project.

00:11:50.605 --> 00:11:52.445
<v Speaker 1>It is. Yeah. It has been brought into

00:11:52.445 --> 00:11:55.005
<v Speaker 1>the project, but I think CI kettle is

00:11:55.005 --> 00:11:57.140
<v Speaker 1>is not going anyway. Right? C r kettle

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.460
<v Speaker 1>is more like around kind of the implementation

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.140
<v Speaker 1>of what the container runtime

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.300
<v Speaker 1>for cube looks like. NerdKettle's

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.620
<v Speaker 1>project is actually even cooler by a curious

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:08.820
<v Speaker 1>Akahirsuda. And what he's doing is he's writing

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.795
<v Speaker 1>a effectively, like, an abstraction that makes it

00:12:11.795 --> 00:12:14.115
<v Speaker 1>look and feel and work like Docker. Because,

00:12:14.115 --> 00:12:15.315
<v Speaker 1>like, I don't know if you've ever tried

00:12:15.315 --> 00:12:18.115
<v Speaker 1>to use container d directly to, like,

00:12:18.915 --> 00:12:21.635
<v Speaker 1>interact with Docker produce. Like, can you start

00:12:21.635 --> 00:12:22.195
<v Speaker 1>a container,

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.740
<v Speaker 1>pull a container, mount volume, exec? There are

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.020
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of those things that we would

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:29.180
<v Speaker 1>normally use in troubleshooting that exist in c

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:30.060
<v Speaker 1>r x kettle.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:33.180
<v Speaker 1>But doing those things in CTR is is

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.740
<v Speaker 1>definitely a cognitive load to, like, get that

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.180
<v Speaker 1>to work. And NerdKettle

00:12:37.385 --> 00:12:39.785
<v Speaker 1>looks to offset that because with NerdKettle, could

00:12:39.785 --> 00:12:40.985
<v Speaker 1>just use NerdKettle

00:12:41.065 --> 00:12:42.585
<v Speaker 1>like you would Docker.

00:12:42.745 --> 00:12:45.464
<v Speaker 1>But instead of going to the Docker obstruction,

00:12:45.464 --> 00:12:47.945
<v Speaker 1>you're going directly to container D. It's pretty

00:12:47.945 --> 00:12:48.745
<v Speaker 1>cool. Nice.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.200
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So let's see if your workload is

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.480
<v Speaker 1>working. Can you you know, you wanna try

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.320
<v Speaker 1>doing a proxy and seeing if your

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.320
<v Speaker 1>if your website is open?

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually kinda curious if if Sion broke

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:02.440
<v Speaker 1>that first.

00:13:03.514 --> 00:13:05.834
<v Speaker 0>Let's see. We can do a port forward.

00:13:05.834 --> 00:13:08.795
<v Speaker 0>Plus we have a new sample workload now.

00:13:08.875 --> 00:13:12.154
<v Speaker 0>No longer just a boring old WordPress system.

00:13:13.595 --> 00:13:15.514
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I wanna hear more about this.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.320
<v Speaker 0>I can't remember what port I'm running on,

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.440
<v Speaker 0>but we're gonna find out if it's port

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.880
<v Speaker 0>80. I think I would have done port

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.360
<v Speaker 0>80.

00:13:23.399 --> 00:13:24.519
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a port forward to the

00:13:24.519 --> 00:13:25.880
<v Speaker 1>control plane? Because right now you're running on

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:26.519
<v Speaker 1>the control.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.079
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I should know better. Okay. Let me

00:13:29.079 --> 00:13:29.720
<v Speaker 0>do that from here.

00:13:31.865 --> 00:13:34.185
<v Speaker 0>This is cluster zero 11.

00:13:34.825 --> 00:13:36.105
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna export.

00:13:36.745 --> 00:13:38.585
<v Speaker 0>Make sure I can run get pods.

00:13:40.904 --> 00:13:41.625
<v Speaker 0>There we go. Okay.

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:47.670
<v Speaker 0>And I've had eighty eighty on that previous

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:49.110
<v Speaker 0>one, so I'm gonna do it again.

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.950
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

00:14:00.115 --> 00:14:00.835
<v Speaker 1>Hello?

00:14:01.635 --> 00:14:02.835
<v Speaker 0>Maybe not working?

00:14:03.315 --> 00:14:05.394
<v Speaker 0>We're not getting a connection reset on the

00:14:05.394 --> 00:14:07.075
<v Speaker 0>port forward side, which makes me think I

00:14:07.075 --> 00:14:08.355
<v Speaker 0>do have the right port.

00:14:08.595 --> 00:14:09.714
<v Speaker 0>I think my application

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:12.770
<v Speaker 0>Ah,

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:15.250
<v Speaker 0>let me zoom in. Oh, my.

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:18.370
<v Speaker 1>Alright. We have do it.

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:21.330
<v Speaker 0>Yep. Alright. We have our first clue.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:23.730
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So there is something

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.105
<v Speaker 0>weird. So let me explain the sample workload

00:14:26.105 --> 00:14:27.545
<v Speaker 0>then. It is a

00:14:27.785 --> 00:14:30.985
<v Speaker 1>Okay. A very simple Rust based application that

00:14:31.465 --> 00:14:33.465
<v Speaker 0>prints a video on the screen of me,

00:14:34.185 --> 00:14:35.465
<v Speaker 0>but I wanted to make sure we had

00:14:35.465 --> 00:14:37.705
<v Speaker 0>some connectivity within the clusters. I added a

00:14:37.705 --> 00:14:40.460
<v Speaker 0>quotes feature that pulls in some quotes from

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.540
<v Speaker 0>people in the Kubernetes and cloud native community

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:43.900
<v Speaker 0>and puts them on the screen for us.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.660
<v Speaker 0>That look up to the database to grab

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:46.860
<v Speaker 0>a quote failing,

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.700
<v Speaker 0>which tells me that our database service is

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.420
<v Speaker 0>unhappy or potentially some networking issue within our

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:51.740
<v Speaker 0>cluster.

00:14:53.335 --> 00:14:55.175
<v Speaker 0>So we should try more Could it be

00:14:55.575 --> 00:14:57.495
<v Speaker 1>I mean, it it can't be DNS. Right?

00:14:57.495 --> 00:14:58.855
<v Speaker 1>Like, it's never DNS.

00:14:59.335 --> 00:15:01.175
<v Speaker 0>It's never DNS. No. I I don't know

00:15:01.175 --> 00:15:02.535
<v Speaker 0>why we have that saying that's all.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:06.960
<v Speaker 0>But we can see

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.200
<v Speaker 0>from our get pods that we ran there

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.280
<v Speaker 0>that, you know, the postgres DB that we're

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.360
<v Speaker 0>running in the same namespace does appear to

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.920
<v Speaker 0>be running and healthy. It's passing its probes.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.000
<v Speaker 0>So, I guess we should maybe take a

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.240
<v Speaker 0>look at the service before we dig into

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:20.960
<v Speaker 0>anything else.

00:15:22.264 --> 00:15:24.665
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you're you're good. I know. Or just

00:15:24.665 --> 00:15:26.105
<v Speaker 0>let you type away. Oh.

00:15:30.345 --> 00:15:31.625
<v Speaker 1>Take a look at cube system.

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:38.769
<v Speaker 1>Core DNS is

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:40.450
<v Speaker 1>terminating

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:42.290
<v Speaker 1>three days ago.

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:45.570
<v Speaker 1>Why would it be stuck in terminating? That's

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:46.370
<v Speaker 1>not a good sign.

00:15:48.545 --> 00:15:50.305
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's interesting.

00:15:50.305 --> 00:15:52.865
<v Speaker 0>But we do have two working copies of

00:15:52.865 --> 00:15:55.265
<v Speaker 0>code for DNS. That means it's not DNS,

00:15:55.265 --> 00:15:56.705
<v Speaker 0>by the way, just FYI.

00:15:58.705 --> 00:16:00.305
<v Speaker 0>That's maybe too bold a statement to make

00:16:00.305 --> 00:16:01.585
<v Speaker 0>this early on in the episode.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Fair.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.560
<v Speaker 0>Have we got too long terminating?

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:08.280
<v Speaker 0>Interesting.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.160
<v Speaker 0>The packet cloud controller manager seems to be

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.240
<v Speaker 0>dying three days as well.

00:16:17.535 --> 00:16:19.775
<v Speaker 0>Are you sourcing the completion? Yeah. There we

00:16:19.775 --> 00:16:20.255
<v Speaker 0>go.

00:16:22.415 --> 00:16:24.495
<v Speaker 1>Oh, rocket syntax.

00:16:25.215 --> 00:16:27.055
<v Speaker 0>Is that what it's called? The rocket syntax?

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.580
<v Speaker 1>That's the way I that's the way I

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:30.460
<v Speaker 1>learned about it.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.020
<v Speaker 0>So what's your hunch here? You're you've taken

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:38.540
<v Speaker 0>a look at the pods and cube system.

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.220
<v Speaker 0>You're now pulling out a conflict map. What

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:40.700
<v Speaker 0>are you thinking?

00:16:42.315 --> 00:16:44.555
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking that that somebody has messed with

00:16:44.555 --> 00:16:46.955
<v Speaker 1>the configuration of core DNS at least, and

00:16:46.955 --> 00:16:49.195
<v Speaker 1>it or and it might be because it's

00:16:49.195 --> 00:16:49.995
<v Speaker 1>terminating.

00:16:50.155 --> 00:16:53.195
<v Speaker 1>Terminating is super interesting. Like, that is terminating.

00:16:53.195 --> 00:16:54.395
<v Speaker 1>I wanna I wanna look at the events

00:16:54.395 --> 00:16:55.595
<v Speaker 1>for that and figure out, like, why it's

00:16:55.595 --> 00:16:57.515
<v Speaker 1>terminating, why it hasn't actually already been deleted.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.810
<v Speaker 1>So there might be also something happening with

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:01.970
<v Speaker 1>the controller manager not doing cleanup or something

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:03.490
<v Speaker 1>else funky happened in there.

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:06.130
<v Speaker 1>It looks like the controller manager has restarted

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:08.049
<v Speaker 1>a few times, and so there might be

00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:11.329
<v Speaker 1>something defined in that position. So my plan

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:13.285
<v Speaker 1>of attack is take a look at the

00:17:13.285 --> 00:17:14.724
<v Speaker 1>core DNS configuration,

00:17:14.724 --> 00:17:16.165
<v Speaker 1>see if we can figure out what's keeping

00:17:16.165 --> 00:17:17.125
<v Speaker 1>it from working.

00:17:19.045 --> 00:17:20.724
<v Speaker 1>And then I wanna go and look at

00:17:20.724 --> 00:17:23.445
<v Speaker 1>the manifest on the as a Kubernetes manifest

00:17:23.445 --> 00:17:24.165
<v Speaker 1>directory

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:27.460
<v Speaker 1>and check those for errors or weird stuff.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.100
<v Speaker 1>And then, you know, we'll go from there,

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.380
<v Speaker 1>see if we can get things working.

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:33.620
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. We got a comment from Jason just

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.860
<v Speaker 0>saying, you know, are all the nodes up,

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:37.220
<v Speaker 0>which we know two of them are unready

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.060
<v Speaker 0>from the get nodes command area. That probably

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.924
<v Speaker 0>would explain the the terminating?

00:17:41.565 --> 00:17:43.085
<v Speaker 0>I guess, if that be yeah. We can

00:17:43.085 --> 00:17:44.365
<v Speaker 0>maybe dig into that if that seems to

00:17:44.365 --> 00:17:46.524
<v Speaker 0>be the case and explain why that happened.

00:17:46.685 --> 00:17:49.485
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good point, actually. If they're

00:17:49.725 --> 00:17:51.725
<v Speaker 1>if the nodes aren't reachable, then, like, if

00:17:51.725 --> 00:17:53.645
<v Speaker 1>they've just kind of, like, gone away, then

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:56.630
<v Speaker 1>the pod will the Kubernetes will keep those

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:58.950
<v Speaker 1>things around almost indefinitely, which is always kind

00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:59.830
<v Speaker 1>of a surprise.

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:07.705
<v Speaker 0>One of the things I've noticed as we

00:18:07.705 --> 00:18:09.385
<v Speaker 0>do more of these episodes as well is

00:18:09.385 --> 00:18:12.025
<v Speaker 0>that age on our conflict maps and other

00:18:12.025 --> 00:18:14.185
<v Speaker 0>things is always very misleading because it's not

00:18:14.185 --> 00:18:15.865
<v Speaker 0>edit, but the actual

00:18:16.185 --> 00:18:18.265
<v Speaker 0>usually the creation timestamp.

00:18:19.385 --> 00:18:19.785
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:27.690
<v Speaker 0>Steve Wade says, hey, Duffy.

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:30.010
<v Speaker 0>Steve.

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:33.690
<v Speaker 0>I know you're trying to think and stuff

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:35.130
<v Speaker 0>here and I'm just gonna keep throwing comments

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:36.090
<v Speaker 0>at you, but

00:18:37.215 --> 00:18:40.174
<v Speaker 0>So we're looking at the config map for

00:18:40.174 --> 00:18:41.374
<v Speaker 0>core DNS.

00:18:41.855 --> 00:18:43.534
<v Speaker 0>Let's see what we've got up here.

00:18:44.335 --> 00:18:45.775
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I really should be getting a

00:18:45.775 --> 00:18:47.375
<v Speaker 0>bit more familiar with this though, but

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:52.470
<v Speaker 0>We do have health already Kubernetes.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Is there a way to go in

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:58.470
<v Speaker 0>Go

00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.669
<v Speaker 0>ahead.

00:19:00.309 --> 00:19:01.029
<v Speaker 0>I

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:02.470
<v Speaker 0>was just wondering, is there a way to

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:04.390
<v Speaker 0>know if this has been modified since the

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:04.790
<v Speaker 0>creation?

00:19:05.725 --> 00:19:06.524
<v Speaker 0>Is this

00:19:06.765 --> 00:19:09.725
<v Speaker 0>timestamp operation update here? Does this because this

00:19:09.725 --> 00:19:11.325
<v Speaker 0>is the same as our creation timestamp, can

00:19:11.325 --> 00:19:13.804
<v Speaker 0>we assume this hasn't been touched? Is that

00:19:13.804 --> 00:19:14.125
<v Speaker 0>correct?

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.580
<v Speaker 1>Creation if it's been just directly replaced, the

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:21.419
<v Speaker 1>creation time stamp would be different than the

00:19:21.419 --> 00:19:23.259
<v Speaker 1>creation time stamp of the cluster.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:24.539
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.140
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I'm, like, at a generation with

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:28.460
<v Speaker 0>conflict maps. Right? I don't see that here,

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:28.940
<v Speaker 0>though. Yeah.

00:19:30.535 --> 00:19:32.135
<v Speaker 1>Looks like it's three days old.

00:19:32.455 --> 00:19:34.055
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I And it looks like

00:19:36.535 --> 00:19:37.335
<v Speaker 1>so

00:19:37.575 --> 00:19:41.095
<v Speaker 1>03/2004.

00:19:41.095 --> 00:19:42.659
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It looks like unless unless it was

00:19:42.659 --> 00:19:44.340
<v Speaker 1>just directly replaced three days ago. This is

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.899
<v Speaker 1>probably not the thing I'm looking for. Yeah.

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.740
<v Speaker 0>But it's can I see it? Can I

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.019
<v Speaker 0>see it? It's not DNS?

00:19:51.539 --> 00:19:53.700
<v Speaker 1>Well, it's not this part of DNS.

00:19:55.705 --> 00:19:57.385
<v Speaker 1>That could be any number of other parts

00:19:57.385 --> 00:19:59.385
<v Speaker 1>of DNS. Yeah. This all looks fine. Okay.

00:19:59.385 --> 00:19:59.945
<v Speaker 1>So

00:20:00.585 --> 00:20:01.784
<v Speaker 1>so let's see.

00:20:04.024 --> 00:20:04.664
<v Speaker 1>Oh,

00:20:04.825 --> 00:20:06.024
<v Speaker 1>you mind if I end this all big

00:20:06.024 --> 00:20:08.664
<v Speaker 1>real quick? No. So anything that we need.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:11.300
<v Speaker 0>It's not big on a bunch of systems.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.700
<v Speaker 0>It will be bind utils, I believe.

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:20.980
<v Speaker 1>And dash utils. Right? I never remember. I

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.500
<v Speaker 0>always end up both trying it both ways.

00:20:23.085 --> 00:20:25.725
<v Speaker 0>Try no dash. Oh, bind nine dash utils.

00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:27.725
<v Speaker 0>There you go. Let's let's try to suggest

00:20:27.725 --> 00:20:28.684
<v Speaker 0>it to us there.

00:20:30.284 --> 00:20:32.524
<v Speaker 0>Bind nine dash util. Yeah.

00:20:32.845 --> 00:20:34.284
<v Speaker 0>The amount of times I've done apt install

00:20:34.284 --> 00:20:36.810
<v Speaker 0>deg, apt install dns utils, apt install dns

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:40.010
<v Speaker 0>utils, apt install bing utils, like I just

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:41.529
<v Speaker 0>I really should get better

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:43.610
<v Speaker 0>at remembering the package. So then you go

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:45.370
<v Speaker 0>to a fedora central system and it's all

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:45.930
<v Speaker 0>different again.

00:20:51.655 --> 00:20:53.255
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we're now gonna take a look

00:20:53.255 --> 00:20:54.775
<v Speaker 0>at the service. I think we're gonna describe

00:20:54.775 --> 00:20:56.375
<v Speaker 0>the postcard service to see if we actually

00:20:56.375 --> 00:20:57.255
<v Speaker 0>have any endpoints.

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.070
<v Speaker 1>DNS would probably still resolve,

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:02.470
<v Speaker 1>but

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:06.790
<v Speaker 0>What did DNS resolve if there were no

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:09.030
<v Speaker 0>endpoints? What would it resolve to?

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:11.670
<v Speaker 0>And I'm not sure.

00:21:13.934 --> 00:21:14.894
<v Speaker 1>Postgres.

00:21:15.375 --> 00:21:16.734
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I typed it wrong.

00:21:17.375 --> 00:21:19.215
<v Speaker 0>That's that new keyboard of yours.

00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:20.575
<v Speaker 1>It is.

00:21:25.054 --> 00:21:26.975
<v Speaker 1>This is what I mean by rendering. Oh,

00:21:26.975 --> 00:21:28.495
<v Speaker 1>here we go. Alright. One more sec.

00:21:29.269 --> 00:21:31.509
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't doing it. There it is. Yeah.

00:21:31.509 --> 00:21:32.949
<v Speaker 0>One extra r. There we Alright.

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:35.829
<v Speaker 0>Oh, it has endpoints. Is it?

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.949
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:21:37.429 --> 00:21:38.710
<v Speaker 1>I think I do think it's gonna be

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:40.710
<v Speaker 1>DNS. So what I was gonna do was

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.200
<v Speaker 1>If let's see if built in DNS is

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:03.759
<v Speaker 1>broken.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:07.679
<v Speaker 0>Sam

00:22:08.559 --> 00:22:10.480
<v Speaker 0>asks, who's eating popcorn?

00:22:10.559 --> 00:22:12.640
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna ask him that's rhetorical question and

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.120
<v Speaker 0>you're sitting there giggling away. Watch

00:22:16.525 --> 00:22:17.245
<v Speaker 0>we

00:22:18.285 --> 00:22:20.285
<v Speaker 0>know that Jason is giggling. Thanks, Jason. Thanks

00:22:20.285 --> 00:22:21.245
<v Speaker 0>for the support, mate.

00:22:24.605 --> 00:22:25.325
<v Speaker 0>What then?

00:22:26.205 --> 00:22:28.045
<v Speaker 0>Just Jason, the timbers laughing.

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:29.580
<v Speaker 0>That's all.

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:34.380
<v Speaker 1>Error from server pods bash is forbidden. Post

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.500
<v Speaker 1>service check. Eight eight eight check. Oh, nice.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.180
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Okay. So what what happened there? Okay.

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:44.300
<v Speaker 0>We've tried to run a bash image and

00:22:46.515 --> 00:22:47.235
<v Speaker 0>and

00:22:47.475 --> 00:22:49.154
<v Speaker 0>we couldn't create a resource. Ah,

00:22:49.475 --> 00:22:50.114
<v Speaker 0>nice.

00:22:52.195 --> 00:22:53.955
<v Speaker 1>Very nice. So this is gonna be an

00:22:53.955 --> 00:22:55.155
<v Speaker 1>a p this is gonna be an admission

00:22:55.155 --> 00:22:55.874
<v Speaker 1>control

00:22:56.434 --> 00:22:56.995
<v Speaker 1>thing.

00:22:57.930 --> 00:22:59.930
<v Speaker 0>So you're opening the manifest because you want

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:01.530
<v Speaker 0>to know if it's dynamic or if it's

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:03.690
<v Speaker 0>a static admission controller. Is that right?

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:07.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. I'm looking at the admission controller

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:10.810
<v Speaker 1>flags and also any other configuration in admission

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:13.055
<v Speaker 1>to see what's been turned on. Looks like

00:23:13.055 --> 00:23:15.215
<v Speaker 1>note our back is here, but there is

00:23:15.215 --> 00:23:17.615
<v Speaker 1>an admission control config

00:23:17.615 --> 00:23:21.455
<v Speaker 1>file, s e kubernetes demo admission dot JSON.

00:23:22.095 --> 00:23:23.375
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. We is

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.499
<v Speaker 1>let's see. Kubernetes.

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't see I don't see how this

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:31.820
<v Speaker 1>could mount.

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:38.620
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting. So I bet you it's just

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:40.380
<v Speaker 1>erroring out because it's not present.

00:23:41.075 --> 00:23:44.035
<v Speaker 1>Let's see Kubernetes demo admission control. Let's take

00:23:44.035 --> 00:23:46.195
<v Speaker 1>a look at it anyway. Yeah. Why not?

00:23:48.195 --> 00:23:49.794
<v Speaker 1>What has he done to us?

00:23:50.035 --> 00:23:50.915
<v Speaker 1>Can we find out?

00:24:10.675 --> 00:24:11.475
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:24:13.155 --> 00:24:15.795
<v Speaker 1>Here we're applying some certificates.

00:24:18.035 --> 00:24:20.435
<v Speaker 1>We have a service check eight eight eight

00:24:20.435 --> 00:24:21.235
<v Speaker 1>check image,

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.919
<v Speaker 1>which is probably gonna be a a thing

00:24:24.919 --> 00:24:26.519
<v Speaker 1>running inside of

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.039
<v Speaker 1>I mean, somehow, it's gonna have to resolve

00:24:30.039 --> 00:24:32.039
<v Speaker 1>this, but it doesn't it doesn't look like

00:24:32.039 --> 00:24:34.440
<v Speaker 1>it likely is. So a quick way to

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.675
<v Speaker 1>resolve this particular problem and move past it

00:24:36.675 --> 00:24:38.195
<v Speaker 1>would be for us just to remove this

00:24:38.195 --> 00:24:40.355
<v Speaker 1>admission controller because it wasn't part of our

00:24:40.355 --> 00:24:41.395
<v Speaker 1>original cluster.

00:24:41.635 --> 00:24:43.635
<v Speaker 0>So can I just clarify can

00:24:44.035 --> 00:24:45.635
<v Speaker 0>you explain something to me here? Okay. So

00:24:45.635 --> 00:24:48.515
<v Speaker 0>there was an admission controller JSON flag that

00:24:48.515 --> 00:24:50.755
<v Speaker 0>pointed to this JSON file, which points to

00:24:50.755 --> 00:24:52.970
<v Speaker 0>a kube config file with some parameters.

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:56.090
<v Speaker 0>Oh, my teleporter. Oh, there's a disconnect. Oh,

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:58.170
<v Speaker 0>yeah. I think it's just because you're oh,

00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:00.410
<v Speaker 0>you open then. I thought my teleporter has

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:02.809
<v Speaker 0>crashed, but we're good. Oh, no.

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:04.170
<v Speaker 1>But I'm

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:05.965
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to I wanted to look at

00:25:05.965 --> 00:25:08.765
<v Speaker 1>the the API server's configuration so we could

00:25:08.765 --> 00:25:10.605
<v Speaker 1>look at what's happening in here. Right? So

00:25:10.765 --> 00:25:12.525
<v Speaker 1>what I was pointing out before or what

00:25:12.525 --> 00:25:15.165
<v Speaker 1>I was curious was whether the the file

00:25:15.165 --> 00:25:18.059
<v Speaker 1>was actually mounted into the into the manifest

00:25:18.059 --> 00:25:20.300
<v Speaker 1>because remember the API server is gonna be

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.300
<v Speaker 1>running as a static pod. So all of

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:24.540
<v Speaker 1>the resources that that static pod needs have

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.460
<v Speaker 1>to be mounted in just like you'd mount

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:28.379
<v Speaker 1>anything else into a container.

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:30.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So because if we go up here

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:31.900
<v Speaker 1>to the admission line

00:25:32.385 --> 00:25:34.865
<v Speaker 1>where it says admission control config file,

00:25:35.905 --> 00:25:38.865
<v Speaker 1>this this line is pointing at that configuration

00:25:38.865 --> 00:25:40.625
<v Speaker 1>file, which kicks off the whole

00:25:41.025 --> 00:25:43.265
<v Speaker 1>set of things that allow the API server

00:25:43.265 --> 00:25:46.409
<v Speaker 1>to interact with that admission webhook and see

00:25:46.409 --> 00:25:48.409
<v Speaker 1>if it could get and and and see

00:25:48.409 --> 00:25:51.289
<v Speaker 1>if the image that we're pulling is allowed

00:25:51.289 --> 00:25:52.489
<v Speaker 1>or disallowed.

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:54.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what Siam put in the

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:56.730
<v Speaker 1>allow list or the denial list. It might

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:57.850
<v Speaker 1>still be in that demo

00:25:58.345 --> 00:26:00.105
<v Speaker 1>directory somewhere, and we'll look at that a

00:26:00.105 --> 00:26:01.705
<v Speaker 1>little bit more here in just a minute.

00:26:01.785 --> 00:26:03.465
<v Speaker 1>But I think for now, what I wanna

00:26:03.465 --> 00:26:07.225
<v Speaker 1>do is drop this line. Yeah. Agreed. And

00:26:09.545 --> 00:26:11.865
<v Speaker 1>then just down here on enable

00:26:11.865 --> 00:26:12.745
<v Speaker 1>admission

00:26:12.745 --> 00:26:13.305
<v Speaker 1>plugins.

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:16.830
<v Speaker 1>Uh-huh. Can you see the The image policy

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:18.029
<v Speaker 0>webhook on the end?

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:20.749
<v Speaker 0>And then That's the thing that tells it

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:23.070
<v Speaker 1>that's the it's like a two parter in

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:26.235
<v Speaker 1>this particular admission control plug in. Right? The

00:26:26.235 --> 00:26:28.555
<v Speaker 1>first part is to enable the image policy

00:26:28.555 --> 00:26:30.955
<v Speaker 1>webhook, which tells the API server we have

00:26:30.955 --> 00:26:32.555
<v Speaker 1>a thing that is just gonna do image

00:26:32.555 --> 00:26:34.394
<v Speaker 1>policy validation,

00:26:34.395 --> 00:26:36.635
<v Speaker 1>whether it's allowed or denied. And then the

00:26:36.635 --> 00:26:38.795
<v Speaker 1>configuration file tells it where to go find

00:26:38.795 --> 00:26:40.875
<v Speaker 1>that thing and how to ask it.

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:44.310
<v Speaker 1>It's that.

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:46.470
<v Speaker 1>I know. Do you know what node restriction

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:47.990
<v Speaker 1>does? This is so cool.

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:50.150
<v Speaker 1>It is really cool. Yeah. Go for it.

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:52.470
<v Speaker 0>Let's let's see here. What does it do?

00:26:54.485 --> 00:26:56.805
<v Speaker 1>What node restriction does is it

00:26:58.245 --> 00:26:59.365
<v Speaker 1>it's responsible for

00:27:01.365 --> 00:27:02.005
<v Speaker 1>so

00:27:02.485 --> 00:27:04.565
<v Speaker 1>when I first started playing with Kubernetes,

00:27:04.565 --> 00:27:06.245
<v Speaker 1>typically, what we what people would do is

00:27:06.245 --> 00:27:09.120
<v Speaker 1>they would, like, give every node, like, almost

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:12.080
<v Speaker 1>the same certificate. Right? The same identity certificate.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.320
<v Speaker 1>And all of the nodes are represented by

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.399
<v Speaker 1>a group called system nodes, and you would

00:27:16.399 --> 00:27:17.519
<v Speaker 1>apply permissions

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.575
<v Speaker 1>from to that system nodes object. That means

00:27:20.575 --> 00:27:22.975
<v Speaker 1>that any node in the cluster effectively was

00:27:22.975 --> 00:27:24.895
<v Speaker 1>like god mode. It could

00:27:25.215 --> 00:27:27.535
<v Speaker 1>read anything inside the cluster. It could do

00:27:27.535 --> 00:27:30.015
<v Speaker 1>anything with its own credential. It was effectively

00:27:30.015 --> 00:27:32.255
<v Speaker 1>unlimited. Right? As long so if you could

00:27:32.255 --> 00:27:35.540
<v Speaker 1>exploit the underlying node, you could easily take

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:38.020
<v Speaker 1>over the cluster because that credential that the

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.740
<v Speaker 1>node had, that was a high value credential.

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:43.140
<v Speaker 1>What node restriction does

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:44.419
<v Speaker 1>is it

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.620
<v Speaker 1>enforces that a node, as identified by its

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:48.740
<v Speaker 1>host

00:27:48.435 --> 00:27:50.915
<v Speaker 1>or by its by its node name

00:27:51.235 --> 00:27:53.475
<v Speaker 1>can only access those resources

00:27:53.475 --> 00:27:55.155
<v Speaker 1>that are attributed

00:27:55.155 --> 00:27:56.275
<v Speaker 1>to that node.

00:27:57.395 --> 00:27:58.675
<v Speaker 1>Right? So if you were to try and

00:27:58.675 --> 00:28:00.915
<v Speaker 1>do KubeKitle get secrets all in fact, we

00:28:01.075 --> 00:28:02.275
<v Speaker 1>let's just try this out real quick. It'll

00:28:02.275 --> 00:28:04.750
<v Speaker 1>be really cool. Get secrets

00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:08.030
<v Speaker 1>dash.

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Man.

00:28:16.125 --> 00:28:17.885
<v Speaker 1>Working on it. I'm gonna get it.

00:28:18.685 --> 00:28:19.804
<v Speaker 1>Apple a

00:28:21.325 --> 00:28:22.365
<v Speaker 1>dash dash

00:28:22.445 --> 00:28:23.325
<v Speaker 1>config.

00:28:27.769 --> 00:28:30.249
<v Speaker 1>This

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:36.729
<v Speaker 1>is node restriction.

00:28:36.809 --> 00:28:38.490
<v Speaker 1>This is what that admission plugin is doing.

00:28:40.275 --> 00:28:42.835
<v Speaker 1>Without that admission plugin, then all of the

00:28:42.835 --> 00:28:44.195
<v Speaker 1>secrets would have just flushed to the disc

00:28:44.275 --> 00:28:45.715
<v Speaker 1>would sort of flush to the screen.

00:28:46.435 --> 00:28:49.075
<v Speaker 1>Ah. Pretty cool. Yeah. That is cool. Okay.

00:28:49.075 --> 00:28:50.915
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's like a really nice view.

00:28:51.235 --> 00:28:51.715
<v Speaker 1>For a little while.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.930
<v Speaker 0>I've seen that at mission yeah. That mission

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:56.850
<v Speaker 0>controller on a couple of episodes now. I

00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:58.610
<v Speaker 0>wasn't sure if it was evil from one

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:00.130
<v Speaker 0>of the breakers or part of the setup,

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:01.490
<v Speaker 0>and I just kind of ignored it. So

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:02.930
<v Speaker 0>I'm glad you've taken the time to explain

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:03.410
<v Speaker 0>that.

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Definitely a good thing.

00:29:06.355 --> 00:29:08.035
<v Speaker 1>One of the other things but you can

00:29:08.035 --> 00:29:09.875
<v Speaker 1>do things like get nodes. You can do

00:29:09.875 --> 00:29:11.075
<v Speaker 1>things like other you can there are a

00:29:11.075 --> 00:29:12.595
<v Speaker 1>bunch of other, like, more generic

00:29:12.755 --> 00:29:14.595
<v Speaker 1>cluster wide commands that you can still do

00:29:14.595 --> 00:29:15.634
<v Speaker 1>with that credential.

00:29:15.875 --> 00:29:18.035
<v Speaker 1>So if you were a if you were

00:29:18.035 --> 00:29:18.434
<v Speaker 1>a

00:29:19.155 --> 00:29:21.039
<v Speaker 1>an attacker and you only had, like, a

00:29:21.039 --> 00:29:23.679
<v Speaker 1>user specific or namespace specific credential, this is

00:29:23.679 --> 00:29:26.159
<v Speaker 1>a way that you could escalate your privilege

00:29:26.159 --> 00:29:28.080
<v Speaker 1>to have a cluster wide

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.039
<v Speaker 1>read

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.985
<v Speaker 1>certificate if you took over the node. So

00:29:32.985 --> 00:29:35.625
<v Speaker 1>interesting stuff. Nice. Anyway, so

00:29:37.385 --> 00:29:39.465
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we've removed that from

00:29:39.705 --> 00:29:41.705
<v Speaker 0>our API server. Does does

00:29:42.105 --> 00:29:43.465
<v Speaker 0>that mean you should now be able to

00:29:43.465 --> 00:29:45.225
<v Speaker 0>run that batch image, and is that still

00:29:45.225 --> 00:29:46.665
<v Speaker 0>our our plan going forward?

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:50.070
<v Speaker 1>That's still my plan going forward. Okay.

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:53.030
<v Speaker 1>What?

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:56.309
<v Speaker 1>We go deeper.

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:59.110
<v Speaker 1>Disable pod, check for labels, validation errors. So

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:00.150
<v Speaker 1>I am has disabled

00:30:00.535 --> 00:30:03.335
<v Speaker 1>pod creation on your cluster. Rule, check for

00:30:03.335 --> 00:30:04.054
<v Speaker 1>labels.

00:30:04.695 --> 00:30:08.055
<v Speaker 1>Failed at pass. Metadata labels app. So that

00:30:08.055 --> 00:30:10.135
<v Speaker 1>means that we have

00:30:12.135 --> 00:30:12.935
<v Speaker 1>yes. PRD.

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:20.659
<v Speaker 1>Oh, nice. Oh, Sam.

00:30:24.659 --> 00:30:26.659
<v Speaker 0>What what what do you see? Oh, I

00:30:26.659 --> 00:30:28.500
<v Speaker 0>see chaos glitch. I would just like to

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:30.179
<v Speaker 1>I would just like to point these things

00:30:30.179 --> 00:30:30.500
<v Speaker 1>out.

00:30:31.995 --> 00:30:33.115
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Go for it.

00:30:35.115 --> 00:30:36.235
<v Speaker 1>Wow.

00:30:37.435 --> 00:30:38.795
<v Speaker 1>Oh, that's beautiful.

00:30:38.955 --> 00:30:40.475
<v Speaker 1>Look at it. Okay. So what I just

00:30:40.475 --> 00:30:42.875
<v Speaker 1>ran here was I did keep getting CRD,

00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:45.870
<v Speaker 1>which is because I know that it's not

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:48.429
<v Speaker 1>gonna be an admission anymore. Right? The admission

00:30:48.669 --> 00:30:51.549
<v Speaker 1>plug in pieces, we've effectively taken care of.

00:30:51.549 --> 00:30:53.309
<v Speaker 1>So anything else that's gonna eat our lunch

00:30:53.309 --> 00:30:55.710
<v Speaker 1>is gonna be deployed into inside the cluster,

00:30:56.365 --> 00:30:58.284
<v Speaker 1>And those things that are deployed inside the

00:30:58.284 --> 00:31:00.205
<v Speaker 1>cluster are almost always gonna have to be

00:31:00.205 --> 00:31:02.284
<v Speaker 1>registered with the cluster for them to work.

00:31:03.164 --> 00:31:04.765
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple of different ways that we

00:31:04.765 --> 00:31:07.404
<v Speaker 1>can see those things or that that Kubernetes

00:31:07.404 --> 00:31:08.845
<v Speaker 1>can be extended

00:31:08.845 --> 00:31:10.284
<v Speaker 1>to be able to support those things. Like,

00:31:10.284 --> 00:31:12.044
<v Speaker 1>one of them is custom resource definitions.

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Right? And

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:16.420
<v Speaker 1>and that's what I'm listing here is kubectl

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:19.300
<v Speaker 1>get cluster resource definitions. Let's me see, you

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:21.220
<v Speaker 1>know, what is the other stuff that is

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.540
<v Speaker 1>available inside of this cluster that I could

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:24.100
<v Speaker 1>use

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:26.420
<v Speaker 1>or that has been registered with the cluster?

00:31:26.995 --> 00:31:28.195
<v Speaker 1>And what we see

00:31:28.674 --> 00:31:30.995
<v Speaker 1>is a bunch of good stuff. Right? We

00:31:30.995 --> 00:31:34.034
<v Speaker 1>see a bunch of, like, custom resource definitions

00:31:34.034 --> 00:31:36.914
<v Speaker 1>that end in chaosmesh.org.

00:31:36.995 --> 00:31:39.715
<v Speaker 1>We see that Caverno is enabled, which is

00:31:39.715 --> 00:31:41.794
<v Speaker 1>probably the thing that is currently blocking us.

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:45.500
<v Speaker 1>And we but we also see that there

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.180
<v Speaker 1>has been some goosery.

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:50.060
<v Speaker 1>You know? I use that term goosery

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:53.420
<v Speaker 1>to describe what has hap stress chaos.

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.900
<v Speaker 1>That's probably the best one word thing ever,

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.475
<v Speaker 1>stress chaos. Stress chaos. Yes.

00:31:59.035 --> 00:32:00.715
<v Speaker 1>Also really good. Alright.

00:32:01.915 --> 00:32:02.555
<v Speaker 1>So

00:32:03.515 --> 00:32:04.475
<v Speaker 1>good old.

00:32:04.875 --> 00:32:06.155
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And this

00:32:08.315 --> 00:32:10.315
<v Speaker 1>so likely, he deployed

00:32:10.315 --> 00:32:12.260
<v Speaker 1>this into something. Right? So we have a

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:15.619
<v Speaker 1>couple of different namespaces here. We have Caverno.

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:19.619
<v Speaker 1>You get all get NS

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.340
<v Speaker 1>dash r. It's like get Dash

00:32:22.419 --> 00:32:22.740
<v Speaker 1>oh,

00:32:24.815 --> 00:32:26.654
<v Speaker 1>A Dash N.

00:32:27.055 --> 00:32:28.894
<v Speaker 0>Would you like me to do some typing?

00:32:30.415 --> 00:32:31.775
<v Speaker 1>And now the thing that's giving me is

00:32:31.775 --> 00:32:33.375
<v Speaker 1>the dashes. I gotta figure out how to

00:32:33.375 --> 00:32:34.015
<v Speaker 1>remap that.

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:39.050
<v Speaker 1>What?

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:41.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh.

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:43.450
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you did, like, get dash a instead

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:44.490
<v Speaker 0>of pods. I

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:48.410
<v Speaker 1>think it's dash all that I wanted.

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:50.890
<v Speaker 0>Well, no. Because you're specifying the namespace with

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:53.054
<v Speaker 0>dash and Kiverno. You've not set a resource.

00:32:53.054 --> 00:32:54.494
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming you want pods.

00:32:57.615 --> 00:32:59.534
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you wanted actually all. Okay.

00:33:02.095 --> 00:33:04.015
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So we have our service running.

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:07.419
<v Speaker 1>We have a deployment.

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:10.219
<v Speaker 1>How does convert will get

00:33:10.539 --> 00:33:11.659
<v Speaker 1>populated?

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:13.019
<v Speaker 1>Get all

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:13.899
<v Speaker 1>get

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:17.980
<v Speaker 1>API resources.

00:33:28.115 --> 00:33:30.914
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So we're gonna have cluster policies, which

00:33:30.914 --> 00:33:32.114
<v Speaker 1>are CPOLs.

00:33:32.274 --> 00:33:35.234
<v Speaker 0>Yep. We're gonna have cluster report change requests.

00:33:36.115 --> 00:33:38.850
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna have generate requests. I'm looking probably

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.450
<v Speaker 1>for CPauls.

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:41.009
<v Speaker 1>So

00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:43.249
<v Speaker 1>you can all get

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:45.169
<v Speaker 1>CPaul dash

00:33:54.505 --> 00:33:55.705
<v Speaker 1>We'll take a look at it.

00:33:56.985 --> 00:33:59.305
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I think that disabled port policy is

00:33:59.305 --> 00:34:00.745
<v Speaker 0>definitely something we wanna

00:34:01.705 --> 00:34:02.425
<v Speaker 0>take a look at.

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:06.129
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:34:07.169 --> 00:34:09.650
<v Speaker 1>What do we got here? We have

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:14.609
<v Speaker 1>background tool, rules match, resource kind for pods,

00:34:14.609 --> 00:34:15.570
<v Speaker 1>check for labels.

00:34:18.725 --> 00:34:21.045
<v Speaker 1>Validate data. The message is this.

00:34:21.605 --> 00:34:24.645
<v Speaker 1>Match resources. Damon sets deployments jobs, stateful sets.

00:34:24.645 --> 00:34:26.085
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I'm tempted to do a replica set

00:34:26.085 --> 00:34:27.364
<v Speaker 1>just to mess them up because it didn't

00:34:27.364 --> 00:34:28.165
<v Speaker 1>get caught.

00:34:28.645 --> 00:34:29.925
<v Speaker 1>And then

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:34.940
<v Speaker 1>disabled

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:36.300
<v Speaker 1>for that.

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:42.620
<v Speaker 1>Blocked cron jobs.

00:34:42.859 --> 00:34:44.859
<v Speaker 1>I think replica replica set was the only

00:34:44.859 --> 00:34:45.500
<v Speaker 1>one he forgot.

00:34:46.145 --> 00:34:47.105
<v Speaker 1>Looks like

00:34:47.505 --> 00:34:49.505
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I think But for our purposes

00:34:50.304 --> 00:34:50.945
<v Speaker 1>but

00:34:51.264 --> 00:34:52.784
<v Speaker 0>I was gonna say, I guess, we just

00:34:52.784 --> 00:34:55.585
<v Speaker 0>wanna delete this terrible policy.

00:34:55.585 --> 00:34:56.065
<v Speaker 1>Right?

00:34:57.185 --> 00:34:58.305
<v Speaker 1>That's what I wanna see.

00:35:00.549 --> 00:35:01.830
<v Speaker 1>Like, is there a way

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:04.630
<v Speaker 1>those match

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:09.670
<v Speaker 1>validation failure action. Probably something that we could

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:12.150
<v Speaker 1>edit to make it approve or something or

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.549
<v Speaker 1>ignore.

00:35:18.505 --> 00:35:18.905
<v Speaker 1>No.

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:29.380
<v Speaker 1>What's the subject again?

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:32.980
<v Speaker 0>It's a c poll cluster policy. Yeah.

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Hey.

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:39.460
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:35:43.735 --> 00:35:45.655
<v Speaker 1>I love when people actually do this. It's

00:35:45.655 --> 00:35:47.495
<v Speaker 1>not it's not everyone that does it today,

00:35:47.495 --> 00:35:48.775
<v Speaker 1>but it's really cool.

00:35:50.935 --> 00:35:53.815
<v Speaker 0>So the explain command allow us to get

00:35:53.815 --> 00:35:54.775
<v Speaker 0>the documentation

00:35:54.775 --> 00:35:58.109
<v Speaker 0>on the open API definition for the policy,

00:35:58.109 --> 00:36:00.670
<v Speaker 0>if I'm not mistaken. Is that close enough?

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:02.110
<v Speaker 1>Like,

00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:04.030
<v Speaker 1>you can't do it now. It didn't used

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:05.150
<v Speaker 1>to be that you could do it, but

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:06.510
<v Speaker 1>you can do it now, which is very

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:06.750
<v Speaker 1>cool.

00:36:09.245 --> 00:36:10.925
<v Speaker 0>So are you looking for a way to

00:36:10.925 --> 00:36:13.165
<v Speaker 0>allow this to fail rather than deleting it

00:36:13.165 --> 00:36:15.805
<v Speaker 0>just because you're being nice, or you wanna

00:36:15.805 --> 00:36:17.165
<v Speaker 0>be a bit more methodological?

00:36:17.245 --> 00:36:18.605
<v Speaker 0>Okay. There's that word I can never see

00:36:18.605 --> 00:36:19.485
<v Speaker 0>on this team.

00:36:20.445 --> 00:36:21.965
<v Speaker 1>Methodo methodological.

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:25.070
<v Speaker 1>It's a good word. It is a good

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:26.990
<v Speaker 0>word. I can tell you. Yeah.

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:28.590
<v Speaker 1>What I'm wondering is oh, I mean, let's

00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:30.190
<v Speaker 1>just we could try nuking it, but I

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:31.550
<v Speaker 1>was wondering if we just turn it into

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:32.990
<v Speaker 1>something that will just allow us to do

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:34.430
<v Speaker 1>all the things rather than deny us to

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:36.190
<v Speaker 1>do all the things, whether we could just

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:37.470
<v Speaker 1>leave it in place and keep going and

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:38.910
<v Speaker 1>till we can play with it later. But

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:40.484
<v Speaker 1>let's let's try and nuke again. Let's see

00:36:40.484 --> 00:36:41.125
<v Speaker 1>what happens.

00:36:41.444 --> 00:36:43.045
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. But there was only one policy. I

00:36:43.045 --> 00:36:44.805
<v Speaker 0>didn't see a policy to block the deletion

00:36:44.805 --> 00:36:46.405
<v Speaker 0>of a policy, which would be a nice

00:36:46.405 --> 00:36:47.765
<v Speaker 0>trick in itself. So

00:36:49.285 --> 00:36:51.765
<v Speaker 1>That would be admission. Or, I mean, I

00:36:51.765 --> 00:36:53.204
<v Speaker 1>guess you could use OPA or something.

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:56.490
<v Speaker 1>C all dash

00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:58.810
<v Speaker 0>I think it was called disable pod.

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:01.770
<v Speaker 0>Disable hyphen pod.

00:37:11.865 --> 00:37:13.625
<v Speaker 0>Oh, the sledgehammer approach.

00:37:17.305 --> 00:37:18.185
<v Speaker 1>Terminates.

00:37:18.185 --> 00:37:19.385
<v Speaker 0>It's my favorite technique.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.480
<v Speaker 0>And it's gone. Boom. Okay.

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.560
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Let's see if we can get in

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.120
<v Speaker 1>there.

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.520
<v Speaker 0>Ta da. Oh. Oh, I thought I thought

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:32.240
<v Speaker 0>it was that

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:33.200
<v Speaker 0>yeah.

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:34.400
<v Speaker 0>Oh. No.

00:37:36.815 --> 00:37:38.495
<v Speaker 1>No. That's probably okay. It's probably gonna just

00:37:38.495 --> 00:37:39.695
<v Speaker 0>take look at Maybe.

00:37:46.655 --> 00:37:48.095
<v Speaker 0>No. I think we've got a network in

00:37:48.095 --> 00:37:49.855
<v Speaker 0>issue. The bash image shouldn't take that long.

00:37:49.855 --> 00:37:50.095
<v Speaker 0>Right?

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:52.670
<v Speaker 1>Probably not.

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:54.829
<v Speaker 1>But we did see some other stuff, didn't

00:37:54.829 --> 00:37:56.670
<v Speaker 1>we? Like we saw the chaos thing. So

00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:57.630
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if we're

00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:00.349
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. There is the litmus kiosk deployed to

00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:02.030
<v Speaker 0>our cluster. We got two nodes in a

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:04.430
<v Speaker 0>not ready state, which I'm assuming could be

00:38:05.835 --> 00:38:08.075
<v Speaker 0>a side effect of this litmus stuff that's

00:38:08.075 --> 00:38:08.715
<v Speaker 0>running.

00:38:14.475 --> 00:38:16.955
<v Speaker 1>I know that the litmus stuff has labels.

00:38:17.595 --> 00:38:19.675
<v Speaker 1>I think that opt you in.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.839
<v Speaker 1>And what I'm wondering

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:27.680
<v Speaker 1>is whether

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:33.200
<v Speaker 1>failure to me. I don't see any labels

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.000
<v Speaker 1>there. No. I don't see anything. KLC.

00:38:37.825 --> 00:38:38.465
<v Speaker 1>No.

00:38:39.425 --> 00:38:41.105
<v Speaker 1>But not ready. Not ready. Not ready. That's

00:38:41.105 --> 00:38:42.225
<v Speaker 1>probably not a good thing.

00:38:43.745 --> 00:38:45.985
<v Speaker 0>So what what makes Kubernetes

00:38:45.985 --> 00:38:47.745
<v Speaker 0>return are not ready when you're doing the

00:38:47.745 --> 00:38:49.745
<v Speaker 0>get notes? What what does it consider a

00:38:49.745 --> 00:38:50.225
<v Speaker 0>ready note?

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:51.820
<v Speaker 0>Do you know?

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:55.420
<v Speaker 1>Usually, ready ready oh, what's that?

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:58.220
<v Speaker 1>So ready notes are really about

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:01.819
<v Speaker 1>the configuration of the cubelet. Right? So if

00:39:01.819 --> 00:39:03.180
<v Speaker 1>you this in the fact, you can even

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:05.420
<v Speaker 1>see to some degree, like, why why it's

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:07.315
<v Speaker 1>ready or not ready. So piddle

00:39:08.515 --> 00:39:09.955
<v Speaker 1>five node.

00:39:12.515 --> 00:39:13.635
<v Speaker 1>See worker

00:39:14.515 --> 00:39:15.395
<v Speaker 1>a

00:39:15.955 --> 00:39:16.435
<v Speaker 1>t.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:22.300
<v Speaker 1>So ready in this case,

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:24.220
<v Speaker 1>looks like requests.

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:28.140
<v Speaker 1>The method's nothing being used here.

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:32.140
<v Speaker 1>So this is a big part of ready

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:35.465
<v Speaker 1>right here. Right? Network unavailable, false. Memory pressure,

00:39:35.465 --> 00:39:36.185
<v Speaker 1>unknown.

00:39:36.585 --> 00:39:39.225
<v Speaker 1>Keyboard has stopped posting node status, which means

00:39:39.225 --> 00:39:40.825
<v Speaker 1>that this node has just kind of,

00:39:41.545 --> 00:39:43.705
<v Speaker 1>you know, withered off into the into into

00:39:43.705 --> 00:39:45.730
<v Speaker 1>the into the history books. It's not connect

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:48.050
<v Speaker 1>it's no longer reporting in. So we have

00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:49.490
<v Speaker 1>to go look at why that node's not

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:50.290
<v Speaker 1>reporting in.

00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:52.690
<v Speaker 1>Right? So in this case, ready means that.

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:54.770
<v Speaker 1>But ready could mean any of these things.

00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:56.610
<v Speaker 1>And with, like, some of the more recent

00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:57.730
<v Speaker 1>stuff in cube,

00:39:57.810 --> 00:39:59.890
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes now has the way or

00:40:00.395 --> 00:40:02.234
<v Speaker 1>or this is now extensible. You could have

00:40:02.234 --> 00:40:05.675
<v Speaker 1>things like, you know, node problem detector indicate

00:40:05.675 --> 00:40:07.275
<v Speaker 1>whether a node is ready or not ready

00:40:07.275 --> 00:40:09.435
<v Speaker 1>as well and kind of and and extend

00:40:09.435 --> 00:40:11.435
<v Speaker 1>that. But for the most part, if you

00:40:11.435 --> 00:40:13.835
<v Speaker 1>look at this condition status here, that's gonna

00:40:13.835 --> 00:40:15.675
<v Speaker 1>tell you what not ready means.

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:20.089
<v Speaker 1>So let's go jump into our other nodes

00:40:20.089 --> 00:40:22.010
<v Speaker 1>and see what we see. Do you wanna

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:23.849
<v Speaker 1>pop open a connect a connection, or shall

00:40:23.849 --> 00:40:25.609
<v Speaker 1>I? Yeah. You can do it. I'll just

00:40:25.609 --> 00:40:26.730
<v Speaker 0>join. It's all good.

00:40:27.849 --> 00:40:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:29.450
<v Speaker 1>Click it all.

00:40:30.345 --> 00:40:31.785
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna go to Target first.

00:40:33.225 --> 00:40:34.345
<v Speaker 1>Get notes.

00:40:35.945 --> 00:40:39.865
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna jump into 7694F.

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.440
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:44.560
<v Speaker 1>Servers

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.640
<v Speaker 1>7694F.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.600
<v Speaker 1>Subscribe to

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:56.240
<v Speaker 1>Rawkode.

00:40:57.494 --> 00:40:58.455
<v Speaker 1>Do you see that?

00:41:01.734 --> 00:41:03.175
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Thanks, Sam.

00:41:04.214 --> 00:41:05.095
<v Speaker 0>Appreciate the assist.

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:12.910
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So we done a system control status

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:14.030
<v Speaker 0>on the Kiplit.

00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:16.510
<v Speaker 0>It looks like it's loaded,

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:20.990
<v Speaker 0>but not running. That's what I'll be. That's

00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:22.670
<v Speaker 0>yeah. We can see it's an activating

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:24.750
<v Speaker 0>auto restart seven seconds. So

00:41:26.775 --> 00:41:27.655
<v Speaker 0>keep it.

00:41:27.895 --> 00:41:28.615
<v Speaker 0>Not happy.

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:41.080
<v Speaker 1>Exception.

00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:49.160
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Let me figure out the journal logs

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:49.480
<v Speaker 0>here.

00:41:55.214 --> 00:41:56.335
<v Speaker 0>Dash flu?

00:41:57.855 --> 00:41:58.575
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:41:58.815 --> 00:41:59.695
<v Speaker 0>Interesting.

00:42:01.855 --> 00:42:03.295
<v Speaker 1>What is going on here?

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:14.770
<v Speaker 0>So it looks like Object. Yeah. Words. The

00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:16.210
<v Speaker 0>Kubelet config

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:18.290
<v Speaker 0>object API version missing.

00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:18.690
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:42:20.715 --> 00:42:21.435
<v Speaker 1>K.

00:42:22.635 --> 00:42:25.195
<v Speaker 1>Wirelib kubelet config dot YAML. That's actually a

00:42:25.195 --> 00:42:25.995
<v Speaker 1>super handy error.

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:38.119
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. If only all other messages were itself,

00:42:38.119 --> 00:42:40.440
<v Speaker 0>what was that? Look at the typo.

00:42:40.599 --> 00:42:41.559
<v Speaker 0>Cheeky Siam.

00:42:58.255 --> 00:42:59.375
<v Speaker 0>Do you see it?

00:43:00.335 --> 00:43:02.175
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I'm trying to get over to it.

00:43:03.055 --> 00:43:04.175
<v Speaker 0>It's a I I.

00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:10.030
<v Speaker 1>What's a I I? Yeah. There you go.

00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:17.390
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. RP.

00:43:19.724 --> 00:43:21.484
<v Speaker 0>And while I'm in here, I already see

00:43:21.484 --> 00:43:23.325
<v Speaker 0>something that looks a bit mischievous, but our

00:43:23.325 --> 00:43:25.405
<v Speaker 0>client c a file five

00:43:25.405 --> 00:43:27.165
<v Speaker 0>lines down is c a two dot c

00:43:27.165 --> 00:43:28.845
<v Speaker 0>r t. I wonder if that's either been

00:43:28.845 --> 00:43:30.125
<v Speaker 0>renamed or

00:43:30.365 --> 00:43:31.964
<v Speaker 0>it was just thrown around them too in

00:43:31.964 --> 00:43:32.444
<v Speaker 0>there too.

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:36.560
<v Speaker 1>Confused. It is surprising. I think Kubernetes p

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:37.840
<v Speaker 1>k I c a two.

00:43:47.785 --> 00:43:50.105
<v Speaker 0>Not even leaving them. Look at that.

00:43:56.505 --> 00:43:58.425
<v Speaker 0>See, that's there. There we go. Yes,

00:44:00.825 --> 00:44:02.185
<v Speaker 0>I am. We got it.

00:44:13.869 --> 00:44:15.549
<v Speaker 0>You've dropped into recording mode.

00:44:18.145 --> 00:44:19.664
<v Speaker 1>That's how I roll. You know, I like

00:44:19.664 --> 00:44:20.145
<v Speaker 1>that.

00:44:23.825 --> 00:44:26.944
<v Speaker 1>1722076Of10.

00:44:26.944 --> 00:44:30.145
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's correct. For for k Q D

00:44:30.145 --> 00:44:30.464
<v Speaker 0>N S.

00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:34.049
<v Speaker 0>I have the address in green, then we

00:44:34.049 --> 00:44:34.609
<v Speaker 0>know.

00:44:37.089 --> 00:44:39.809
<v Speaker 1>Else looks pretty okay. This is actually one

00:44:39.809 --> 00:44:41.010
<v Speaker 1>of the things that always trips me out.

00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:43.730
<v Speaker 1>You see this line right here? Static PodPass?

00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:44.049
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:44:45.135 --> 00:44:47.455
<v Speaker 1>This means that with the cube ADM based

00:44:47.455 --> 00:44:48.255
<v Speaker 1>cluster,

00:44:50.415 --> 00:44:52.575
<v Speaker 1>static pods work on any node.

00:44:53.295 --> 00:44:54.495
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that interesting?

00:44:54.575 --> 00:44:56.175
<v Speaker 1>They should only have to work on the

00:44:56.175 --> 00:44:57.695
<v Speaker 1>control plane nodes. There was an issue open

00:44:57.695 --> 00:44:59.055
<v Speaker 1>for this, but never got really resolved.

00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:01.380
<v Speaker 0>I didn't know that. So on a worker

00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:03.140
<v Speaker 0>node, I could create that directory, add the

00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:05.060
<v Speaker 0>config and then just run whatever workloads I

00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:05.540
<v Speaker 0>want.

00:45:06.099 --> 00:45:06.980
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:09.700
<v Speaker 0>One of our friends and my current colleague,

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:11.700
<v Speaker 0>Dan Fennerin discovered that if you put the

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:13.540
<v Speaker 0>namespace into static manifest,

00:45:14.135 --> 00:45:16.535
<v Speaker 0>that namespace doesn't exist, it will still run

00:45:16.535 --> 00:45:18.934
<v Speaker 0>the pod and it's invisible to keep control

00:45:18.934 --> 00:45:21.015
<v Speaker 0>commands, which I think is ridiculous.

00:45:21.015 --> 00:45:23.815
<v Speaker 0>That should that shouldn't be a thing. And

00:45:24.694 --> 00:45:26.615
<v Speaker 1>and and and I have been up to

00:45:26.615 --> 00:45:27.974
<v Speaker 1>some pretty good onks that way.

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:30.089
<v Speaker 1>That is

00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:31.849
<v Speaker 1>keep it.

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:33.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:45:33.369 --> 00:45:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Looks happy.

00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:36.650
<v Speaker 0>But I'm just gonna jump over to our

00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:38.809
<v Speaker 0>under other tab and run our get nodes

00:45:38.809 --> 00:45:41.049
<v Speaker 0>and yeah. That that one is back and

00:45:41.049 --> 00:45:41.369
<v Speaker 0>happy.

00:45:43.185 --> 00:45:45.985
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Let's jump over to number PMC q

00:45:45.985 --> 00:45:47.425
<v Speaker 0>h. PMC

00:45:47.425 --> 00:45:49.345
<v Speaker 1>q H. I'm gonna start it and he'll

00:45:49.345 --> 00:45:51.105
<v Speaker 1>join or Yeah. Yeah. Go for it.

00:45:52.065 --> 00:45:52.465
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:58.300
<v Speaker 1>Welcome, Duffy.

00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:01.260
<v Speaker 1>I

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:04.700
<v Speaker 1>I feel welcome, Flanagan.

00:46:10.765 --> 00:46:13.645
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's see what we got here. It

00:46:13.645 --> 00:46:15.725
<v Speaker 0>does say not ready schedule and disabled, which

00:46:15.725 --> 00:46:17.805
<v Speaker 0>makes me think the Kubelet oh, no. It's

00:46:17.805 --> 00:46:18.925
<v Speaker 0>not gonna be okay because I can see

00:46:18.925 --> 00:46:20.445
<v Speaker 0>it restarting already. I thought we make an

00:46:20.445 --> 00:46:22.285
<v Speaker 0>okay Kubelet with something that should get on,

00:46:22.285 --> 00:46:25.565
<v Speaker 0>but not the case. We have another exception.

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay. It'll minus

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:32.900
<v Speaker 1>u.

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:33.780
<v Speaker 1>Keep it.

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:37.300
<v Speaker 1>The u is for unit, l is for

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:39.460
<v Speaker 1>wrap lines, f is for follow.

00:46:40.734 --> 00:46:43.135
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I tend to do Do remember? X

00:46:43.135 --> 00:46:44.494
<v Speaker 0>e dash u. I don't know why I

00:46:44.494 --> 00:46:46.175
<v Speaker 0>separate them though. I feel like I feel

00:46:46.175 --> 00:46:47.855
<v Speaker 0>really silly now that I didn't think of

00:46:47.855 --> 00:46:49.855
<v Speaker 0>that, so I I'm stealing this from you.

00:46:51.695 --> 00:46:53.214
<v Speaker 0>And I always used to do no pager

00:46:53.214 --> 00:46:54.655
<v Speaker 0>for the rap lines, so that dash l

00:46:54.655 --> 00:46:56.300
<v Speaker 0>is awesome. That's probably the best thing I've

00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:57.100
<v Speaker 0>learned today.

00:46:57.740 --> 00:46:59.100
<v Speaker 0>Well, that and the other thing you taught

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:01.340
<v Speaker 0>me with Chrome, which is I guess you

00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:03.180
<v Speaker 0>could Oh, yeah. The trick is self sign

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:05.100
<v Speaker 1>certs. This is unsafe. Good trick.

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:06.780
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'll let you read the logs and

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:09.325
<v Speaker 0>when I explain that. Like teleport as running

00:47:09.325 --> 00:47:11.325
<v Speaker 0>with self signed certificates and Chrome I just

00:47:11.325 --> 00:47:12.605
<v Speaker 0>assumed that let me do that because it

00:47:12.605 --> 00:47:14.205
<v Speaker 0>was trying to be secure and then Duffy

00:47:14.205 --> 00:47:15.885
<v Speaker 0>taught me that if I just type this

00:47:15.885 --> 00:47:17.565
<v Speaker 0>as unsafe.

00:47:17.565 --> 00:47:18.925
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. This is unsafe

00:47:18.925 --> 00:47:21.245
<v Speaker 0>into the browser. It loads it anyway.

00:47:21.965 --> 00:47:23.325
<v Speaker 0>It's a awesome little trick.

00:47:25.090 --> 00:47:26.610
<v Speaker 1>I think our problem.

00:47:28.210 --> 00:47:29.970
<v Speaker 0>Right here. Container d is not run. In

00:47:29.970 --> 00:47:31.410
<v Speaker 0>fact, no, the path to the socket is

00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:32.050
<v Speaker 0>wrong.

00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:34.210
<v Speaker 0>You see there's missing a k.

00:47:37.965 --> 00:47:39.965
<v Speaker 0>My face is almost covering it, but hopefully

00:47:39.965 --> 00:47:41.565
<v Speaker 0>people can see that. Yeah.

00:47:48.685 --> 00:47:50.205
<v Speaker 1>Where is that system?

00:48:09.275 --> 00:48:10.795
<v Speaker 0>I

00:48:14.315 --> 00:48:15.115
<v Speaker 0>don't

00:48:15.275 --> 00:48:16.635
<v Speaker 0>see system the

00:48:17.275 --> 00:48:20.395
<v Speaker 1>cubelet service d 10 cubic d m config.

00:48:21.730 --> 00:48:23.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Let's see. System.

00:48:26.130 --> 00:48:26.690
<v Speaker 1>System.

00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:29.570
<v Speaker 1>Kubelet.

00:48:37.675 --> 00:48:40.155
<v Speaker 1>Barlet, Kubit, Kubit config dot emo.

00:48:41.995 --> 00:48:43.515
<v Speaker 0>I really wish there was an easier way

00:48:43.515 --> 00:48:45.915
<v Speaker 0>to work through all the different environment fails.

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:49.880
<v Speaker 1>There are too many of them, but yeah.

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:50.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean, like,

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:53.560
<v Speaker 1>a bunch to one place in

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.760
<v Speaker 1>violin kubeletconfig.yaml

00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:58.760
<v Speaker 1>has been a boon for sure.

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:01.400
<v Speaker 1>But I think what I'm looking for is

00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:01.800
<v Speaker 1>this one.

00:49:03.734 --> 00:49:07.015
<v Speaker 1>Violet kubelet kubelet mflags.env.

00:49:07.335 --> 00:49:08.455
<v Speaker 1>So c d

00:49:08.855 --> 00:49:10.214
<v Speaker 1>Violet kubelet.

00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:18.390
<v Speaker 0>There it is. There it is.

00:49:21.830 --> 00:49:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Another trick. Boink.

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:33.935
<v Speaker 0>Oh. Oopsie. I'm not supposed to make it

00:49:33.935 --> 00:49:37.135
<v Speaker 0>worse. Come on. Fix it. Alright. Yeah. Yeah.

00:49:38.335 --> 00:49:39.295
<v Speaker 0>I've lost track of it a bit of

00:49:39.295 --> 00:49:40.735
<v Speaker 0>times. I've made a cluster worse than this

00:49:40.735 --> 00:49:41.055
<v Speaker 0>show.

00:49:45.350 --> 00:49:47.910
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's see. Let me jump over.

00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:52.150
<v Speaker 0>I'm trying to watch.

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:54.550
<v Speaker 0>Done that weird thing.

00:49:56.775 --> 00:49:57.895
<v Speaker 1>Online again.

00:49:58.135 --> 00:50:01.335
<v Speaker 0>It's now ready, but scheduling is disabled. So

00:50:01.335 --> 00:50:03.415
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming it's got some sort of

00:50:03.895 --> 00:50:05.175
<v Speaker 0>tint on it.

00:50:06.214 --> 00:50:08.535
<v Speaker 1>Oh, you just corded. Oh, let's go. I'll

00:50:08.535 --> 00:50:09.095
<v Speaker 0>cord and check.

00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay. I'm gonna jump back over to that.

00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:16.610
<v Speaker 1>How should we do kettle?

00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:23.810
<v Speaker 1>P m c a p m c q

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:24.130
<v Speaker 1>h.

00:50:26.865 --> 00:50:27.905
<v Speaker 1>Worker.

00:50:28.625 --> 00:50:30.465
<v Speaker 1>P m c q h.

00:50:33.265 --> 00:50:34.385
<v Speaker 1>It notes.

00:50:35.425 --> 00:50:36.065
<v Speaker 0>There.

00:50:37.825 --> 00:50:39.560
<v Speaker 0>You You wanna run a get pods all

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:42.840
<v Speaker 0>and see if all those random broken things

00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:43.480
<v Speaker 0>are

00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:47.240
<v Speaker 0>coming back to life? Those dashes are causing

00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:49.080
<v Speaker 0>me I know they're really getting

00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:52.360
<v Speaker 0>I know. We still get a lot of

00:50:53.515 --> 00:50:55.755
<v Speaker 0>no. Maybe. Maybe it's getting better. Still

00:50:56.395 --> 00:50:57.835
<v Speaker 1>well, it's looking pretty good.

00:51:00.715 --> 00:51:01.835
<v Speaker 1>I think they're running.

00:51:03.035 --> 00:51:05.195
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at your test app

00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:05.540
<v Speaker 1>again,

00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:06.500
<v Speaker 1>if you don't mind.

00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:08.660
<v Speaker 0>Yep. Let me reload.

00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:10.020
<v Speaker 0>I really need to speak to the Teleport

00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:12.580
<v Speaker 0>team and get that fixed. So let's see.

00:51:13.619 --> 00:51:14.340
<v Speaker 0>Get pods.

00:51:20.095 --> 00:51:21.215
<v Speaker 0>Or forward.

00:51:21.215 --> 00:51:23.695
<v Speaker 0>It's not changed as it nope.

00:51:30.415 --> 00:51:32.220
<v Speaker 1>Get a refresh on that guy.

00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:33.580
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's

00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:36.140
<v Speaker 0>but I think it's gonna time out again

00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:38.460
<v Speaker 0>on us. So we're still unable to speak

00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:39.100
<v Speaker 0>to

00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:40.620
<v Speaker 0>Postgres.

00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:45.100
<v Speaker 0>Connections. Okay. Yeah. I think it's gonna time

00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:45.580
<v Speaker 0>out on us.

00:51:48.055 --> 00:51:50.535
<v Speaker 0>Alright. There we go. So we're still gonna

00:51:50.535 --> 00:51:52.535
<v Speaker 0>there was something weird going on here.

00:51:53.415 --> 00:51:54.215
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:51:54.455 --> 00:51:56.135
<v Speaker 1>Keep it all. But we do have all

00:51:56.135 --> 00:51:57.415
<v Speaker 0>the keyplets online.

00:51:57.495 --> 00:51:58.615
<v Speaker 0>Let's progress.

00:52:19.715 --> 00:52:21.155
<v Speaker 0>What's your what are you thinking at the

00:52:21.155 --> 00:52:21.715
<v Speaker 0>moment?

00:52:23.475 --> 00:52:26.115
<v Speaker 1>I am actually curious how it's configured. Like,

00:52:26.115 --> 00:52:27.910
<v Speaker 1>you know, if there's is DNS busted or

00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:29.110
<v Speaker 1>anything else like that? The other thing I'm

00:52:29.110 --> 00:52:30.710
<v Speaker 1>thinking about is just trying to see if

00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:32.950
<v Speaker 1>I can resolve DNS from inside there to

00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:34.550
<v Speaker 1>see if that's a see if there's a

00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:35.270
<v Speaker 1>real problem.

00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:38.070
<v Speaker 0>Well, That's the bug. But where control run

00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:40.070
<v Speaker 0>you did for the bash part is it's

00:52:40.070 --> 00:52:40.630
<v Speaker 0>still pending,

00:52:41.785 --> 00:52:43.065
<v Speaker 0>which is something

00:52:43.065 --> 00:52:44.425
<v Speaker 0>I think we need to fix in order

00:52:44.425 --> 00:52:45.545
<v Speaker 0>to get the connect to have it even

00:52:45.545 --> 00:52:46.745
<v Speaker 0>on the cluster working.

00:52:48.265 --> 00:52:48.745
<v Speaker 1>Sure.

00:52:59.559 --> 00:53:00.920
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's not good.

00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You know what I think is happening?

00:53:05.079 --> 00:53:05.960
<v Speaker 0>Go for it.

00:53:07.079 --> 00:53:08.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious.

00:53:14.915 --> 00:53:16.515
<v Speaker 1>Yep. We still haven't figured out what he

00:53:16.515 --> 00:53:18.115
<v Speaker 1>was doing with all the chaos stuff.

00:53:18.595 --> 00:53:21.075
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. Should we just delete all that

00:53:21.075 --> 00:53:23.234
<v Speaker 0>chaos stuff? Surely that's just there to trip

00:53:23.234 --> 00:53:23.635
<v Speaker 0>us up.

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:27.319
<v Speaker 0>Although if it has caused chaos deleting, that

00:53:27.319 --> 00:53:28.680
<v Speaker 0>may not be the best approach.

00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.240
<v Speaker 0>We probably wanted to undo the chaos.

00:53:32.839 --> 00:53:34.839
<v Speaker 1>So controller manager is looking okay.

00:53:49.325 --> 00:53:50.605
<v Speaker 0>I think we should take a look in

00:53:50.605 --> 00:53:52.780
<v Speaker 0>the the litmus name space then that was

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:55.420
<v Speaker 0>created. We both know Litmus Chaos is a

00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:56.540
<v Speaker 0>CNC project,

00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:58.859
<v Speaker 0>Chaos Monkey sales thing.

00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:05.579
<v Speaker 0>Sam is a way to fetch another popcorn.

00:54:12.285 --> 00:54:14.445
<v Speaker 1>We do have the chaos operator running.

00:54:14.765 --> 00:54:17.165
<v Speaker 1>We have chaos operator metrics running.

00:54:17.325 --> 00:54:18.365
<v Speaker 1>We have a deployment.

00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Should we just nuke it? Let's just nuke

00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:24.380
<v Speaker 1>it. Let's just nuke it. Nothing

00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:30.220
<v Speaker 0>good ever came from running chaos there. It's

00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:31.740
<v Speaker 1>actually kind of an interesting thing. I wanna

00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:34.075
<v Speaker 1>find out my reasoning here. Like, in the

00:54:34.075 --> 00:54:36.235
<v Speaker 1>deployment, if we have a pod that's running

00:54:36.235 --> 00:54:38.875
<v Speaker 1>that is the chaos operator, then it's the

00:54:38.875 --> 00:54:41.435
<v Speaker 1>chaos operator that's eating our lunch. Right? It's

00:54:41.435 --> 00:54:44.635
<v Speaker 1>actively finding our lunch and eating it. But

00:54:44.635 --> 00:54:45.195
<v Speaker 1>if we

00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:48.040
<v Speaker 1>disable that pod, then it can no longer

00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:49.720
<v Speaker 1>do that thing. Right? So when I'm when

00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:51.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm deleting that deployment,

00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:53.480
<v Speaker 1>I should be able to completely disable the

00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:55.880
<v Speaker 1>chaos operator from doing what it's what it

00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:56.840
<v Speaker 1>was doing before.

00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:59.240
<v Speaker 1>Unless it's running as a static pod somewhere,

00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:01.525
<v Speaker 1>in which case, I will be so so

00:55:01.525 --> 00:55:03.765
<v Speaker 1>pleasantly surprised, I am. I can't even really

00:55:03.765 --> 00:55:05.685
<v Speaker 1>put it into words. But this is the

00:55:05.685 --> 00:55:07.445
<v Speaker 1>reason why I'm totally done with turning this

00:55:07.445 --> 00:55:08.565
<v Speaker 1>off in this case.

00:55:09.525 --> 00:55:10.245
<v Speaker 0>Let's see what happens.

00:55:17.410 --> 00:55:18.210
<v Speaker 0>Bye bye, KS.

00:55:26.385 --> 00:55:28.465
<v Speaker 0>Hold on. No reset. Perfect. I'm

00:55:30.705 --> 00:55:32.625
<v Speaker 0>gonna reload my app. Do we think that

00:55:32.625 --> 00:55:34.865
<v Speaker 0>the chaos just disappearing is gonna fix I

00:55:34.865 --> 00:55:36.865
<v Speaker 0>don't The bash one is still pending. Should

00:55:36.865 --> 00:55:37.905
<v Speaker 0>we maybe describe that?

00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:41.680
<v Speaker 1>I wanna see what's happening. Get all

00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:45.200
<v Speaker 1>bash.

00:55:51.714 --> 00:55:53.555
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Still says pending.

00:55:53.555 --> 00:55:54.275
<v Speaker 0>Not

00:55:54.355 --> 00:55:55.555
<v Speaker 0>very useful.

00:56:01.714 --> 00:56:03.315
<v Speaker 1>So it's like maybe the schedule is not

00:56:03.315 --> 00:56:03.555
<v Speaker 1>there.

00:56:06.130 --> 00:56:07.810
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Strange that we're getting

00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:09.250
<v Speaker 0>nothing.

00:56:10.690 --> 00:56:12.690
<v Speaker 0>Bet if there's another table in one of

00:56:12.690 --> 00:56:14.770
<v Speaker 0>the in the scheduler manifest or something.

00:56:24.275 --> 00:56:25.795
<v Speaker 0>No. It looks like it's there.

00:56:27.395 --> 00:56:29.475
<v Speaker 1>It's restarted a few times. Yeah.

00:56:54.015 --> 00:56:56.895
<v Speaker 1>So in another window, I have, like, a

00:56:56.895 --> 00:56:58.975
<v Speaker 1>kind cluster stood up because kind is also

00:56:58.975 --> 00:57:00.255
<v Speaker 1>KubeTM based,

00:57:01.135 --> 00:57:03.455
<v Speaker 1>and that can help me, like, understand what

00:57:03.455 --> 00:57:05.775
<v Speaker 1>the configuration looks like for a working scheduler.

00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:07.270
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm.

00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:09.029
<v Speaker 1>Employment.

00:57:20.195 --> 00:57:22.195
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious about looking at that real quick.

00:57:22.195 --> 00:57:24.675
<v Speaker 1>Keeps scheduler 124. Looks right like the right

00:57:24.675 --> 00:57:25.315
<v Speaker 1>image.

00:57:26.675 --> 00:57:28.675
<v Speaker 1>I don't see anything particularly

00:57:29.395 --> 00:57:31.715
<v Speaker 1>bad about this scheduler. Looks okay.

00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:35.060
<v Speaker 1>What I wonder is

00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:42.180
<v Speaker 1>there is a way to extend the scheduler.

00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:44.980
<v Speaker 1>Big maps.

00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:48.660
<v Speaker 1>That's in

00:57:48.305 --> 00:57:50.145
<v Speaker 1>two system.

00:57:57.665 --> 00:57:59.665
<v Speaker 1>But I don't see anything extending it.

00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:02.940
<v Speaker 1>What if we did keep it off?

00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Create

00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:05.260
<v Speaker 1>deployment

00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:06.620
<v Speaker 1>test.

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:31.860
<v Speaker 1>And then flag image.

00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:35.460
<v Speaker 1>What you talking about?

00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:39.620
<v Speaker 1>Get off.

00:58:39.859 --> 00:58:40.900
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'm not sure.

00:58:42.494 --> 00:58:43.934
<v Speaker 0>Although I don't often bust a a create

00:58:43.934 --> 00:58:45.615
<v Speaker 0>deployment to be fair. Normally, just use a

00:58:45.615 --> 00:58:46.815
<v Speaker 0>kib control run.

00:58:48.815 --> 00:58:49.855
<v Speaker 1>It's different.

00:58:50.335 --> 00:58:52.095
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if I text it or something.

00:58:56.660 --> 00:58:57.540
<v Speaker 1>It

00:59:02.099 --> 00:59:02.820
<v Speaker 0>worked.

00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:07.060
<v Speaker 1>I created the replica set.

00:59:07.220 --> 00:59:09.220
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'm sure we Yeah. Nothing to plug

00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:09.540
<v Speaker 0>yet.

00:59:11.675 --> 00:59:12.635
<v Speaker 0>Pending.

00:59:13.035 --> 00:59:13.755
<v Speaker 1>Pending.

00:59:26.410 --> 00:59:29.530
<v Speaker 1>Not being scheduled, though. The scheduler is definitely

00:59:29.849 --> 00:59:31.290
<v Speaker 1>not doing the same.

00:59:32.089 --> 00:59:34.490
<v Speaker 1>Our problem is the scheduler. Shall we take

00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:35.770
<v Speaker 0>a look at the scheduler logs?

00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:57.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh, okay. Before I do this,

00:59:57.780 --> 00:59:59.220
<v Speaker 1>I wanna make a I wanna make a

00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:01.380
<v Speaker 1>bet that it's that it's permissions.

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh.

01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:08.785
<v Speaker 0>K. So the scheduler

01:00:08.945 --> 01:00:10.465
<v Speaker 0>oh, look at the port number on that.

01:00:10.465 --> 01:00:11.905
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. There we go.

01:00:13.825 --> 01:00:15.505
<v Speaker 1>Feather, Siam. Wow.

01:00:16.145 --> 01:00:17.025
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty.

01:00:21.359 --> 01:00:23.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Where is that configured?

01:00:23.599 --> 01:00:24.400
<v Speaker 1>Oh,

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.000
<v Speaker 1>that is configured here.

01:00:34.095 --> 01:00:36.335
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you just jumped at the manifest directory.

01:00:36.335 --> 01:00:38.335
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if you meant that. No.

01:00:38.415 --> 01:00:39.295
<v Speaker 1>I did.

01:00:40.575 --> 01:00:42.095
<v Speaker 0>Oh, scheduled. Ah, okay.

01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:48.410
<v Speaker 1>So in the in yes.

01:00:50.890 --> 01:00:53.690
<v Speaker 1>So good. So good. So good, Saya.

01:00:56.010 --> 01:00:57.290
<v Speaker 1>You should find one to say.

01:01:01.105 --> 01:01:02.945
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's run that get pods.

01:01:03.585 --> 01:01:06.465
<v Speaker 0>The scheduler oh, well. When we change the

01:01:06.465 --> 01:01:08.225
<v Speaker 0>configs of the scheduler, do we need to

01:01:08.225 --> 01:01:09.425
<v Speaker 0>restart up pods? Yeah.

01:01:10.385 --> 01:01:12.225
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing. Right? Like, that's the thing

01:01:12.225 --> 01:01:14.625
<v Speaker 1>about about most of the thing most most

01:01:14.625 --> 01:01:17.900
<v Speaker 1>things in app in the application space. Nothing

01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:19.900
<v Speaker 1>unless it's implemented specifically,

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:21.579
<v Speaker 1>nothing's gonna trigger to the fact that the

01:01:21.579 --> 01:01:22.940
<v Speaker 1>file system has changed.

01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:26.700
<v Speaker 1>So move

01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:28.140
<v Speaker 1>manifest

01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:29.420
<v Speaker 1>to

01:01:31.644 --> 01:01:33.484
<v Speaker 1>here.

01:01:35.565 --> 01:01:42.204
<v Speaker 0>There's

01:01:42.204 --> 01:01:43.805
<v Speaker 0>a cool trick last week that someone pointed

01:01:43.805 --> 01:01:45.164
<v Speaker 0>out that you can just touch the fail

01:01:45.164 --> 01:01:47.340
<v Speaker 0>in order to restart it even.

01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:50.060
<v Speaker 1>It was Jason. I learned that last week.

01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:51.420
<v Speaker 1>I did not know that last I did

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:52.220
<v Speaker 1>not know that.

01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:56.620
<v Speaker 0>Jason just popped up with a comment. Hey.

01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:57.740
<v Speaker 0>We need to restart that.

01:02:01.595 --> 01:02:03.035
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Was a good trick. I like that

01:02:03.035 --> 01:02:03.595
<v Speaker 0>one.

01:02:03.994 --> 01:02:06.155
<v Speaker 0>In fact, he's already jumped in. That would

01:02:06.155 --> 01:02:06.955
<v Speaker 0>work well.

01:02:07.595 --> 01:02:08.954
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That was a great thing I learned

01:02:08.954 --> 01:02:10.075
<v Speaker 0>last week. I love that one.

01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:17.510
<v Speaker 1>Wonder if there's like another typo in

01:02:18.310 --> 01:02:20.150
<v Speaker 1>so that's obvious. There we go.

01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:22.470
<v Speaker 1>Hey, yo. Back in I

01:02:24.310 --> 01:02:25.830
<v Speaker 1>think we're I think we have I think

01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:26.870
<v Speaker 1>we have this cluster.

01:02:28.105 --> 01:02:30.345
<v Speaker 0>Well, no. We don't have a database connectivity

01:02:30.345 --> 01:02:31.225
<v Speaker 0>yet.

01:02:32.905 --> 01:02:35.065
<v Speaker 0>Still not resolved our DNS issue.

01:02:37.225 --> 01:02:39.145
<v Speaker 0>But we are getting short on time.

01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:45.490
<v Speaker 0>Oh, and the pods aren't creating either. Hopefully,

01:02:45.490 --> 01:02:48.609
<v Speaker 0>that's just Hey, Ted, puppy. Let's go. Pull

01:02:48.609 --> 01:02:49.170
<v Speaker 1>it.

01:02:54.450 --> 01:02:55.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean, I know I'm impatient.

01:02:58.015 --> 01:03:00.015
<v Speaker 0>I think we're gonna have to describe that.

01:03:05.935 --> 01:03:07.215
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's not right.

01:03:08.495 --> 01:03:10.655
<v Speaker 0>That is scheduled, but unable to run.

01:03:26.394 --> 01:03:28.875
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Well, let's see what this has been

01:03:28.875 --> 01:03:29.914
<v Speaker 1>associated

01:03:29.914 --> 01:03:30.635
<v Speaker 1>with.

01:03:33.355 --> 01:03:34.954
<v Speaker 1>This is on Worker

01:03:35.914 --> 01:03:37.434
<v Speaker 1>7 6 9 4 F.

01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:41.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh,

01:03:45.130 --> 01:03:47.530
<v Speaker 1>let's see here. Docker library bash failed to

01:03:47.530 --> 01:03:48.490
<v Speaker 1>do request.

01:03:50.010 --> 01:03:52.330
<v Speaker 1>Dial TCP lookup register

01:03:53.714 --> 01:03:56.994
<v Speaker 1>on 1477520720.

01:03:56.994 --> 01:03:58.755
<v Speaker 1>What is that? Is that a DNS name

01:03:58.755 --> 01:03:59.954
<v Speaker 1>that you actually know?

01:04:02.434 --> 01:04:04.275
<v Speaker 0>That is 14775

01:04:04.275 --> 01:04:06.194
<v Speaker 0>is the facility or region that I have

01:04:06.194 --> 01:04:06.994
<v Speaker 0>deployed this to.

01:04:10.010 --> 01:04:11.050
<v Speaker 0>So no.

01:04:12.570 --> 01:04:14.570
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So I'm gonna jump back over to

01:04:16.170 --> 01:04:17.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna jump back over to

01:04:19.210 --> 01:04:20.890
<v Speaker 1>this guy, this node here,

01:04:23.815 --> 01:04:25.975
<v Speaker 1>which is the 7694F

01:04:25.975 --> 01:04:27.975
<v Speaker 1>node. And I already still have my session

01:04:27.975 --> 01:04:29.015
<v Speaker 1>open, I think.

01:04:30.375 --> 01:04:32.135

<v Speaker 1>see if it works from the

01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:08.330
<v Speaker 1>curl google.com.

01:05:08.650 --> 01:05:10.650
<v Speaker 1>I think it works from here. K. Let's

01:05:10.650 --> 01:05:12.010
<v Speaker 1>see. Resolve.com.

01:05:12.970 --> 01:05:14.490
<v Speaker 0>Which session are you on?

01:05:15.770 --> 01:05:17.210
<v Speaker 1>I just went back to the master real

01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:19.050
<v Speaker 1>quick just to look at this resolve.com.

01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:23.195
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna compare. So 207207207208.

01:05:24.315 --> 01:05:25.915
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. He's taking the numbers off the

01:05:25.915 --> 01:05:26.475
<v Speaker 0>end.

01:05:27.275 --> 01:05:28.155

<v Speaker 1>It's obvious you know, it's it's a it's

01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:37.050
<v Speaker 1>death by a thousand cuts.

01:05:38.090 --> 01:05:38.490
<v Speaker 1>Seven.

01:05:51.414 --> 01:05:53.654
<v Speaker 1>Alright. And then I'm gonna go back to

<v Speaker 0>Yep.

01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:05.460
<v Speaker 1>You can we'll get pods.

01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:08.980
<v Speaker 1>Ash is running. Test is still kinda mostly

01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:09.780
<v Speaker 1>unhappy.

01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:11.380
<v Speaker 0>Oh, that yeah.

01:06:12.474 --> 01:06:14.075
<v Speaker 0>I send back off so it might just

<v Speaker 0>need to kick.

01:06:18.954 --> 01:06:20.155
<v Speaker 1>Mostly to

01:06:20.315 --> 01:06:22.395
<v Speaker 1>to get all described

01:06:22.474 --> 01:06:22.954
<v Speaker 1>pod.

01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:29.530
<v Speaker 1>Actually, pulled it. Yeah.

01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

01:06:36.090 --> 01:06:37.050
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

01:06:38.170 --> 01:06:39.450
<v Speaker 1>Now what does it look like for the

01:06:39.450 --> 01:06:39.849
<v Speaker 1>database?

01:06:44.145 --> 01:06:45.025
<v Speaker 0>Nugget.

01:06:45.025 --> 01:06:45.825
<v Speaker 0>So

01:06:45.825 --> 01:06:47.665
<v Speaker 0>I think that's gonna say that again.

01:06:48.945 --> 01:06:49.745
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

01:06:51.185 --> 01:06:51.985
<v Speaker 1>K. K.

01:06:53.265 --> 01:06:54.785
<v Speaker 0>Should we jump inside of the

01:06:55.630 --> 01:06:56.510
<v Speaker 0>container,

01:06:56.590 --> 01:06:59.150
<v Speaker 0>the custard container Yeah. And try and execute

01:06:59.150 --> 01:06:59.790
<v Speaker 0>a few commands?

01:07:16.845 --> 01:07:17.245
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:25.700
<v Speaker 0>You may wanna just check that's working.

01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:28.660
<v Speaker 0>That that exists, I mean.

01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:31.540
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a script in here that

01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:32.740
<v Speaker 1>does, like, the testing?

01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:36.100
<v Speaker 0>No. I'm afraid not.

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:54.440
<v Speaker 0>You're gonna have to do an laptop there,

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:55.160
<v Speaker 0>I think, on that.

01:08:07.174 --> 01:08:08.855
<v Speaker 0>We have no connectivity.

01:08:10.934 --> 01:08:13.015
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute. That doesn't look right. You

01:08:13.015 --> 01:08:15.015
<v Speaker 1>said it was something else before. Oh, wait.

01:08:15.015 --> 01:08:15.414
<v Speaker 1>Is it?

01:08:17.439 --> 01:08:19.439
<v Speaker 0>+1 722026010

01:08:19.439 --> 01:08:22.000
<v Speaker 0>is yeah. That is right. Yeah. That's good.

<v Speaker 1>You can get all Yeah. Get get services.

01:08:33.375 --> 01:08:35.535
<v Speaker 1>Cache and system.

01:08:43.399 --> 01:08:45.640
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. There we go. Yeah. That's okay.

01:08:46.359 --> 01:08:47.960
<v Speaker 0>Do wanna describe it? Make sure we got

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:48.679
<v Speaker 0>endpoints.

01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:53.399
<v Speaker 1>Right.

01:08:56.185 --> 01:08:58.184
<v Speaker 1>K. I'm gonna pull another batch trick.

01:09:03.064 --> 01:09:03.704
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

01:09:04.904 --> 01:09:06.665
<v Speaker 0>It has in punch too. Okay. That looks

01:09:06.665 --> 01:09:06.904
<v Speaker 0>good.

01:09:16.439 --> 01:09:17.960
<v Speaker 1>So our exec

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:19.639
<v Speaker 1>interesting.

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:19.880
<v Speaker 1>So

01:09:25.324 --> 01:09:29.885
<v Speaker 1>when we're in here catcresolve.com.

01:09:32.444 --> 01:09:34.124
<v Speaker 1>20 6 0 ten.

01:09:36.524 --> 01:09:37.965
<v Speaker 1>Curl Google

01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:45.550
<v Speaker 0>It feels like a network policy to me.

01:09:47.149 --> 01:09:49.310
<v Speaker 1>You're probably right because you're using Cilium.

01:09:51.835 --> 01:09:53.194
<v Speaker 1>Good call, David.

01:09:54.954 --> 01:09:56.395
<v Speaker 0>I get them right once in a blue

01:09:56.395 --> 01:09:57.675
<v Speaker 0>moon, so hopefully.

01:09:58.315 --> 01:09:59.754
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully, today's my day.

01:10:03.275 --> 01:10:04.155
<v Speaker 0>No. Well,

01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:06.760
<v Speaker 0>that must maybe it's a misleading name. I

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:08.600
<v Speaker 0>don't think that's a deny ingress.

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:11.000
<v Speaker 0>Let's just delete it.

01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:18.200
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I'm gonna jump over to my app.

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:19.080
<v Speaker 0>Look at that.

01:10:21.864 --> 01:10:23.144
<v Speaker 1>That's a nice catch.

01:10:24.185 --> 01:10:26.185
<v Speaker 0>May your bag be bountiful and your success

01:10:26.185 --> 01:10:28.985
<v Speaker 0>great. PS, you're very smart and hot. Signs,

01:10:28.985 --> 01:10:30.425
<v Speaker 0>Steven Augustine. And

01:10:31.625 --> 01:10:33.065
<v Speaker 0>here's my lovely video for y'all.

01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:35.349
<v Speaker 0>Found us that we got time. We need

01:10:35.349 --> 01:10:36.229
<v Speaker 0>to fix this.

01:10:37.670 --> 01:10:38.629
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

01:10:38.949 --> 01:10:40.389
<v Speaker 0>Should we deploy the update?

01:10:42.949 --> 01:10:43.909
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Good.

01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:48.630
<v Speaker 0>Image

01:10:49.865 --> 01:10:51.145
<v Speaker 0>version two.

01:10:52.265 --> 01:10:53.705
<v Speaker 0>I don't have an alias key. I have

01:10:53.705 --> 01:10:54.985
<v Speaker 0>no point in that now.

01:10:56.905 --> 01:10:58.905
<v Speaker 0>We have our new version coming. Let's pop

01:10:58.905 --> 01:11:00.745
<v Speaker 0>over here and get a new port forward.

01:11:01.545 --> 01:11:03.080
<v Speaker 0>I think we fixed everything,

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:04.040
<v Speaker 0>hopefully.

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:09.480
<v Speaker 0>Image isn't too big. It should be real

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:10.120
<v Speaker 0>quick.

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Very cool.

01:11:15.155 --> 01:11:16.915
<v Speaker 1>Thank you, Sam. That was fun.

01:11:17.955 --> 01:11:20.115
<v Speaker 0>There we go. We have our new

01:11:20.195 --> 01:11:20.995
<v Speaker 0>container

01:11:22.355 --> 01:11:23.635
<v Speaker 0>port forward

01:11:24.355 --> 01:11:25.395
<v Speaker 0>this one

01:11:27.475 --> 01:11:29.235
<v Speaker 0>and make sure our upgrade

01:11:29.235 --> 01:11:29.715
<v Speaker 0>worked.

01:11:35.650 --> 01:11:37.650
<v Speaker 0>I think it's just not ready yet.

01:11:43.090 --> 01:11:43.890
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

01:11:47.065 --> 01:11:48.905
<v Speaker 0>And if the video doesn't load, I think

01:11:48.905 --> 01:11:49.864
<v Speaker 0>that's just my

01:11:51.465 --> 01:11:52.665
<v Speaker 0>my application.

01:11:53.545 --> 01:11:54.985
<v Speaker 1>Fight for your limits and sure enough they're

01:11:54.985 --> 01:11:56.905
<v Speaker 1>yours by Duffy's mom. It's true. I love

01:11:56.905 --> 01:11:59.940
<v Speaker 1>that statement. One of my favorites. Right. My

01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:01.300
<v Speaker 1>knowledge is the best knowledge.

01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Thank you, Siam. That was awesome.

01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:05.940
<v Speaker 0>We're not gonna get my dance in video

01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:07.540
<v Speaker 0>because clearly I've messed up v two of

01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:08.900
<v Speaker 0>the image, but the quote worked. We have

01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:11.060
<v Speaker 0>our connectivity. We did deploy our update.

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:13.140
<v Speaker 0>We are ready for cluster 13.

01:12:14.425 --> 01:12:16.505
<v Speaker 0>You happy? I do. Good. Good. Right.

01:12:16.824 --> 01:12:17.784
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy.

01:12:20.185 --> 01:12:22.025
<v Speaker 0>Thank you, Sam. That was good fun.

01:12:22.265 --> 01:12:23.704
<v Speaker 0>Let's get that closed.

01:12:23.784 --> 01:12:25.385
<v Speaker 0>So I don't make because I've got a

01:12:25.385 --> 01:12:26.665
<v Speaker 0>very bad habit of going to the wrong

01:12:26.665 --> 01:12:26.985
<v Speaker 0>cluster.

01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:30.739
<v Speaker 0>Alright. 0 13.

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:33.380
<v Speaker 0>Export to config and then we'll come over

01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:35.140
<v Speaker 0>here. Okay. Let's jump onto the control point.

01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:37.220
<v Speaker 0>So this cluster, I kinda left as a

01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:39.060
<v Speaker 0>little bit of a surprise for you.

01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:42.420
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Alright. We we had

01:12:42.915 --> 01:12:44.754
<v Speaker 0>two returning breakers,

01:12:45.315 --> 01:12:47.635
<v Speaker 0>former colleagues of yours. Can you guess who

01:12:47.635 --> 01:12:48.434
<v Speaker 0>that would be?

01:12:49.395 --> 01:12:50.434
<v Speaker 1>Oh, no.

01:12:50.915 --> 01:12:52.354
<v Speaker 1>It is Jason

01:12:52.675 --> 01:12:54.994
<v Speaker 1>Was it and Jason did that be it?

01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:58.300
<v Speaker 0>It is Dan and Jason. They decided to

01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:00.699
<v Speaker 0>put a little special together for you.

01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:02.140
<v Speaker 1>You know? So

01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:04.380

<v Speaker 1>I'm opening a love letter here right now.

01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:06.860
<v Speaker 1>You know? Like,

01:13:07.915 --> 01:13:08.715
<v Speaker 1>that

01:13:08.715 --> 01:13:09.915
<v Speaker 1>makes me feel awesome.

01:13:11.275 --> 01:13:15.995
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So maketheyear.com.

01:13:17.195 --> 01:13:19.595
<v Speaker 1>Oh, cool. Okay. I'll be back at at

01:13:19.595 --> 01:13:20.940
<v Speaker 0>just one second. Apologies.

01:13:43.545 --> 01:13:44.264
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

01:13:44.505 --> 01:13:45.385
<v Speaker 1>Uh-oh.

01:13:45.385 --> 01:13:46.025
<v Speaker 1>Oh, no.

01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:49.239
<v Speaker 1>Oh, it's not a good sign.

01:13:53.719 --> 01:13:55.159
<v Speaker 1>Sorry about that.

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:57.400
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.

01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:58.280
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

01:13:58.679 --> 01:14:00.280
<v Speaker 0>Did we have an API server, or is

01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:01.480
<v Speaker 0>that too much to ask?

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.065
<v Speaker 1>We I think that is too much to

01:14:04.065 --> 01:14:06.385
<v Speaker 1>ask. +1 6849.

01:14:08.545 --> 01:14:09.345
<v Speaker 1>60

01:14:10.545 --> 01:14:12.865
<v Speaker 1>8 40 9. Alright. Well, that's the first

01:14:12.865 --> 01:14:14.385
<v Speaker 1>test I wanted to look at. K.

01:14:27.219 --> 01:14:29.380
<v Speaker 1>Which line again so I can remember what

01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:29.780
<v Speaker 1>it is?

01:14:46.610 --> 01:14:49.329
<v Speaker 0>Jason's saying no API server. I didn't expect

01:14:49.329 --> 01:14:51.010
<v Speaker 0>her to be one, to be fair. But,

01:14:51.010 --> 01:14:52.929
<v Speaker 0>you know, I can remain a little bit

01:14:52.929 --> 01:14:53.650
<v Speaker 0>hopeful at time.

01:15:00.245 --> 01:15:01.605
<v Speaker 1>See you at kettle.

01:15:01.685 --> 01:15:02.325
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

01:15:03.765 --> 01:15:05.045
<v Speaker 1>Oh my. Oh.

01:15:07.125 --> 01:15:08.965
<v Speaker 1>Oh. Oh. Oh my.

01:15:09.285 --> 01:15:10.885
<v Speaker 0>A little sparse there, isn't it?

01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:14.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's looking a little anorectic. It's true.

01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:17.300
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes manifests.

01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:22.820
<v Speaker 1>They're like

01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:25.780
<v Speaker 1>Interesting. When you go when you go to,

01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:27.585
<v Speaker 1>like when you're tab completing and you realize

01:15:27.585 --> 01:15:29.505
<v Speaker 1>that there's more to a word than you

01:15:29.505 --> 01:15:30.464
<v Speaker 1>think there is,

01:15:31.025 --> 01:15:33.105
<v Speaker 1>you know you know that feeling? Yeah. I'm

01:15:33.105 --> 01:15:33.984
<v Speaker 1>having a feeling.

01:15:35.425 --> 01:15:35.984
<v Speaker 0>Well,

01:15:37.105 --> 01:15:38.545
<v Speaker 0>let's let's see what the left is in

01:15:38.545 --> 01:15:38.864
<v Speaker 0>the Oh.

01:15:43.210 --> 01:15:44.330
<v Speaker 1>Not working.

01:15:50.010 --> 01:15:50.490
<v Speaker 1>Unless

01:15:54.985 --> 01:15:56.345
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna take a quick peek at

01:15:56.345 --> 01:15:57.705
<v Speaker 1>these Mhmm. Because it

01:15:59.785 --> 01:16:00.665
<v Speaker 1>that's,

01:16:00.745 --> 01:16:03.225
<v Speaker 1>I think, probably a good idea.

01:16:04.985 --> 01:16:08.185
<v Speaker 1>Just take a quick little look here. Okay?

01:16:08.185 --> 01:16:11.590
<v Speaker 1>Nope. That's all. Okay. Okay. Looks normal.

01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:14.390
<v Speaker 0>Maybe Suspiciously.

01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.710
<v Speaker 0>So

01:16:15.670 --> 01:16:17.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh, even SED is gone.

01:16:25.264 --> 01:16:27.184
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:16:27.905 --> 01:16:29.184
<v Speaker 1>It's a good sign. Okay.

01:16:31.025 --> 01:16:31.824
<v Speaker 1>Totally gross.

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Also oh,

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:43.040
<v Speaker 1>what?

01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:47.440
<v Speaker 0>Does that look okay? Does that look bad?

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean, I don't think the SED, the

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:54.025
<v Speaker 1>daemon, actually generates a thing that's called walled

01:16:54.025 --> 01:16:56.264
<v Speaker 1>up broken. I'm just putting it out there.

01:16:56.264 --> 01:16:58.264
<v Speaker 1>You know? Oh, yeah. Like, we be recovering

01:16:59.304 --> 01:17:00.905
<v Speaker 1>some STD stuff here.

01:17:04.585 --> 01:17:06.585
<v Speaker 0>I need to start adding rules. No break

01:17:06.585 --> 01:17:07.864
<v Speaker 0>in STD either

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:11.200
<v Speaker 0>because Violet etcd. Violet etcd.

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:13.440
<v Speaker 1>2381.

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:14.880
<v Speaker 1>'20 '3 '80 '1.

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:18.000
<v Speaker 1>'20 '3 '70 '9.

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:21.360
<v Speaker 1>They don't it doesn't look like they've been

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:23.120
<v Speaker 1>too mean to me here. Like, this all

01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:24.344
<v Speaker 1>looks right to me.

01:17:24.905 --> 01:17:26.264
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm gonna do

01:17:29.065 --> 01:17:31.305
<v Speaker 1>is I'm gonna start by doing this. Move

01:17:31.305 --> 01:17:32.425
<v Speaker 1>to FTD.

01:17:33.705 --> 01:17:34.344
<v Speaker 1>Hold

01:17:34.905 --> 01:17:35.545
<v Speaker 1>on. What's that?

01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:39.680
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:41.600
<v Speaker 1>Slash.

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:42.400
<v Speaker 0>Should we

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:45.120
<v Speaker 0>run like a PS or something first? Just

01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:47.040
<v Speaker 0>because maybe they are running and

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:49.280
<v Speaker 0>No. Because cry control would show us down

01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:50.640
<v Speaker 0>at the lowest level. Right? There's no way

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:52.240
<v Speaker 0>to hide stuff from a cry control.

01:17:53.795 --> 01:17:56.514
<v Speaker 1>Well, there is. Oh. But, you you have

01:17:56.915 --> 01:17:58.514
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be a little more creative. I

01:17:58.514 --> 01:17:59.554
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they did that. I don't

01:17:59.554 --> 01:18:01.474
<v Speaker 1>think they would do that per se. Okay.

01:18:01.635 --> 01:18:02.594
<v Speaker 0>I trust you.

01:18:05.074 --> 01:18:07.315
<v Speaker 0>Oh, we got a fairly amazing trying to

01:18:07.315 --> 01:18:07.875
<v Speaker 0>pop up there.

01:18:14.250 --> 01:18:15.849
<v Speaker 1>Ready.

01:18:16.570 --> 01:18:17.530
<v Speaker 1>It's a good sign.

01:18:23.265 --> 01:18:24.065
<v Speaker 1>Right.

01:18:25.505 --> 01:18:26.945
<v Speaker 1>Okay. That's a

01:18:27.345 --> 01:18:28.145
<v Speaker 1>reasonably

01:18:29.345 --> 01:18:30.305
<v Speaker 1>good sign.

01:18:30.625 --> 01:18:32.145
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:33.745
<v Speaker 1>The next thing I'm gonna do,

01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:39.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna move the API server over there.

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:49.400
<v Speaker 0>So you're just moving things back one by

01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:50.920
<v Speaker 0>one because you don't trust these two. Right?

01:18:52.015 --> 01:18:53.615
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're talking about. Trust

01:18:53.615 --> 01:18:56.015
<v Speaker 1>these I trust these guys with my life.

01:18:58.495 --> 01:19:00.015
<v Speaker 1>Or at least the life of my pets.

01:19:03.870 --> 01:19:05.389
<v Speaker 0>I guess it could take a little bit

01:19:05.389 --> 01:19:07.469
<v Speaker 0>longer for the API server, but

01:19:07.949 --> 01:19:08.909
<v Speaker 0>let's see.

01:19:09.310 --> 01:19:10.110
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. There we go.

01:19:25.245 --> 01:19:27.324
<v Speaker 0>So when we do a a cry control

01:19:27.324 --> 01:19:29.725
<v Speaker 0>get pods there and it says state ready,

01:19:29.725 --> 01:19:30.764
<v Speaker 0>that's

01:19:30.764 --> 01:19:33.005
<v Speaker 0>just as far as the container goes and

01:19:33.005 --> 01:19:33.565
<v Speaker 0>not

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:36.350
<v Speaker 0>readiness program for that because it's not it's

01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:38.030
<v Speaker 0>not aware of that level. Right?

01:19:41.070 --> 01:19:43.949
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So it's like, pods shows you the

01:19:43.950 --> 01:19:44.910
<v Speaker 1>sandbox

01:19:45.230 --> 01:19:47.469
<v Speaker 1>and PS shows you the process.

01:19:47.630 --> 01:19:47.950
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

01:19:51.005 --> 01:19:53.965
<v Speaker 1>Oh, SCD did in fact bounce on this.

01:19:54.205 --> 01:19:54.765
<v Speaker 1>Oh,

01:19:56.685 --> 01:19:57.725
<v Speaker 0>yeah. Perfect.

01:19:58.285 --> 01:20:00.125
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So I'm gonna move h m s

01:20:00.125 --> 01:20:01.085
<v Speaker 1>to a back. Or

01:20:01.725 --> 01:20:03.165
<v Speaker 0>should we delete that broken file?

01:20:04.190 --> 01:20:06.910
<v Speaker 0>Maybe that's causing us easy to filter initialize.

01:20:07.150 --> 01:20:08.830
<v Speaker 0>Maybe it's just like a random text file

01:20:08.830 --> 01:20:10.670
<v Speaker 0>that's got some, you know, profanity in it

01:20:10.670 --> 01:20:11.390
<v Speaker 0>or something.

01:20:12.510 --> 01:20:13.230
<v Speaker 1>I

01:20:14.350 --> 01:20:15.870
<v Speaker 1>like I like where you read that, but

01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:16.670
<v Speaker 1>I wanna

01:20:16.990 --> 01:20:17.310
<v Speaker 1>see.

01:20:19.845 --> 01:20:20.725
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. Yes.

01:20:23.445 --> 01:20:24.165
<v Speaker 1>That's a

01:20:27.285 --> 01:20:28.965
<v Speaker 1>I wanna see if

01:20:29.845 --> 01:20:32.085
<v Speaker 1>you can grab the logs from this puppy.

01:20:34.885 --> 01:20:35.685
<v Speaker 1>Get all

01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:37.060
<v Speaker 1>bugs.

01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:39.060
<v Speaker 0>I guess you could also go to

01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:42.340
<v Speaker 0>our log containers as well. I don't know.

01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:44.180
<v Speaker 0>Cray control could do that too. That's cool.

01:20:55.375 --> 01:20:56.735
<v Speaker 0>We got a

01:20:57.615 --> 01:20:59.455
<v Speaker 0>oh, okay. Permission based. Yeah.

01:21:23.795 --> 01:21:25.554
<v Speaker 0>Doesn't look bad.

01:21:45.514 --> 01:21:47.114
<v Speaker 0>You see anything that's

01:21:47.275 --> 01:21:48.235
<v Speaker 0>suspicious?

01:21:48.315 --> 01:21:50.635
<v Speaker 0>Looks okay to me. Hold Open

01:21:53.114 --> 01:21:55.675
<v Speaker 1>bar, let it see the member snap.

01:21:56.954 --> 01:21:59.034
<v Speaker 0>Is it not is it not running as

01:21:59.034 --> 01:21:59.435
<v Speaker 0>a root?

01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:02.720
<v Speaker 0>We got a security contact. Is that what

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:03.520
<v Speaker 0>you're looking for?

01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:06.000
<v Speaker 1>What I was wondering was, like, if it

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.159
<v Speaker 1>was mounted read only or something. It

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:12.800
<v Speaker 1>doesn't look like it was.

01:22:26.885 --> 01:22:27.845
<v Speaker 0>It looks fine.

01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:29.850
<v Speaker 0>And it keeps saying My low pitch. In

01:22:29.850 --> 01:22:31.690
<v Speaker 0>my weird high pitched voice because I have

01:22:31.690 --> 01:22:32.489
<v Speaker 0>no idea.

01:22:37.770 --> 01:22:39.130
<v Speaker 0>See that error message There

01:22:41.850 --> 01:22:42.170
<v Speaker 0>it is.

01:22:46.025 --> 01:22:49.385
<v Speaker 0>Now open database, Violet etcd member snap DB.

01:22:49.705 --> 01:22:50.665
<v Speaker 0>Operation

01:22:52.345 --> 01:22:53.385
<v Speaker 0>not permitted.

01:23:03.570 --> 01:23:04.449
<v Speaker 1>Open

01:23:04.610 --> 01:23:06.290
<v Speaker 1>Snap t p. So let's do a look

01:23:06.290 --> 01:23:07.329
<v Speaker 1>at Snap t p.

01:23:08.369 --> 01:23:08.770
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

01:23:12.205 --> 01:23:12.925
<v Speaker 1>Oh.

01:23:13.005 --> 01:23:14.285
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh.

01:23:18.045 --> 01:23:19.165
<v Speaker 1>Check her.

01:23:21.405 --> 01:23:23.485
<v Speaker 0>We wanna see if there's any weird attributes

01:23:23.485 --> 01:23:26.205
<v Speaker 0>on the file that would Flown away

01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:27.100
<v Speaker 1>this is what they've done.

01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:30.140
<v Speaker 1>I can't even remember what the syntax is

01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:31.420
<v Speaker 1>to look at the permissions that we're seeing.

01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:32.060
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.

01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:34.940
<v Speaker 0>Jason's left his very sneaky comment there. There

01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:36.460
<v Speaker 0>are more to permissions

01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:38.220
<v Speaker 0>than the files. Yeah.

01:23:41.815 --> 01:23:42.775
<v Speaker 1>Shutter.

01:23:42.855 --> 01:23:43.335
<v Speaker 1>How do I

01:23:48.215 --> 01:23:50.295
<v Speaker 1>but I wanna see the permissions.

01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:55.880
<v Speaker 1>LSetter.

01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:56.600
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.

01:24:06.375 --> 01:24:08.054
<v Speaker 0>I think we need the translator.

01:24:09.014 --> 01:24:10.534
<v Speaker 1>You dirty dog.

01:24:13.014 --> 01:24:14.854
<v Speaker 0>Can you explain that to me?

01:24:18.054 --> 01:24:18.534
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.

01:24:19.770 --> 01:24:21.530
<v Speaker 1>That's beautiful. So

01:24:21.850 --> 01:24:23.690
<v Speaker 1>in the file in

01:24:24.890 --> 01:24:27.770
<v Speaker 1>the attributes file system attributes. Right? It's a

01:24:27.770 --> 01:24:30.090
<v Speaker 1>thing. It's like a security feature for the

01:24:30.250 --> 01:24:32.650
<v Speaker 1>underlying because in in Linux, everything is a

01:24:32.650 --> 01:24:35.045
<v Speaker 1>file. So you can actually mark a file

01:24:35.045 --> 01:24:36.005
<v Speaker 1>immutable.

01:24:37.285 --> 01:24:39.525
<v Speaker 1>And if you mark that file immutable with

01:24:39.525 --> 01:24:42.245
<v Speaker 1>its attributes, then that means that nothing can

01:24:42.485 --> 01:24:44.085
<v Speaker 1>effectively mutate it.

01:24:45.285 --> 01:24:47.525
<v Speaker 1>What's neat about permissions here is that we're

01:24:47.525 --> 01:24:49.670
<v Speaker 1>so used to looking at, like, whether I'm

01:24:49.670 --> 01:24:51.909
<v Speaker 1>allowed to do a thing, not think of

01:24:51.909 --> 01:24:54.550
<v Speaker 1>the think of, like, attributes more like the

01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:55.750
<v Speaker 1>authorization

01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:57.350
<v Speaker 1>rather than the authentication.

01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Like, I'm authenticated to do the thing. I

01:24:59.190 --> 01:25:01.350
<v Speaker 1>have readwrite. I'm good. I can I've they

01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:03.270
<v Speaker 1>it knows me. I'm rude. I'm a I'm

01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:04.310
<v Speaker 1>good. But

01:25:04.815 --> 01:25:05.855
<v Speaker 1>Chatter says,

01:25:06.015 --> 01:25:08.255
<v Speaker 1>but no matter who you are, you cannot

01:25:08.255 --> 01:25:10.895
<v Speaker 1>do that. Right? So it's, basically setting

01:25:11.855 --> 01:25:14.655
<v Speaker 1>setting the permission to block it. So

01:25:15.215 --> 01:25:17.295
<v Speaker 1>I want to disable minus

01:25:17.295 --> 01:25:18.255
<v Speaker 1>I, I think.

01:25:22.179 --> 01:25:24.500
<v Speaker 0>Should we just set a a man change

01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:26.020
<v Speaker 0>adder and see if it lists the different

01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:26.900
<v Speaker 0>attributes?

01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:30.340
<v Speaker 0>Would that work? I think I want shatter

01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:31.060
<v Speaker 1>minus I.

01:25:32.695 --> 01:25:34.135
<v Speaker 0>No man d b. Oh, well. Never mind.

01:25:46.050 --> 01:25:48.130
<v Speaker 0>So that I is an immutable flag and

01:25:48.130 --> 01:25:50.449
<v Speaker 0>we think that we've removed that and now

01:25:50.449 --> 01:25:52.850
<v Speaker 0>it should start when it restarts

01:25:52.850 --> 01:25:53.570
<v Speaker 0>correctly.

01:25:55.889 --> 01:25:57.650
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That was two minutes ago, so we

01:25:57.650 --> 01:25:58.770
<v Speaker 0>might just have to

01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:16.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I'm looking at a one.

01:26:39.015 --> 01:26:40.695
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Exit two minutes ago.

01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:45.800
<v Speaker 0>Does that mean the touch didn't work?

01:26:46.679 --> 01:26:48.120
<v Speaker 0>Or did we move it back out of

01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:49.480
<v Speaker 0>the directory and into the

01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:52.040
<v Speaker 1>I have not moved it out of the

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:53.960
<v Speaker 1>directory. It is right where it's supposed to

01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:54.199
<v Speaker 1>be.

01:27:05.605 --> 01:27:06.725
<v Speaker 1>I know this works, though.

01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:20.640
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Don't think you moved it. You only

01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:21.760
<v Speaker 0>put one dot instead of two.

01:27:29.935 --> 01:27:32.015
<v Speaker 1>You see the HDD pod drop.

01:27:40.989 --> 01:27:44.270
<v Speaker 1>It goes. I believe STD back into manifest.

01:28:03.810 --> 01:28:05.890
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. There's conversations in the chat right now

01:28:05.890 --> 01:28:07.650
<v Speaker 0>about SE Linus and AppArmor.

01:28:08.370 --> 01:28:09.010
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:28:09.570 --> 01:28:10.530
<v Speaker 0>I'm not dealing with that.

01:28:12.395 --> 01:28:12.955
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:28:13.915 --> 01:28:15.755
<v Speaker 0>There's no one else to ban things.

01:28:16.795 --> 01:28:18.635
<v Speaker 1>Houston knows how I feel about AppArmor, so

01:28:18.635 --> 01:28:20.875
<v Speaker 1>that would be that would be particularly cruel.

01:28:22.555 --> 01:28:24.235
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm getting some lag here.

01:28:24.235 --> 01:28:25.275
<v Speaker 1>See where I cut all.

01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:30.040
<v Speaker 0>Well, we don't know if they haven't done

01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:31.800
<v Speaker 0>other stuff to this machine. I wouldn't be

01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:33.800
<v Speaker 0>surprised if there was something timed

01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:35.240
<v Speaker 0>inappropriately.

01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:35.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:41.080
<v Speaker 0>Uh-oh.

01:28:49.625 --> 01:28:50.985
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's not coming back.

01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:59.120
<v Speaker 0>Oh, look at the load average. Hello.

01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:00.400
<v Speaker 1>Dang.

01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:04.960
<v Speaker 0>We better stop that quick before we

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:06.640
<v Speaker 0>there's access to this host.

01:29:14.425 --> 01:29:15.465
<v Speaker 0>Key swap d.

01:29:35.219 --> 01:29:37.060
<v Speaker 0>What was your thought process in running mount

01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:37.460
<v Speaker 0>there?

01:29:39.304 --> 01:29:40.824
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to see if we could

01:29:40.824 --> 01:29:43.385
<v Speaker 1>do LS swap and see if we have

01:29:43.385 --> 01:29:44.985
<v Speaker 1>it. But I don't remember what the trick

01:29:44.985 --> 01:29:46.184
<v Speaker 1>is, so, like,

01:29:47.145 --> 01:29:49.465
<v Speaker 1>swap. We could just just swap off all.

01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:57.520
<v Speaker 0>I think it's the dash dash all.

01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:20.659
<v Speaker 1>So in the swap.

01:30:22.180 --> 01:30:22.900
<v Speaker 1>So

01:30:25.060 --> 01:30:26.659
<v Speaker 1>you're not using a top memory.

01:30:28.580 --> 01:30:29.219
<v Speaker 1>We

01:30:30.180 --> 01:30:32.980
<v Speaker 1>do you see the cubelet freaking out? Yeah.

01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:34.955
<v Speaker 0>The cubelet. Interesting.

01:30:53.730 --> 01:30:55.250
<v Speaker 0>You wanna try a p s a u

01:30:55.250 --> 01:30:56.610
<v Speaker 0>x and get a fill path on that

01:30:56.610 --> 01:30:58.850
<v Speaker 0>k swap d just in case it's just

01:30:58.850 --> 01:31:00.690
<v Speaker 0>particular just in case it's named that way,

01:31:00.690 --> 01:31:01.410
<v Speaker 0>but not actually.

01:31:03.385 --> 01:31:05.144
<v Speaker 0>Or you think it's cubelet?

01:31:06.185 --> 01:31:07.705
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna take the cubelet out for

01:31:07.705 --> 01:31:09.864
<v Speaker 1>now because it's freaking out. So I wanna,

01:31:09.864 --> 01:31:11.704
<v Speaker 1>like, try and reduce the load.

01:31:12.425 --> 01:31:14.665
<v Speaker 1>If the cubelet's taking up so much juice,

01:31:14.665 --> 01:31:16.425
<v Speaker 1>then maybe that'll help us a little bit.

01:31:16.425 --> 01:31:16.985
<v Speaker 1>There we go.

01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:19.360
<v Speaker 1>Let's get that. Nope.

01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:29.920
<v Speaker 0>Nope.

01:31:37.695 --> 01:31:39.135
<v Speaker 1>That's not what I wanted.

01:31:42.415 --> 01:31:42.975
<v Speaker 1>Message.

01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:50.780
<v Speaker 0>Secret part of memory process called API server.

01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:56.220
<v Speaker 1>That's because the cubit died, and that's okay.

01:32:03.385 --> 01:32:05.304
<v Speaker 1>You know what? I'm gonna move

01:32:06.585 --> 01:32:07.544
<v Speaker 1>FS

01:32:07.945 --> 01:32:08.985
<v Speaker 1>API server.

01:32:13.630 --> 01:32:15.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna move the API server back out

01:32:15.230 --> 01:32:15.949
<v Speaker 1>of here.

01:32:18.989 --> 01:32:20.829
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't know for sure if there's

01:32:20.829 --> 01:32:22.269
<v Speaker 1>not something else happening. I haven't looked at

01:32:22.269 --> 01:32:23.150
<v Speaker 1>the image or anything.

01:32:33.895 --> 01:32:34.614
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

01:32:36.615 --> 01:32:37.575
<v Speaker 1>CTL.

01:32:57.695 --> 01:32:59.855
<v Speaker 1>So I'll do a few.

01:33:02.015 --> 01:33:03.295
<v Speaker 1>And that minus.

01:33:06.255 --> 01:33:08.255
<v Speaker 1>Gotta really find a gotta really find a

01:33:08.255 --> 01:33:09.215
<v Speaker 1>way to do that.

01:33:10.335 --> 01:33:11.695
<v Speaker 0>Choice of a new keyboard.

01:33:13.630 --> 01:33:14.349
<v Speaker 1>Right?

01:33:14.590 --> 01:33:15.310
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:33:16.670 --> 01:33:17.869
<v Speaker 0>We all do it.

01:33:18.510 --> 01:33:20.350
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's see what the keyboard I'll say

01:33:20.350 --> 01:33:20.989
<v Speaker 0>then.

01:33:23.230 --> 01:33:25.630
<v Speaker 1>Memory, c group out of memory error.

01:33:26.990 --> 01:33:27.710
<v Speaker 1>Total VM.

01:33:34.085 --> 01:33:36.245
<v Speaker 1>Oh, they messed with the c groups.

01:33:42.659 --> 01:33:44.499
<v Speaker 0>I think my teleport has

01:33:45.619 --> 01:33:47.539
<v Speaker 0>it's not crashes. It's very slow.

01:33:49.139 --> 01:33:49.539
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:33:56.155 --> 01:33:57.514
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

01:34:01.515 --> 01:34:03.275
<v Speaker 0>So whenever we start the Kubelet, the or

01:34:03.275 --> 01:34:04.554
<v Speaker 0>the API server,

01:34:04.875 --> 01:34:05.915
<v Speaker 0>bad things are happening.

01:34:09.190 --> 01:34:09.829
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:34:11.989 --> 01:34:14.550
<v Speaker 1>Also see so a secret out of error

01:34:14.550 --> 01:34:16.150
<v Speaker 1>message out of memory error.

01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:38.059
<v Speaker 0>That looks okay. A little bit in the

01:34:38.059 --> 01:34:40.460
<v Speaker 1>file. In the unit file, though. Yeah.

01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:12.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I'm pulling up a command that should

01:35:12.550 --> 01:35:14.390
<v Speaker 1>give us the ability to see, like, what

01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:15.190
<v Speaker 1>the top

01:35:15.670 --> 01:35:17.750
<v Speaker 1>consuming c groups are

01:35:18.655 --> 01:35:20.495
<v Speaker 1>and see if there's maybe a c group

01:35:20.495 --> 01:35:23.055
<v Speaker 1>that has been started up in another namespace

01:35:23.055 --> 01:35:24.095
<v Speaker 1>or some other way.

01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:38.280
<v Speaker 0>Does that say that we only have 1.6

01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:39.399
<v Speaker 0>gig of memory?

01:35:43.159 --> 01:35:45.000
<v Speaker 1>It does. Oh, I just got kicked out.

01:35:50.305 --> 01:35:51.025
<v Speaker 0>Boink.

01:35:55.105 --> 01:35:55.905
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.

01:35:58.225 --> 01:36:00.705
<v Speaker 0>Oh, this machine's definitely slowing down again.

01:36:11.210 --> 01:36:12.250
<v Speaker 1>Is it restarting or

01:36:15.369 --> 01:36:18.155
<v Speaker 1>1869999.

01:36:20.954 --> 01:36:22.954
<v Speaker 0>There's something weird with the machine.

01:36:25.355 --> 01:36:27.434
<v Speaker 0>We got 62 gig of

01:36:28.074 --> 01:36:30.315
<v Speaker 0>RAM, but we've only got one available.

01:36:33.340 --> 01:36:34.300
<v Speaker 0>Perfect.

01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:38.139
<v Speaker 0>Oh, Jason's commenting. What does three dash h

01:36:38.139 --> 01:36:40.219
<v Speaker 0>show? What's the h channel and no g

01:36:40.219 --> 01:36:40.939
<v Speaker 0>and m?

01:36:42.940 --> 01:36:45.500
<v Speaker 1>Human readable. I can't even I can't even

01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:46.380
<v Speaker 1>get back in right now.

01:36:50.695 --> 01:36:53.335
<v Speaker 0>We've only 1.1 giga RAM available to the

01:36:53.335 --> 01:36:53.655
<v Speaker 0>machine.

01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:00.980
<v Speaker 0>But that means that

01:37:03.460 --> 01:37:05.780
<v Speaker 0>So how is it to restrict the avail

01:37:05.860 --> 01:37:07.300
<v Speaker 0>memory of it? But that would have to

01:37:07.300 --> 01:37:08.900
<v Speaker 0>be a kernel boot arg, or is there

01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:09.860
<v Speaker 0>another way of doing that?

01:37:12.165 --> 01:37:13.525
<v Speaker 1>You could do cat

01:37:14.005 --> 01:37:14.804
<v Speaker 1>cat

01:37:14.965 --> 01:37:16.725
<v Speaker 1>proc c m d line

01:37:16.885 --> 01:37:18.885
<v Speaker 1>and see if something was defined there.

01:37:21.925 --> 01:37:23.525
<v Speaker 0>No. It's okay. Yeah.

01:37:24.565 --> 01:37:26.085
<v Speaker 1>Think it's gonna be

01:37:27.470 --> 01:37:29.790
<v Speaker 0>the dev cat. Something is the be the

01:37:29.790 --> 01:37:31.550
<v Speaker 1>way that Sorry. I need to go.

01:37:33.150 --> 01:37:35.070
<v Speaker 1>I think it'll be something in

01:37:35.470 --> 01:37:36.910
<v Speaker 1>the way the c groups

01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:39.390
<v Speaker 1>are configured. Like, the c group itself has

01:37:39.390 --> 01:37:42.190
<v Speaker 1>been manipulated for the root c group.

01:37:43.035 --> 01:37:44.875
<v Speaker 0>Now is that root c group gonna be

01:37:44.875 --> 01:37:45.994
<v Speaker 0>process one?

01:37:46.315 --> 01:37:47.835
<v Speaker 0>Like, can we see it by

01:37:49.114 --> 01:37:50.635
<v Speaker 0>broadening around it? Yeah.

01:37:51.755 --> 01:37:52.955
<v Speaker 1>I can make the cat Let's take a

01:37:52.955 --> 01:37:53.114
<v Speaker 1>look.

01:37:58.860 --> 01:37:59.900
<v Speaker 0>I

01:38:02.540 --> 01:38:04.300
<v Speaker 1>think I'm gonna need some help from well,

01:38:04.300 --> 01:38:05.659
<v Speaker 1>Dan, of course, you know,

01:38:06.460 --> 01:38:08.300
<v Speaker 1>this is probably gonna be a thing that

01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:10.460
<v Speaker 1>is a little bit on the edge of

01:38:10.065 --> 01:38:12.465
<v Speaker 1>my experience. So somewhere there

01:38:13.745 --> 01:38:16.225
<v Speaker 0>But you can modify the kernel through the

01:38:16.225 --> 01:38:17.824
<v Speaker 0>SAS interface. Right? Is there a way for

01:38:17.824 --> 01:38:19.585
<v Speaker 0>us to pull something out of here?

01:38:21.025 --> 01:38:22.545
<v Speaker 1>It would probably be under

01:38:23.989 --> 01:38:25.749
<v Speaker 0>Secret. Yeah. Under secret.

01:38:27.429 --> 01:38:28.949
<v Speaker 0>Maybe not. Features.

01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:31.110
<v Speaker 0>Maybe it's m m. Oh, you think it's

01:38:31.110 --> 01:38:33.030
<v Speaker 0>secret features. Hold on. Alright.

01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:34.949
<v Speaker 0>It's really painful to type.

01:38:36.965 --> 01:38:38.885
<v Speaker 1>I can't even get in though. Jason has

01:38:38.885 --> 01:38:40.885
<v Speaker 1>said We even get in. Not secret related.

01:38:40.885 --> 01:38:42.165
<v Speaker 0>So there must be another way to restrict

01:38:42.165 --> 01:38:44.645
<v Speaker 0>the memory on this device. They haven't modified

01:38:44.645 --> 01:38:46.085
<v Speaker 0>the kernel bit parameters.

01:38:47.125 --> 01:38:49.365
<v Speaker 0>We got a comment in chat, proc mem

01:38:49.365 --> 01:38:50.645
<v Speaker 0>info. Let's check that out.

01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:54.320
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:57.919
<v Speaker 0>I got booted out.

01:38:59.599 --> 01:39:01.679
<v Speaker 1>Hey. When you invited me, what username did

01:39:01.679 --> 01:39:02.479
<v Speaker 1>you give me?

01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:04.000
<v Speaker 0>Your Twitter handle.

01:39:05.455 --> 01:39:06.175
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

01:39:07.775 --> 01:39:09.215
<v Speaker 0>Which I'm not sure how to pronounce. Is

01:39:09.215 --> 01:39:11.855
<v Speaker 0>it Maui lion? Maui? How would you say

01:39:11.855 --> 01:39:13.295
<v Speaker 0>it? Maui.

01:39:13.455 --> 01:39:15.775
<v Speaker 1>Maui likes the island I grew up on.

01:39:15.775 --> 01:39:16.574
<v Speaker 1>Maui.

01:39:16.655 --> 01:39:19.295
<v Speaker 1>Lion likes the big cat. Maui lion. Maui

01:39:19.295 --> 01:39:20.094
<v Speaker 0>lion. Got it.

01:39:25.570 --> 01:39:27.890
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We're we're we're gonna have to

01:39:28.610 --> 01:39:31.010
<v Speaker 0>gotta handle this memory thing because

01:39:31.970 --> 01:39:34.290
<v Speaker 0>otherwise debugging this cluster is not gonna

01:39:38.825 --> 01:39:41.545
<v Speaker 1>My intuition is telling me that they they

01:39:41.545 --> 01:39:44.105
<v Speaker 1>did something to, like, the root c group

01:39:44.105 --> 01:39:45.304
<v Speaker 1>that limited

01:39:45.305 --> 01:39:48.185
<v Speaker 1>the available memory to the root c group,

01:39:48.185 --> 01:39:48.825
<v Speaker 1>the top one.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.840
<v Speaker 1>What I think has happened. It's told us

01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:53.040
<v Speaker 0>it's not c group. Well,

01:39:57.760 --> 01:39:59.280
<v Speaker 1>I can't even get back in. So there's

01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:02.080
<v Speaker 1>that. Yeah. I'm gonna try and SSH from

01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:04.880
<v Speaker 0>my terminal and see if that helps. There

01:40:05.515 --> 01:40:07.755
<v Speaker 1>is a run time tunable.

01:40:09.195 --> 01:40:11.195
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. We may have to pull up Google.

01:40:13.355 --> 01:40:14.395
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Okay.

01:40:15.835 --> 01:40:17.115
<v Speaker 0>How Unclaimed.

01:40:19.910 --> 01:40:21.830
<v Speaker 1>What if you do cat proc mem info?

01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Anything?

01:40:22.710 --> 01:40:24.470
<v Speaker 0>Oh, that's what I tried to do before.

01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:25.430
<v Speaker 0>It completely

01:40:25.990 --> 01:40:27.110
<v Speaker 0>died on me.

01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:31.110
<v Speaker 1>VM allocated.

01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:48.159
<v Speaker 1>No. That looks

01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:50.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean, unless I'm missing something, this is

01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:51.520
<v Speaker 1>all looking

01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:53.760
<v Speaker 1>I think our problem our consists is in

01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:55.439
<v Speaker 1>another castle. That's what I think.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.159
<v Speaker 1>So he says it's a runtime tunable.

01:41:00.275 --> 01:41:01.955
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at the configuration of

01:41:01.955 --> 01:41:03.074
<v Speaker 1>container d.

01:41:04.915 --> 01:41:07.395
<v Speaker 1>Can we do system CTL? But my host

01:41:07.395 --> 01:41:09.635
<v Speaker 0>is showing that we don't have memory available.

01:41:10.515 --> 01:41:11.955
<v Speaker 0>I don't think that's his

01:41:12.915 --> 01:41:14.595
<v Speaker 0>container d. Right? Like

01:41:16.090 --> 01:41:18.090
<v Speaker 1>Well, everything is in a namespace. Right? So

01:41:18.090 --> 01:41:19.770
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna be I mean but you just

01:41:19.770 --> 01:41:22.970
<v Speaker 1>said so, like, we have two options. Either

01:41:23.530 --> 01:41:26.170
<v Speaker 1>we're missing something in the way that

01:41:27.930 --> 01:41:29.930
<v Speaker 1>c groups themselves are configured

01:41:30.105 --> 01:41:31.545
<v Speaker 1>at the kernel layer,

01:41:32.265 --> 01:41:33.785
<v Speaker 1>and we need to go chase that down

01:41:33.785 --> 01:41:35.224
<v Speaker 1>and find out where that is.

01:41:36.185 --> 01:41:36.824
<v Speaker 1>Or

01:41:37.625 --> 01:41:40.505
<v Speaker 1>runtime wise, there's something messing us up.

01:41:41.545 --> 01:41:42.185
<v Speaker 1>So

01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:45.120
<v Speaker 1>my intuition tells me that it like, I

01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:47.840
<v Speaker 1>want this to be something where they configured

01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:51.520
<v Speaker 1>the root c group, limited the amount of

01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:52.880
<v Speaker 1>memory available to it.

01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:55.440
<v Speaker 1>You can also you can tune the kernel

01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:56.239
<v Speaker 1>virtual memory.

01:42:01.175 --> 01:42:03.175
<v Speaker 1>Kernel virtual memory.

01:42:08.855 --> 01:42:11.735
<v Speaker 0>Oh, it's SPM. Okay. So

01:42:17.159 --> 01:42:18.199
<v Speaker 1>I'm impressed.

01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Tuning virtual memory.

01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Can you take a look at

01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:25.320
<v Speaker 1>sysctl

01:42:25.655 --> 01:42:27.895
<v Speaker 1>dash a pipe grip?

01:42:29.175 --> 01:42:33.015
<v Speaker 1>Let's

01:42:33.015 --> 01:42:34.614
<v Speaker 1>see. What do I wanna see?

01:42:35.015 --> 01:42:37.735
<v Speaker 0>Mem to dash a just in case. Yeah?

01:42:41.970 --> 01:42:43.889
<v Speaker 0>Maybe that's It's probably VM.

01:42:43.890 --> 01:42:46.290
<v Speaker 1>I wanna see VM min three k bytes.

01:42:53.175 --> 01:42:55.655
<v Speaker 0>Let's try VM instead of mem. Maybe there's

01:42:55.655 --> 01:42:56.614
<v Speaker 0>something missing.

01:43:02.295 --> 01:43:07.000
<v Speaker 1>User reserve k bytes 131072.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.920
<v Speaker 1>What's what's up there?

01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:11.640
<v Speaker 0>Which one? Sorry.

01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:18.200
<v Speaker 1>Min free k bytes is five zero one.

01:43:20.695 --> 01:43:22.295
<v Speaker 0>Oh, so that's saying that we have to

01:43:22.295 --> 01:43:24.614
<v Speaker 0>keep this number of kilobytes available,

01:43:25.175 --> 01:43:26.614
<v Speaker 0>which does not means they can't be allocated

01:43:26.614 --> 01:43:28.935
<v Speaker 0>by the kernel. So we could probably just

01:43:28.935 --> 01:43:29.494
<v Speaker 0>do

01:43:31.735 --> 01:43:34.054
<v Speaker 0>echo zero over the top of that.

01:43:34.535 --> 01:43:35.969
<v Speaker 1>Oh. Well,

01:43:36.930 --> 01:43:39.330
<v Speaker 1>there's a there's a CTL way of resetting

01:43:39.330 --> 01:43:40.610
<v Speaker 1>it to its default,

01:43:40.850 --> 01:43:42.449
<v Speaker 1>which is not what you're doing here.

01:43:43.490 --> 01:43:45.410
<v Speaker 0>I like the sledgehammer approach. I would just

01:43:45.410 --> 01:43:45.969
<v Speaker 0>have

01:43:46.610 --> 01:43:48.290
<v Speaker 0>cat echo as you know, right over the

01:43:48.290 --> 01:43:50.770
<v Speaker 0>top of that and assist our system. But

01:43:52.074 --> 01:43:54.635
<v Speaker 0>how can we reset with this CTL?

01:43:56.474 --> 01:43:57.275
<v Speaker 1>You'll actually

01:44:02.074 --> 01:44:02.554
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.

01:44:04.150 --> 01:44:06.469
<v Speaker 0>Read values from system directory. Yeah.

01:44:08.630 --> 01:44:09.989
<v Speaker 0>That's that's system.

01:44:13.590 --> 01:44:15.429
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's see if that changed our VM

01:44:15.429 --> 01:44:16.309
<v Speaker 0>minimum

01:44:16.949 --> 01:44:17.590
<v Speaker 0>allocatable.

01:44:21.235 --> 01:44:23.074
<v Speaker 0>No. It's still ridiculously

01:44:23.075 --> 01:44:25.155
<v Speaker 0>high. At least I I I think that's

01:44:25.155 --> 01:44:25.715
<v Speaker 0>high.

01:44:26.355 --> 01:44:28.034
<v Speaker 0>Let's try the sledgehammer. Let's

01:44:28.675 --> 01:44:30.595
<v Speaker 1>let's jump into another I would jump into

01:44:30.595 --> 01:44:31.955
<v Speaker 1>another host to see what it is. So

01:44:31.955 --> 01:44:34.034
<v Speaker 1>it's probably it's probably something that's

01:44:34.115 --> 01:44:34.835
<v Speaker 1>reasonable,

01:44:36.650 --> 01:44:38.249
<v Speaker 1>but it should be set at.

01:44:42.090 --> 01:44:45.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of, like, having an

01:44:45.210 --> 01:44:46.969
<v Speaker 1>example of something that should that is working

01:44:46.969 --> 01:44:49.370
<v Speaker 1>the way it's supposed to and then comparing

01:44:49.370 --> 01:44:50.810
<v Speaker 1>that with the thing that is not working

01:44:50.810 --> 01:44:51.585
<v Speaker 1>with it. It.

01:44:52.065 --> 01:44:53.905
<v Speaker 0>I'm not happy with the performance of this

01:44:53.905 --> 01:44:55.425
<v Speaker 0>machine either, to be fair.

01:44:59.185 --> 01:45:00.465
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And free

01:45:01.665 --> 01:45:03.185
<v Speaker 1>So let's make it that. I'd be happier

01:45:03.185 --> 01:45:04.179
<v Speaker 1>with that change.

01:45:04.420 --> 01:45:06.020
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So echo

01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:09.860
<v Speaker 0>oh, I didn't copy properly. 7584.

01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:12.500
<v Speaker 1>You can echo it in, or you can

01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:15.220
<v Speaker 1>also do system d system CTL dash w,

01:45:15.855 --> 01:45:18.815
<v Speaker 1>and then the argument equals the value. Either

01:45:18.815 --> 01:45:20.415
<v Speaker 1>way either way works.

01:45:22.255 --> 01:45:23.215
<v Speaker 0>What

01:45:23.215 --> 01:45:23.935
<v Speaker 0>was it?

01:45:24.175 --> 01:45:25.135
<v Speaker 0>Men

01:45:25.135 --> 01:45:26.735
<v Speaker 0>three Three k bytes.

01:45:29.295 --> 01:45:29.615
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

01:45:34.929 --> 01:45:38.050
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Okay. Cool. And that's already snappy,

01:45:38.290 --> 01:45:40.610
<v Speaker 0>like Now, that's like a top. Yeah.

01:45:43.410 --> 01:45:45.324
<v Speaker 1>Okay. But In fact, we could run out

01:45:45.485 --> 01:45:48.284
<v Speaker 1>back in. Free dash h. Yeah.

01:45:50.045 --> 01:45:52.525
<v Speaker 0>We've got available sexy kick there. Okay. We're

01:45:52.525 --> 01:45:55.165
<v Speaker 0>back to business. Let's

01:45:55.165 --> 01:45:57.005
<v Speaker 1>see if you can join the session again.

01:45:57.965 --> 01:45:58.525
<v Speaker 1>For this.

01:46:00.210 --> 01:46:01.250
<v Speaker 1>And

01:46:06.530 --> 01:46:07.409
<v Speaker 1>I

01:46:07.650 --> 01:46:08.610
<v Speaker 1>am

01:46:13.570 --> 01:46:15.090
<v Speaker 1>options, join session.

01:46:17.815 --> 01:46:19.015
<v Speaker 1>Back in business.

01:46:20.535 --> 01:46:21.975
<v Speaker 1>So sneaky.

01:46:22.775 --> 01:46:24.135
<v Speaker 1>So sneaky.

01:46:25.175 --> 01:46:26.775
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So I guess what we wanna do

01:46:26.775 --> 01:46:29.095
<v Speaker 0>now is get the Kubelet and API server

01:46:29.095 --> 01:46:30.615
<v Speaker 0>back into the

01:46:31.770 --> 01:46:33.690
<v Speaker 0>manifest directory and see if we can find

01:46:33.690 --> 01:46:35.449
<v Speaker 0>some sense of normality here.

01:46:36.730 --> 01:46:37.689
<v Speaker 0>One hopes.

01:46:43.050 --> 01:46:43.369
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

01:47:06.380 --> 01:47:07.820
<v Speaker 1>Hey.

01:47:09.980 --> 01:47:10.620
<v Speaker 0>Copy?

01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:12.540
<v Speaker 1>Yes. Let's see.

01:47:16.595 --> 01:47:19.555
<v Speaker 0>Thanks,

01:47:19.555 --> 01:47:20.195
<v Speaker 0>Jason.

01:47:21.395 --> 01:47:22.915
<v Speaker 0>Normal is relative.

01:47:23.155 --> 01:47:24.915
<v Speaker 0>That fills me with great hope.

01:47:29.710 --> 01:47:32.030
<v Speaker 0>Let's see. I'll be right I'll be right

01:47:32.030 --> 01:47:34.110
<v Speaker 1>back in just one second. Okay? Of course.

01:47:34.110 --> 01:47:35.469
<v Speaker 1>If you wanna see if the API server

01:47:35.469 --> 01:47:37.789
<v Speaker 1>comes up, that'd be awesome. Alright. No worries.

01:47:41.790 --> 01:47:43.869
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So the API server is back in

01:47:43.869 --> 01:47:44.270
<v Speaker 0>here.

01:47:45.185 --> 01:47:47.105
<v Speaker 0>I guess I should use crack control.

01:47:47.185 --> 01:47:47.824
<v Speaker 0>Nothing

01:47:49.025 --> 01:47:49.824
<v Speaker 0>there.

01:47:56.625 --> 01:47:57.905
<v Speaker 0>Oh, why

01:48:00.110 --> 01:48:02.590
<v Speaker 0>it just slow? Am I being very impatient?

01:48:02.590 --> 01:48:03.150
<v Speaker 0>No,

01:48:07.950 --> 01:48:09.230
<v Speaker 0>there we go. Nice.

01:48:10.270 --> 01:48:11.150
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

01:48:11.150 --> 01:48:13.150
<v Speaker 0>So we have an API server.

01:48:14.855 --> 01:48:17.094
<v Speaker 0>I can't remember if we took this link,

01:48:17.094 --> 01:48:18.534
<v Speaker 0>but let's see if we can do

01:48:21.094 --> 01:48:22.855
<v Speaker 0>We can. Okay.

01:48:24.775 --> 01:48:26.614
<v Speaker 0>We've got two nodes not ready.

01:48:32.570 --> 01:48:34.570
<v Speaker 0>Ship system namespace.

01:48:35.530 --> 01:48:37.370
<v Speaker 0>Obviously, missing a couple of things, but it

01:48:37.370 --> 01:48:38.490
<v Speaker 0>doesn't look too bad.

01:48:39.930 --> 01:48:41.290
<v Speaker 0>And my actual application,

01:48:44.875 --> 01:48:48.235
<v Speaker 0>database is terminating, let's

01:48:48.235 --> 01:48:49.275
<v Speaker 0>try and move it over the rest of

01:48:49.275 --> 01:48:50.395
<v Speaker 0>these manifests.

01:49:00.450 --> 01:49:02.370
<v Speaker 0>Like I definitely took things nice and slow

01:49:02.370 --> 01:49:03.890
<v Speaker 0>and one by one and was trying to

01:49:03.890 --> 01:49:05.330
<v Speaker 0>verify things and I just gonna

01:49:06.690 --> 01:49:07.490
<v Speaker 0>it'll be fine.

01:49:09.514 --> 01:49:13.514
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Scheduler, good. Controller manager, good. Oh, running.

01:49:13.594 --> 01:49:14.475
<v Speaker 0>Once they could just

01:49:19.594 --> 01:49:20.315
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:23.840
<v Speaker 0>Don't keep system namespace.

01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:28.640
<v Speaker 0>I fixed it all. Get off the hook.

01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:30.400
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you can't hear me yet. Oh,

01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:32.000
<v Speaker 0>you can.

01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:35.760
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

01:49:36.995 --> 01:49:39.395
<v Speaker 0>So I've moved Alright. Job done. Too easy.

01:49:39.795 --> 01:49:42.115
<v Speaker 0>Moved those manifest back. The API server came

01:49:42.115 --> 01:49:44.195
<v Speaker 0>up. I put the controller manager, the scheduler

01:49:44.195 --> 01:49:46.195
<v Speaker 0>back end. They appear to be coming up.

01:49:46.435 --> 01:49:48.435
<v Speaker 0>We can speak to the API server.

01:49:49.350 --> 01:49:51.350
<v Speaker 0>Control manager's not quite healthy yet, but I

01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:52.550
<v Speaker 0>think it's getting there.

01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:55.270
<v Speaker 0>We still I ran and get nodes. We

01:49:55.270 --> 01:49:56.630
<v Speaker 0>still got two of them down. There's still

01:49:56.630 --> 01:49:58.310
<v Speaker 0>two worker nodes that need a little bit

01:49:58.310 --> 01:49:59.510
<v Speaker 0>of CPR.

01:50:01.205 --> 01:50:03.285
<v Speaker 0>But the Kubernetes control point does seem to

01:50:03.285 --> 01:50:03.764
<v Speaker 0>be

01:50:04.565 --> 01:50:05.284
<v Speaker 0>okay.

01:50:05.845 --> 01:50:07.204
<v Speaker 0>I will say okay.

01:50:09.845 --> 01:50:11.045
<v Speaker 1>Fine. Okay.

01:50:11.525 --> 01:50:12.645
<v Speaker 0>So we probably

01:50:12.805 --> 01:50:14.805
<v Speaker 0>wanna jump on to D R 44 and

01:50:14.805 --> 01:50:16.645
<v Speaker 0>Q P Q

01:50:16.300 --> 01:50:17.820
<v Speaker 0>Unless there's something else on here that we

01:50:17.820 --> 01:50:18.940
<v Speaker 0>need to check out.

01:50:26.940 --> 01:50:27.420
<v Speaker 1>Dang it.

01:50:30.015 --> 01:50:31.375
<v Speaker 1>Was really close on that one too. You

01:50:31.375 --> 01:50:31.935
<v Speaker 1>know? That's

01:50:32.415 --> 01:50:34.414
<v Speaker 0>Getting better. Yeah. There we go.

01:50:38.335 --> 01:50:40.735
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So I think you're right. I think

01:50:41.054 --> 01:50:43.054
<v Speaker 1>what I wanna see

01:50:46.380 --> 01:50:48.540
<v Speaker 1>just look at these other two mental. I

01:50:48.540 --> 01:50:50.220
<v Speaker 1>think I would like to just real quick

01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:51.900
<v Speaker 1>for my own

01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:54.700
<v Speaker 1>verification.

01:51:03.244 --> 01:51:05.804
<v Speaker 0>Is that controller list that suspect?

01:51:09.570 --> 01:51:11.889
<v Speaker 0>No. That's maybe okay. I just that star

01:51:11.889 --> 01:51:13.649
<v Speaker 0>kinda threw me. Yeah.

01:51:16.770 --> 01:51:17.809
<v Speaker 1>That looks okay.

01:51:19.250 --> 01:51:20.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay. And then cat.

01:51:31.155 --> 01:51:32.835
<v Speaker 0>Pretty simple. Okay.

01:51:35.075 --> 01:51:36.995
<v Speaker 1>Oh, okay. Now it's okay.

01:51:38.755 --> 01:51:39.235
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

01:51:48.330 --> 01:51:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Just out of curiosity.

01:52:17.330 --> 01:52:18.690
<v Speaker 0>Nothing suspicious

01:52:18.690 --> 01:52:19.409
<v Speaker 0>there.

01:52:20.290 --> 01:52:22.050
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you're looking for pod security policy.

01:52:24.335 --> 01:52:26.335
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I was just curious. These are places

01:52:26.335 --> 01:52:28.175
<v Speaker 1>where I I would, like

01:52:29.135 --> 01:52:30.255
<v Speaker 1>feel like one of the things I should

01:52:30.255 --> 01:52:32.175
<v Speaker 1>have done earlier was this one for sure

01:52:33.855 --> 01:52:35.615
<v Speaker 1>because we are on a Cilium cluster.

01:52:36.670 --> 01:52:38.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh, alright. Okay. Well, let's go see if

01:52:38.910 --> 01:52:40.430
<v Speaker 1>we can get our notes back. Get get

01:52:40.430 --> 01:52:40.989
<v Speaker 1>all

01:52:42.030 --> 01:52:43.150
<v Speaker 1>get notes.

01:52:44.670 --> 01:52:47.230
<v Speaker 1>Let's jump over to D R 44 B.

01:52:47.310 --> 01:52:49.070
<v Speaker 0>There's a session open if you just wanna

01:52:49.070 --> 01:52:49.710
<v Speaker 0>join that one.

01:52:50.445 --> 01:52:52.284
<v Speaker 1>Oh, cool. I'll just join that one.

01:52:52.764 --> 01:52:54.045
<v Speaker 1>Do you wanna start a session on the

01:52:54.045 --> 01:52:55.965
<v Speaker 1>other one too? Yep. Got it.

01:53:00.764 --> 01:53:02.125
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We have sessions.

01:53:05.930 --> 01:53:07.610
<v Speaker 0>I'm on DR44B

01:53:07.610 --> 01:53:08.489
<v Speaker 0>right now.

01:53:13.690 --> 01:53:15.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure what I'm on.

01:53:16.810 --> 01:53:18.570
<v Speaker 1>Hold on. Close that. Config here.

01:53:20.405 --> 01:53:22.965
<v Speaker 1>KDR443

01:53:26.245 --> 01:53:27.925
<v Speaker 1>active sessions. There we go. Now I see

01:53:27.925 --> 01:53:30.645
<v Speaker 1>it. Alright. So 443.

01:53:31.605 --> 01:53:34.005
<v Speaker 0>We have a kubelet. It's active and running.

01:53:34.760 --> 01:53:36.119
<v Speaker 0>Nothing suspicious.

01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:38.199
<v Speaker 1>Logs.

01:53:38.199 --> 01:53:39.800
<v Speaker 1>Request that. Reload.

01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:40.440
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

01:53:46.040 --> 01:53:48.040
<v Speaker 0>We have a kubelet, but we're not ready.

01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:10.869
<v Speaker 1>It's a good sign.

01:54:11.590 --> 01:54:12.309
<v Speaker 0>No errors.

01:54:15.075 --> 01:54:16.594
<v Speaker 1>No obvious errors.

01:54:18.195 --> 01:54:19.155
<v Speaker 0>That's true.

01:54:19.955 --> 01:54:21.155
<v Speaker 0>Oh, there we go.

01:54:23.875 --> 01:54:24.755
<v Speaker 1>Cannot

01:54:25.475 --> 01:54:28.035
<v Speaker 1>connection refused

01:54:27.090 --> 01:54:28.770
<v Speaker 1>on the docker socket on the container d

01:54:28.770 --> 01:54:30.929
<v Speaker 1>socket. Yeah. It can't speak to container d.

01:54:30.929 --> 01:54:31.250
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

01:54:44.065 --> 01:54:44.785
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's not running.

01:54:56.800 --> 01:54:57.760
<v Speaker 0>Think we're

01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:00.079
<v Speaker 0>don't think be that easy though. No. I

01:55:00.079 --> 01:55:01.360
<v Speaker 0>don't think that's gonna run for long.

01:55:10.094 --> 01:55:12.014
<v Speaker 1>That's that thing again. Okay.

01:55:12.815 --> 01:55:15.295
<v Speaker 0>I'm

01:55:15.295 --> 01:55:16.895
<v Speaker 0>gonna add that to my automation for spinning

01:55:16.895 --> 01:55:18.335
<v Speaker 0>up these clusters so we don't have to

01:55:18.335 --> 01:55:19.695
<v Speaker 0>configure every single thing.

01:55:45.305 --> 01:55:47.705
<v Speaker 1>So a couple of things we've been doing

01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:50.680
<v Speaker 1>in this session, which I've really been enjoying.

01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:52.760
<v Speaker 1>Right? One is that we are in our

01:55:52.760 --> 01:55:55.239
<v Speaker 1>own hurry. We're not in anybody else's hurry.

01:55:56.280 --> 01:55:58.360
<v Speaker 1>Right? I know that that's hard to accomplish

01:55:58.360 --> 01:55:59.080
<v Speaker 1>sometimes,

01:56:00.040 --> 01:56:00.600
<v Speaker 1>but

01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:03.160
<v Speaker 1>it definitely brings some

01:56:05.005 --> 01:56:07.085
<v Speaker 0>I'm enjoying the to what we're trying. The

01:56:07.085 --> 01:56:09.645
<v Speaker 0>chillness and the the thinking and the the

01:56:09.645 --> 01:56:11.245
<v Speaker 0>talking process.

01:56:11.885 --> 01:56:14.125
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's it's it's working well. You know

01:56:14.125 --> 01:56:16.285
<v Speaker 1>what our targets are? Like, we're moving through

01:56:16.285 --> 01:56:18.205
<v Speaker 1>it. Like, one of the things that is,

01:56:18.205 --> 01:56:20.045
<v Speaker 1>like, one of the things that that I

01:56:20.045 --> 01:56:20.525
<v Speaker 1>think

01:56:21.110 --> 01:56:23.110
<v Speaker 1>the show probably could use a little bit

01:56:23.110 --> 01:56:25.350
<v Speaker 1>of is, like, just remember that, like, no

01:56:25.350 --> 01:56:27.670
<v Speaker 1>matter what, like, everybody in this audience, shout

01:56:27.670 --> 01:56:29.190
<v Speaker 1>out if you're with the audience,

01:56:29.350 --> 01:56:31.830
<v Speaker 1>is is rooting for us. Like, everybody is

01:56:31.830 --> 01:56:33.750
<v Speaker 1>rooting for us. We can't we literally cannot

01:56:33.750 --> 01:56:36.935
<v Speaker 1>fail in this scenario. There's absolutely no way

01:56:36.935 --> 01:56:37.735
<v Speaker 1>to do it.

01:56:38.614 --> 01:56:40.054
<v Speaker 1>But no matter how hard it looks like

01:56:40.054 --> 01:56:42.054
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be or how difficult it

01:56:42.054 --> 01:56:45.175
<v Speaker 1>is, like, know that you're that that that

01:56:45.175 --> 01:56:47.880
<v Speaker 1>things are always gonna be on your side.

01:56:48.440 --> 01:56:50.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna jump back over to this

01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:54.200
<v Speaker 1>master and see if we've cleared this problem.

01:56:56.520 --> 01:56:57.080
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Session.

01:57:02.265 --> 01:57:03.304
<v Speaker 1>Odes.

01:57:04.105 --> 01:57:07.145
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. K. We got E r 44 b

01:57:07.145 --> 01:57:09.065
<v Speaker 1>back. Let's take a look at q p

01:57:09.225 --> 01:57:11.145
<v Speaker 0>So starting container d was all we had

01:57:11.145 --> 01:57:11.705
<v Speaker 0>to do there?

01:57:13.860 --> 01:57:15.539
<v Speaker 1>I know. I know. I'm I'm

01:57:17.699 --> 01:57:18.659
<v Speaker 1>I'm

01:57:18.659 --> 01:57:21.380
<v Speaker 1>nervous. I've got suspicious eyes for sure on

01:57:21.380 --> 01:57:22.499
<v Speaker 0>that one. But

01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:25.139
<v Speaker 0>alright. Let's I'll take it. Well, it's it's

01:57:25.139 --> 01:57:27.380
<v Speaker 1>a subtle trick. Like, they probably expected that

01:57:27.380 --> 01:57:29.255
<v Speaker 1>to be more subtle than it was because,

01:57:29.255 --> 01:57:29.655
<v Speaker 1>like,

01:57:30.375 --> 01:57:31.974
<v Speaker 1>the way it works, like, it would look

01:57:31.974 --> 01:57:33.735
<v Speaker 1>like things are still running. Right? Pods are

01:57:33.735 --> 01:57:35.894
<v Speaker 1>still active and running. Why isn't it working?

01:57:35.895 --> 01:57:37.974
<v Speaker 1>But you if you didn't know that container

01:57:37.974 --> 01:57:39.494
<v Speaker 1>d was broken, then it might take you

01:57:39.494 --> 01:57:40.135
<v Speaker 1>a while to get there.

01:57:41.190 --> 01:57:43.030
<v Speaker 0>That's true. So And it's easy to overlook

01:57:43.030 --> 01:57:45.030
<v Speaker 0>the obvious. Definitely. I think I've done that

01:57:45.030 --> 01:57:45.989
<v Speaker 0>time and time again.

01:57:46.790 --> 01:57:48.870
<v Speaker 0>Alright. What are you thinking? We should jump

01:57:48.870 --> 01:57:50.870
<v Speaker 0>out to q p q? You wanna get

01:57:50.870 --> 01:57:52.150
<v Speaker 0>that one? Yeah.

01:57:52.390 --> 01:57:54.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm a jump on the q p q.

01:57:54.070 --> 01:57:56.505
<v Speaker 1>Exactly. There's a active session there if you

01:57:56.505 --> 01:57:57.625
<v Speaker 0>just join it.

01:57:58.745 --> 01:58:00.665
<v Speaker 1>That is where I am. Oh, looks like

01:58:00.665 --> 01:58:01.225
<v Speaker 1>our

01:58:02.905 --> 01:58:04.985
<v Speaker 1>oh, wait a minute. It says it's killed.

01:58:05.625 --> 01:58:06.745
<v Speaker 1>Why did it say killed?

01:58:07.430 --> 01:58:08.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:58:08.310 --> 01:58:09.350
<v Speaker 1>Would have killed?

01:58:10.470 --> 01:58:12.630
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I see. It's a reload. Uh-huh.

01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:18.310
<v Speaker 1>Why why is that being killed, do you

01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.550
<v Speaker 1>think?

01:58:28.864 --> 01:58:31.184
<v Speaker 0>You're looking for suspicious processes?

01:58:32.465 --> 01:58:33.265
<v Speaker 1>I am.

01:58:50.365 --> 01:58:52.125
<v Speaker 0>Smiley face from Jason.

01:58:53.565 --> 01:58:55.645
<v Speaker 0>Assuming that's, like, a suspicious processes.

01:59:08.050 --> 01:59:09.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I think

01:59:12.530 --> 01:59:13.650
<v Speaker 1>that's our teleport.

01:59:19.915 --> 01:59:22.555
<v Speaker 1>Why is it saying killed? Something is

01:59:25.835 --> 01:59:27.755
<v Speaker 1>the other possibility the other one was so

01:59:27.755 --> 01:59:29.435
<v Speaker 1>easy, and then this was really where they're

01:59:29.435 --> 01:59:31.115
<v Speaker 1>gonna make it shine for us. Alright. So

01:59:31.115 --> 01:59:31.675
<v Speaker 1>let's see.

01:59:51.135 --> 01:59:53.775
<v Speaker 1>Something is sending the cubelet a kill. A

01:59:53.775 --> 01:59:54.895
<v Speaker 0>sick kill. Yeah.

01:59:58.975 --> 02:00:00.175
<v Speaker 1>That could be fun to find.

02:00:03.810 --> 02:00:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Hoping that I would see, like, you know,

02:00:05.730 --> 02:00:08.290
<v Speaker 1>some dumb little script somewhere, like, sending a

02:00:08.290 --> 02:00:08.929
<v Speaker 1>kill.

02:00:13.409 --> 02:00:15.170
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Well, Jason did leave us a comment.

02:00:15.170 --> 02:00:17.705
<v Speaker 0>He said, why honk with a suspicious process

02:00:17.705 --> 02:00:19.465
<v Speaker 0>when you can have the system honk for

02:00:19.465 --> 02:00:19.945
<v Speaker 0>you?

02:00:21.305 --> 02:00:23.065
<v Speaker 1>Fair.

02:00:25.065 --> 02:00:25.545
<v Speaker 1>Fair.

02:00:38.070 --> 02:00:39.750
<v Speaker 0>Memory max 64 k.

02:00:45.085 --> 02:00:45.885
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

02:00:48.925 --> 02:00:49.805
<v Speaker 1>I would do it.

02:01:10.125 --> 02:01:10.844
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

02:01:12.765 --> 02:01:14.364
<v Speaker 0>So good. Terrible people.

02:01:19.085 --> 02:01:19.965
<v Speaker 1>Oh,

02:01:22.845 --> 02:01:23.805
<v Speaker 1>they even reload.

02:01:24.510 --> 02:01:27.150
<v Speaker 0>Well, the sick kill wasn't on because

02:01:27.150 --> 02:01:28.909
<v Speaker 0>of a bad setting.

02:01:29.230 --> 02:01:31.309
<v Speaker 0>And I agree Bill Gates quote there from

02:01:31.309 --> 02:01:33.389
<v Speaker 0>Jason in the chat, who needs more than

02:01:33.389 --> 02:01:34.670
<v Speaker 0>64 k of memory?

02:01:38.594 --> 02:01:40.435
<v Speaker 1>Right. I mean That was amusing. That was

02:01:40.435 --> 02:01:41.155
<v Speaker 0>amusing.

02:01:42.675 --> 02:01:45.074
<v Speaker 0>I'm

02:01:45.074 --> 02:01:46.994
<v Speaker 0>gonna jump on to the control plane just

02:01:46.994 --> 02:01:48.275
<v Speaker 0>to run get nodes and

02:01:48.780 --> 02:01:51.179
<v Speaker 0>we've lost a D r d r 44

02:01:51.179 --> 02:01:53.500
<v Speaker 0>has died on us again. Our our starting

02:01:53.500 --> 02:01:55.020
<v Speaker 0>of container d I do not think was

02:01:55.020 --> 02:01:55.659
<v Speaker 0>enough.

02:01:57.420 --> 02:01:58.219
<v Speaker 1>Excellent.

02:01:58.300 --> 02:02:00.059
<v Speaker 1>Excellent. But we do have

02:02:02.485 --> 02:02:03.844
<v Speaker 0>q q ready,

02:02:04.645 --> 02:02:05.685
<v Speaker 0>if that helps.

02:02:05.845 --> 02:02:06.565
<v Speaker 1>Oh,

02:02:07.365 --> 02:02:08.645
<v Speaker 1>we'll leave that one. We'll leave q q

02:02:08.645 --> 02:02:10.245
<v Speaker 1>working itself out for a while, and then

02:02:10.245 --> 02:02:11.525
<v Speaker 1>we'll jump back over to

02:02:12.085 --> 02:02:13.605
<v Speaker 1>I think that would have been as swift

02:02:13.605 --> 02:02:16.165
<v Speaker 0>as possible. But let's jump on to D

02:02:16.165 --> 02:02:17.739
<v Speaker 0>R 44.

02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:19.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

02:02:21.180 --> 02:02:22.300
<v Speaker 0>That's 99.

02:02:22.460 --> 02:02:24.060
<v Speaker 0>I still have a d r four. Yeah.

02:02:24.060 --> 02:02:25.100
<v Speaker 0>There we go. Nice.

02:02:33.585 --> 02:02:35.264
<v Speaker 0>So we're seeing

02:02:35.505 --> 02:02:36.224
<v Speaker 0>oh,

02:02:38.385 --> 02:02:39.905
<v Speaker 0>network namespace. Too

02:02:40.385 --> 02:02:41.744
<v Speaker 0>many open files.

02:02:42.864 --> 02:02:44.465
<v Speaker 0>I feel like when we start to container

02:02:44.465 --> 02:02:45.824
<v Speaker 0>d, we've let list a dragon.

02:02:50.330 --> 02:02:51.610
<v Speaker 1>I think you might be right.

02:02:55.690 --> 02:02:58.809
<v Speaker 1>Too many open files. Check network namespace. Close.

02:02:58.969 --> 02:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>CNI.

02:03:00.330 --> 02:03:03.369
<v Speaker 1>Too many open files. Okay. So

02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:22.280
<v Speaker 1>That probably wasn't what I wanted. I want

02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:23.960
<v Speaker 1>let's let's see.

02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:27.080
<v Speaker 1>We dash I.

02:03:38.705 --> 02:03:40.145
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you're trying to do the I nodes

02:03:40.145 --> 02:03:41.905
<v Speaker 0>as d f dash I. Yeah.

02:03:43.665 --> 02:03:45.425
<v Speaker 0>At least get dot 2%.

02:03:52.030 --> 02:03:52.989
<v Speaker 1>So freeze.

02:04:04.265 --> 02:04:06.344
<v Speaker 0>I mean, we maybe it's a good limit?

02:04:08.905 --> 02:04:10.025
<v Speaker 1>It could be.

02:04:11.864 --> 02:04:13.225
<v Speaker 0>Could be to

02:04:17.010 --> 02:04:17.809
<v Speaker 0>max,

02:04:18.610 --> 02:04:19.729
<v Speaker 0>what's it called?

02:04:21.650 --> 02:04:22.929
<v Speaker 0>Oh, fail max.

02:04:23.250 --> 02:04:24.449
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no. Okay.

02:04:26.050 --> 02:04:27.330
<v Speaker 1>That's that's pretty big.

02:04:33.105 --> 02:04:34.864
<v Speaker 1>Too many open files.

02:04:40.065 --> 02:04:42.465
<v Speaker 1>File ticket usage for snapshot. Oh, wait. You

02:04:42.465 --> 02:04:45.025
<v Speaker 1>know what? Usage for snapshot is probably a

02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:45.599
<v Speaker 1>a red herring.

02:04:53.199 --> 02:04:54.000
<v Speaker 0>Is

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:54.800
<v Speaker 0>that in the logs?

02:04:57.775 --> 02:05:00.415
<v Speaker 1>Now this one is kinda checked, though.

02:05:04.895 --> 02:05:06.415
<v Speaker 0>Where are you Yeah. We see too many

02:05:06.735 --> 02:05:07.135
<v Speaker 1>oh,

02:05:07.935 --> 02:05:09.295
<v Speaker 1>sorry. I was scrolling back up in the

02:05:09.295 --> 02:05:09.455
<v Speaker 1>history. Yeah.

02:05:10.960 --> 02:05:12.719
<v Speaker 0>We don't share our scroller portion of that.

02:05:12.719 --> 02:05:12.960
<v Speaker 0>So

02:05:14.239 --> 02:05:15.599
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That is unfortunate.

02:05:35.155 --> 02:05:36.755
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I don't think it I don't know.

02:05:39.040 --> 02:05:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't particularly like that. Yeah?

02:05:50.560 --> 02:05:52.160
<v Speaker 1>Lots of too many open files.

02:06:16.469 --> 02:06:18.310
<v Speaker 1>It shut down again. Right? No. It's still

02:06:18.310 --> 02:06:20.469
<v Speaker 1>running. Yeah. It looks okay on my end.

02:06:21.555 --> 02:06:22.515
<v Speaker 0>I'm just

02:06:22.755 --> 02:06:24.515
<v Speaker 0>scrolling, scrolling, scrolling.

02:06:27.475 --> 02:06:29.475
<v Speaker 1>I'm take a look at when we started

02:06:29.475 --> 02:06:31.315
<v Speaker 0>container d. Right? So we need to know

02:06:31.315 --> 02:06:34.515
<v Speaker 0>what containers are running and maybe find a

02:06:35.955 --> 02:06:36.675
<v Speaker 0>bad apple.

02:06:40.179 --> 02:06:40.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

02:06:41.780 --> 02:06:42.579
<v Speaker 1>Possibly.

02:06:42.980 --> 02:06:45.139
<v Speaker 1>Oh, you know what? You were just saying

02:06:45.139 --> 02:06:45.780
<v Speaker 1>this yourself.

02:06:50.895 --> 02:06:52.255
<v Speaker 1>Let's see Kubernetes.

02:06:54.735 --> 02:06:55.935
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

02:06:57.855 --> 02:07:00.335
<v Speaker 1>That's good. Try dash here. I mean

02:07:03.455 --> 02:07:04.095
<v Speaker 1>Do you put

02:07:07.350 --> 02:07:08.310
<v Speaker 1>It's

02:07:12.230 --> 02:07:13.190
<v Speaker 1>the right place.

02:07:14.710 --> 02:07:15.990
<v Speaker 0>What if this starts with a dot?

02:07:20.265 --> 02:07:21.065
<v Speaker 1>Wait. What?

02:07:22.105 --> 02:07:23.465
<v Speaker 0>I was just curious if they had a

02:07:23.465 --> 02:07:24.664
<v Speaker 0>head and dot fail.

02:07:25.625 --> 02:07:27.545
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I don't think we get caught.

02:07:28.344 --> 02:07:29.145
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

02:07:31.545 --> 02:07:32.744
<v Speaker 0>Could they have over

02:07:33.530 --> 02:07:35.130
<v Speaker 0>could it be a fake fail system? You

02:07:35.130 --> 02:07:36.890
<v Speaker 1>know what? Let's

02:07:36.890 --> 02:07:38.570
<v Speaker 1>look at this real quick. Let's go back

02:07:38.570 --> 02:07:39.930
<v Speaker 1>to master for a sec for the control

02:07:39.930 --> 02:07:42.330
<v Speaker 1>plane for a second. Sorry. Keep it all.

02:07:43.370 --> 02:07:45.130
<v Speaker 1>Subscribe node.

02:07:46.490 --> 02:07:48.195
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you want to see what states

02:07:48.275 --> 02:07:50.435
<v Speaker 0>Cisco okay. That's a good idea.

02:08:01.160 --> 02:08:02.520
<v Speaker 1>Saying node ready.

02:08:12.280 --> 02:08:13.720
<v Speaker 0>Rawkode notes again.

02:08:16.605 --> 02:08:19.164
<v Speaker 1>Hold on. Reading this. Memory pressure, false.

02:08:19.565 --> 02:08:21.005
<v Speaker 1>Disc pressure, false.

02:08:21.645 --> 02:08:24.044
<v Speaker 1>Grid pressure, false. Ready, true.

02:08:25.645 --> 02:08:27.724
<v Speaker 1>Keyblade is posting a ready status.

02:08:28.045 --> 02:08:29.085
<v Speaker 1>Did I go to the wrong one?

02:08:31.570 --> 02:08:33.409
<v Speaker 1>I don't get notes.

02:08:37.650 --> 02:08:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Having that

02:08:39.090 --> 02:08:40.930
<v Speaker 1>dining on red herring kind of feeling.

02:08:49.954 --> 02:08:51.794
<v Speaker 0>Inter intermittent problem.

02:08:54.275 --> 02:08:55.235
<v Speaker 1>That's fine, really.

02:08:57.040 --> 02:08:58.159
<v Speaker 1>The pods.

02:08:58.480 --> 02:09:00.159
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Should we test my app? Yes.

02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:02.159
<v Speaker 1>We should.

02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:08.880
<v Speaker 1>Remember on your you're on 13 now.

02:09:12.255 --> 02:09:13.135
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

02:09:13.135 --> 02:09:15.295
<v Speaker 0>I'm setting up the port forward,

02:09:19.375 --> 02:09:20.494
<v Speaker 0>heading the web,

02:09:21.215 --> 02:09:22.735
<v Speaker 0>and we got version one.

02:09:24.490 --> 02:09:26.730
<v Speaker 1>Okay. But that means we're hitting the database.

02:09:27.290 --> 02:09:29.690
<v Speaker 0>It does. So now we can do a

02:09:29.690 --> 02:09:31.370
<v Speaker 0>edit deployment

02:09:32.090 --> 02:09:32.969
<v Speaker 0>clustered.

02:09:37.530 --> 02:09:38.330
<v Speaker 0>Version two.

02:09:43.925 --> 02:09:46.005
<v Speaker 1>Continue creating for past scheduling.

02:09:51.445 --> 02:09:53.685
<v Speaker 0>Mental note to pre fill the images. Although,

02:09:54.780 --> 02:09:56.619
<v Speaker 0>people may mess with them, I guess.

02:10:03.579 --> 02:10:04.699
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

02:10:06.619 --> 02:10:07.179
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

02:10:12.805 --> 02:10:13.525
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

02:10:13.925 --> 02:10:15.605
<v Speaker 1>Are you are you using fish or c

02:10:15.605 --> 02:10:16.405
<v Speaker 1>s h?

02:10:17.605 --> 02:10:19.125
<v Speaker 0>C s h.

02:10:19.525 --> 02:10:22.245
<v Speaker 0>That's all. There we go. Oh, it's actually

02:10:22.245 --> 02:10:22.485
<v Speaker 0>gonna

02:10:24.690 --> 02:10:26.210
<v Speaker 0>I worked on this cluster.

02:10:26.450 --> 02:10:27.410
<v Speaker 1>Nice.

02:10:27.410 --> 02:10:28.849
<v Speaker 0>We got the happy dance

02:10:29.090 --> 02:10:30.450
<v Speaker 0>even though I'm not smiling. I like the

02:10:30.450 --> 02:10:31.170
<v Speaker 1>happy dance.

02:10:32.450 --> 02:10:34.530
<v Speaker 1>May your bag be bountiful and your success

02:10:34.530 --> 02:10:35.010
<v Speaker 1>be great.

02:10:36.934 --> 02:10:39.494
<v Speaker 1>I love it. Is that us? Well, heck.

02:10:40.934 --> 02:10:41.894
<v Speaker 1>Jason,

02:10:42.375 --> 02:10:43.494
<v Speaker 1>how are we doing?

02:10:44.934 --> 02:10:47.255
<v Speaker 0>I think we got all awful.

02:10:47.255 --> 02:10:49.254
<v Speaker 1>It says down to the final honk,

02:10:49.735 --> 02:10:50.695
<v Speaker 1>but then it says the.

02:10:52.909 --> 02:10:55.150
<v Speaker 1>Something's

02:10:55.150 --> 02:10:56.030
<v Speaker 1>weird here.

02:10:56.670 --> 02:10:57.469
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Especially

02:10:58.429 --> 02:11:00.909
<v Speaker 0>with that d r 44 node, which was

02:11:00.909 --> 02:11:03.469
<v Speaker 0>ready, unready with too many open files and

02:11:03.469 --> 02:11:04.590
<v Speaker 0>then ready again.

02:11:06.755 --> 02:11:08.435
<v Speaker 0>I'm sure if we left it long enough

02:11:08.435 --> 02:11:11.074
<v Speaker 0>that our d r 44 b would maybe

02:11:11.074 --> 02:11:13.074
<v Speaker 0>disappear, but for now it's healthy. Our app

02:11:13.074 --> 02:11:14.594
<v Speaker 0>is working. We did our upgrade.

02:11:14.755 --> 02:11:16.434
<v Speaker 0>I'm calling that a win. Yeah.

02:11:16.835 --> 02:11:18.355
<v Speaker 1>I think we're I think we're gonna fall

02:11:18.355 --> 02:11:20.675
<v Speaker 1>into the trap of, like, other operations folks.

02:11:21.180 --> 02:11:23.020
<v Speaker 1>Those nodes are looking beautiful, Jason. Look at

02:11:23.020 --> 02:11:26.059
<v Speaker 1>how happy they are. They're all ready.

02:11:26.780 --> 02:11:28.780
<v Speaker 1>There's no, like, unreadiness.

02:11:29.980 --> 02:11:32.059
<v Speaker 0>Yep. They look ready, Jason.

02:11:33.020 --> 02:11:34.699
<v Speaker 0>I think one one of your geese may

02:11:34.699 --> 02:11:35.580
<v Speaker 0>have fallen down a hole.

02:11:39.175 --> 02:11:41.255
<v Speaker 0>Jason says that no What time Bob? What

02:11:41.255 --> 02:11:43.895

02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:05.080
<v Speaker 0>We deployed our update. We've seen the happy

02:12:05.080 --> 02:12:06.895
<v Speaker 0>dance. The happy dance is the aim of

02:12:06.895 --> 02:12:08.815
<v Speaker 0>the game. I I I think we smashed

02:12:08.815 --> 02:12:10.735
<v Speaker 0>it. Well, you know, I didn't do a

02:12:10.735 --> 02:12:12.335
<v Speaker 0>lot of the heavy lifting, but still I
