00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.240
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:00:12.015 --> 00:00:13.934
<v Speaker 0>So what am I doing now?

00:00:14.415 --> 00:00:16.815
<v Speaker 0>Well, I should probably tweet, shouldn't I?

00:00:18.495 --> 00:00:21.535
<v Speaker 0>My plan is to play with cluster API

00:00:21.695 --> 00:00:22.654
<v Speaker 0>a little bit more.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.390
<v Speaker 0>And passed some new changes to the cluster

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.030
<v Speaker 0>API, which should allow me to upgrade my

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.390
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.950
<v Speaker 0>cluster.

00:00:40.485 --> 00:00:42.164
<v Speaker 0>Let me just get this tweet out.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.390
<v Speaker 0>So there was a there was an issue

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.710
<v Speaker 0>with the

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.549
<v Speaker 0>packet now Equinix metal cluster API provider.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:07.670
<v Speaker 0>And

00:01:08.215 --> 00:01:09.815
<v Speaker 0>let me just show you the pull request

00:01:09.815 --> 00:01:11.335
<v Speaker 0>I submitted yesterday.

00:01:11.895 --> 00:01:14.375
<v Speaker 0>What you'll see is when we actually provision

00:01:14.375 --> 00:01:15.415
<v Speaker 0>the cluster,

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:18.135
<v Speaker 0>we were just installing the latest version of

00:01:18.135 --> 00:01:19.735
<v Speaker 0>the Kubelet and Kubelet m.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 0>What that means is even if you request

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.710
<v Speaker 0>an earlier version of Kubernetes,

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.070
<v Speaker 0>you are never gonna get it. You would

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.070
<v Speaker 0>always always always get the latest and greatest

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.430
<v Speaker 0>version of Kubernetes.

00:01:32.245 --> 00:01:32.885
<v Speaker 0>And

00:01:33.365 --> 00:01:35.685
<v Speaker 0>I wanted to to do some content on

00:01:35.685 --> 00:01:37.525
<v Speaker 0>the cluster API provider

00:01:38.085 --> 00:01:41.125
<v Speaker 0>to show how cool the cluster API is

00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:43.125
<v Speaker 0>for doing upgrades of clusters as well.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.869
<v Speaker 0>So what I wanna do is just test

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.110
<v Speaker 0>this pull request. Now this pull request was

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.310
<v Speaker 0>actually merged

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:52.829
<v Speaker 0>yesterday.

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:54.590
<v Speaker 0>And I had left a comment on it

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.829
<v Speaker 0>saying, hey, I haven't done the test for

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:57.229
<v Speaker 0>this shit.

00:01:59.445 --> 00:02:02.405
<v Speaker 0>And someone very nicely merged anyway. Now what

00:02:02.405 --> 00:02:05.045
<v Speaker 0>I can confirm is that the commands here

00:02:06.565 --> 00:02:08.965
<v Speaker 0>do pull the latest version or do pull

00:02:08.965 --> 00:02:11.540
<v Speaker 0>the specific version using the app cache on

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.900
<v Speaker 0>Debian and Ubuntu

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.020
<v Speaker 0>to

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.020
<v Speaker 0>actually work. But it hasn't been tested end

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.700
<v Speaker 0>to end, and I'm gonna do that now.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.500
<v Speaker 0>To do so, I'm gonna run through the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.900
<v Speaker 0>quick start just following the really basic instructions

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.940
<v Speaker 0>of cluster API.

00:02:25.765 --> 00:02:27.365
<v Speaker 0>And then we will

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:29.765
<v Speaker 0>we will try and spin up Kubernetes

00:02:29.765 --> 00:02:31.205
<v Speaker 0>one eighteen cluster

00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:33.525
<v Speaker 0>and upgrade it to one nineteen.

00:02:34.885 --> 00:02:37.845
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So I just need to prepare a

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.690
<v Speaker 0>few things.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.170
<v Speaker 0>Now, what I would suggest is if you're

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.050
<v Speaker 0>watching

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.450
<v Speaker 0>and, you know, have questions, drop them in

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.170
<v Speaker 0>the chat.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.970
<v Speaker 0>I always like a confirmation that my audio

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.730
<v Speaker 0>is actually working. So, you know, I would

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.090
<v Speaker 0>appreciate a thumbs up from someone.

00:02:52.504 --> 00:02:54.665
<v Speaker 0>So the amount of times I started streaming

00:02:54.665 --> 00:02:57.065
<v Speaker 0>and I just not had things working,

00:02:57.864 --> 00:02:59.305
<v Speaker 0>it's all too common.

00:03:01.785 --> 00:03:03.305
<v Speaker 0>So let's grab

00:03:03.785 --> 00:03:06.185
<v Speaker 0>my

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.370
<v Speaker 0>credentials that I need.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.650
<v Speaker 0>So you all seen.

00:03:22.365 --> 00:03:23.165
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:03:23.165 --> 00:03:25.565
<v Speaker 0>I have my API token.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.920
<v Speaker 0>And let's store that in a fail.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.000
<v Speaker 0>Hold on. Let me drag item over here

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.960
<v Speaker 0>for a second.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.200
<v Speaker 0>Pack it.

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:47.445
<v Speaker 0>And my code over,

00:03:47.765 --> 00:03:50.325
<v Speaker 0>save the file, close it, and drag it

00:03:50.325 --> 00:03:51.285
<v Speaker 0>all back.

00:03:52.245 --> 00:03:54.725
<v Speaker 0>Secure as can be.

00:03:55.845 --> 00:03:56.245
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.379
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. I need to actually do one

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.140
<v Speaker 0>more thing, don't I? So hold on.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.140
<v Speaker 0>This requires

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.180
<v Speaker 0>me to actually export at the desk, not

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.140
<v Speaker 0>just store it in a file.

00:04:09.065 --> 00:04:09.945
<v Speaker 1>So

00:04:16.105 --> 00:04:16.665
<v Speaker 1>k.

00:04:18.345 --> 00:04:19.705
<v Speaker 1>I took in.

00:04:20.904 --> 00:04:21.305
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.000
<v Speaker 0>And when I resize that window, it's gonna

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.280
<v Speaker 0>show my token again.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.960
<v Speaker 0>Let's fill it up with some random text.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.440
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.840
<v Speaker 0>Perfect.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.275
<v Speaker 0>And let's not confuse myself. Right.

00:04:38.595 --> 00:04:40.915
<v Speaker 0>So now I'm gonna use Docker

00:04:42.195 --> 00:04:44.595
<v Speaker 0>for Mac as my management cluster and keep

00:04:44.595 --> 00:04:46.275
<v Speaker 0>this really, really simple,

00:04:47.395 --> 00:04:49.635
<v Speaker 0>which means if I do get nodes,

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.660
<v Speaker 0>this is Docker desktop. Right? Nothing fancy here.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.220
<v Speaker 0>I am going to install the cluster API

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.260
<v Speaker 0>controller

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:59.180
<v Speaker 0>with the packet provisioner.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.580
<v Speaker 0>My exposed environment variable,

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.275
<v Speaker 0>and That that should be all it takes

00:05:04.275 --> 00:05:06.354
<v Speaker 0>really to get started. Once we've got the

00:05:06.354 --> 00:05:08.275
<v Speaker 0>cluster API controller working, which we can get

00:05:08.354 --> 00:05:10.275
<v Speaker 0>let go of the background, we we just

00:05:10.275 --> 00:05:13.235
<v Speaker 0>need to generate a cluster API configuration.

00:05:14.435 --> 00:05:16.370
<v Speaker 0>And to do that, we just need to

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.730
<v Speaker 0>expose a few environment variables to tell it,

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.130
<v Speaker 0>you know, what size the node should be,

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.170
<v Speaker 0>etcetera.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.810
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I'm still in this view. Probably makes

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.250
<v Speaker 0>a bit more sense if I'm on

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:28.290
<v Speaker 0>this view.

00:05:30.715 --> 00:05:32.875
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Yeah. That's better. See?

00:05:34.555 --> 00:05:36.955
<v Speaker 0>Cool. So let's call this

00:05:39.835 --> 00:05:40.955
<v Speaker 0>the comments.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.830
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.030
<v Speaker 0>what do we wanna do? Where is my

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.990
<v Speaker 0>SSH key? It's called m b p sixteen.

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:54.789
<v Speaker 0>That will do.

00:05:56.195 --> 00:05:59.075
<v Speaker 0>I'm using SE key, which uses the secure

00:05:59.075 --> 00:06:01.075
<v Speaker 0>enclave on a Mac. It's pretty sweet.

00:06:01.315 --> 00:06:03.075
<v Speaker 0>Let's go with AMS one.

00:06:04.035 --> 00:06:06.035
<v Speaker 0>It's my project ID.

00:06:07.395 --> 00:06:09.155
<v Speaker 0>Let's switch organization.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:15.450
<v Speaker 0>Better.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.650
<v Speaker 0>And my project ID.

00:06:29.665 --> 00:06:32.305
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Now, pod side or service side, I'm

00:06:32.305 --> 00:06:34.145
<v Speaker 0>gonna run them as a default. Those work

00:06:34.145 --> 00:06:36.785
<v Speaker 0>well with packet because it doesn't use our

00:06:36.945 --> 00:06:38.465
<v Speaker 0>10 dot x

00:06:39.265 --> 00:06:41.105
<v Speaker 0>either. And I'm

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.840
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure if the t one smalls

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.840
<v Speaker 0>will be available in my region.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.080
<v Speaker 0>I'll quickly do a recheck.

00:06:54.895 --> 00:06:56.975
<v Speaker 0>We may wanna go with something a bit

00:06:56.975 --> 00:06:59.615
<v Speaker 0>beefier anyway just for the lulls.

00:07:00.655 --> 00:07:03.375
<v Speaker 0>Let's go with a c three medium.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:08.990
<v Speaker 0>X 86.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.350
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.110
<v Speaker 0>We'll call it ENV.

00:07:19.485 --> 00:07:21.005
<v Speaker 0>Don't know why that didn't save to this

00:07:21.005 --> 00:07:22.605
<v Speaker 0>directory. No big deal.

00:07:24.365 --> 00:07:25.725
<v Speaker 0>So what does it want me to do

00:07:25.725 --> 00:07:28.445
<v Speaker 0>next? It wants me to generate a copy

00:07:28.445 --> 00:07:29.324
<v Speaker 0>configuration.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.900
<v Speaker 0>Now the way that the changes I've made

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.380
<v Speaker 0>to the cluster API work is

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.420
<v Speaker 0>it uses app cache policy kubelet

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.715
<v Speaker 0>to search app cache for a version. Now

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:47.235
<v Speaker 0>the way that this works is it's actually

00:07:47.235 --> 00:07:49.555
<v Speaker 0>gonna do a pretty much a pattern match.

00:07:49.555 --> 00:07:51.475
<v Speaker 0>So I don't need to be as specific

00:07:52.515 --> 00:07:54.515
<v Speaker 0>as this example is here,

00:07:54.675 --> 00:07:56.515
<v Speaker 0>which is actually quite nice.

00:07:57.235 --> 00:07:58.755
<v Speaker 0>So if I paste that in,

00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:04.000
<v Speaker 0>what I should be able to do is

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.600
<v Speaker 0>actually just specify

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.440
<v Speaker 0>oh, no. Well, Capi may not let me

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.639
<v Speaker 0>away with that, will it?

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.320
<v Speaker 0>Let's try just go with one eighteen

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:13.360
<v Speaker 1>to

00:08:14.925 --> 00:08:16.445
<v Speaker 1>you know what? Let's see. Let's see what

00:08:16.445 --> 00:08:18.125
<v Speaker 0>Kathy says if I take it off.

00:08:21.805 --> 00:08:23.645
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. And I have to source. This

00:08:23.645 --> 00:08:25.805
<v Speaker 0>is gonna fail. So let's just echo this

00:08:25.805 --> 00:08:26.125
<v Speaker 0>out.

00:08:27.169 --> 00:08:28.050
<v Speaker 0>I

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:30.290
<v Speaker 0>need to source

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:32.610
<v Speaker 0>my ENV file, but if I save it

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:33.890
<v Speaker 0>to the wrong directory,

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.970
<v Speaker 0>it should give me access to project ID.

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:38.929
<v Speaker 0>What was it called?

00:08:40.775 --> 00:08:42.535
<v Speaker 0>Oh, it doesn't let's just try

00:08:44.295 --> 00:08:45.655
<v Speaker 0>I'm type today.

00:08:47.175 --> 00:08:48.135
<v Speaker 0>Echo

00:08:48.135 --> 00:08:49.015
<v Speaker 0>project.

00:08:49.495 --> 00:08:50.775
<v Speaker 0>Okay. That's better.

00:08:52.535 --> 00:08:55.015
<v Speaker 0>We pull back this, take off the echo.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.310
<v Speaker 0>And invalid. What's the full semantic?

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:00.670
<v Speaker 0>That's disappointing.

00:09:01.149 --> 00:09:03.710
<v Speaker 0>The script would have supported a much looser

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:05.390
<v Speaker 0>representation.

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:07.230
<v Speaker 0>See if we can get a one eight

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:08.830
<v Speaker 0>one eighteen dot two out of this.

00:09:17.305 --> 00:09:18.665
<v Speaker 0>Failed to identify

00:09:18.665 --> 00:09:20.745
<v Speaker 0>the default infrastructure

00:09:20.745 --> 00:09:21.785
<v Speaker 0>provider.

00:09:25.464 --> 00:09:25.865
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.200
<v Speaker 0>I did run cluster CTO. Did it fail?

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.400
<v Speaker 0>And I just wasn't paying attention.

00:09:42.555 --> 00:09:44.475
<v Speaker 0>But that's not running. I don't even remember

00:09:44.475 --> 00:09:45.035
<v Speaker 0>that.

00:09:47.355 --> 00:09:49.195
<v Speaker 0>Packet API key.

00:09:50.875 --> 00:09:52.875
<v Speaker 0>Did I export that wrong? Let me check.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.520
<v Speaker 0>It did. I did pack the API token.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.680
<v Speaker 0>Were the docs wrong or is I wrong?

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.480
<v Speaker 0>So it's back.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.635
<v Speaker 0>API in it. That should work. What does

00:10:10.635 --> 00:10:11.755
<v Speaker 0>the docs say?

00:10:13.515 --> 00:10:15.115
<v Speaker 0>Unless, when the docs are right, and I

00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:16.875
<v Speaker 0>wish it's been a bit silly.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.170
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:27.530
<v Speaker 0>Oh, well.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.370
<v Speaker 0>So that's gonna install cert manager into our

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:32.170
<v Speaker 0>cluster

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:35.450
<v Speaker 0>and then the cluster API controllers.

00:10:36.395 --> 00:10:38.075
<v Speaker 0>Then I'll be able to generate our CAPI

00:10:38.075 --> 00:10:40.075
<v Speaker 0>config. Hopefully, it's been up a cluster. I'm

00:10:40.075 --> 00:10:41.755
<v Speaker 0>hoping it works. Like it says, this hasn't

00:10:41.755 --> 00:10:43.435
<v Speaker 0>actually been tested end to end.

00:10:44.955 --> 00:10:46.475
<v Speaker 0>But the PR is merged, so now is

00:10:46.475 --> 00:10:47.915
<v Speaker 0>a good time as any to test it.

00:10:47.915 --> 00:10:48.155
<v Speaker 0>Right?

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.120
<v Speaker 0>So we're generating a configuration for Kubernetes one

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.480
<v Speaker 0>eighteen point two.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.160
<v Speaker 0>Nice. And I should just be able to

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.120
<v Speaker 0>apply this

00:11:02.795 --> 00:11:04.315
<v Speaker 0>to Docker for Mac.

00:11:06.795 --> 00:11:09.115
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Now you can now run

00:11:09.435 --> 00:11:10.795
<v Speaker 0>get cluster API.

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:19.270
<v Speaker 0>And it looks good.

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:22.630
<v Speaker 0>Now I need to wait.

00:11:29.745 --> 00:11:31.345
<v Speaker 0>What can I do in the meantime?

00:11:31.905 --> 00:11:33.825
<v Speaker 0>Let's go take a look at the

00:11:34.625 --> 00:11:36.305
<v Speaker 0>Equinix and metal

00:11:36.705 --> 00:11:37.745
<v Speaker 0>new portal.

00:11:38.465 --> 00:11:39.905
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Let's do that.

00:11:40.625 --> 00:11:41.585
<v Speaker 0>So

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.350
<v Speaker 0>pop out this tab.

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:46.750
<v Speaker 1>So

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:53.550
<v Speaker 0>I already have a couple of clusters here.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:54.830
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. But there we go. Let's just fill

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:55.950
<v Speaker 0>in this one copy.

00:11:57.925 --> 00:11:59.845
<v Speaker 0>So it's now sparing up our first control

00:11:59.845 --> 00:12:02.165
<v Speaker 0>plane node. And if I already actually got

00:12:02.165 --> 00:12:04.085
<v Speaker 0>an IP address, so maybe we could just

00:12:04.085 --> 00:12:06.965
<v Speaker 0>follow this along as it goes through its

00:12:06.965 --> 00:12:08.325
<v Speaker 0>bootstrapping process.

00:12:10.405 --> 00:12:11.125
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:13.130
<v Speaker 0>It should

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:19.130
<v Speaker 0>maybe just not quite ready for SSH yet.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:22.330
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. Well, we actually can follow along

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.865
<v Speaker 0>with the provisioning of the machine too. Yeah.

00:12:24.865 --> 00:12:26.865
<v Speaker 0>So let's get it out of network and

00:12:26.865 --> 00:12:28.144
<v Speaker 0>write in some config.

00:12:29.105 --> 00:12:30.865
<v Speaker 0>But it's not actually even installed the operating

00:12:30.865 --> 00:12:33.185
<v Speaker 0>system yet. So there's no way MSSH should

00:12:33.185 --> 00:12:34.385
<v Speaker 0>answer that just yet.

00:12:35.665 --> 00:12:36.545
<v Speaker 0>Obviously, we

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:40.100
<v Speaker 0>went under a a bit of a rebrand

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:41.540
<v Speaker 0>recently.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.060
<v Speaker 0>The newpacket.com

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.860
<v Speaker 0>homepage refer Equinix metal logo.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.060
<v Speaker 0>And it's got some information here, you know,

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.740
<v Speaker 0>Equinix purchase packet in March.

00:12:53.455 --> 00:12:55.774
<v Speaker 0>The rebrand is only a few days old.

00:12:55.774 --> 00:12:58.095
<v Speaker 0>This happened this week. And we're now Equinix

00:12:58.095 --> 00:13:00.415
<v Speaker 0>Metal, which I love as a name. So,

00:13:00.415 --> 00:13:01.055
<v Speaker 0>you know,

00:13:01.855 --> 00:13:04.015
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna be spatting out metal band puns

00:13:04.015 --> 00:13:06.015
<v Speaker 0>for the rest of the the rest of

00:13:06.015 --> 00:13:06.735
<v Speaker 0>the year.

00:13:07.295 --> 00:13:09.930
<v Speaker 0>And we can go to metal.equinix.com,

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:13.130
<v Speaker 0>and this is the new corporate site.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:17.769
<v Speaker 0>Pretty. I like it.

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:19.610
<v Speaker 0>Nice and fresh, clean.

00:13:21.355 --> 00:13:23.355
<v Speaker 0>As far as the portal, you know, it's

00:13:23.355 --> 00:13:24.714
<v Speaker 0>pretty much the same as the old packet

00:13:24.714 --> 00:13:26.315
<v Speaker 0>portal. But I mean, it is. It's just

00:13:26.315 --> 00:13:28.394
<v Speaker 0>been styled to reflect the new Equinix mail

00:13:28.394 --> 00:13:29.035
<v Speaker 0>branding.

00:13:29.595 --> 00:13:31.834
<v Speaker 0>The new cool thing that we've got, I'll

00:13:31.834 --> 00:13:33.675
<v Speaker 0>start doing a few streams on pretty soon.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.600
<v Speaker 0>This ability to request a new interconnect using

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.800
<v Speaker 0>Equinix Fabric.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.840
<v Speaker 0>It gives us the ability to actually have

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.880
<v Speaker 0>a fiber backbone into other cloud providers.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.360
<v Speaker 0>So you can run bare metal on Equinix

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:46.840
<v Speaker 0>metal

00:13:47.514 --> 00:13:50.954
<v Speaker 0>and have really low latency connection to AWS

00:13:50.954 --> 00:13:52.315
<v Speaker 0>or to GCP.

00:13:54.235 --> 00:13:55.834
<v Speaker 0>Or as long as we are in

00:13:56.555 --> 00:13:57.915
<v Speaker 0>as long as one of these regions are

00:13:57.915 --> 00:14:00.555
<v Speaker 0>supported. So definitely something I wanna be playing

00:14:00.555 --> 00:14:01.274
<v Speaker 0>with really soon.

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:05.550
<v Speaker 0>Let's get our copy filter back on. Where

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:06.910
<v Speaker 0>are we on the provision?

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.150
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Cool. We're just waiting for the device

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.510
<v Speaker 0>to phone home now,

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:14.670
<v Speaker 0>which only takes a moment. So, I mean,

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:16.925
<v Speaker 0>that was pretty fast. That provision started at

00:14:16.925 --> 00:14:18.205
<v Speaker 0>03:29.

00:14:19.324 --> 00:14:21.885
<v Speaker 0>And by 03:31, it was rebooting the server.

00:14:21.885 --> 00:14:23.084
<v Speaker 0>That's pretty sweet.

00:14:24.524 --> 00:14:26.764
<v Speaker 0>And I'll probably just SSH into this device

00:14:26.764 --> 00:14:28.045
<v Speaker 0>once it does come online

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:31.220
<v Speaker 0>and follow along with the

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.300
<v Speaker 0>the cloud and logs.

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:37.940
<v Speaker 0>And I'm hoping

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:42.100
<v Speaker 0>that we get a successful cluster and I

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.500
<v Speaker 0>haven't broken our packet provider

00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:48.774
<v Speaker 0>because that would be sad.

00:14:50.055 --> 00:14:51.255
<v Speaker 0>Sad. Sad. Sad.

00:14:51.975 --> 00:14:53.735
<v Speaker 0>My plan was actually to write a test

00:14:53.735 --> 00:14:54.375
<v Speaker 0>today.

00:14:54.855 --> 00:14:56.535
<v Speaker 0>I should have I should have submitted that

00:14:56.535 --> 00:14:57.175
<v Speaker 0>as a draft.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:01.940
<v Speaker 0>This PR

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.180
<v Speaker 0>no. Where is it? Oh, yeah. I need

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.180
<v Speaker 0>to provide test for this, but

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:08.580
<v Speaker 0>people thought it looked good,

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:10.260
<v Speaker 0>which is nice.

00:15:11.935 --> 00:15:13.855
<v Speaker 0>And it is relatively trivial.

00:15:13.855 --> 00:15:15.295
<v Speaker 0>I mean, it should work.

00:15:20.655 --> 00:15:22.415
<v Speaker 0>What will cause it to fail?

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:29.610
<v Speaker 0>I take the v off, which is good.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:32.170
<v Speaker 0>I escape the dot. Yeah. This is not

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:34.570
<v Speaker 0>gonna fail. I am pretty confident.

00:15:36.535 --> 00:15:38.375
<v Speaker 0>The last time I said that, you know

00:15:38.855 --> 00:15:39.655
<v Speaker 0>oops.

00:15:42.695 --> 00:15:44.135
<v Speaker 0>Machine's still rebooting.

00:15:45.735 --> 00:15:46.695
<v Speaker 0>Oh, wrong one.

00:16:03.389 --> 00:16:04.910
<v Speaker 0>Need to create a wee game or something

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:07.709
<v Speaker 0>to play while I'm doing it for these

00:16:06.705 --> 00:16:08.065
<v Speaker 0>these components.

00:16:11.425 --> 00:16:13.585
<v Speaker 0>Or just be really impatient and keep having

00:16:13.585 --> 00:16:15.585
<v Speaker 0>the port until eventually it lets me in.

00:16:15.585 --> 00:16:16.705
<v Speaker 0>Either works.

00:16:17.345 --> 00:16:19.105
<v Speaker 0>K. Let's scan that.

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:22.510
<v Speaker 0>Nice. We're

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:24.830
<v Speaker 0>definitely ahead of provisioning. Oh, we're not oh,

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:25.550
<v Speaker 0>abort.

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:28.430
<v Speaker 0>Wow. Q Qubit's already in.

00:16:33.084 --> 00:16:34.764
<v Speaker 0>We got one nineteen too.

00:16:38.204 --> 00:16:39.885
<v Speaker 0>It's debugging time.

00:16:40.605 --> 00:16:41.644
<v Speaker 0>What went wrong?

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.579
<v Speaker 0>Okay. What have we got access to? Let's

00:16:49.579 --> 00:16:52.140
<v Speaker 0>take a look at our cloud and output.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.180
<v Speaker 0>And there's the app cache. No. It's not

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:55.420
<v Speaker 0>there.

00:17:00.395 --> 00:17:01.835
<v Speaker 1>I

00:17:06.714 --> 00:17:09.595
<v Speaker 0>haven't upgraded cluster CTL locally.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:12.629
<v Speaker 0>Dreads.

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:16.869
<v Speaker 0>Let's spin up on more cluster.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:18.630
<v Speaker 0>So what do I need to do then

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:19.829
<v Speaker 0>to make this work?

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:23.750
<v Speaker 0>I need to compile cluster CTL manually.

00:17:29.965 --> 00:17:31.565
<v Speaker 0>I'm not actually sure

00:17:31.965 --> 00:17:32.764
<v Speaker 0>how

00:17:34.845 --> 00:17:36.684
<v Speaker 0>it gets the packet provider.

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.270
<v Speaker 0>I've never done this before.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:44.630
<v Speaker 0>So when I do

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:46.710
<v Speaker 0>cluster CTL

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:47.590
<v Speaker 0>in it

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:50.470
<v Speaker 0>and I specify the packet provider, I wonder

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:53.030
<v Speaker 0>how it actually delivers that to the cluster.

00:17:53.955 --> 00:17:55.154
<v Speaker 0>I wonder

00:17:55.794 --> 00:17:57.874
<v Speaker 0>if I can just do this manually

00:17:58.355 --> 00:18:00.914
<v Speaker 0>rather than compiling things together.

00:18:01.395 --> 00:18:04.274
<v Speaker 0>I'm in a completely uncharted territory right now.

00:18:04.674 --> 00:18:04.914
<v Speaker 0>So

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:07.330
<v Speaker 0>in fact, I know what I can do.

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:09.009
<v Speaker 0>When I so

00:18:09.809 --> 00:18:12.130
<v Speaker 0>this is gonna get into what's actually happening

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:15.009
<v Speaker 0>then. So when I run cluster CTL config,

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:17.249
<v Speaker 0>webinar

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:20.690
<v Speaker 0>it's just

00:18:19.865 --> 00:18:20.745
<v Speaker 0>boop.

00:18:21.625 --> 00:18:23.625
<v Speaker 0>So when I run cluster CTL config, it's

00:18:23.625 --> 00:18:24.424
<v Speaker 0>it's actually

00:18:24.585 --> 00:18:25.544
<v Speaker 0>generating

00:18:25.545 --> 00:18:27.785
<v Speaker 0>the provisioning scripts for me.

00:18:28.105 --> 00:18:30.184
<v Speaker 0>So let's just pop that open.

00:18:31.865 --> 00:18:33.465
<v Speaker 0>And I can just modify this with my

00:18:33.465 --> 00:18:36.420
<v Speaker 0>changes. I I don't need to recompile copy

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.540
<v Speaker 0>or anything like that. In fact, I should

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:39.220
<v Speaker 0>have remembered to do this anyway. That would've

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.020
<v Speaker 0>been smart.

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.460
<v Speaker 0>And you can see this is using the

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.140
<v Speaker 0>old one. This has not got our new

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.260
<v Speaker 0>commands in it.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.780
<v Speaker 0>So let's just go to my PR

00:18:49.985 --> 00:18:51.424
<v Speaker 0>and still look good.

00:18:51.585 --> 00:18:53.825
<v Speaker 0>This account is stealing of its main not

00:18:53.825 --> 00:18:55.264
<v Speaker 0>main contributor now.

00:18:55.904 --> 00:18:58.384
<v Speaker 0>No. Of course not. Alright. Let's grab

00:18:58.465 --> 00:18:59.184
<v Speaker 0>command number one.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:02.820
<v Speaker 0>B and I don't have guests. I just

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.500
<v Speaker 0>talk to myself and I'm

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:06.020
<v Speaker 0>sorry.

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.100
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So let's save that. And then we

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.140
<v Speaker 0>need to pin them.

00:19:20.235 --> 00:19:21.835
<v Speaker 0>This is the right one.

00:19:25.515 --> 00:19:26.554
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It looks good.

00:19:29.779 --> 00:19:31.139
<v Speaker 0>That says updated.

00:19:31.299 --> 00:19:33.459
<v Speaker 0>Which which template is this?

00:19:35.139 --> 00:19:37.059
<v Speaker 0>That's a control plane template.

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.299
<v Speaker 0>So we just need to

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.820
<v Speaker 0>do the same. I'm pretty sure it's the

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:43.380
<v Speaker 0>exact same.

00:19:43.985 --> 00:19:46.065
<v Speaker 0>And it's for the work or not.

00:19:47.025 --> 00:19:49.025
<v Speaker 0>And then we can just scroll down

00:19:52.305 --> 00:19:52.945
<v Speaker 0>here.

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:59.330
<v Speaker 0>Upside it? Oh, we've got some format measures.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:03.169
<v Speaker 0>Oh, that's good.

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:04.770
<v Speaker 0>Let me make sure I don't have those

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.210
<v Speaker 0>format measures here.

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:08.450
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Very good. Okay. So now I could

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:09.730
<v Speaker 0>just actually reapply this.

00:20:12.015 --> 00:20:13.934
<v Speaker 0>I think what I'll do is

00:20:19.775 --> 00:20:22.095
<v Speaker 0>delete that f

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.120
<v Speaker 0>that way

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.440
<v Speaker 0>and reapply

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.280
<v Speaker 0>it. And I'm not sure

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.160
<v Speaker 0>how long I kinda need to wait for

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:34.400
<v Speaker 0>that.

00:20:36.225 --> 00:20:37.745
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So it's kinda going through some sort

00:20:37.745 --> 00:20:39.745
<v Speaker 0>of deletion and reprovisioning. I wonder if I

00:20:39.745 --> 00:20:41.664
<v Speaker 0>can just tweak a few names.

00:20:44.225 --> 00:20:44.945
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:20:47.265 --> 00:20:48.065
<v Speaker 0>Pro plan.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:51.700
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no. Because they're everywhere.

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:54.900
<v Speaker 0>I'm just patient.

00:21:03.655 --> 00:21:04.375
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:21:05.335 --> 00:21:06.534
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

00:21:07.975 --> 00:21:10.855
<v Speaker 0>Be patient or search and replace. Be patient

00:21:10.855 --> 00:21:12.135
<v Speaker 0>or search and replace.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.700
<v Speaker 0>18 instances.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.140
<v Speaker 0>Let's call it copy slow start.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:24.980
<v Speaker 0>And then we can apply this over the

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:25.620
<v Speaker 0>top.

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:29.460
<v Speaker 0>I'm just gonna hope I haven't broken anything

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:31.860
<v Speaker 0>with that

00:21:30.535 --> 00:21:32.534
<v Speaker 0>very wide scoped.

00:21:32.615 --> 00:21:34.054
<v Speaker 0>So I shouldn't replace.

00:21:34.535 --> 00:21:35.654
<v Speaker 0>Should be alright.

00:21:39.495 --> 00:21:42.455
<v Speaker 0>So yep. Slow start slow start. No. We

00:21:42.455 --> 00:21:44.270
<v Speaker 0>just need to wait again until I get

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:46.669
<v Speaker 0>a new control plane node. It spins up,

00:21:46.669 --> 00:21:47.950
<v Speaker 0>and I jump back on it and check

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:49.070
<v Speaker 0>the cubelet version.

00:21:49.309 --> 00:21:50.909
<v Speaker 0>But at least it now has my changes.

00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:52.510
<v Speaker 0>That was that was naive of me. I

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:53.710
<v Speaker 0>don't know why I didn't think to check

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:53.950
<v Speaker 0>that.

00:21:59.435 --> 00:22:00.154
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm.

00:22:01.915 --> 00:22:05.835
<v Speaker 0>Well, we pop over to our thing here.

00:22:06.155 --> 00:22:07.755
<v Speaker 0>This is still quick start.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.840
<v Speaker 0>And we have slow start starting.

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.400
<v Speaker 0>My is awake.

00:22:33.975 --> 00:22:34.934
<v Speaker 0>There you go.

00:22:37.015 --> 00:22:38.695
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. He can all talk to Zelda for

00:22:38.695 --> 00:22:39.095
<v Speaker 0>a minute.

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:43.090
<v Speaker 0>Hello?

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:54.130
<v Speaker 0>That was a fret of sneezing if you

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:54.610
<v Speaker 0>heard that.

00:23:00.015 --> 00:23:00.815
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:23:05.535 --> 00:23:07.455
<v Speaker 0>You've not had a wee snuggle today yet,

00:23:07.455 --> 00:23:07.775
<v Speaker 0>have you?

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.260
<v Speaker 0>It's getting to winter. It means that she

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:14.180
<v Speaker 0>sleeps for pretty much the majority of the

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:14.740
<v Speaker 0>day.

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:17.860
<v Speaker 0>Goes a rewintered coat.

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:19.300
<v Speaker 0>Right.

00:23:24.045 --> 00:23:27.645
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's see. Where are we? Oh, wrong

00:23:27.645 --> 00:23:28.365
<v Speaker 0>button.

00:23:29.725 --> 00:23:31.485
<v Speaker 0>Magic install system.

00:23:31.485 --> 00:23:32.445
<v Speaker 0>Let's just

00:23:33.805 --> 00:23:34.924
<v Speaker 0>get prepared,

00:23:35.005 --> 00:23:36.284
<v Speaker 0>get impatient,

00:23:36.285 --> 00:23:37.165
<v Speaker 0>and wait.

00:23:53.305 --> 00:23:55.865
<v Speaker 0>Now the reason of that, let's go over

00:23:55.865 --> 00:23:59.145
<v Speaker 0>that too. Let's try and fill some silence.

00:24:01.545 --> 00:24:03.705
<v Speaker 0>I do have other machine. I have another

00:24:03.705 --> 00:24:05.145
<v Speaker 0>cluster in this project, actually.

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:07.830
<v Speaker 0>Let's jump onto that machine, and I'll just

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:09.429
<v Speaker 0>show you what these commands are doing.

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:15.990
<v Speaker 0>But it's actually quite tricky

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:18.630
<v Speaker 0>in Debian and Ubuntu to get

00:24:19.625 --> 00:24:21.945
<v Speaker 0>specific packages because of the

00:24:22.745 --> 00:24:25.705
<v Speaker 0>the Kubernetes version is semantically version, but then

00:24:25.705 --> 00:24:27.705
<v Speaker 0>Debbie and add on their own package version

00:24:27.705 --> 00:24:29.065
<v Speaker 0>to the end of it. So it's not

00:24:29.065 --> 00:24:30.745
<v Speaker 0>like you can just do apt

00:24:30.745 --> 00:24:33.705
<v Speaker 0>get install kubelet one eighteen two. There's then

00:24:33.705 --> 00:24:36.080
<v Speaker 0>this extra version on top of that, which

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.520
<v Speaker 0>makes it just a little bit more painful

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.480
<v Speaker 0>to work out.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.880
<v Speaker 0>So if we take those commands, I'll filter

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.080
<v Speaker 0>this back down so we can keep an

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:45.120
<v Speaker 0>eye on our our slow start control plan.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.560
<v Speaker 0>And let's just run this first command, and

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.400
<v Speaker 0>I'll run it without the assignment for now.

00:24:53.595 --> 00:24:54.155
<v Speaker 0>So

00:24:56.795 --> 00:24:59.115
<v Speaker 0>so the Kubernetes version is passed in by

00:24:59.115 --> 00:25:00.315
<v Speaker 0>cluster API.

00:25:01.195 --> 00:25:01.835
<v Speaker 0>So

00:25:02.155 --> 00:25:04.475
<v Speaker 0>right now, that shouldn't really do anything

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:08.190
<v Speaker 0>We can just export that ourselves

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:12.110
<v Speaker 0>and set this to the value that I

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:14.110
<v Speaker 0>set on the command line, which is Kubernetes

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:15.230
<v Speaker 0>one eighteen two.

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:18.030
<v Speaker 0>And then run this again, and we get

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:21.470
<v Speaker 0>a trim version and an escaped version so

00:25:20.585 --> 00:25:22.585
<v Speaker 0>that we can actually use and consume that

00:25:22.585 --> 00:25:24.905
<v Speaker 0>version and save up an off script or

00:25:24.905 --> 00:25:26.345
<v Speaker 0>it's an off command in this case. So

00:25:26.345 --> 00:25:28.105
<v Speaker 0>you can see I've taken off the v

00:25:28.345 --> 00:25:30.425
<v Speaker 0>and I'm just escaping the dots because we

00:25:30.425 --> 00:25:32.105
<v Speaker 0>actually do like a reject search.

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:34.950
<v Speaker 0>And then I assign that to a variable

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:36.870
<v Speaker 0>called trimmed Kubernetes version.

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:39.510
<v Speaker 0>I mean, this is overly complicated. It shouldn't

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:41.190
<v Speaker 0>it shouldn't have to be like this, but

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:42.230
<v Speaker 0>it's unfortunate.

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:45.270
<v Speaker 0>We then search the app cache, and then

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:46.870
<v Speaker 0>we're trying to filter this down. So let's

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:48.434
<v Speaker 0>go through this one step at a time.

00:25:48.434 --> 00:25:48.994
<v Speaker 0>Right?

00:25:49.875 --> 00:25:51.075
<v Speaker 0>If I just do

00:25:51.875 --> 00:25:54.434
<v Speaker 0>an app cache policy for Kubelet, it's gonna

00:25:54.434 --> 00:25:56.914
<v Speaker 0>list every single version that is available inside

00:25:56.914 --> 00:25:58.034
<v Speaker 0>the repository.

00:25:58.914 --> 00:26:00.355
<v Speaker 0>And we get it in a slightly weird

00:26:00.355 --> 00:26:01.394
<v Speaker 0>format. And you can see

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:03.559
<v Speaker 0>here

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.880
<v Speaker 0>with one six five, we then got dash

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.960
<v Speaker 0>o one and dash o o. And that's

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.200
<v Speaker 0>the the Debbie and then the Ubuntu version

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.440
<v Speaker 0>of the package. So there you go. They

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.120
<v Speaker 0>have an incremental counter for all the changes

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.800
<v Speaker 0>that they make for the package,

00:26:16.965 --> 00:26:18.565
<v Speaker 0>Which means that we then just need to

00:26:18.565 --> 00:26:20.325
<v Speaker 0>tweak this a little bit. So then

00:26:21.285 --> 00:26:23.684
<v Speaker 0>what I'm actually doing is using ARC

00:26:24.565 --> 00:26:25.284
<v Speaker 0>here

00:26:27.525 --> 00:26:28.244
<v Speaker 0>where

00:26:28.485 --> 00:26:29.764
<v Speaker 0>we're first

00:26:30.325 --> 00:26:32.245
<v Speaker 0>setting a variable in ARC.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.600
<v Speaker 0>We have to give it access to the

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.520
<v Speaker 0>churn version and rather than it being trimmed

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.680
<v Speaker 0>version equals trimmed version, I'm just inversion equals

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.640
<v Speaker 0>trimmed version, trying to remove as much verbose

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.520
<v Speaker 0>as possible.

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:46.200
<v Speaker 0>ARC scripts are comprised of filters and commands,

00:26:47.115 --> 00:26:48.715
<v Speaker 0>And that's what's in the quote here. Our

00:26:48.715 --> 00:26:49.674
<v Speaker 0>filter is

00:26:49.915 --> 00:26:51.434
<v Speaker 0>we wanna check whether

00:26:51.595 --> 00:26:53.755
<v Speaker 0>using rejects, which is what the total operator

00:26:53.755 --> 00:26:56.315
<v Speaker 0>means. Parameter one, which is this here,

00:26:57.995 --> 00:27:00.360
<v Speaker 0>matches the version that we're passionate, which it

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.440
<v Speaker 0>should with those escape dots in the version.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.279
<v Speaker 0>And then we just print it out.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.039
<v Speaker 0>Well, I should see here.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:08.840
<v Speaker 0>That's one eighteen two.

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.440
<v Speaker 0>Let's try just tweaking

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.960
<v Speaker 0>trimmed

00:27:15.585 --> 00:27:16.784
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes

00:27:17.424 --> 00:27:18.465
<v Speaker 0>version

00:27:19.184 --> 00:27:20.225
<v Speaker 0>equals

00:27:20.304 --> 00:27:21.985
<v Speaker 0>let's do one

00:27:25.985 --> 00:27:26.945
<v Speaker 0>five

00:27:26.945 --> 00:27:27.505
<v Speaker 0>two.

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:35.970
<v Speaker 0>It didn't use my exported one.

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:40.130
<v Speaker 0>Export

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:41.409
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:42.289
<v Speaker 0>version.

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:44.610
<v Speaker 0>I just wanna show the multiple results.

00:27:46.505 --> 00:27:50.264
<v Speaker 0>So this will be B152.

00:27:51.225 --> 00:27:54.184
<v Speaker 0>Echo Kubernetes version, they got B152.

00:27:54.424 --> 00:27:56.905
<v Speaker 0>We can then run our trimmed assignment again.

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:02.110
<v Speaker 0>Echo trimmed.

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:04.830
<v Speaker 0>We get our escaped minus the b,

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:07.390
<v Speaker 0>and I'll run I'll just run this in

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:08.990
<v Speaker 0>a whole this time. You'll see that I

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:10.670
<v Speaker 0>also add on the head dash n one,

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:11.790
<v Speaker 0>and that's just so that we get one

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:13.790
<v Speaker 0>version back. But I could tweak that command

00:28:14.985 --> 00:28:16.665
<v Speaker 0>to show you the multiple results. So if

00:28:16.665 --> 00:28:19.225
<v Speaker 0>I had resolved Kubernetes version, we actually get

00:28:19.225 --> 00:28:21.705
<v Speaker 0>a note it been to a Debian package

00:28:21.705 --> 00:28:23.384
<v Speaker 0>version number we can work with.

00:28:25.625 --> 00:28:27.625
<v Speaker 0>If I run at cache here,

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.640
<v Speaker 0>take off the head,

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.640
<v Speaker 0>let's see that we actually get

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.640
<v Speaker 0>every package version.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.040
<v Speaker 0>And they're coming back and

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:42.240
<v Speaker 0>the correct order descending from when they were

00:28:41.805 --> 00:28:43.645
<v Speaker 0>released. So just by using the head and

00:28:43.645 --> 00:28:46.045
<v Speaker 0>one, we can always get the latest version.

00:28:47.165 --> 00:28:47.885
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:28:50.285 --> 00:28:52.445
<v Speaker 0>Let's drop off this machine now

00:28:52.845 --> 00:28:54.765
<v Speaker 0>and see if this one is alive.

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:00.590
<v Speaker 0>And the moment of truth is running Qubelet

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:01.309
<v Speaker 0>version.

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:04.990
<v Speaker 0>It's not installed yet. Now that's

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:07.630
<v Speaker 0>potentially a bad thing.

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:12.510
<v Speaker 0>It could mean that our provisioning script failed

00:29:13.784 --> 00:29:15.864
<v Speaker 0>or it could still be running, but

00:29:20.424 --> 00:29:22.585
<v Speaker 0>it finished. It failed. Drats.

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:30.370
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's see what went wrong.

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:37.250
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no.

00:29:42.125 --> 00:29:43.325
<v Speaker 0>That's imputing.

00:29:52.845 --> 00:29:53.885
<v Speaker 0>Let's fix it. Okay.

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:56.900
<v Speaker 0>So the

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:01.299
<v Speaker 0>looks like

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:09.300
<v Speaker 0>there's an equivalent

00:30:07.294 --> 00:30:08.254
<v Speaker 0>colon

00:30:08.655 --> 00:30:10.734
<v Speaker 0>for kubelet was not found.

00:30:12.414 --> 00:30:14.815
<v Speaker 0>Something particularly strange

00:30:17.375 --> 00:30:17.775
<v Speaker 0>happened.

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:22.010
<v Speaker 0>So what am I gonna have to do?

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:24.090
<v Speaker 0>Do I have access to I don't have

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:25.210
<v Speaker 0>access to the

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:27.850
<v Speaker 0>the user data here.

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:30.090
<v Speaker 0>We can curl it

00:30:33.065 --> 00:30:35.385
<v Speaker 0>from metadata.packet.net

00:30:35.385 --> 00:30:36.664
<v Speaker 0>user data.

00:30:36.825 --> 00:30:37.544
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:30:38.585 --> 00:30:39.385
<v Speaker 0>And

00:30:43.385 --> 00:30:45.945
<v Speaker 0>store it in my root directory as user

00:30:45.945 --> 00:30:46.345
<v Speaker 0>data.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:54.639
<v Speaker 0>So this is cloud config syntax.

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.600
<v Speaker 0>Let's get down to here. I'm trying to

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.559
<v Speaker 0>work out

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.720
<v Speaker 0>what hasn't worked. I'm just gonna run these

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.640
<v Speaker 0>commands manually, which means I'm gonna

00:31:03.525 --> 00:31:04.804
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna show.

00:31:09.285 --> 00:31:11.125
<v Speaker 0>So I'm gonna assume everything to this stage

00:31:11.125 --> 00:31:12.005
<v Speaker 0>will work,

00:31:12.245 --> 00:31:14.645
<v Speaker 0>which means these commands, I did just run

00:31:14.645 --> 00:31:16.005
<v Speaker 0>on another machine and worked.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.640
<v Speaker 0>Potentially, something went wrong here.

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.800
<v Speaker 0>So this is our do

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.560
<v Speaker 0>we have

00:31:31.745 --> 00:31:32.785
<v Speaker 0>there we go.

00:31:33.665 --> 00:31:34.785
<v Speaker 0>That's frustrating.

00:31:34.785 --> 00:31:35.825
<v Speaker 0>So it's

00:31:35.825 --> 00:31:36.385
<v Speaker 0>not

00:31:36.785 --> 00:31:38.945
<v Speaker 0>my initial thought there was, oh, crap. The

00:31:38.945 --> 00:31:40.945
<v Speaker 0>version of Valk is different, but it's not.

00:31:40.945 --> 00:31:41.665
<v Speaker 0>It's

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:43.640
<v Speaker 0>that's escape.

00:31:56.845 --> 00:31:58.045
<v Speaker 0>That's gonna be a bit of a pain

00:31:58.045 --> 00:31:59.164
<v Speaker 0>in the ass to fix.

00:32:03.485 --> 00:32:05.885
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna provision this manually

00:32:06.685 --> 00:32:07.565
<v Speaker 0>just

00:32:07.565 --> 00:32:08.685
<v Speaker 0>to make sure it works.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.580
<v Speaker 0>Is my result Kubernetes

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:20.460
<v Speaker 0>wrong?

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:22.060
<v Speaker 0>Oh, it's still wrong.

00:32:26.435 --> 00:32:28.274
<v Speaker 0>Do I have a trimmed?

00:32:30.115 --> 00:32:33.395
<v Speaker 0>Oh, right. Why did the trimmed not work?

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:46.059
<v Speaker 0>I don't oh, yeah. Because the Kubernetes config

00:32:46.059 --> 00:32:48.620
<v Speaker 0>isn't available at this moment because I'm not

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:49.339
<v Speaker 0>within

00:32:50.059 --> 00:32:51.579
<v Speaker 0>the cloud config.

00:32:51.899 --> 00:32:52.220
<v Speaker 0>So

00:32:53.795 --> 00:32:56.034
<v Speaker 0>that's the Kubernetes

00:32:56.035 --> 00:32:56.995
<v Speaker 0>version

00:32:58.195 --> 00:33:00.195
<v Speaker 0>b one eighteen

00:33:00.195 --> 00:33:00.995
<v Speaker 0>two.

00:33:00.995 --> 00:33:01.794
<v Speaker 0>Let's

00:33:02.915 --> 00:33:04.034
<v Speaker 0>set the trend.

00:33:04.355 --> 00:33:05.475
<v Speaker 0>Set resolved.

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:13.290
<v Speaker 0>Now it's now resolved to the correct package.

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:14.410
<v Speaker 0>So let's paste that on our app, get

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:15.769
<v Speaker 0>install command again.

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:17.529
<v Speaker 0>That works.

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:19.929
<v Speaker 0>Silver lining,

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:20.730
<v Speaker 0>at least.

00:33:24.385 --> 00:33:26.225
<v Speaker 0>Now, let's try and work out how we

00:33:26.225 --> 00:33:27.105
<v Speaker 0>fix

00:33:27.105 --> 00:33:27.905
<v Speaker 0>this and I

00:33:29.745 --> 00:33:31.264
<v Speaker 0>yeah. I don't know yet.

00:33:34.945 --> 00:33:35.745
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:39.050
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. You saw the version there. That was

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:39.610
<v Speaker 0>great.

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:42.650
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:44.890
<v Speaker 0>Now can I double escape the

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:48.650
<v Speaker 0>yeah? Let's let's try it manually first.

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:52.970
<v Speaker 0>This is oh, that's the next. Okay. So

00:33:55.105 --> 00:33:56.465
<v Speaker 0>problem is

00:33:57.265 --> 00:33:59.585
<v Speaker 0>it's gonna skip this for me.

00:34:03.185 --> 00:34:05.025
<v Speaker 0>And my thoughts are

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:08.860
<v Speaker 0>that's not gonna work. I thought

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.780
<v Speaker 0>because we're in a situation where we have

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:13.179
<v Speaker 0>this.

00:34:25.725 --> 00:34:28.125
<v Speaker 0>Let's check our generated config.

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:35.429
<v Speaker 0>There are no quotes here. Those are being

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:36.070
<v Speaker 0>added

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:44.150
<v Speaker 0>because we have them here.

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:45.350
<v Speaker 0>So, really,

00:34:50.464 --> 00:34:52.145
<v Speaker 0>I wonder if I can just do that

00:34:52.145 --> 00:34:53.665
<v Speaker 0>without the double quotes.

00:34:54.864 --> 00:34:56.065
<v Speaker 0>Let's try that.

00:34:59.585 --> 00:35:01.025
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So

00:35:02.769 --> 00:35:04.690
<v Speaker 0>make sure that still works.

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:07.569
<v Speaker 0>I'm not passing it anything there.

00:35:15.695 --> 00:35:17.135
<v Speaker 0>Just from the whole command.

00:35:19.535 --> 00:35:20.575
<v Speaker 0>This one.

00:35:22.495 --> 00:35:23.855
<v Speaker 0>And take the course

00:35:25.215 --> 00:35:26.095
<v Speaker 0>off.

00:35:26.335 --> 00:35:28.175
<v Speaker 0>Maybe there's gonna be superfluous.

00:35:28.335 --> 00:35:29.940
<v Speaker 0>That would make things a lot simpler rather

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:30.900
<v Speaker 0>than me trying to work out how to

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:31.860
<v Speaker 0>wrangle this

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:34.180
<v Speaker 0>some other way.

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:42.180
<v Speaker 0>So that didn't work.

00:35:55.355 --> 00:35:57.755
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's put the double quotes back in.

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.000
<v Speaker 0>And we can't use single quotes because we

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:06.560
<v Speaker 0>have

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.560
<v Speaker 0>bash interpolation happening.

00:36:16.385 --> 00:36:18.465
<v Speaker 0>Well, that didn't occur anything either.

00:36:21.424 --> 00:36:21.984
<v Speaker 0>Let's try.

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:26.410
<v Speaker 0>But we still have trimmed.

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:36.490
<v Speaker 0>Using myself now.

00:36:40.155 --> 00:36:41.835
<v Speaker 0>Let's take off the head.

00:36:48.475 --> 00:36:50.315
<v Speaker 0>I just have cash policy.

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:58.060
<v Speaker 0>There's an equal, there's a match.

00:37:05.795 --> 00:37:06.835
<v Speaker 1>What's this?

00:37:08.515 --> 00:37:10.675
<v Speaker 1>It's not escaped. Should it be escaped by

00:37:10.675 --> 00:37:11.235
<v Speaker 0>now?

00:37:12.515 --> 00:37:13.315
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

00:37:17.875 --> 00:37:19.075
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's try again.

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:29.240
<v Speaker 0>Terms

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:30.360
<v Speaker 0>looks good.

00:37:32.915 --> 00:37:34.115
<v Speaker 0>I'm cash policy keep

00:37:34.675 --> 00:37:36.275
<v Speaker 0>have I have I have I broken my

00:37:36.275 --> 00:37:37.235
<v Speaker 0>alt command?

00:37:39.795 --> 00:37:40.835
<v Speaker 0>What have I done?

00:38:01.555 --> 00:38:03.715
<v Speaker 0>It should move the filler just now.

00:38:08.755 --> 00:38:10.115
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I like that.

00:38:14.109 --> 00:38:15.150
<v Speaker 0>Version.

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:22.270
<v Speaker 0>Excuse me.

00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:42.770
<v Speaker 0>That's not correct.

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:50.130
<v Speaker 0>The version

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:50.930
<v Speaker 0>should

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:51.890
<v Speaker 0>be

00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:54.130
<v Speaker 0>our trimmed Kubernetes version.

00:38:58.325 --> 00:38:59.765
<v Speaker 0>Instead,

00:39:02.085 --> 00:39:03.845
<v Speaker 0>we're getting something different.

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:14.950
<v Speaker 0>Let's

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:19.270
<v Speaker 0>we run this. So we should have a

00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:20.550
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes version.

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:22.550
<v Speaker 0>I got a trim version,

00:39:24.155 --> 00:39:26.635
<v Speaker 0>unless they are resolved version.

00:39:30.795 --> 00:39:33.195
<v Speaker 0>A blank. Okay. Everything

00:39:33.195 --> 00:39:34.155
<v Speaker 0>is fucked.

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:41.830
<v Speaker 0>So

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:43.190
<v Speaker 0>I'm sure

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:47.830
<v Speaker 0>I'm being silly,

00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:50.150
<v Speaker 0>and I just

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:51.350
<v Speaker 0>can't

00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:52.310
<v Speaker 0>spot it yet.

00:39:53.345 --> 00:39:55.505
<v Speaker 0>Let's build this back from the ground up.

00:39:58.305 --> 00:40:00.305
<v Speaker 0>Hey. We get what we want with the

00:40:00.305 --> 00:40:01.505
<v Speaker 0>policy command.

00:40:04.305 --> 00:40:06.385
<v Speaker 0>I want to go through I wanna assign

00:40:06.385 --> 00:40:07.665
<v Speaker 0>a variable

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:11.180
<v Speaker 0>Version equals trend.

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:13.980
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:15.020
<v Speaker 0>version.

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:22.140
<v Speaker 0>Let's not do the filler just now. Let's

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:22.780
<v Speaker 0>just

00:40:23.565 --> 00:40:25.245
<v Speaker 0>print our version.

00:40:29.325 --> 00:40:30.685
<v Speaker 0>Let me close off this.

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:38.940
<v Speaker 0>That's interesting.

00:40:51.835 --> 00:40:53.595
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's not working at all.

00:40:58.555 --> 00:40:59.435
<v Speaker 0>Riddle me this.

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.560
<v Speaker 0>Let's change the assignment

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:08.360
<v Speaker 0>here.

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:12.680
<v Speaker 0>E m.

00:41:21.345 --> 00:41:22.465
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:41:25.025 --> 00:41:25.265
<v Speaker 0>So

00:41:25.825 --> 00:41:28.065
<v Speaker 0>Alright. For the defined variables, you just don't

00:41:28.065 --> 00:41:29.425
<v Speaker 0>use the dollar syntax.

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:32.040
<v Speaker 0>And it came to me in a moment

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:33.960
<v Speaker 0>of clarity there that that's only really for

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:35.880
<v Speaker 0>things that are inside of it.

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:38.520
<v Speaker 0>As that are

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.640
<v Speaker 0>matched in the after the filter.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.840
<v Speaker 0>So that means that my version line was

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:46.405
<v Speaker 0>actually key.

00:41:50.565 --> 00:41:52.404
<v Speaker 0>Add our filter back in.

00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:00.660
<v Speaker 0>Because the command, the default is just to

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:01.700
<v Speaker 0>print everything.

00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:03.860
<v Speaker 0>Still not matching.

00:42:20.755 --> 00:42:22.434
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I anymore version.

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:26.740
<v Speaker 0>Looks alright.

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:31.940
<v Speaker 0>We have a one eighteen too.

00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:34.339
<v Speaker 0>I'm just gonna have to start verifying everything.

00:42:34.339 --> 00:42:35.460
<v Speaker 0>I'm losing the main tier.

00:42:42.395 --> 00:42:43.115
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:42:46.395 --> 00:42:47.755
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's try this again.

00:42:50.829 --> 00:42:52.829
<v Speaker 0>And one, that's what we're doing to match

00:42:52.829 --> 00:42:53.710
<v Speaker 0>against.

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:56.670
<v Speaker 0>That's fine.

00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:58.670
<v Speaker 0>So

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:00.430
<v Speaker 0>on

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:02.510
<v Speaker 0>version.

00:43:03.855 --> 00:43:06.255
<v Speaker 0>I see an as the regex here, then

00:43:06.255 --> 00:43:07.215
<v Speaker 0>print it.

00:43:08.015 --> 00:43:08.494
<v Speaker 0>Nothing.

00:43:28.819 --> 00:43:29.619
<v Speaker 0>Can't

00:43:29.619 --> 00:43:31.380
<v Speaker 0>believe I'm fading

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:32.339
<v Speaker 0>with Rawk.

00:43:39.894 --> 00:43:41.734
<v Speaker 0>Am I getting I mean, I don't I'm

00:43:41.734 --> 00:43:42.934
<v Speaker 0>not getting that command wrong. I know that

00:43:42.934 --> 00:43:43.255
<v Speaker 0>command.

00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:17.770
<v Speaker 0>Let's revalidate

00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:20.330
<v Speaker 0>this input. Something is clearly

00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:21.050
<v Speaker 0>not working.

00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:39.950
<v Speaker 0>I should print one.

00:44:43.310 --> 00:44:44.030
<v Speaker 0>Good.

00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:48.349
<v Speaker 0>Add a really simple filler.

00:44:52.345 --> 00:44:53.065
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

00:44:54.025 --> 00:44:55.465
<v Speaker 0>Oh, that shouldn't matter. Right?

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:05.990
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't matter.

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:11.670
<v Speaker 0>The two works.

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:13.190
<v Speaker 0>12

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.550
<v Speaker 0>works.

00:45:19.494 --> 00:45:20.295
<v Speaker 0>One

00:45:21.095 --> 00:45:21.895
<v Speaker 0>eighteen.

00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:36.970
<v Speaker 0>The variable would be fine.

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:42.970
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:48.730
<v Speaker 0>We are actually passing on two, so let's

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:50.250
<v Speaker 0>just for the sake of completeness.

00:45:52.915 --> 00:45:53.315
<v Speaker 1>Oh.

00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:06.730
<v Speaker 0>There is no one eighteen to

00:46:07.690 --> 00:46:09.370
<v Speaker 0>or something I'm doing

00:46:09.609 --> 00:46:11.130
<v Speaker 0>because it already installed.

00:46:21.245 --> 00:46:22.925
<v Speaker 0>Okay. That

00:46:22.925 --> 00:46:23.885
<v Speaker 0>was painful.

00:46:26.205 --> 00:46:28.445
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So what what I need to do

00:46:28.445 --> 00:46:29.885
<v Speaker 0>is

00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:31.890
<v Speaker 0>confirm the dash the the variable assignment is

00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:32.690
<v Speaker 0>gonna work.

00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:35.730
<v Speaker 0>Let's say double quote, so we should be

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:36.370
<v Speaker 0>alright.

00:46:37.570 --> 00:46:38.450
<v Speaker 0>So

00:46:42.005 --> 00:46:44.005
<v Speaker 0>let's do maybe

00:46:44.245 --> 00:46:45.285
<v Speaker 0>equals

00:46:47.525 --> 00:46:50.085
<v Speaker 0>18. I might just go with three to

00:46:50.085 --> 00:46:50.805
<v Speaker 0>avoid

00:46:52.005 --> 00:46:53.445
<v Speaker 0>a weird thing.

00:46:53.765 --> 00:46:57.285
<v Speaker 0>And we wanna confirm that

00:46:56.970 --> 00:46:58.330
<v Speaker 0>we can use

00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:00.410
<v Speaker 0>IP

00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:02.330
<v Speaker 0>and that

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:07.770
<v Speaker 0>isn't working just yet because

00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:11.370
<v Speaker 0>this isn't the thing

00:47:14.315 --> 00:47:15.755
<v Speaker 0>with an Elm script.

00:47:16.155 --> 00:47:16.715
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

00:47:18.395 --> 00:47:20.315
<v Speaker 0>we do the dash b here.

00:47:21.755 --> 00:47:22.555
<v Speaker 0>And

00:47:23.035 --> 00:47:24.474
<v Speaker 0>if I can just get away,

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:29.480
<v Speaker 0>things will work.

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.480
<v Speaker 0>And just so we don't have a duplication

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.640
<v Speaker 0>of name, let's just do this.

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:35.880
<v Speaker 0>Make sure we get the right value.

00:47:40.994 --> 00:47:41.635
<v Speaker 0>Right.

00:47:44.275 --> 00:47:45.475
<v Speaker 0>That was painful.

00:47:46.915 --> 00:47:48.915
<v Speaker 0>So the problem was

00:47:49.075 --> 00:47:51.395
<v Speaker 0>these quotes are superfluous,

00:47:51.395 --> 00:47:52.994
<v Speaker 0>but they did break because they were being

00:47:52.994 --> 00:47:55.075
<v Speaker 0>escaped and failing the matter to work.

00:47:56.570 --> 00:47:57.530
<v Speaker 0>And

00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:01.530
<v Speaker 0>we can just remove them from here too.

00:48:09.285 --> 00:48:10.085
<v Speaker 1>Sweet.

00:48:12.244 --> 00:48:14.085
<v Speaker 0>Because I've now got my

00:48:17.204 --> 00:48:20.165
<v Speaker 0>let's see. Let's change Kubernetes version so that

00:48:20.165 --> 00:48:22.165
<v Speaker 0>will work. Oh, no. Then the trend one

00:48:22.165 --> 00:48:22.965
<v Speaker 0>will be wrong.

00:48:23.444 --> 00:48:24.165
<v Speaker 0>Set trend.

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:32.160
<v Speaker 0>Close.

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:36.320
<v Speaker 0>11183.

00:48:39.825 --> 00:48:40.545
<v Speaker 0>Perfect.

00:48:41.984 --> 00:48:42.705
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:48:44.945 --> 00:48:46.785
<v Speaker 0>I've updated this file,

00:48:48.385 --> 00:48:49.984
<v Speaker 0>and then I need to spend a new

00:48:49.984 --> 00:48:50.545
<v Speaker 0>cluster.

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:52.970
<v Speaker 0>Let's

00:48:53.050 --> 00:48:56.170
<v Speaker 0>kill slow start and go to fast start.

00:48:58.970 --> 00:49:00.650
<v Speaker 0>And I'm gonna apply.

00:49:05.945 --> 00:49:07.945
<v Speaker 0>I will under that change just so I

00:49:07.945 --> 00:49:08.985
<v Speaker 0>can delete.

00:49:09.705 --> 00:49:10.745
<v Speaker 1>We'll start.

00:49:12.345 --> 00:49:12.905
<v Speaker 1>Bye.

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:22.840
<v Speaker 0>We go there.

00:49:24.359 --> 00:49:25.320
<v Speaker 0>Unfortunately,

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:27.080
<v Speaker 0>it doesn't mean that I need to update

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:29.240
<v Speaker 0>this poor request. Poor guy's is merged. I

00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:30.680
<v Speaker 0>need to update the repository.

00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:31.800
<v Speaker 0>Let's do that just now.

00:49:35.215 --> 00:49:36.495
<v Speaker 0>Packet host.

00:49:36.495 --> 00:49:37.375
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no.

00:49:37.855 --> 00:49:40.895
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes saved cluster API for later.

00:49:42.975 --> 00:49:44.335
<v Speaker 0>Master

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:46.420
<v Speaker 0>changes.

00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:49.220
<v Speaker 0>And this is

00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:50.580
<v Speaker 0>a fix.

00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:52.900
<v Speaker 0>Remove

00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:54.340
<v Speaker 0>superfluous

00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:56.020
<v Speaker 0>superfluous

00:49:59.865 --> 00:50:00.585
<v Speaker 0>quotes.

00:50:02.825 --> 00:50:04.185
<v Speaker 0>See if I can get that pushed through

00:50:04.185 --> 00:50:05.705
<v Speaker 0>by a few colleagues.

00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:15.170
<v Speaker 0>One more.

00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:23.970
<v Speaker 0>That's why things should be tested.

00:50:29.065 --> 00:50:29.945
<v Speaker 0>First,

00:50:30.345 --> 00:50:33.705
<v Speaker 0>Lewis quotes that breaks semantic

00:50:33.705 --> 00:50:34.505
<v Speaker 0>versioning

00:50:34.505 --> 00:50:35.865
<v Speaker 0>matcher.

00:50:37.705 --> 00:50:39.225
<v Speaker 0>This is my branch.

00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:48.170
<v Speaker 0>And open on your pull request.

00:50:57.245 --> 00:50:58.525
<v Speaker 0>What's in this

00:50:59.085 --> 00:50:59.885
<v Speaker 0>command

00:51:00.445 --> 00:51:02.125
<v Speaker 0>are escaped.

00:51:03.485 --> 00:51:07.405
<v Speaker 0>I cleared in it causing the

00:51:07.645 --> 00:51:08.525
<v Speaker 0>rejects

00:51:08.525 --> 00:51:10.525
<v Speaker 0>matcher to fail

00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:14.480
<v Speaker 0>and all version of the kubelet,

00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:15.680
<v Speaker 0>kubedm,

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:16.480
<v Speaker 0>and

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.560
<v Speaker 0>ship c t l

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:19.920
<v Speaker 0>are installed.

00:51:31.885 --> 00:51:32.685
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:51:33.325 --> 00:51:34.125
<v Speaker 0>It's good.

00:51:35.565 --> 00:51:37.805
<v Speaker 0>So let's pop over to here.

00:51:38.765 --> 00:51:39.565
<v Speaker 0>Refresh

00:51:39.565 --> 00:51:40.125
<v Speaker 0>on this.

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:46.740
<v Speaker 0>Copy.

00:51:47.619 --> 00:51:49.460
<v Speaker 0>I start it there. I'm not sure why

00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:51.140
<v Speaker 0>these two haven't disappeared yet.

00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:52.500
<v Speaker 0>Let's just say

00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:54.900
<v Speaker 0>gives them a gentle nudge.

00:51:57.895 --> 00:52:00.535
<v Speaker 0>Got an IP address here. Although, I'm gonna

00:52:00.535 --> 00:52:01.655
<v Speaker 0>assume it's

00:52:01.734 --> 00:52:02.535
<v Speaker 0>prob

00:52:07.255 --> 00:52:09.255
<v Speaker 0>there you go. Yeah. I probably still oh,

00:52:09.255 --> 00:52:10.934
<v Speaker 0>no. It's not too early. Alright. Let's I'll

00:52:10.934 --> 00:52:11.895
<v Speaker 0>phone it home in a second.

00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:17.870
<v Speaker 0>Come on this machine.

00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:25.710
<v Speaker 0>Well, fifty two minutes to

00:52:27.070 --> 00:52:27.230
<v Speaker 0>cool.

00:52:32.085 --> 00:52:32.885
<v Speaker 0>Couplet.

00:52:33.205 --> 00:52:34.245
<v Speaker 0>Not yet.

00:52:36.645 --> 00:52:38.805
<v Speaker 0>I'd close and it finished. Is it still

00:52:38.805 --> 00:52:39.285
<v Speaker 0>broking?

00:52:47.890 --> 00:52:48.690
<v Speaker 0>Right.

00:52:52.450 --> 00:52:53.890
<v Speaker 0>I see the fast start box.

00:52:55.085 --> 00:52:56.445
<v Speaker 0>Oh, that's right. Yeah.

00:53:04.525 --> 00:53:05.565
<v Speaker 0>We've done a metadata.

00:53:24.015 --> 00:53:24.735
<v Speaker 0>And

00:53:24.815 --> 00:53:26.174
<v Speaker 0>I just

00:53:51.475 --> 00:53:53.875
<v Speaker 0>I did update both of those quotes. Right?

00:53:58.915 --> 00:53:59.235
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:05.600
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's it.

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:11.200
<v Speaker 0>Done here.

00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:15.520
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:54:19.145 --> 00:54:21.305
<v Speaker 0>K. Let's try to see if that machine

00:54:21.305 --> 00:54:22.345
<v Speaker 0>is responding.

00:54:28.984 --> 00:54:30.744
<v Speaker 0>Let's pull down the metadata.

00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:35.990
<v Speaker 0>The user data. Sorry.

00:54:43.590 --> 00:54:44.470
<v Speaker 0>I mean,

00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:48.070
<v Speaker 0>I'm pretty happy with that.

00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:14.100
<v Speaker 0>So that's interesting.

00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:16.340
<v Speaker 0>Let's see if it's fail.

00:55:17.295 --> 00:55:37.295
<v Speaker 1>This

00:55:31.930 --> 00:55:33.850
<v Speaker 1>no Kubernetes version here.

00:55:46.615 --> 00:55:49.335
<v Speaker 0>So why is that not being interpolated?

00:55:49.335 --> 00:55:51.095
<v Speaker 0>We have another

00:55:51.175 --> 00:55:51.975
<v Speaker 0>problem.

00:55:52.935 --> 00:55:56.055
<v Speaker 0>I grabbed that as an example from something

00:55:56.055 --> 00:55:58.055
<v Speaker 0>else that I saw being posted in.

00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:06.270
<v Speaker 0>But I may have made that up.

00:56:21.085 --> 00:56:22.045
<v Speaker 0>Looks like I did.

00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:29.580
<v Speaker 0>So

00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:32.380
<v Speaker 0>let's look for this.

00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:41.100
<v Speaker 0>Let's see. I know the variables are mentioned.

00:57:00.890 --> 00:57:01.290
<v Speaker 0>Shit.

00:57:09.234 --> 00:57:12.355
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's fix that. Now, if we take

00:57:12.355 --> 00:57:13.875
<v Speaker 0>a look at what's actually in the user

00:57:13.875 --> 00:57:16.195
<v Speaker 0>data, there is some interpolation.

00:57:16.195 --> 00:57:19.075
<v Speaker 0>We can see the control plane endpoint

00:57:19.474 --> 00:57:20.995
<v Speaker 0>is passed in.

00:57:21.474 --> 00:57:23.474
<v Speaker 0>Actually, it's in the ghost style templates.

00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:28.780
<v Speaker 0>We're gonna try and fudge that then.

00:57:37.755 --> 00:57:39.115
<v Speaker 0>Let's go take a look at the copy

00:57:39.115 --> 00:57:40.155
<v Speaker 0>code. Have

00:57:41.595 --> 00:57:43.035
<v Speaker 0>have no idea what I'm doing at the

00:57:43.035 --> 00:57:43.675
<v Speaker 0>moment.

00:57:48.075 --> 00:57:49.435
<v Speaker 0>That is copy.

00:57:50.635 --> 00:57:52.315
<v Speaker 0>Check up the fader stuff first.

00:57:57.170 --> 00:57:59.090
<v Speaker 0>Let's do a somewhere in logged in.

00:58:02.850 --> 00:58:05.250
<v Speaker 0>Let's work in progress this.

00:58:11.015 --> 00:58:12.535
<v Speaker 0>How do I do that again?

00:58:16.295 --> 00:58:17.415
<v Speaker 0>Oh, wait. That's still

00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:26.100
<v Speaker 0>Jason, you're too quick.

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:32.260
<v Speaker 0>Shit. Alright. Let's try and fix this then.

00:58:35.095 --> 00:58:37.015
<v Speaker 0>I wonder if he's available. Let's just ping

00:58:37.015 --> 00:58:37.255
<v Speaker 0>him.

00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:56.850
<v Speaker 0>I sent him a message on Slack. Maybe

00:58:56.850 --> 00:58:58.945
<v Speaker 0>he can speed this process up and tell

00:58:58.945 --> 00:59:01.665
<v Speaker 0>me how that interpolation is actually happening into

00:59:01.665 --> 00:59:02.705
<v Speaker 0>those files.

00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:40.360
<v Speaker 0>Cool. Alright.

00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:43.320
<v Speaker 0>He says he'll be available soon.

00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:45.480
<v Speaker 0>In the meantime,

00:59:49.015 --> 00:59:50.855
<v Speaker 0>I will be back.

00:59:53.015 --> 00:59:55.495
<v Speaker 0>Oh, we've got some go templates here

00:59:56.535 --> 00:59:57.815
<v Speaker 0>for plain endpoint.

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:03.540
<v Speaker 0>See if we can find

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:08.980
<v Speaker 0>so this is our template.

01:00:12.819 --> 01:00:14.020
<v Speaker 0>Let's search for that.

01:00:15.465 --> 01:00:17.305
<v Speaker 0>You can see the call to go template.

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:31.480
<v Speaker 0>To not die.

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:42.200
<v Speaker 0>It looks like this defines a Kubernetes version.

01:00:49.695 --> 01:00:51.215
<v Speaker 0>I just need to work out how to

01:00:51.215 --> 01:00:53.935
<v Speaker 0>get that into the provision or the cloud

01:00:53.935 --> 01:00:54.815
<v Speaker 0>in it data.

01:00:59.849 --> 01:01:01.370
<v Speaker 0>Let's try

01:01:02.810 --> 01:01:03.530
<v Speaker 0>template.

01:01:05.690 --> 01:01:07.530
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's quite a lot of templates, actually.

01:01:12.575 --> 01:01:14.175
<v Speaker 0>This is probably what I want.

01:01:46.915 --> 01:01:47.795
<v Speaker 0>Feels right.

01:01:51.089 --> 01:01:52.849
<v Speaker 0>I can see the special handler for the

01:01:52.849 --> 01:01:53.970
<v Speaker 0>control plan endpoint.

01:02:10.224 --> 01:02:11.185
<v Speaker 0>Let's

01:02:11.265 --> 01:02:12.465
<v Speaker 0>let's think.

01:02:14.625 --> 01:02:16.545
<v Speaker 0>This is creating a new device.

01:02:16.944 --> 01:02:18.385
<v Speaker 0>It was a control plane.

01:02:21.690 --> 01:02:23.370
<v Speaker 0>Parses the user data.

01:02:28.490 --> 01:02:30.570
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's okay. This is the right bit.

01:02:35.234 --> 01:02:37.555
<v Speaker 0>And the API key has been injected. Let's

01:02:37.555 --> 01:02:38.435
<v Speaker 0>see if we can see that.

01:02:47.170 --> 01:02:47.890
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

01:02:50.610 --> 01:02:52.930
<v Speaker 0>Punching

01:02:52.930 --> 01:02:53.570
<v Speaker 0>my mic now.

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.640
<v Speaker 0>Jason is typing.

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:16.680
<v Speaker 0>That's good.

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.000
<v Speaker 0>This template execute.

01:03:27.375 --> 01:03:30.415
<v Speaker 0>So the API key struck. I think that's

01:03:30.495 --> 01:03:32.335
<v Speaker 0>maybe just poorly named.

01:03:36.895 --> 01:03:39.135
<v Speaker 0>It was really just a variable map.

01:03:40.730 --> 01:03:42.010
<v Speaker 0>I could add

01:03:43.049 --> 01:03:44.970
<v Speaker 0>a Kubernetes version to that.

01:03:50.730 --> 01:03:52.170
<v Speaker 0>How confident do I feel?

01:03:54.785 --> 01:03:57.505
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Fuck it. Let's do it. Okay. So

01:04:02.944 --> 01:04:04.865
<v Speaker 0>we need to inject the version.

01:04:09.110 --> 01:04:10.470
<v Speaker 0>We'll come back here.

01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:15.510
<v Speaker 0>And the branch has been merged.

01:04:20.550 --> 01:04:21.190
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

01:04:36.204 --> 01:04:39.325
<v Speaker 0>Offered Jason

01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:40.540
<v Speaker 0>to some private if he doesn't wanna stream

01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:41.340
<v Speaker 0>Cisco.

01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:43.660
<v Speaker 0>Let me drop off, but we'll see.

01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:46.460
<v Speaker 0>Let's get a new branch.

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:50.300
<v Speaker 0>It's again.

01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:52.780
<v Speaker 0>Inject

01:04:55.075 --> 01:04:56.195
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes

01:04:57.555 --> 01:04:58.595
<v Speaker 1>version.

01:05:00.915 --> 01:05:03.395
<v Speaker 0>Cool. Join them. And Jason will join us

01:05:03.395 --> 01:05:04.435
<v Speaker 0>on the stream.

01:05:06.195 --> 01:05:07.315
<v Speaker 0>Client.co.

01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:10.349
<v Speaker 0>Let's get it ready to show them. In

01:05:10.349 --> 01:05:12.270
<v Speaker 0>fact, I can just send them the link.

01:05:17.309 --> 01:05:18.110
<v Speaker 0>Sweet.

01:05:19.390 --> 01:05:20.270
<v Speaker 0>And assist.

01:05:23.275 --> 01:05:24.155
<v Speaker 0>I'm

01:05:25.115 --> 01:05:27.515
<v Speaker 0>I'm trying to be sure what I need.

01:05:33.115 --> 01:05:34.155
<v Speaker 0>Something here.

01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:37.660
<v Speaker 0>And it's not gonna be an f. It's

01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:39.500
<v Speaker 0>just gonna be an always. There's always gonna

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:41.100
<v Speaker 0>be a version provided.

01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:45.900
<v Speaker 0>It close.

01:05:52.174 --> 01:05:53.775
<v Speaker 0>And I'll just wait for someone who knows

01:05:53.775 --> 01:05:54.815
<v Speaker 0>what the hell they're doing.

01:05:58.335 --> 01:05:59.055
<v Speaker 0>Hello?

01:06:00.095 --> 01:06:00.734
<v Speaker 0>Hello.

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:02.720
<v Speaker 0>Hi.

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.200
<v Speaker 0>So I got myself in a pickle.

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:06.880
<v Speaker 0>Assume I should give you a little bit

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:08.000
<v Speaker 0>of context first.

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:09.360
<v Speaker 2>Alright.

01:06:11.839 --> 01:06:14.720
<v Speaker 0>So I submitted a PR yesterday

01:06:14.934 --> 01:06:16.694
<v Speaker 0>and just said there was no test yet,

01:06:16.694 --> 01:06:18.535
<v Speaker 0>but it's miraculous to make its way into

01:06:18.535 --> 01:06:20.775
<v Speaker 0>the master branch. So I thought I better

01:06:20.775 --> 01:06:22.375
<v Speaker 0>test this, and I figured I would stream

01:06:22.375 --> 01:06:23.895
<v Speaker 0>it. It would all work and nothing would

01:06:23.895 --> 01:06:24.615
<v Speaker 0>go wrong.

01:06:24.855 --> 01:06:26.375
<v Speaker 0>And the first problem I ran until you've

01:06:26.375 --> 01:06:28.775
<v Speaker 0>already merged, so thank you. Then close it

01:06:28.775 --> 01:06:29.335
<v Speaker 0>because

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:31.640
<v Speaker 0>the YAML is loaded and and

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:34.200
<v Speaker 0>encapsulated with the courts. The courts have said

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.559
<v Speaker 0>to escape, and then the match on the

01:06:35.559 --> 01:06:37.799
<v Speaker 0>arc was failing. So we're past that. The

01:06:37.799 --> 01:06:38.760
<v Speaker 0>problem is

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:40.920
<v Speaker 0>I was miraculously

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:42.920
<v Speaker 0>expecting the Kubernetes version

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:44.839
<v Speaker 0>be able to exist.

01:06:47.585 --> 01:06:49.984
<v Speaker 0>Oh, sorry. That that doesn't exist? No. I

01:06:49.984 --> 01:06:52.065
<v Speaker 0>think I found where to inject it, which

01:06:52.065 --> 01:06:53.665
<v Speaker 0>is API construct,

01:06:54.865 --> 01:06:56.225
<v Speaker 0>which seems to happen,

01:06:56.385 --> 01:06:58.305
<v Speaker 0>which I think is gonna pass at the

01:06:58.305 --> 01:06:58.705
<v Speaker 0>template

01:06:59.105 --> 01:06:59.905
<v Speaker 0>execute.

01:06:59.905 --> 01:07:01.025
<v Speaker 0>Does that seem right?

01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:03.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. That seems right.

01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:07.100
<v Speaker 2>Generally, if somebody was doing this with

01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:09.740
<v Speaker 2>following the upstream docs,

01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:13.100
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the variables that's passed into

01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:15.020
<v Speaker 2>the templates when you call

01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:17.180
<v Speaker 2>the cluster cuddle command to

01:07:18.195 --> 01:07:21.155
<v Speaker 2>create the cluster resources from templates.

01:07:25.475 --> 01:07:27.075
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So if I just made a mistake

01:07:27.075 --> 01:07:28.355
<v Speaker 0>and it's not a problem then?

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:32.080
<v Speaker 0>So sorry. Let me confirm what I think

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:33.200
<v Speaker 0>you were saying there.

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:35.360
<v Speaker 0>I'll go back to my directory

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:36.000
<v Speaker 0>here.

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:37.920
<v Speaker 0>So if I

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:41.360
<v Speaker 0>to the command that I ran

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:44.160
<v Speaker 0>Yep. After the Kubernetes version here

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:44.800
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

01:07:45.345 --> 01:07:48.625
<v Speaker 0>And you're saying that the output YAML

01:07:49.665 --> 01:07:50.625
<v Speaker 0>should have

01:07:52.625 --> 01:07:54.785
<v Speaker 0>API key. I better delete that now.

01:07:56.945 --> 01:07:59.505
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I I created it here. Okay.

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:05.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Basically, that command line argument for

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:07.680
<v Speaker 2>cluster cuddle config cluster

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:10.560
<v Speaker 2>basically just,

01:08:11.934 --> 01:08:14.815
<v Speaker 2>you know, interpolates the Kubernetes

01:08:14.815 --> 01:08:16.654
<v Speaker 2>version environment variable.

01:08:19.455 --> 01:08:21.215
<v Speaker 0>Oh, okay. So I am in a peck

01:08:21.215 --> 01:08:22.654
<v Speaker 0>of it as well. That's what that is

01:08:22.654 --> 01:08:24.654
<v Speaker 0>my fault. So it's the reason

01:08:24.975 --> 01:08:25.935
<v Speaker 0>I

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:29.840
<v Speaker 0>I modified this after generating it because I

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:32.159
<v Speaker 0>don't I don't wanna have to build cluster

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:34.880
<v Speaker 0>CTL control cuddle

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:36.319
<v Speaker 0>myself.

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:38.560
<v Speaker 0>So I should just do that and confirm

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:41.094
<v Speaker 0>that this still works. Right? Yeah. And it

01:08:41.094 --> 01:08:42.614
<v Speaker 2>should just be a matter of

01:08:42.935 --> 01:08:44.694
<v Speaker 2>running ENV substitute.

01:08:46.854 --> 01:08:49.255
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's anything too advanced that

01:08:49.255 --> 01:08:51.895
<v Speaker 2>would be replaced that you couldn't just do

01:08:51.895 --> 01:08:53.014
<v Speaker 2>with ENV substitute.

01:08:57.250 --> 01:08:58.210
<v Speaker 0>Right. Okay.

01:09:00.530 --> 01:09:03.810
<v Speaker 0>So the Kubernetes all uppercase underscore version is

01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:06.690
<v Speaker 0>fine, and I'm just stressing over nothing.

01:09:07.875 --> 01:09:08.675
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully.

01:09:10.274 --> 01:09:11.074
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

01:09:11.394 --> 01:09:12.194
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:09:12.354 --> 01:09:14.675
<v Speaker 0>Well, I built this now, so let's just

01:09:15.954 --> 01:09:16.675
<v Speaker 0>okay.

01:09:18.994 --> 01:09:22.274
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no. Because yeah. There is this is,

01:09:22.274 --> 01:09:23.960
<v Speaker 0>like, the first three minutes of the stream,

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:24.920
<v Speaker 0>had this question.

01:09:25.399 --> 01:09:27.640
<v Speaker 0>How do when I run cluster control and

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:29.159
<v Speaker 0>a provider packet,

01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:31.479
<v Speaker 0>do I need to do anything to get

01:09:31.479 --> 01:09:33.880
<v Speaker 0>it to use this version? Like, how how

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:34.680
<v Speaker 0>do they correlate?

01:09:36.555 --> 01:09:38.555
<v Speaker 2>The version of Kubernetes and the version of

01:09:38.555 --> 01:09:39.914
<v Speaker 2>the packet provider?

01:09:40.555 --> 01:09:43.514
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So when I run cluster control provider,

01:09:43.755 --> 01:09:45.675
<v Speaker 0>I don't get the new templates that were

01:09:45.675 --> 01:09:47.915
<v Speaker 0>merged. Is there another step that has to

01:09:47.915 --> 01:09:48.314
<v Speaker 0>happen there?

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:50.159
<v Speaker 2>Yes.

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:53.279
<v Speaker 2>In the cluster API

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:54.559
<v Speaker 2>documentation

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:58.159
<v Speaker 2>that's generated and published to Netlify, that has

01:09:58.239 --> 01:09:59.040
<v Speaker 2>kind of

01:10:00.495 --> 01:10:02.255
<v Speaker 2>a a set of steps that you can

01:10:02.255 --> 01:10:06.175
<v Speaker 2>run to basically use the developer workflow and

01:10:06.255 --> 01:10:07.855
<v Speaker 2>use a locally,

01:10:08.895 --> 01:10:11.375
<v Speaker 2>checked out copy of the provider.

01:10:12.015 --> 01:10:13.650
<v Speaker 2>You would have to follow those steps in

01:10:13.650 --> 01:10:15.170
<v Speaker 2>order to be able to run the local

01:10:15.170 --> 01:10:17.730
<v Speaker 2>changes. Otherwise, it's just going to pull the

01:10:17.730 --> 01:10:18.450
<v Speaker 2>latest

01:10:18.610 --> 01:10:21.010
<v Speaker 2>published release that's out there.

01:10:23.250 --> 01:10:24.050
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

01:10:24.690 --> 01:10:26.210
<v Speaker 2>So it should be under

01:10:26.610 --> 01:10:27.570
<v Speaker 2>cluster cuddle.

01:10:29.695 --> 01:10:30.974
<v Speaker 2>There's a section.

01:10:40.975 --> 01:10:43.215
<v Speaker 2>Cluster cuddle for developers there, 2.4.

01:10:46.449 --> 01:10:49.090
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Using most local artifacts.

01:10:49.889 --> 01:10:50.610
<v Speaker 1>Sweet.

01:10:56.915 --> 01:10:59.075
<v Speaker 0>So I create this JSON file, and that's

01:10:59.075 --> 01:10:59.635
<v Speaker 0>it.

01:11:01.475 --> 01:11:03.955
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. That that's just gonna tell cluster cuddle

01:11:03.955 --> 01:11:06.435
<v Speaker 2>when you run it to override the defaults

01:11:06.435 --> 01:11:07.155
<v Speaker 2>that it

01:11:07.555 --> 01:11:09.795
<v Speaker 2>that it has internally or or it looks

01:11:09.795 --> 01:11:10.355
<v Speaker 2>up

01:11:10.909 --> 01:11:12.110
<v Speaker 2>from GitHub.

01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:17.709
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

01:11:18.670 --> 01:11:20.270
<v Speaker 0>I'm just trying to work out whether I

01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:22.510
<v Speaker 0>need to create that file and that's particular

01:11:22.510 --> 01:11:23.630
<v Speaker 0>location or not.

01:11:25.385 --> 01:11:26.825
<v Speaker 0>It seems that I think this is assuming

01:11:26.825 --> 01:11:29.465
<v Speaker 0>I may be in a a local clone

01:11:29.465 --> 01:11:30.105
<v Speaker 0>of

01:11:30.745 --> 01:11:31.785
<v Speaker 0>that repo.

01:11:32.985 --> 01:11:34.185
<v Speaker 2>So let's see.

01:11:38.830 --> 01:11:41.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. That's gonna be the local

01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:42.990
<v Speaker 2>copy of the repo.

01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:48.030
<v Speaker 0>Let me see.

01:11:51.505 --> 01:11:53.425
<v Speaker 2>You may actually want the

01:12:01.345 --> 01:12:02.705
<v Speaker 2>yeah. I think there's some that you can

01:12:02.705 --> 01:12:05.590
<v Speaker 2>override with just the cluster cuddle config. Yeah.

01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:06.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm all there. Let me see if I

01:12:06.710 --> 01:12:07.589
<v Speaker 2>can look it up.

01:12:10.150 --> 01:12:11.909
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I guess I could always just

01:12:12.949 --> 01:12:15.429
<v Speaker 0>hope that the variable is there. I guess

01:12:15.429 --> 01:12:16.070
<v Speaker 0>I

01:12:17.195 --> 01:12:19.035
<v Speaker 2>I I wouldn't expect it to be unless

01:12:19.035 --> 01:12:20.475
<v Speaker 2>we publish the new

01:12:20.875 --> 01:12:21.994
<v Speaker 2>version of

01:12:22.555 --> 01:12:24.475
<v Speaker 2>the packet provider since

01:12:25.835 --> 01:12:27.435
<v Speaker 2>since those changes got merged.

01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:32.660
<v Speaker 0>Oh, what I mean is, like, this Kubernetes

01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:36.179
<v Speaker 0>version variable will be interpolated and

01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:40.179
<v Speaker 0>low. Right? Yeah. That you're pretty confident that

01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:42.580
<v Speaker 0>where is it?

01:12:47.625 --> 01:12:49.304
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. That's the one I generated.

01:12:51.465 --> 01:12:53.304
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I mean, you you said you're pretty

01:12:53.304 --> 01:12:55.864
<v Speaker 0>confident that that is when I run cluster

01:12:55.864 --> 01:12:58.585
<v Speaker 0>configs, that's just gonna work anyway. Right? Yes.

01:12:58.585 --> 01:13:00.479
<v Speaker 2>That should. Yeah. Okay.

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:03.280
<v Speaker 0>Then I fixed the quotes. Maybe I should

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:05.280
<v Speaker 0>just be confident. So, like,

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:07.360
<v Speaker 0>if I want to test this with so

01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:09.760
<v Speaker 0>any local modifications on my side

01:13:10.079 --> 01:13:10.719
<v Speaker 0>is

01:13:11.555 --> 01:13:12.995
<v Speaker 0>Does that just mean that we need to

01:13:12.995 --> 01:13:15.795
<v Speaker 0>tag a release on the packet side? Or

01:13:16.355 --> 01:13:18.275
<v Speaker 0>yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

01:13:18.675 --> 01:13:21.075
<v Speaker 2>Basically, what cluster cuddle does is it looks

01:13:21.075 --> 01:13:21.475
<v Speaker 2>at the

01:13:22.195 --> 01:13:23.875
<v Speaker 2>you know, it's configured to

01:13:24.115 --> 01:13:27.290
<v Speaker 2>where the GitHub repository is for the various

01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:29.850
<v Speaker 2>providers, and it looks at the latest published

01:13:29.850 --> 01:13:32.170
<v Speaker 2>release that's not a prerelease.

01:13:35.850 --> 01:13:36.570
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

01:13:36.890 --> 01:13:38.810
<v Speaker 0>I guess I can just wait for the

01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:39.210
<v Speaker 0>release.

01:13:42.625 --> 01:13:44.305
<v Speaker 0>Or at least I can try playing around

01:13:44.305 --> 01:13:46.225
<v Speaker 0>with this later.

01:13:49.025 --> 01:13:52.304
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I'm confident. I think it's gonna work.

01:13:53.665 --> 01:13:55.345
<v Speaker 0>It's been a trying hour and a half.

01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:58.270
<v Speaker 0>So my plan was to spin up a

01:13:58.270 --> 01:14:00.350
<v Speaker 0>one eighteen two cluster and then do an

01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:02.670
<v Speaker 0>upgrade, and I kinda go down this rabbit

01:14:02.670 --> 01:14:03.470
<v Speaker 0>hole of

01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:07.470
<v Speaker 0>trying to use the new configuration without the

01:14:07.470 --> 01:14:08.430
<v Speaker 0>manual modifications.

01:14:08.855 --> 01:14:10.215
<v Speaker 0>So I I I mean, I can just

01:14:10.215 --> 01:14:12.775
<v Speaker 0>do that myself. Right? So if I just

01:14:12.775 --> 01:14:14.775
<v Speaker 0>search and replace Kubernetes,

01:14:18.135 --> 01:14:19.415
<v Speaker 0>I'm not gonna be able to search and

01:14:19.415 --> 01:14:19.895
<v Speaker 0>replace.

01:14:20.215 --> 01:14:21.735
<v Speaker 0>Alright. And if I just be a bit

01:14:21.735 --> 01:14:22.455
<v Speaker 0>more specific.

01:14:25.770 --> 01:14:27.449
<v Speaker 0>And this will be one

01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:28.330
<v Speaker 0>eighteen.

01:14:34.490 --> 01:14:36.810
<v Speaker 0>And I don't need you anymore because I

01:14:36.810 --> 01:14:38.650
<v Speaker 0>was gonna start doing that. That's gonna be

01:14:38.650 --> 01:14:39.210
<v Speaker 0>a bad thing.

01:14:48.725 --> 01:14:50.325
<v Speaker 0>And I'm now on to my third name

01:14:50.325 --> 01:14:53.285
<v Speaker 0>of this cluster. I've had quick start, slow

01:14:53.285 --> 01:14:56.139
<v Speaker 0>start, fast start, and then I'm gonna do

01:14:56.139 --> 01:14:57.340
<v Speaker 0>right start.

01:14:59.420 --> 01:15:00.699
<v Speaker 0>So that I don't have to wait on

01:15:00.699 --> 01:15:01.900
<v Speaker 0>everything disappearing.

01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:02.699
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:15:06.059 --> 01:15:07.579
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Thank

01:15:07.579 --> 01:15:09.260
<v Speaker 0>you for your help. You're more than welcome

01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:11.244
<v Speaker 0>to just hang around while I spin this

01:15:11.244 --> 01:15:12.445
<v Speaker 0>up and kick the tires on it, but

01:15:12.445 --> 01:15:13.965
<v Speaker 0>I don't expect you to take time out

01:15:13.965 --> 01:15:15.484
<v Speaker 0>of your day to sit and watch this.

01:15:17.324 --> 01:15:18.605
<v Speaker 2>I have I have some other stuff I

01:15:18.605 --> 01:15:21.085
<v Speaker 2>have to look at, some reviews I'm kinda

01:15:21.085 --> 01:15:23.085
<v Speaker 2>backlogged on. But if you do hit any

01:15:23.085 --> 01:15:24.684
<v Speaker 2>issues, let me know, and I'll be happy

01:15:24.684 --> 01:15:26.920
<v Speaker 2>to rejoin. Thank you very much. I really

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:28.760
<v Speaker 0>appreciate that. That was helpful. Yep. I'll speak

01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:29.719
<v Speaker 0>to you soon. Alright.

01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:38.280
<v Speaker 0>It's good to get help then again.

01:15:41.385 --> 01:15:44.025
<v Speaker 0>Hey. Right. Start. No. I'm not gonna do

01:15:44.025 --> 01:15:44.905
<v Speaker 0>the upgrade

01:15:44.985 --> 01:15:47.065
<v Speaker 0>as it is getting a little bit late.

01:15:47.065 --> 01:15:48.824
<v Speaker 0>What I will do is confirm that one

01:15:48.824 --> 01:15:50.184
<v Speaker 0>eighteen two installs.

01:15:50.905 --> 01:15:52.585
<v Speaker 0>And then next week, I will run an

01:15:52.585 --> 01:15:52.905
<v Speaker 0>upgrade.

01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:56.400
<v Speaker 0>So I'll wait for the IP address, the

01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:58.720
<v Speaker 0>machine to reboot, jump on it, and hope

01:15:58.720 --> 01:15:59.600
<v Speaker 0>for the best.

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:09.360
<v Speaker 0>We have an IP address, which is good.

01:16:13.335 --> 01:16:16.215
<v Speaker 0>We can kill faster.

01:16:21.735 --> 01:16:23.255
<v Speaker 0>And push

01:16:23.815 --> 01:16:24.135
<v Speaker 0>here.

01:16:32.210 --> 01:16:34.770
<v Speaker 0>Search restatins of that nine. Let take that

01:16:34.770 --> 01:16:35.250
<v Speaker 0>like that.

01:16:46.425 --> 01:16:47.624
<v Speaker 0>And we're wet.

01:16:52.824 --> 01:16:54.744
<v Speaker 0>Looks a bit dark on there. Let's see

01:16:54.744 --> 01:16:55.945
<v Speaker 0>if I can get my lights up.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.440
<v Speaker 0>Gives me something to do for a few

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:00.079
<v Speaker 0>minutes.

01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:02.959
<v Speaker 0>Woah.

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:04.639
<v Speaker 0>I'm bright.

01:17:07.679 --> 01:17:09.679
<v Speaker 0>Few minutes, few seconds, whatever.

01:17:18.324 --> 01:17:21.284
<v Speaker 0>And I need to delete that API token

01:17:21.284 --> 01:17:23.124
<v Speaker 0>that I shared with everybody.

01:17:23.284 --> 01:17:24.085
<v Speaker 0>That was fun.

01:17:27.190 --> 01:17:29.030
<v Speaker 0>Let's just pop this open

01:17:30.789 --> 01:17:32.389
<v Speaker 0>in a new window

01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:36.949
<v Speaker 0>and

01:17:40.285 --> 01:17:41.085
<v Speaker 0>delete.

01:17:45.165 --> 01:17:45.485
<v Speaker 0>Done.

01:18:13.145 --> 01:18:13.864
<v Speaker 0>I

01:18:14.265 --> 01:18:16.585
<v Speaker 0>should bring a book to read

01:18:17.305 --> 01:18:18.345
<v Speaker 0>during these moments.

01:18:31.670 --> 01:18:32.950
<v Speaker 0>But slower this time.

01:18:44.405 --> 01:18:45.925
<v Speaker 0>We need to play with some buttons.

01:18:52.429 --> 01:18:53.790
<v Speaker 0>I quite like that one, but it's a

01:18:53.790 --> 01:18:54.590
<v Speaker 0>bit small.

01:18:59.550 --> 01:19:00.829
<v Speaker 0>We could if you could make it just

01:19:00.829 --> 01:19:01.630
<v Speaker 0>a little bit bigger.

01:19:09.665 --> 01:19:10.785
<v Speaker 0>Let's do this.

01:19:18.909 --> 01:19:19.869
<v Speaker 0>Looks good.

01:19:21.230 --> 01:19:23.869
<v Speaker 0>We got a little clash on the keys.

01:19:47.070 --> 01:19:49.469
<v Speaker 0>New lane expected.

01:19:50.429 --> 01:19:51.630
<v Speaker 0>Fuck you.

01:19:57.790 --> 01:19:59.070
<v Speaker 0>And what the user data?

01:20:09.835 --> 01:20:10.554
<v Speaker 0>And

01:20:10.955 --> 01:20:12.955
<v Speaker 0>that it that's nothing to do with me.

01:20:23.130 --> 01:20:24.650
<v Speaker 0>I hope that's not it.

01:20:26.489 --> 01:20:27.450
<v Speaker 0>There's a new line.

01:20:38.665 --> 01:20:40.825
<v Speaker 0>I don't feel

01:20:40.825 --> 01:20:42.265
<v Speaker 0>like that's my problem.

01:20:55.460 --> 01:20:57.460
<v Speaker 0>That seems to run the oh,

01:21:02.284 --> 01:21:03.565
<v Speaker 0>that's my problem.

01:21:04.765 --> 01:21:06.124
<v Speaker 0>Where'd that come from?

01:21:10.605 --> 01:21:11.245
<v Speaker 0>Strats.

01:21:14.770 --> 01:21:15.489
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:21:15.650 --> 01:21:16.849
<v Speaker 0>Great start.

01:21:17.010 --> 01:21:18.130
<v Speaker 0>Final start.

01:21:18.210 --> 01:21:20.130
<v Speaker 0>And I'll have final two start and I'm

01:21:20.130 --> 01:21:20.690
<v Speaker 0>done.

01:21:22.290 --> 01:21:23.809
<v Speaker 0>Alright. One more time.

01:21:25.250 --> 01:21:25.890
<v Speaker 0>Delete.

01:21:27.795 --> 01:21:29.155
<v Speaker 0>That's making sure.

01:21:39.315 --> 01:21:41.074
<v Speaker 0>The API key is missing. That's not gonna

01:21:41.074 --> 01:21:41.395
<v Speaker 0>work.

01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:56.119
<v Speaker 0>Create a livestream key that can be a

01:21:56.119 --> 01:21:57.719
<v Speaker 0>little bit more expandable

01:21:58.885 --> 01:22:00.965
<v Speaker 0>than the one I've been using and then

01:22:00.965 --> 01:22:01.925
<v Speaker 0>delete it.

01:22:03.525 --> 01:22:04.165
<v Speaker 0>Nothing's gonna

01:22:05.925 --> 01:22:08.164
<v Speaker 0>no wrong start will spin up here.

01:22:10.405 --> 01:22:10.885
<v Speaker 0>Export.

01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:19.510
<v Speaker 0>We're

01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:23.670
<v Speaker 0>CTL edit.

01:22:32.405 --> 01:22:35.525
<v Speaker 0>And I need to reset the Docker daemon,

01:22:35.605 --> 01:22:36.805
<v Speaker 0>the Kubernetes daemon.

01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:55.275
<v Speaker 0>And then reprovision

01:22:55.275 --> 01:22:56.875
<v Speaker 0>the cluster controller

01:22:57.675 --> 01:22:59.755
<v Speaker 0>with the new seeker. I could probably have

01:22:59.755 --> 01:23:00.554
<v Speaker 0>started

01:23:01.515 --> 01:23:03.994
<v Speaker 0>editing things and restarting controllers,

01:23:04.475 --> 01:23:06.955
<v Speaker 0>you know, resetting a Kubernetes cluster with Docker

01:23:06.955 --> 01:23:08.795
<v Speaker 0>for Mac doesn't exactly take long.

01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:15.100
<v Speaker 0>And I already feel like I'm committed now.

01:23:31.475 --> 01:23:31.875
<v Speaker 0>See.

01:23:36.610 --> 01:23:39.490
<v Speaker 0>I'll resend that updated my config. That's good.

01:23:54.465 --> 01:23:56.625
<v Speaker 0>I'm tired now. This is stressful work.

01:24:24.135 --> 01:24:26.455
<v Speaker 0>Come on, Docker Kubernetes.

01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:36.790
<v Speaker 0>Let's just see if I've got access to

01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:38.230
<v Speaker 0>my control plan.

01:24:39.270 --> 01:24:40.070
<v Speaker 0>Right. Okay.

01:24:41.455 --> 01:24:43.615
<v Speaker 0>So let's bring this back. Now the secret

01:24:43.615 --> 01:24:44.735
<v Speaker 0>bit is done.

01:24:48.335 --> 01:24:50.575
<v Speaker 0>My key is there. I'm deleting that in

01:24:50.575 --> 01:24:51.615
<v Speaker 0>a minute anyway.

01:24:52.015 --> 01:24:53.935
<v Speaker 0>I'm beyond kidding now. So

01:24:57.840 --> 01:24:58.719
<v Speaker 0>and

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:01.600
<v Speaker 0>which year.

01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:05.360
<v Speaker 0>Reprovision

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:06.800
<v Speaker 0>cluster CTL,

01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:08.480
<v Speaker 0>reapply

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:10.080
<v Speaker 0>manifest.

01:25:12.765 --> 01:25:13.885
<v Speaker 0>See what happens.

01:25:16.125 --> 01:25:18.365
<v Speaker 0>And then I am done. It's too late

01:25:18.365 --> 01:25:19.485
<v Speaker 0>and afraid for this shit.

01:25:32.239 --> 01:25:33.599
<v Speaker 0>I have a comment.

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:37.520
<v Speaker 0>Watching a stream about upgrades, my virtual machine

01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:38.640
<v Speaker 0>just died. Yep.

01:25:39.325 --> 01:25:41.804
<v Speaker 0>All of my shit is dying. Like,

01:25:42.925 --> 01:25:44.285
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if you've been watching for

01:25:44.285 --> 01:25:45.805
<v Speaker 0>five minutes or the whole hour and a

01:25:45.805 --> 01:25:47.485
<v Speaker 0>half, but it's not going well.

01:25:47.805 --> 01:25:50.845
<v Speaker 0>But it's been fun. I'm learning about cluster

01:25:50.845 --> 01:25:51.965
<v Speaker 0>API. So

01:25:52.950 --> 01:25:55.510
<v Speaker 0>so now that we've reprovisioned the packet provider

01:25:55.510 --> 01:25:58.550
<v Speaker 0>with my now very public Equinix metal API

01:25:58.550 --> 01:25:59.270
<v Speaker 0>key.

01:26:02.150 --> 01:26:04.710
<v Speaker 0>Just wanna reapply wrong start.

01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:07.190
<v Speaker 0>Confirm that it shows up

01:26:08.925 --> 01:26:10.044
<v Speaker 0>over here.

01:26:11.804 --> 01:26:13.004
<v Speaker 0>Moment, hopefully.

01:26:15.165 --> 01:26:17.005
<v Speaker 0>I just wanna see Kubernetes

01:26:17.005 --> 01:26:19.165
<v Speaker 0>one eighteen two on this machine, and then

01:26:19.165 --> 01:26:20.364
<v Speaker 0>I'll deal with the upgrade layer.

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:28.040
<v Speaker 0>But we did fix the cool editor. Silver

01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:29.159
<v Speaker 0>lining. Right?

01:26:36.199 --> 01:26:37.000
<v Speaker 0>Why? Why? Why?

01:26:39.135 --> 01:26:40.734
<v Speaker 0>Let's see what's going on.

01:26:45.775 --> 01:26:48.414
<v Speaker 0>My credentials are only seventy two seconds old.

01:26:48.414 --> 01:26:50.014
<v Speaker 0>I'm hoping that's a new one.

01:26:51.909 --> 01:26:53.109
<v Speaker 0>The controllers

01:26:53.190 --> 01:26:54.709
<v Speaker 0>should be running.

01:26:58.949 --> 01:27:01.189
<v Speaker 0>And patience again, as always.

01:27:02.710 --> 01:27:05.030
<v Speaker 0>Let's hope we get a fast deploy this

01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:05.429
<v Speaker 0>time.

01:27:06.785 --> 01:27:08.065
<v Speaker 0>This machine

01:27:09.185 --> 01:27:10.065
<v Speaker 0>quick.

01:27:11.585 --> 01:27:13.105
<v Speaker 0>And I open I want you.

01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:23.960
<v Speaker 0>I love that the stream started off about

01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:26.040
<v Speaker 0>upgrades, and it's just turned into

01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:29.560
<v Speaker 0>defect hunting, bug hunting.

01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:45.159
<v Speaker 1>See.

01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:48.920
<v Speaker 0>Patience is a virtue, David.

01:27:57.065 --> 01:27:58.825
<v Speaker 0>Wait. I have the time.

01:28:01.785 --> 01:28:03.305
<v Speaker 0>Don't get you anymore.

01:28:05.945 --> 01:28:08.985
<v Speaker 0>Could probably kill the API key nervous pause.

01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:13.820
<v Speaker 0>I mean, all I wanna do is

01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:15.340
<v Speaker 0>confirm.

01:28:29.724 --> 01:28:31.804
<v Speaker 0>And I refresh refresh refresh.

01:28:57.975 --> 01:29:00.135
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Come on, Kubernetes.

01:29:00.215 --> 01:29:04.295
<v Speaker 0>One eighteen two. One eighteen two. One eighteen

01:29:04.295 --> 01:29:04.615
<v Speaker 0>two.

01:29:22.349 --> 01:29:23.469
<v Speaker 0>I don't know. It.

01:29:28.565 --> 01:29:30.005
<v Speaker 0>Check. Done.

01:29:37.844 --> 01:29:39.045
<v Speaker 0>Keep it. Keep it.

01:29:39.685 --> 01:29:40.780
<v Speaker 0>Keep it. Keep Keep it.

01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:46.700
<v Speaker 0>That's a relief.

01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:50.060
<v Speaker 0>Good.

01:29:52.635 --> 01:29:53.514
<v Speaker 0>It worked.

01:29:56.315 --> 01:29:57.034
<v Speaker 0>So

01:29:59.835 --> 01:30:01.675
<v Speaker 0>I have two choices.

01:30:10.180 --> 01:30:12.820
<v Speaker 0>Again, gives this cluster enough time to become

01:30:12.820 --> 01:30:13.700
<v Speaker 0>healthy

01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:17.620
<v Speaker 0>and walk through the upgrade process, albeit

01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:19.300
<v Speaker 0>10 to five,

01:30:19.855 --> 01:30:22.255
<v Speaker 0>or I can say at least the changes

01:30:22.255 --> 01:30:25.135
<v Speaker 0>I've made to the packet slash Equinix mail

01:30:25.135 --> 01:30:26.414
<v Speaker 0>provider work.

01:30:28.655 --> 01:30:29.374
<v Speaker 0>And

01:30:30.094 --> 01:30:32.094
<v Speaker 0>to another stream

01:30:33.020 --> 01:30:35.980
<v Speaker 0>tackling the upgrade. What is involved in an

01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:36.860
<v Speaker 0>upgrade?

01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:42.860
<v Speaker 0>Let's

01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:43.260
<v Speaker 0>see.

01:30:58.410 --> 01:31:14.730
<v Speaker 1>So

01:31:14.005 --> 01:31:17.125
<v Speaker 1>apparently, can run an upgrade plan.

01:31:22.645 --> 01:31:25.580
<v Speaker 0>We gotta drop my connection there again. Weird.

01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:27.580
<v Speaker 0>Over here.

01:31:30.380 --> 01:31:31.740
<v Speaker 0>First CTL

01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:32.619
<v Speaker 0>upgrade.

01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:33.340
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

01:31:34.220 --> 01:31:34.620
<v Speaker 0>Fine.

01:31:39.435 --> 01:31:40.155
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:31:40.235 --> 01:31:42.795
<v Speaker 0>So that updates the provider. So it's not

01:31:42.795 --> 01:31:43.835
<v Speaker 0>what I want.

01:31:47.915 --> 01:31:49.515
<v Speaker 0>How do I upgrade a cluster?

01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:53.520
<v Speaker 0>Dope. Alright. Yeah. That's useless. Next.

01:32:08.685 --> 01:32:10.205
<v Speaker 0>I I saw

01:32:10.605 --> 01:32:11.565
<v Speaker 0>upgrades were a thing.

01:32:21.410 --> 01:32:22.450
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

01:32:23.810 --> 01:32:26.210
<v Speaker 0>So to upgrade the control plane machines, let's

01:32:26.210 --> 01:32:27.250
<v Speaker 0>say we start with that.

01:32:30.695 --> 01:32:33.175
<v Speaker 0>We copy the existing machine template,

01:32:33.175 --> 01:32:34.775
<v Speaker 0>modify the values,

01:32:37.495 --> 01:32:39.895
<v Speaker 0>create the new machine template,

01:32:41.175 --> 01:32:44.615
<v Speaker 0>and then update the QVDM control plane ref.

01:32:48.180 --> 01:32:49.219
<v Speaker 0>Right. Okay.

01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:52.420
<v Speaker 0>Let's go for it. Fuck it.

01:32:54.260 --> 01:32:55.620
<v Speaker 0>So

01:32:56.180 --> 01:32:57.860
<v Speaker 0>let's just do a control plane upgrade. I'm

01:32:57.860 --> 01:32:59.060
<v Speaker 0>not gonna do the work or notes. We

01:32:59.060 --> 01:33:00.260
<v Speaker 0>don't even have them yet anyway.

01:33:04.315 --> 01:33:07.035
<v Speaker 0>And it wants us to upgrade the machine

01:33:07.035 --> 01:33:10.235
<v Speaker 0>template followed by the the QVDM control plane.

01:33:12.635 --> 01:33:14.075
<v Speaker 0>Is there a machine template?

01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:18.070
<v Speaker 0>No. That's the packet machine template. We don't

01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:18.790
<v Speaker 0>want that.

01:33:23.670 --> 01:33:24.870
<v Speaker 0>Wrong one.

01:33:29.365 --> 01:33:31.364
<v Speaker 0>Search for the Qubit commands.

01:33:34.565 --> 01:33:36.485
<v Speaker 0>Qubitm config template.

01:33:40.485 --> 01:33:42.325
<v Speaker 0>I think those docs are wrong. Okay.

01:33:48.510 --> 01:33:50.350
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. This looks right. Let's

01:33:54.750 --> 01:33:56.110
<v Speaker 0>Give us a new name

01:33:56.350 --> 01:33:58.190
<v Speaker 0>as a worker. I don't know why they're

01:33:58.190 --> 01:34:00.145
<v Speaker 0>control plan. I ain't got time for

01:34:01.825 --> 01:34:03.105
<v Speaker 0>time for everything.

01:34:03.825 --> 01:34:05.265
<v Speaker 0>Scroll up. There

01:34:05.745 --> 01:34:06.545
<v Speaker 0>we go. So

01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:27.920
<v Speaker 0>Confused there. Because it does tell me to

01:34:26.985 --> 01:34:29.065
<v Speaker 0>modify the existing resource

01:34:29.065 --> 01:34:31.465
<v Speaker 0>to the new machine template and the infrastructure

01:34:31.465 --> 01:34:32.265
<v Speaker 0>ref,

01:34:34.025 --> 01:34:35.625
<v Speaker 0>which is a map which has a packet

01:34:35.625 --> 01:34:37.545
<v Speaker 0>machine template. I don't wanna change the packet

01:34:37.545 --> 01:34:39.385
<v Speaker 0>machine template. I wonder if this is something

01:34:39.385 --> 01:34:41.785
<v Speaker 0>that's just unique to a bare metal cluster.

01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:45.520
<v Speaker 0>Let's just

01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:48.320
<v Speaker 0>let's just change this.

01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:55.520
<v Speaker 0>Alright. First thing, Josh, let's see which versions

01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:56.480
<v Speaker 0>of

01:34:58.535 --> 01:35:00.775
<v Speaker 0>one nineteen are available on the app cache

01:35:00.775 --> 01:35:01.255
<v Speaker 0>policy.

01:35:16.710 --> 01:35:18.710
<v Speaker 0>One nineteen two is good.

01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:24.150
<v Speaker 0>And because we need that here,

01:35:27.315 --> 01:35:28.835
<v Speaker 0>we need to modify that.

01:35:32.675 --> 01:35:34.355
<v Speaker 0>See that a few times for good luck.

01:35:34.355 --> 01:35:35.074
<v Speaker 0>Right.

01:35:37.235 --> 01:35:38.514
<v Speaker 0>So in theory,

01:35:38.595 --> 01:35:40.515
<v Speaker 0>if I just apply this over the top,

01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:43.400
<v Speaker 0>we know how that our control plan is

01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:45.000
<v Speaker 0>reconfigured.

01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:47.960
<v Speaker 0>And I'm curious

01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:49.640
<v Speaker 0>to know what that means

01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:50.280
<v Speaker 0>here.

01:36:03.615 --> 01:36:06.015
<v Speaker 0>But now it's actually spinning up a new

01:36:06.015 --> 01:36:07.215
<v Speaker 0>control plane.

01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:11.400
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's still provisioning the initial workers.

01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:14.679
<v Speaker 0>I

01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:17.560
<v Speaker 0>don't know if I'm just being impatient

01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:18.920
<v Speaker 0>as I normally am.

01:36:20.805 --> 01:36:22.885
<v Speaker 0>I'm just gonna start doing that control plan

01:36:22.885 --> 01:36:24.645
<v Speaker 0>at the same time. Now the reason I

01:36:24.645 --> 01:36:26.245
<v Speaker 0>think it may wait

01:36:26.645 --> 01:36:29.125
<v Speaker 0>is because in our control plan configuration, we

01:36:29.125 --> 01:36:31.045
<v Speaker 0>we actually do have replicas of three.

01:36:35.330 --> 01:36:37.570
<v Speaker 0>And our cluster is not currently healthy.

01:36:40.210 --> 01:36:42.290
<v Speaker 0>I really I actually don't expect it to

01:36:42.290 --> 01:36:43.810
<v Speaker 0>try and spin up a or do an

01:36:43.810 --> 01:36:45.730
<v Speaker 0>upgrade of our control plane yet.

01:36:46.210 --> 01:36:47.890
<v Speaker 0>Maybe we should just get

01:36:48.585 --> 01:36:50.825
<v Speaker 0>let's get this healthy first. So

01:36:51.065 --> 01:36:54.265
<v Speaker 0>there's a command with a cluster thing from

01:36:54.265 --> 01:36:56.185
<v Speaker 0>quick start that gives us a cube config

01:36:56.185 --> 01:36:57.305
<v Speaker 0>for the cluster.

01:36:58.105 --> 01:36:59.785
<v Speaker 0>We need to do that just now.

01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:04.739
<v Speaker 0>And then

01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:12.340
<v Speaker 0>copy.

01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:14.340
<v Speaker 0>Final star.

01:37:19.704 --> 01:37:21.464
<v Speaker 0>What's our cost of gold?

01:37:23.065 --> 01:37:23.465
<v Speaker 1>Here.

01:37:36.610 --> 01:37:37.650
<v Speaker 0>Copy panel start.

01:37:50.045 --> 01:37:51.084
<v Speaker 0>Secrets.

01:37:52.364 --> 01:37:53.644
<v Speaker 0>I'll keep config.

01:37:53.645 --> 01:37:54.124
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

01:37:55.804 --> 01:37:57.645
<v Speaker 0>Right. Okay. So now I can do a

01:37:57.645 --> 01:37:59.085
<v Speaker 0>cube config

01:37:59.085 --> 01:38:01.565
<v Speaker 0>equals

01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:01.239
<v Speaker 0>copy.

01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:05.480
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Cube config get notes.

01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:09.080
<v Speaker 0>See, our customer is not actually healthy. Yeah.

01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:11.160
<v Speaker 0>We haven't deployed the c n I implementation.

01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:13.080
<v Speaker 0>So we can just use the example one

01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:14.360
<v Speaker 0>here to deploy Calico.

01:38:24.615 --> 01:38:26.775
<v Speaker 0>And if we watch that, we actually should

01:38:26.775 --> 01:38:29.050
<v Speaker 0>see if the calico pods come up on

01:38:29.050 --> 01:38:31.210
<v Speaker 0>each of those machines and the yeah. We're

01:38:31.210 --> 01:38:32.570
<v Speaker 0>already starting to turn to ready.

01:38:41.395 --> 01:38:42.755
<v Speaker 0>But actually important,

01:38:43.475 --> 01:38:46.434
<v Speaker 0>the control plan turn in ready particularly

01:38:46.835 --> 01:38:49.715
<v Speaker 0>now means that the management cluster or local

01:38:50.675 --> 01:38:52.275
<v Speaker 0>cluster API cluster

01:38:53.395 --> 01:38:55.074
<v Speaker 0>will see that and then start to spin

01:38:55.074 --> 01:38:57.690
<v Speaker 0>up the other two control plane notes.

01:38:58.410 --> 01:38:59.930
<v Speaker 0>And now we're gonna be in this really

01:38:59.930 --> 01:39:04.090
<v Speaker 0>weird situation where I've already modified the QBDM

01:39:08.250 --> 01:39:10.170
<v Speaker 0>config template for the control notes.

01:39:12.594 --> 01:39:15.715
<v Speaker 0>So, I mean, as we see a new

01:39:15.715 --> 01:39:17.235
<v Speaker 0>control plan note

01:39:17.635 --> 01:39:19.074
<v Speaker 0>showing up here,

01:39:19.715 --> 01:39:21.474
<v Speaker 0>probably gonna deploy one nineteen.

01:39:25.740 --> 01:39:27.020
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. There we go.

01:39:29.020 --> 01:39:31.580
<v Speaker 0>So I wonder if I sabotage myself already.

01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:33.260
<v Speaker 0>Well, I'm not sabotage myself, to be honest.

01:39:33.260 --> 01:39:34.780
<v Speaker 0>The control plane, one of them being upgraded

01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:35.980
<v Speaker 0>is actually fine.

01:39:38.475 --> 01:39:40.315
<v Speaker 0>I see one way to do an upgrade,

01:39:40.315 --> 01:39:42.155
<v Speaker 0>but probably not the prescribed way to do

01:39:42.155 --> 01:39:42.955
<v Speaker 0>an upgrade.

01:39:43.675 --> 01:39:44.475
<v Speaker 0>Oops.

01:39:45.035 --> 01:39:46.555
<v Speaker 0>Bear with me on calendar. Did I have

01:39:46.555 --> 01:39:47.435
<v Speaker 0>any more meetings today?

01:39:51.130 --> 01:39:53.930
<v Speaker 0>Nothing more important than this. We get right.

01:39:57.930 --> 01:39:58.650
<v Speaker 0>So

01:39:58.890 --> 01:39:59.770
<v Speaker 0>let's

01:40:02.650 --> 01:40:04.170
<v Speaker 0>put you

01:40:12.625 --> 01:40:14.705
<v Speaker 0>I won't be ready yet. Hopefully, it won't

01:40:14.705 --> 01:40:15.264
<v Speaker 0>be too long.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:36.640
<v Speaker 1>So

01:40:32.705 --> 01:40:34.945
<v Speaker 1>that means the next two control planes

01:40:37.185 --> 01:40:39.264
<v Speaker 0>yeah. I'm gonna spin up the one nineteen.

01:40:42.945 --> 01:40:43.985
<v Speaker 0>And I wonder

01:40:46.860 --> 01:40:50.300
<v Speaker 0>because we have the reconciliation

01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:52.300
<v Speaker 0>loop with the management cluster keeping an eye

01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:53.580
<v Speaker 0>on our control plan.

01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:55.260
<v Speaker 0>Once the other two are up,

01:40:56.140 --> 01:40:57.260
<v Speaker 1>I can probably

01:40:59.055 --> 01:41:00.575
<v Speaker 0>I I don't know if I can just

01:41:00.575 --> 01:41:01.935
<v Speaker 0>tell that machine

01:41:02.735 --> 01:41:04.974
<v Speaker 0>and it'll be replaced. I'm curious.

01:41:05.695 --> 01:41:06.735
<v Speaker 0>I mean,

01:41:08.255 --> 01:41:09.295
<v Speaker 0>I'm good in my head.

01:41:14.450 --> 01:41:16.369
<v Speaker 0>Not sure if that's what actually happens.

01:41:17.570 --> 01:41:19.330
<v Speaker 0>Because if we take a look at the

01:41:19.330 --> 01:41:21.650
<v Speaker 0>cluster API resources,

01:41:22.770 --> 01:41:24.610
<v Speaker 0>what we actually get are

01:41:25.585 --> 01:41:26.544
<v Speaker 0>machines.

01:41:28.704 --> 01:41:32.625
<v Speaker 0>How curious that if I destroy this, if

01:41:32.625 --> 01:41:34.144
<v Speaker 0>it spins up a new one,

01:41:34.465 --> 01:41:35.985
<v Speaker 0>which should be really nice in this case,

01:41:39.870 --> 01:41:41.870
<v Speaker 0>Thank you. I keep meaning to

01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:44.910
<v Speaker 0>mute myself when I cough, but sometimes I

01:41:44.910 --> 01:41:46.510
<v Speaker 0>forget. Appreciate it.

01:41:48.670 --> 01:41:50.670
<v Speaker 0>It would be quite nice. So what I'm

01:41:50.670 --> 01:41:52.510
<v Speaker 0>thinking of now, rather sort of rather than

01:41:52.510 --> 01:41:53.390
<v Speaker 0>there being an

01:41:54.755 --> 01:41:57.395
<v Speaker 0>you know, like a prescribed cluster control, upgrade

01:41:57.395 --> 01:41:59.955
<v Speaker 0>this cluster command that redeploys

01:41:59.955 --> 01:42:01.555
<v Speaker 0>a new control plane and swap them over

01:42:01.555 --> 01:42:03.955
<v Speaker 0>or something like that. So it may

01:42:04.435 --> 01:42:06.980
<v Speaker 0>be as simple as just upgrading the control

01:42:06.980 --> 01:42:08.820
<v Speaker 0>plane template, which we did, apply it to

01:42:08.820 --> 01:42:10.739
<v Speaker 0>the cluster, and then kill the machines one

01:42:10.739 --> 01:42:12.739
<v Speaker 0>by one and wait until they come back

01:42:12.739 --> 01:42:14.580
<v Speaker 0>up. Right? I mean, that's that's how I

01:42:14.580 --> 01:42:16.420
<v Speaker 0>would do an upgrade if it was not

01:42:16.420 --> 01:42:19.780
<v Speaker 0>using cluster control using the cluster API.

01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:22.179
<v Speaker 0>And I'm hoping that workflow actually just works.

01:42:24.085 --> 01:42:26.565
<v Speaker 0>What we wanna confirm now is that

01:42:31.205 --> 01:42:33.205
<v Speaker 0>it's still running. I'm sure it's not gonna

01:42:33.205 --> 01:42:35.285
<v Speaker 0>fail anymore. And I'm assuming you don't actually

01:42:35.285 --> 01:42:36.885
<v Speaker 0>hear the beep, so I'm just gonna go

01:42:36.885 --> 01:42:37.045
<v Speaker 0>to.

01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:39.830
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So keep it keep it up. One

01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:42.070
<v Speaker 0>nineteen to okay. So that's pretty cool. I

01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:42.949
<v Speaker 0>like that, actually.

01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:48.070
<v Speaker 0>So

01:42:48.390 --> 01:42:49.350
<v Speaker 0>that means

01:42:52.155 --> 01:42:54.235
<v Speaker 0>watch this. Let's wait for that second control

01:42:54.235 --> 01:42:55.594
<v Speaker 0>plane mode to become

01:42:56.715 --> 01:42:57.594
<v Speaker 0>ready.

01:43:00.635 --> 01:43:01.994
<v Speaker 0>There we go. Almost there.

01:43:14.210 --> 01:43:16.290
<v Speaker 0>And then those that it's a control plan

01:43:16.290 --> 01:43:17.810
<v Speaker 0>with the master role.

01:43:22.885 --> 01:43:24.165
<v Speaker 0>Ready yet.

01:43:25.525 --> 01:43:27.045
<v Speaker 0>And now I'm gonna lose access to the

01:43:27.045 --> 01:43:28.085
<v Speaker 0>API server

01:43:28.165 --> 01:43:30.405
<v Speaker 0>because there is an election happening between the

01:43:30.405 --> 01:43:32.405
<v Speaker 0>two nodes. The first one will take a

01:43:32.405 --> 01:43:32.965
<v Speaker 0>little while.

01:43:37.610 --> 01:43:38.570
<v Speaker 0>It will

01:43:38.810 --> 01:43:40.170
<v Speaker 0>fall over shortly.

01:43:40.810 --> 01:43:42.170
<v Speaker 0>I'm not I'm not sure why I have

01:43:42.170 --> 01:43:43.610
<v Speaker 0>noticed this a few times now when the

01:43:43.610 --> 01:43:45.610
<v Speaker 0>second control plane notice comes on, I I

01:43:45.610 --> 01:43:46.650
<v Speaker 0>lose access.

01:43:50.890 --> 01:43:52.764
<v Speaker 0>And I think we're just passing around an

01:43:52.764 --> 01:43:53.965
<v Speaker 0>elastic IP

01:43:54.125 --> 01:43:55.804
<v Speaker 0>that hasn't really settled yet.

01:44:10.990 --> 01:44:12.430
<v Speaker 0>Let's see if we got a third one

01:44:12.430 --> 01:44:12.910
<v Speaker 0>on the way.

01:44:21.575 --> 01:44:23.175
<v Speaker 0>So this is two.

01:44:23.575 --> 01:44:25.895
<v Speaker 0>Oh, okay. Almost there. So when it starts

01:44:25.895 --> 01:44:27.575
<v Speaker 0>getting refused, it's not time and out. It

01:44:27.575 --> 01:44:29.095
<v Speaker 0>means the IP has been allocated.

01:44:30.135 --> 01:44:32.375
<v Speaker 0>We're just waiting for the API server to

01:44:32.375 --> 01:44:33.895
<v Speaker 0>start saying hello to me.

01:44:37.730 --> 01:44:39.249
<v Speaker 0>Maybe. There we go.

01:44:40.050 --> 01:44:40.849
<v Speaker 0>Sweet.

01:44:42.449 --> 01:44:43.809
<v Speaker 0>That is

01:44:44.449 --> 01:44:45.090
<v Speaker 0>cool.

01:44:46.610 --> 01:44:49.085
<v Speaker 0>Now how brave do I feel? There should

01:44:49.085 --> 01:44:51.485
<v Speaker 0>be a third one now. They're both ready.

01:44:51.485 --> 01:44:53.005
<v Speaker 0>The controller is gonna try and get me

01:44:53.005 --> 01:44:54.205
<v Speaker 0>a third one up.

01:44:54.605 --> 01:44:56.285
<v Speaker 0>And then we'll see how brave I'm feeling

01:44:56.285 --> 01:44:57.405
<v Speaker 0>about breaking this loop.

01:45:04.810 --> 01:45:06.969
<v Speaker 0>I could wait for the third one to

01:45:06.969 --> 01:45:09.289
<v Speaker 0>at least start provisioning before I get

01:45:12.330 --> 01:45:13.449
<v Speaker 0>gotta hammer it.

01:45:24.105 --> 01:45:25.144
<v Speaker 0>Too impatient.

01:45:25.145 --> 01:45:26.584
<v Speaker 0>I'm just gonna delete it.

01:45:27.705 --> 01:45:30.120
<v Speaker 0>So I wanna delete this one, the one

01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:31.880
<v Speaker 0>eighteen one to see if it gets replaced

01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:32.360
<v Speaker 0>or not.

01:45:43.365 --> 01:45:44.645
<v Speaker 0>Too late to go back now.

01:46:03.110 --> 01:46:04.630
<v Speaker 0>I'm pretty sure this is the one we

01:46:04.630 --> 01:46:05.030
<v Speaker 0>deleted.

01:46:11.525 --> 01:46:14.005
<v Speaker 0>We'll wait for that delete to if that's

01:46:14.005 --> 01:46:15.204
<v Speaker 0>the new one there.

01:46:22.804 --> 01:46:25.364
<v Speaker 0>This livestream should just be called. What happens

01:46:25.364 --> 01:46:27.685
<v Speaker 0>is

01:46:26.540 --> 01:46:28.699
<v Speaker 0>I do things I'm not supposed to do.

01:46:33.900 --> 01:46:36.059
<v Speaker 0>Alright. That's definitely deleted there.

01:46:36.219 --> 01:46:38.140
<v Speaker 0>What does cluster API think of the world?

01:46:43.515 --> 01:46:43.915
<v Speaker 0>Really?

01:46:56.010 --> 01:46:56.730
<v Speaker 0>No.

01:46:59.930 --> 01:47:01.130
<v Speaker 0>So the the

01:47:03.370 --> 01:47:04.410
<v Speaker 1>hasn't

01:47:05.770 --> 01:47:07.770
<v Speaker 1>kick started anything

01:47:08.945 --> 01:47:09.905
<v Speaker 0>Ever

01:47:13.425 --> 01:47:14.704
<v Speaker 0>I mean, it remains

01:47:17.744 --> 01:47:19.264
<v Speaker 0>we are in a

01:47:19.824 --> 01:47:21.985
<v Speaker 0>a rather variable state right now with that

01:47:21.985 --> 01:47:23.985
<v Speaker 0>third control plan non being provisioned.

01:47:25.050 --> 01:47:26.330
<v Speaker 0>It could be

01:47:26.810 --> 01:47:28.650
<v Speaker 0>once that becomes ready,

01:47:29.210 --> 01:47:31.610
<v Speaker 0>it will pay attention to the missing node

01:47:31.610 --> 01:47:33.690
<v Speaker 0>and start to replace it. I would have

01:47:33.690 --> 01:47:35.690
<v Speaker 0>expected the phase to at least change now.

01:47:35.690 --> 01:47:36.010
<v Speaker 0>Although,

01:47:37.265 --> 01:47:39.185
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure what API calls this provider

01:47:39.185 --> 01:47:41.585
<v Speaker 0>is doing behind the scene. If it's just

01:47:43.665 --> 01:47:45.665
<v Speaker 0>if it checks that it exists

01:47:46.145 --> 01:47:46.945
<v Speaker 0>anymore.

01:47:48.625 --> 01:47:50.785
<v Speaker 0>Mean, we could probably look at the code.

01:47:51.650 --> 01:47:53.329
<v Speaker 0>Maybe better if I had someone that knew

01:47:53.329 --> 01:47:55.650
<v Speaker 0>more about it rather than me flailing around

01:47:55.650 --> 01:47:56.289
<v Speaker 0>it.

01:47:57.650 --> 01:47:58.690
<v Speaker 0>So I'm just gonna delete it.

01:48:10.445 --> 01:48:11.245
<v Speaker 0>See what happens.

01:48:22.710 --> 01:48:24.950
<v Speaker 0>Well, I wonder if I should delete that

01:48:24.950 --> 01:48:26.550
<v Speaker 0>instead, or was it too late?

01:48:33.205 --> 01:48:35.525
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. To the so what I was thinking

01:48:35.525 --> 01:48:38.005
<v Speaker 0>there was rather than deleting the machine, actually

01:48:38.005 --> 01:48:40.485
<v Speaker 0>delete the concrete packet machine.

01:48:40.965 --> 01:48:42.405
<v Speaker 0>Leave that machine intact.

01:48:45.150 --> 01:48:46.750
<v Speaker 0>Because I was curious to see if the

01:48:46.750 --> 01:48:49.230
<v Speaker 0>user data is baked into this somehow,

01:48:50.030 --> 01:48:52.030
<v Speaker 0>and it would have deployed the same version.

01:48:52.990 --> 01:48:54.830
<v Speaker 0>That would give us a slightly different upgrade

01:48:54.830 --> 01:48:56.190
<v Speaker 0>path moving forward.

01:49:02.045 --> 01:49:03.485
<v Speaker 0>Well, this has got the name in it,

01:49:03.485 --> 01:49:04.445
<v Speaker 0>and I don't need to type.

01:49:13.020 --> 01:49:15.020
<v Speaker 0>Doesn't appear really to have, like, the user

01:49:15.020 --> 01:49:16.380
<v Speaker 0>data or anything there.

01:49:22.860 --> 01:49:24.940
<v Speaker 0>And it's trying to drain the node.

01:49:26.445 --> 01:49:29.405
<v Speaker 0>Obviously, not gonna work. It killed it.

01:49:31.645 --> 01:49:33.485
<v Speaker 0>Let's just create this. I wonder if it

01:49:33.645 --> 01:49:35.645
<v Speaker 0>does it notice that that machine disappeared?

01:49:39.100 --> 01:49:39.739
<v Speaker 0>No.

01:49:40.700 --> 01:49:43.179
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't appear that the packet provider

01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:45.739
<v Speaker 0>monitors the health of the machine.

01:49:50.060 --> 01:49:51.820
<v Speaker 0>I can speak to Jason about that and

01:49:51.820 --> 01:49:53.820
<v Speaker 0>see if I can get a better understanding

01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:56.355
<v Speaker 0>of what what happens at that stage.

01:50:01.875 --> 01:50:03.554
<v Speaker 0>And it's still deleting.

01:50:05.075 --> 01:50:07.475
<v Speaker 0>I'm not really sure what's happening at this

01:50:07.475 --> 01:50:07.875
<v Speaker 0>layer.

01:50:15.370 --> 01:50:18.329
<v Speaker 0>We maybe have a second control play note.

01:50:21.290 --> 01:50:23.130
<v Speaker 0>It may be doing the

01:50:24.170 --> 01:50:25.130
<v Speaker 0>the h a dance.

01:50:31.955 --> 01:50:33.795
<v Speaker 0>Really, if it's not working, say the watch,

01:50:33.795 --> 01:50:34.275
<v Speaker 0>of course.

01:50:46.070 --> 01:50:47.349
<v Speaker 0>And there's a very

01:50:47.829 --> 01:50:50.550
<v Speaker 0>good chance that I've just killed my control

01:50:50.550 --> 01:50:51.270
<v Speaker 0>plane anyway.

01:50:53.155 --> 01:50:55.795
<v Speaker 0>Very likely or it has potential.

01:51:06.100 --> 01:51:07.620
<v Speaker 0>I guess this is a good example of

01:51:07.620 --> 01:51:09.380
<v Speaker 0>how not to upgrade a cluster.

01:51:14.260 --> 01:51:16.820
<v Speaker 0>I would like to think that IP

01:51:17.060 --> 01:51:19.460
<v Speaker 0>came back, though. That wasn't IP of the

01:51:19.460 --> 01:51:20.340
<v Speaker 0>machine, was it?

01:51:22.185 --> 01:51:23.224
<v Speaker 0>Possibly.

01:51:25.145 --> 01:51:27.304
<v Speaker 0>Must be an Elastic IP. Right?

01:51:33.545 --> 01:51:34.105
<v Speaker 0>Must be.

01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:43.499
<v Speaker 0>What is that? 14710226.

01:51:45.020 --> 01:51:46.540
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's an elastic IP.

01:51:53.295 --> 01:51:55.935
<v Speaker 0>To control plane, no. It's

01:52:20.905 --> 01:52:22.745
<v Speaker 0>Alright. What can I do now?

01:52:23.385 --> 01:52:24.745
<v Speaker 0>Jump on both of these.

01:52:25.305 --> 01:52:26.585
<v Speaker 0>See if my

01:52:26.905 --> 01:52:28.905
<v Speaker 0>IP appears to be available.

01:52:36.500 --> 01:52:38.020
<v Speaker 0>Uh-huh. And this one.

01:52:52.255 --> 01:52:53.055
<v Speaker 0>Nope.

01:52:59.055 --> 01:53:02.095
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. My elastic IP hasn't oh, no. It

01:53:02.095 --> 01:53:02.975
<v Speaker 0>has. There we go.

01:53:04.270 --> 01:53:06.030
<v Speaker 0>We do have a control plan node with

01:53:06.030 --> 01:53:06.590
<v Speaker 0>the IP.

01:53:20.565 --> 01:53:22.485
<v Speaker 0>We're try to start it four more times.

01:53:36.430 --> 01:53:37.390
<v Speaker 0>Mine.

01:53:38.190 --> 01:53:38.830
<v Speaker 0>It

01:53:45.870 --> 01:53:47.550
<v Speaker 0>was attached to this machine. Right?

01:53:48.724 --> 01:53:49.684
<v Speaker 0>It began.

01:53:52.405 --> 01:53:53.124
<v Speaker 1>Nope.

01:53:55.125 --> 01:53:57.364
<v Speaker 0>Alright. You should be at local host.

01:53:59.925 --> 01:54:00.645
<v Speaker 0>It is.

01:54:14.710 --> 01:54:16.710
<v Speaker 0>And we do have a Qubelet running.

01:54:25.785 --> 01:54:26.824
<v Speaker 0>Maybe not for long.

01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:41.560
<v Speaker 0>Back in a moment.

01:55:20.660 --> 01:55:21.700
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

01:55:22.020 --> 01:55:23.460
<v Speaker 0>Someone at my door.

01:55:24.580 --> 01:55:27.220
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we have a cubelet running. The

01:55:27.220 --> 01:55:29.220
<v Speaker 0>IP address is attached. It's been running for

01:55:29.220 --> 01:55:29.940
<v Speaker 0>twenty minutes.

01:55:33.315 --> 01:55:35.555
<v Speaker 0>But it's just it's it's broken. It's not

01:55:35.555 --> 01:55:36.035
<v Speaker 0>coming back.

01:55:44.770 --> 01:55:46.530
<v Speaker 0>It's done at the leading phase with the

01:55:46.530 --> 01:55:48.610
<v Speaker 0>first control plan. It's oh, it still says

01:55:48.610 --> 01:55:50.289
<v Speaker 0>the provisioning, the other one.

01:55:54.130 --> 01:55:56.369
<v Speaker 0>And maybe I'm just being too impatient, but

01:55:56.369 --> 01:55:57.170
<v Speaker 0>I don't

01:56:00.034 --> 01:56:01.554
<v Speaker 0>I don't think I am.

01:56:08.114 --> 01:56:09.155
<v Speaker 0>It's weird.

01:56:10.755 --> 01:56:12.434
<v Speaker 0>I keep switching between

01:56:12.515 --> 01:56:13.235
<v Speaker 0>time out,

01:56:13.890 --> 01:56:15.570
<v Speaker 0>connection refused.

01:56:15.890 --> 01:56:17.570
<v Speaker 0>It tells me that the IP address is

01:56:17.570 --> 01:56:18.370
<v Speaker 0>bouncing around.

01:56:27.945 --> 01:56:29.945
<v Speaker 0>Never again refused again.

01:56:31.145 --> 01:56:32.185
<v Speaker 0>API.

01:56:33.225 --> 01:56:34.745
<v Speaker 0>It's also provisioning.

01:56:35.545 --> 01:56:35.945
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:53.510
<v Speaker 0>I'm just not sure it's salvageable.

01:56:59.594 --> 01:57:00.635
<v Speaker 0>I knew

01:57:01.355 --> 01:57:03.354
<v Speaker 0>upgrading the cluster.

01:57:04.635 --> 01:57:06.395
<v Speaker 0>But so waiting for it to even really

01:57:06.395 --> 01:57:09.114
<v Speaker 0>get into a itchy healthy state was probably

01:57:09.114 --> 01:57:09.835
<v Speaker 0>a bad idea.

01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:12.440
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna just kill all this.

01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:18.200
<v Speaker 0>And we're approaching two hours anyway, I think.

01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:23.240
<v Speaker 0>Return to this next week.

01:57:25.305 --> 01:57:26.985
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. I'm empty just to save with

01:57:26.985 --> 01:57:27.225
<v Speaker 0>it.

01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:42.999
<v Speaker 0>Right. That connection refused shouldn't happen.

01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:45.880
<v Speaker 0>Speaking to the kubelet on this local host.

01:57:48.520 --> 01:57:50.119
<v Speaker 1>Let me restart this kubelet.

01:58:00.894 --> 01:58:02.815
<v Speaker 0>Might I get connection refused?

01:58:19.990 --> 01:58:21.990
<v Speaker 0>I think it only binds on the IP.

01:58:28.574 --> 01:58:29.935
<v Speaker 0>Try it from here then.

01:58:36.699 --> 01:58:37.820
<v Speaker 0>Logs.

01:58:45.099 --> 01:58:45.739
<v Speaker 0>Oh, well.

01:58:50.275 --> 01:58:51.075
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's failing.

01:59:02.670 --> 01:59:04.510
<v Speaker 0>I want to find the other notes.

01:59:10.110 --> 01:59:12.430
<v Speaker 0>Some sort of weird direction thing happening here

01:59:12.430 --> 01:59:13.150
<v Speaker 0>in the loop.

01:59:15.445 --> 01:59:17.284
<v Speaker 0>Filter should have known least.

01:59:17.765 --> 01:59:18.965
<v Speaker 0>Shit.

01:59:24.565 --> 01:59:24.965
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:59:29.070 --> 01:59:30.749
<v Speaker 0>Definitely broken it.

01:59:35.310 --> 01:59:37.230
<v Speaker 0>I mean, it should fix itself.

01:59:43.775 --> 01:59:46.015
<v Speaker 0>I don't really know how the leases are

01:59:46.015 --> 01:59:47.215
<v Speaker 0>being managed.

01:59:52.335 --> 01:59:52.735
<v Speaker 0>Like

01:59:53.695 --> 01:59:56.575
<v Speaker 0>no. I think that the problem is probably

01:59:58.369 --> 02:00:00.290
<v Speaker 0>was just too quick to call the other

02:00:00.290 --> 02:00:02.369
<v Speaker 0>machine. Although we don't have two control play

02:00:02.369 --> 02:00:03.489
<v Speaker 0>notes that are healthy.

02:00:03.889 --> 02:00:07.489
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming SCD hadn't completed

02:00:08.050 --> 02:00:09.969
<v Speaker 0>copy of the data to the other version.

02:00:11.735 --> 02:00:12.534
<v Speaker 0>And

02:00:12.615 --> 02:00:15.415
<v Speaker 0>I have now lost that CD. And if

02:00:15.415 --> 02:00:16.614
<v Speaker 0>you lose that CD,

02:00:17.575 --> 02:00:19.895
<v Speaker 0>there's probably not any chance we bring them

02:00:19.895 --> 02:00:20.695
<v Speaker 0>back to this cluster.

02:00:29.250 --> 02:00:31.250
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's just not gonna happen.

02:00:33.890 --> 02:00:35.730
<v Speaker 0>Maybe an entity on this.

02:00:37.969 --> 02:00:39.250
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I'm calling it.

02:00:41.725 --> 02:00:43.965
<v Speaker 0>Hey. Let's open Docker.

02:00:45.965 --> 02:00:47.165
<v Speaker 0>Try the world.

02:00:54.525 --> 02:00:55.565
<v Speaker 0>It's the provision.

02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:10.679
<v Speaker 0>Alright. That's unfortunate.

02:01:13.545 --> 02:01:15.385
<v Speaker 0>Next week, I will spend up a $1.18

02:01:15.385 --> 02:01:17.144
<v Speaker 0>2 cluster, which I know works.

02:01:17.545 --> 02:01:20.425
<v Speaker 0>I will probably spend it up with a

02:01:20.425 --> 02:01:22.104
<v Speaker 0>single control plane mode

02:01:22.744 --> 02:01:24.664
<v Speaker 0>and do an upgrade of that first,

02:01:24.985 --> 02:01:26.585
<v Speaker 0>then tackle the h a one.

02:01:27.090 --> 02:01:28.850
<v Speaker 0>And but I'll always spend that up in

02:01:28.850 --> 02:01:30.290
<v Speaker 0>advance so that we don't have to sit

02:01:30.290 --> 02:01:31.650
<v Speaker 0>here and listen to me ramble on to

02:01:31.650 --> 02:01:32.930
<v Speaker 0>myself while we wait for that to get

02:01:32.930 --> 02:01:35.090
<v Speaker 0>healthy, get impatient, and destroy the entire cluster

02:01:35.090 --> 02:01:35.730
<v Speaker 0>again.

02:01:36.610 --> 02:01:39.090
<v Speaker 0>And we'll go through the various upgrade paths

02:01:39.090 --> 02:01:39.810
<v Speaker 0>as well,

02:01:40.210 --> 02:01:40.850
<v Speaker 0>and

02:01:41.925 --> 02:01:43.364
<v Speaker 0>it'll be much better.

02:01:44.005 --> 02:01:45.764
<v Speaker 0>Thanks for watching.

02:01:46.165 --> 02:01:47.525
<v Speaker 0>Have a great weekend.

02:01:47.685 --> 02:01:48.645
<v Speaker 0>I'll see you all soon.
