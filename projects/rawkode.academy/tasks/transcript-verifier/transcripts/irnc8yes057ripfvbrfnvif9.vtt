00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.599
<v Speaker 0>I can tell you that your colleagues have

00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:04.000
<v Speaker 0>left you some Falco workloads on the cluster.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.240
<v Speaker 1>So we have file side QI?

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.480
<v Speaker 0>Yep. If you wanna access the Falco side

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.800
<v Speaker 0>QI, I'm happy to open it in a

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.320
<v Speaker 0>terminal browser on the site just so the

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.155
<v Speaker 0>audience can follow along. I mean, right now,

00:00:14.155 --> 00:00:16.315
<v Speaker 0>doesn't the kind of thing's broken. So yeah.

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:19.515
<v Speaker 1>So

00:00:22.795 --> 00:00:23.595
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:00:23.915 --> 00:00:25.994
<v Speaker 2>To connect to the database. To connect to

00:00:25.994 --> 00:00:27.595
<v Speaker 1>database. Password notification. That

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.520
<v Speaker 3>there's also an image here in the page.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.640
<v Speaker 3>You can can we open it with the

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.400
<v Speaker 3>browser? Where is the chat?

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.880
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.920
<v Speaker 3>Looks looks like we're looks like we're upset.

00:00:42.995 --> 00:00:44.595
<v Speaker 3>Should we go take a look what the

00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:46.035
<v Speaker 3>sidekick is

00:00:46.595 --> 00:00:48.755
<v Speaker 3>telling us? If if tell if we get

00:00:48.755 --> 00:00:49.635
<v Speaker 3>any hint

00:00:49.875 --> 00:00:53.555
<v Speaker 3>from Yeah. Maybe any any fault code,

00:00:53.875 --> 00:00:55.635
<v Speaker 3>of all. Maybe it's captured something.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.970
<v Speaker 1>We are an an exec into a board.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.370
<v Speaker 1>The DB program was spawned,

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.130
<v Speaker 1>and Bash history was deleted.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.530
<v Speaker 0>A naughty person has been on one of

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.090
<v Speaker 0>these pods, I think. Schedule cron jobs.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.409
<v Speaker 3>Keep scrolling.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.930
<v Speaker 3>Three times.

00:01:14.145 --> 00:01:15.905
<v Speaker 3>Delete or in a mystery.

00:01:16.784 --> 00:01:17.665
<v Speaker 3>Attach

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:20.945
<v Speaker 3>or exec import. Definitely, somebody has gone

00:01:21.744 --> 00:01:23.265
<v Speaker 3>into one of these pod. Which one is

00:01:23.265 --> 00:01:25.424
<v Speaker 3>it? Yeah. And there is a an alternate

00:01:25.424 --> 00:01:26.305
<v Speaker 4>user

00:01:26.305 --> 00:01:27.185
<v Speaker 4>in the database.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.790
<v Speaker 3>Mhmm.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.150
<v Speaker 3>It's Postgres. Right? There's also the password in

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.590
<v Speaker 2>the altar command.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.390
<v Speaker 3>It's like So Mhmm. Not today. So the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.910
<v Speaker 3>so somebody

00:01:40.245 --> 00:01:41.365
<v Speaker 3>somebody

00:01:41.365 --> 00:01:42.725
<v Speaker 3>went

00:01:43.365 --> 00:01:45.605
<v Speaker 3>somebody somebody went into the Postgres

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:47.925
<v Speaker 3>pod and manually changed the password. Is that

00:01:47.925 --> 00:01:50.165
<v Speaker 3>what they is that that what they did?

00:01:50.165 --> 00:01:53.045
<v Speaker 0>It's very cool that Falco gives you visibility

00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:53.765
<v Speaker 0>into

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.189
<v Speaker 0>these arbitrary random

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.909
<v Speaker 0>commands within a pod. That's pretty sweet.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.630
<v Speaker 0>Here we go. Here, the Postgres pod is

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.310
<v Speaker 0>running engine x latest.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.909
<v Speaker 4>Oh,

00:02:06.765 --> 00:02:10.205
<v Speaker 4>wrong image, but the Falco UI also said

00:02:10.205 --> 00:02:10.925
<v Speaker 4>something.

00:02:12.845 --> 00:02:16.045
<v Speaker 4>Containers image, Postgres one three Alpine.

00:02:16.045 --> 00:02:18.205
<v Speaker 1>So we have a meeting in webhook somewhere.

00:02:19.485 --> 00:02:21.325
<v Speaker 0>Those are nasty. I would maybe get rid

00:02:21.325 --> 00:02:23.730
<v Speaker 0>of that. I mean, your falco UI here

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.690
<v Speaker 0>shows you that the web hook, QDNS,

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.810
<v Speaker 0>is modifying

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.450
<v Speaker 0>all all container images to be engine x

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.450
<v Speaker 0>latest. So I did it. I did it.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.050
<v Speaker 1>I can delete, man, right now.

00:02:35.205 --> 00:02:37.445
<v Speaker 3>That's no kit. Yeah. Music and webhooks are

00:02:37.445 --> 00:02:39.365
<v Speaker 0>are pretty opaque. You don't know what they

00:02:39.365 --> 00:02:41.365
<v Speaker 0>do. You just know the permissions they have.

00:02:41.525 --> 00:02:42.565
<v Speaker 1>So we

00:02:43.205 --> 00:02:44.965
<v Speaker 0>we do have v one. So, currently, our

00:02:44.965 --> 00:02:46.085
<v Speaker 0>application is working.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:48.890
<v Speaker 3>Oh, look at that.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.209
<v Speaker 0>So now you have to upgrade it to

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.010
<v Speaker 0>v two.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.810
<v Speaker 3>Just do a sysdig with the

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.010
<v Speaker 3>event dot type equal exec v,

00:02:59.635 --> 00:03:01.315
<v Speaker 3>and we're seeing and and we can see

00:03:01.315 --> 00:03:02.595
<v Speaker 3>the executions

00:03:02.595 --> 00:03:03.715
<v Speaker 3>in the cluster.

00:03:04.755 --> 00:03:05.555
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:03:05.955 --> 00:03:06.595
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:03:08.915 --> 00:03:09.955
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Exactly.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 3>There's some kind of hidden

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.940
<v Speaker 3>process probably somewhere.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:18.380
<v Speaker 3>Here,

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.900
<v Speaker 3>there's a process

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.820
<v Speaker 2>There's a process code, definitely not.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.980
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That looks like question. Yeah.

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:27.340
<v Speaker 3>Why do you say it?

00:03:28.314 --> 00:03:28.955
<v Speaker 3>Or

00:03:29.594 --> 00:03:31.834
<v Speaker 3>now that we need What is definitely not?

00:03:31.834 --> 00:03:34.315
<v Speaker 4>What is definitely not? What is that?

00:03:35.355 --> 00:03:37.995
<v Speaker 0>It used to be running date and sleep,

00:03:38.075 --> 00:03:38.555
<v Speaker 0>and

00:03:38.954 --> 00:03:40.875
<v Speaker 0>those are interesting. What if we just kill

00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:43.114
<v Speaker 3>that process? We have the paid from

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.500
<v Speaker 3>Sysdig. Right? Try try just to do a

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.660
<v Speaker 3>Sysdig filter with the definitely,

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.140
<v Speaker 3>prog name prog prod dot name

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.100
<v Speaker 3>contains

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:55.019
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.

00:03:55.725 --> 00:03:56.605
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.

00:03:58.285 --> 00:03:59.165
<v Speaker 3>Maybe

00:03:59.565 --> 00:04:00.445
<v Speaker 3>let's try.

00:04:01.325 --> 00:04:03.165
<v Speaker 3>But, again, I don't know when the damn

00:04:03.165 --> 00:04:05.005
<v Speaker 3>thing starts, but let's try.

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:08.525
<v Speaker 3>And before the filter, do the HP

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.180
<v Speaker 3>proc dot p name.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.780
<v Speaker 3>Can you scroll up in

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.900
<v Speaker 2>the meantime?

00:04:25.785 --> 00:04:28.185
<v Speaker 2>Because there there is the that clone.

00:04:28.585 --> 00:04:30.985
<v Speaker 3>The clone should contain the parent too. Yeah.

00:04:30.985 --> 00:04:32.585
<v Speaker 3>P t system d.

00:04:32.985 --> 00:04:34.665
<v Speaker 4>It's system d. Arguments

00:04:34.825 --> 00:04:37.785
<v Speaker 4>the arguments is bar catch. Definitely not. So

00:04:37.785 --> 00:04:39.870
<v Speaker 3>this is run by system d? Just kill

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.550
<v Speaker 3>kill dash nine system d.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.990
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Kevin,

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.070
<v Speaker 0>that's a good way to do it. I

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.830
<v Speaker 1>killed the p I d one. Okay.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. Exactly.

00:04:51.905 --> 00:04:53.905
<v Speaker 3>Guys, have you have you seen the Falco

00:04:53.905 --> 00:04:55.345
<v Speaker 4>UI service there?

00:05:00.625 --> 00:05:01.745
<v Speaker 4>Do you see that?

00:05:04.065 --> 00:05:06.145
<v Speaker 4>I would like to check the service Falco

00:05:06.145 --> 00:05:08.500
<v Speaker 4>UI, System CTL cat

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.700
<v Speaker 4>Falco UI serve

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:11.860

<v Speaker 3>So this That looks nice. Lips forever,

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:38.690
<v Speaker 0>checks to see if the pod is

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.449
<v Speaker 0>old, and resets the password on Postgres. Good

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:43.169
<v Speaker 0>catch, Vicente.

00:05:45.693 --> 00:05:46.973
