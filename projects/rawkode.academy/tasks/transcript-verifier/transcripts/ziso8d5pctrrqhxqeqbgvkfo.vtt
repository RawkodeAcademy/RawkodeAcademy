00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.290
<v Speaker 0>Hello, and welcome back to the Rawkode Academy.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.970
<v Speaker 0>I'm your host, Rawkode.

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.290
<v Speaker 0>Today is the episode of Rawkode Live, the

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.130
<v Speaker 0>show where we take a look at cloud

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.250
<v Speaker 0>native Kubernetes

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 0>and fund development projects to help make your

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 0>lives a little bit easier.

00:03:02.425 --> 00:03:06.105
<v Speaker 0>And today, we're tackling source control security posture,

00:03:06.345 --> 00:03:07.465
<v Speaker 0>which is gonna be a whole lot of

00:03:07.465 --> 00:03:10.025
<v Speaker 0>fun. Of course, I am not smart enough

00:03:10.025 --> 00:03:11.705
<v Speaker 0>to get this conversation, but I am joined

00:03:11.705 --> 00:03:12.985
<v Speaker 0>by someone who is.

00:03:13.944 --> 00:03:16.665
<v Speaker 0>Hello. Barak from Scribes Security. How are you?

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm great. I'm actually very happy to join

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.770
<v Speaker 1>you for this episode.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.650
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Well, thank you for taking the time

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.450
<v Speaker 0>to join me and, you know, do some

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.730
<v Speaker 0>live experimentation

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.810
<v Speaker 0>with an open source project called the GitGat.

00:03:31.715 --> 00:03:33.795
<v Speaker 0>But before we talk about that, can you

00:03:33.795 --> 00:03:35.635
<v Speaker 0>tell our audience a little bit more about

00:03:35.635 --> 00:03:36.115
<v Speaker 0>you?

00:03:36.834 --> 00:03:38.675
<v Speaker 1>Well, of course. I mean, you know, I'm

00:03:38.675 --> 00:03:40.675
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not a I'm not just a

00:03:40.675 --> 00:03:41.555
<v Speaker 1>pretty face.

00:03:42.194 --> 00:03:43.955
<v Speaker 1>Like you said, my name is Rawkode.

00:03:44.194 --> 00:03:48.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm currently working as the developer advocate for

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.670
<v Speaker 1>Scribe Security, a company that deals with software

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.590
<v Speaker 1>supply chain security.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:53.710
<v Speaker 1>Other

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.750
<v Speaker 1>than that, I can say that before Scribe,

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.269
<v Speaker 1>I was a developer on and off for

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.510
<v Speaker 1>about ten years. I have a degree in

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.310
<v Speaker 1>art education,

00:04:01.965 --> 00:04:04.125
<v Speaker 1>a bit unusual in the field, I know.

00:04:04.765 --> 00:04:08.125
<v Speaker 1>And other than explaining complicated concepts clearly,

00:04:08.365 --> 00:04:09.725
<v Speaker 1>I'm also a dad.

00:04:10.045 --> 00:04:12.285
<v Speaker 1>I'm a sci fi and fantasy nerd. I'm

00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:14.365
<v Speaker 1>a martial arts instructor, and I'm a dungeon

00:04:14.365 --> 00:04:16.685
<v Speaker 1>master. So I'm a, you know, well rounded

00:04:16.685 --> 00:04:17.245
<v Speaker 1>individual.

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:19.269
<v Speaker 1>You can actually see some of my swords

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.230
<v Speaker 0>in the background.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.150
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.350
<v Speaker 0>I I think it's always great that, you

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.150
<v Speaker 0>know, technology welcomes everybody from regardless of their

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.910
<v Speaker 0>background. Although you may be the first art

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.910
<v Speaker 0>major that I've I've had a conversation with.

00:04:32.415 --> 00:04:35.215
<v Speaker 0>I am not great. Yeah. Education art major.

00:04:35.215 --> 00:04:38.175
<v Speaker 1>So the education part is the education part

00:04:38.175 --> 00:04:40.655
<v Speaker 1>is very useful. The art, slightly less.

00:04:41.294 --> 00:04:41.855
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:04:42.095 --> 00:04:44.175
<v Speaker 0>I'm I'm not creative at all. I often

00:04:44.175 --> 00:04:45.215
<v Speaker 0>say if I have to build a UI

00:04:45.215 --> 00:04:46.815
<v Speaker 0>for something, it's gonna be black text on

00:04:46.815 --> 00:04:48.580
<v Speaker 0>a background. And that to me, that that

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.700
<v Speaker 0>that's good enough.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.940
<v Speaker 0>However, thank you for joining us. So thank

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.380
<v Speaker 0>you for sharing all that as well.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.220
<v Speaker 0>Do you wanna tell us a little bit

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.020
<v Speaker 0>more about

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.220
<v Speaker 0>describe and get and, you know, everything in

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.460
<v Speaker 0>between?

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:01.305
<v Speaker 1>Of course.

00:05:01.865 --> 00:05:04.025
<v Speaker 1>Well, like, I'll I'll try to keep this

00:05:04.025 --> 00:05:06.265
<v Speaker 1>part at least the the Stripe part short

00:05:06.265 --> 00:05:08.345
<v Speaker 1>because GitGuard is is our focus here, and

00:05:08.345 --> 00:05:10.105
<v Speaker 1>I don't wanna take too much away from

00:05:10.105 --> 00:05:13.225
<v Speaker 1>that. Stripe security, like I said, is is

00:05:13.225 --> 00:05:15.145
<v Speaker 1>dealing with software supply chain security.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.910
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know what that is, software

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.110
<v Speaker 1>supply chain is the idea that everything,

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.590
<v Speaker 1>all the code, all the tools that you

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.270
<v Speaker 1>use are interconnected,

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.350
<v Speaker 1>and one

00:05:30.015 --> 00:05:31.135
<v Speaker 1>weak link

00:05:31.135 --> 00:05:32.815
<v Speaker 1>is enough to create

00:05:33.055 --> 00:05:34.335
<v Speaker 1>an extensive

00:05:34.415 --> 00:05:35.615
<v Speaker 1>blast radius.

00:05:35.695 --> 00:05:36.575
<v Speaker 1>Some of the

00:05:36.975 --> 00:05:38.735
<v Speaker 1>one of the most common examples in the

00:05:38.735 --> 00:05:39.375
<v Speaker 1>field is

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.490
<v Speaker 1>is the breach

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.810
<v Speaker 1>that happened at the end of

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.050
<v Speaker 1>twenty twenty, SolarWinds.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Yep. One little

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.210
<v Speaker 1>well, I wouldn't quite say mistake, but one

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.090
<v Speaker 1>little change in the code exposed over 18,000

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.770
<v Speaker 1>computers, lots of damages.

00:05:56.305 --> 00:05:56.785
<v Speaker 1>It's

00:05:58.305 --> 00:05:59.905
<v Speaker 1>as a result from that, a lot of

00:05:59.905 --> 00:06:00.865
<v Speaker 1>regulatory

00:06:00.865 --> 00:06:04.145
<v Speaker 1>changes happened. Scribe is right there to help

00:06:04.145 --> 00:06:05.025
<v Speaker 1>companies

00:06:05.745 --> 00:06:09.185
<v Speaker 1>secure the software supply chain, gain more visibility

00:06:09.185 --> 00:06:12.465
<v Speaker 1>and trust into whatever code they're doing, including

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.250
<v Speaker 1>getting the the the provenance of the code,

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.810
<v Speaker 1>including making sure that stuff wasn't modified or

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.570
<v Speaker 1>changed where it's not supposed to,

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.970
<v Speaker 1>you're more than welcome I mean, I'm saying

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.330
<v Speaker 1>to our viewers, you're more than welcome to

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.170
<v Speaker 1>check out the Stripe security website.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.210
<v Speaker 1>It's there's a freemium level, you can try

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.530
<v Speaker 1>it out.

00:06:28.975 --> 00:06:31.135
<v Speaker 1>And you can also, you know, contact me

00:06:31.135 --> 00:06:33.535
<v Speaker 1>either on LinkedIn or my email for with

00:06:33.535 --> 00:06:36.335
<v Speaker 1>any questions you might have. That's about Scribe.

00:06:36.335 --> 00:06:38.335
<v Speaker 1>And, again, I can talk about Scribe a

00:06:38.335 --> 00:06:40.015
<v Speaker 1>lot more, but this is about GitGat.

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:43.469
<v Speaker 1>And GitGat is an open source project that

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:45.229
<v Speaker 1>was created by Scribe

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.669
<v Speaker 1>with the focus on SCM

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:51.069
<v Speaker 1>security posture. Now SCM, for those of you

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:52.750
<v Speaker 1>who don't know the the abbreviation,

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.825
<v Speaker 1>is source control the source code management. So

00:06:55.825 --> 00:06:58.065
<v Speaker 1>the most common source

00:06:58.145 --> 00:07:01.105
<v Speaker 1>code management platform out there is GitHub, and

00:07:01.105 --> 00:07:03.905
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure almost every single one of our

00:07:03.905 --> 00:07:06.225
<v Speaker 1>listeners knows GitHub. But there are others out

00:07:06.225 --> 00:07:09.080
<v Speaker 1>there. You probably know them, like GitLab or

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.040
<v Speaker 1>Bitbucket.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.960
<v Speaker 1>There's a few more of them. At least

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.680
<v Speaker 1>big ones, there's quite a few more less

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.800
<v Speaker 1>well known ones.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.840
<v Speaker 1>And the idea behind GitGat is that

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.400
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these platforms

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.065
<v Speaker 1>were designed, first and foremost, to enable easy

00:07:25.065 --> 00:07:26.425
<v Speaker 1>sharing of information,

00:07:26.585 --> 00:07:28.745
<v Speaker 1>enabling lots of people to work together on

00:07:28.745 --> 00:07:29.305
<v Speaker 1>code.

00:07:29.705 --> 00:07:31.465
<v Speaker 1>Obviously, when you get a lot of people

00:07:31.465 --> 00:07:33.784
<v Speaker 1>to work together on code, security is not

00:07:33.784 --> 00:07:35.785
<v Speaker 1>always at the top of the list.

00:07:36.585 --> 00:07:36.985
<v Speaker 1>Developers,

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.470
<v Speaker 1>most of them being lovely, trusting people, don't

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:43.510
<v Speaker 1>always consider the fact that some of them

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:46.070
<v Speaker 1>are not as nice and are mainly interested

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.990
<v Speaker 1>in stealing code or modifying it.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:52.230
<v Speaker 1>Again, the idea behind GitGap is to hand

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:55.224
<v Speaker 1>you a report about your security posture, either

00:07:55.224 --> 00:07:57.785
<v Speaker 1>of your private GitHub account or if in

00:07:57.785 --> 00:07:59.224
<v Speaker 1>case you're an organization

00:07:59.224 --> 00:08:01.785
<v Speaker 1>with a GitHub account about your organizational

00:08:02.025 --> 00:08:04.264
<v Speaker 1>security posture. It involves quite a few things,

00:08:04.264 --> 00:08:06.104
<v Speaker 1>and I will go over them in the

00:08:06.104 --> 00:08:08.920
<v Speaker 1>report. The nice things about GitGat is, first

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.760
<v Speaker 1>of all, if you learn about GitGat, you

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.760
<v Speaker 1>know about the security posture so you can

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.080
<v Speaker 1>handle it yourself if you want to. Secondly,

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.880
<v Speaker 1>that report is private. You generate the report

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.320
<v Speaker 1>once or continuously.

00:08:19.975 --> 00:08:21.815
<v Speaker 1>All the results that you get are only

00:08:21.815 --> 00:08:24.215
<v Speaker 1>yours. Nobody else sees them, unlike, for example,

00:08:24.215 --> 00:08:24.935
<v Speaker 1>scorecard,

00:08:25.495 --> 00:08:27.575
<v Speaker 1>which is public. Once you generate the scorecard

00:08:27.575 --> 00:08:29.095
<v Speaker 1>for your repository,

00:08:29.095 --> 00:08:31.735
<v Speaker 1>everybody can see it. So Gitcat is private,

00:08:32.054 --> 00:08:35.070
<v Speaker 1>and you can add quite a few little

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.309
<v Speaker 1>things to it built into it, of course.

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:38.910
<v Speaker 1>So you can you could just configure them.

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:40.910
<v Speaker 1>For example, you can use a state to

00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:43.950
<v Speaker 1>manage exactly what information you get on a

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:46.830
<v Speaker 1>continuous manner. You can add information

00:08:47.525 --> 00:08:49.845
<v Speaker 1>to your state, for example, like,

00:08:50.485 --> 00:08:51.525
<v Speaker 1>you can set

00:08:52.325 --> 00:08:53.365
<v Speaker 1>approved

00:08:54.245 --> 00:08:56.565
<v Speaker 1>modifiers or or contributors,

00:08:56.725 --> 00:08:59.045
<v Speaker 1>people that if they happen to touch or

00:08:59.045 --> 00:09:00.645
<v Speaker 1>accounts, actually, that if they happen to touch

00:09:00.645 --> 00:09:02.770
<v Speaker 1>your code, you'll be alerted for it. There's

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:04.690
<v Speaker 1>lots of nifty new things that you can

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:05.730
<v Speaker 1>do with GitGat.

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:08.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh, and one other thing that I can

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:09.810
<v Speaker 1>mention is that I wrote a course about

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:11.490
<v Speaker 1>GitGat for the Linux Foundation.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:15.330
<v Speaker 1>So everything that we're covering on this demonstration,

00:09:15.845 --> 00:09:18.645
<v Speaker 1>you can check out on that course for

00:09:18.645 --> 00:09:21.125
<v Speaker 1>free because, you know, Linux Foundation courses are

00:09:21.125 --> 00:09:21.685
<v Speaker 1>free.

00:09:22.245 --> 00:09:24.005
<v Speaker 1>And, you know, like I said, even if

00:09:24.005 --> 00:09:26.085
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to end up using GitKat

00:09:26.085 --> 00:09:29.750
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason, learning about GitHub security posture

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:30.630
<v Speaker 1>is great.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:31.750
<v Speaker 1>Eventually,

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:34.150
<v Speaker 1>the more, you know, contributors

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:36.950
<v Speaker 1>we get to the to the repository, eventually,

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.990
<v Speaker 1>other than GitHub, we'll be able to add

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.830
<v Speaker 1>additional SCM systems to it.

00:09:42.785 --> 00:09:45.265
<v Speaker 1>GitLab is almost completely ready.

00:09:45.345 --> 00:09:47.105
<v Speaker 1>Currently, it's in the testing phase.

00:09:47.425 --> 00:09:50.305
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping that GitLab will be ready within

00:09:50.305 --> 00:09:52.225
<v Speaker 1>a week or so. And once it is,

00:09:52.385 --> 00:09:53.985
<v Speaker 1>I'll add it to the documentation

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.100
<v Speaker 1>on the repository, and GitLab users will be

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.860
<v Speaker 1>able to use GitHub just like GitHub users

00:09:58.860 --> 00:09:59.740
<v Speaker 1>right now.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.899
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Thank you for sharing all that. And

00:10:03.899 --> 00:10:05.180
<v Speaker 0>I I think that

00:10:06.405 --> 00:10:08.085
<v Speaker 0>I don't know. Not not me it's not

00:10:08.085 --> 00:10:10.725
<v Speaker 0>amusing. That's the wrong word. But so many

00:10:10.725 --> 00:10:14.405
<v Speaker 0>security companies and products and even the awareness

00:10:14.405 --> 00:10:16.725
<v Speaker 0>of supply chain security over the last three

00:10:16.725 --> 00:10:17.285
<v Speaker 0>years,

00:10:18.005 --> 00:10:20.590
<v Speaker 0>all the origin stories are the SolarWinds hack.

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:22.830
<v Speaker 0>Like, it just you know, I do a

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.710
<v Speaker 0>lot of reviews for CFPs at KubeCon. Mhmm.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:27.710
<v Speaker 0>And, like, ever since the SolarWinds attack, it's

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.310
<v Speaker 0>been supply chain supply chain. And I think

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:31.550
<v Speaker 0>we're now at, like, peak. This is where

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:33.790
<v Speaker 0>everybody is really starting to take security and

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:36.175
<v Speaker 0>their security posture a lot more seriously, which

00:10:36.175 --> 00:10:38.975
<v Speaker 0>is a fantastic thing. Well, there's a lot

00:10:38.975 --> 00:10:41.615
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of other security breaches. It's

00:10:41.615 --> 00:10:43.775
<v Speaker 1>just that SolarWind is like the poster child.

00:10:43.775 --> 00:10:46.095
<v Speaker 1>It's the most well known. So if I

00:10:46.095 --> 00:10:49.020
<v Speaker 1>say, for example, Code Cove or Argo CD

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.020
<v Speaker 1>or some other names,

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.900
<v Speaker 1>it's it wouldn't resonate as much because most

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.220
<v Speaker 1>people wouldn't know about them. But SolarWinds, almost

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.060
<v Speaker 1>everybody heard about it because it was such

00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:59.340
<v Speaker 1>a big deal at the time.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.300
<v Speaker 1>So, yeah, it's it's the poster child for

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.340
<v Speaker 1>software supply chain.

00:11:04.115 --> 00:11:05.954
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. And last pass could be the poster

00:11:05.954 --> 00:11:07.235
<v Speaker 0>child for something else, but I'm not gonna

00:11:07.235 --> 00:11:08.435
<v Speaker 0>say that word on air. So

00:11:09.714 --> 00:11:11.394
<v Speaker 0>we got some love in the chat from

00:11:11.394 --> 00:11:13.154
<v Speaker 0>James for the logo as well. So why

00:11:13.154 --> 00:11:14.595
<v Speaker 0>don't we share my screen and get the

00:11:14.595 --> 00:11:16.675
<v Speaker 0>repository up so people can see where it's

00:11:16.675 --> 00:11:18.514
<v Speaker 0>at? And then we can talk a little

00:11:18.514 --> 00:11:19.315
<v Speaker 0>bit more about it.

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.170
<v Speaker 0>So Sure. Since since

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:24.570
<v Speaker 1>James said that the logo was fun, I

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:26.730
<v Speaker 1>can share that our CTO's

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:27.370
<v Speaker 1>daughter,

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:31.370
<v Speaker 1>who's a graphic design major, designed the logo.

00:11:32.965 --> 00:11:34.885
<v Speaker 0>There we go. From the center of the

00:11:34.885 --> 00:11:36.965
<v Speaker 0>the thing there. Yeah. But it's a KitKat.

00:11:36.965 --> 00:11:38.965
<v Speaker 0>Right? But it's a green KitKat.

00:11:38.965 --> 00:11:40.485
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it's Yeah.

00:11:40.725 --> 00:11:42.565
<v Speaker 1>Actually, it says GitGat.

00:11:42.565 --> 00:11:44.645
<v Speaker 1>But yeah. It's it's it's a a play

00:11:44.645 --> 00:11:47.205
<v Speaker 1>on the KitKat. Yeah. Yeah. It's a play

00:11:47.205 --> 00:11:47.925
<v Speaker 1>on KitKat.

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:49.900
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.620
<v Speaker 0>So for anyone who wants to play with

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.380
<v Speaker 0>KitKat in their own time, you can find

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:58.460
<v Speaker 0>it at github.com/scrape-public/KitKat.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.140
<v Speaker 1>Mhmm. Nice.

00:12:01.105 --> 00:12:03.265
<v Speaker 0>So before we dive into the hands on

00:12:03.265 --> 00:12:06.145
<v Speaker 0>component, you know, we kind of shared kind

00:12:06.145 --> 00:12:07.665
<v Speaker 0>of what it's doing. Like,

00:12:07.985 --> 00:12:10.945
<v Speaker 0>I always ask the same question from similar,

00:12:10.945 --> 00:12:13.425
<v Speaker 0>not security based products, but developer experience products.

00:12:13.425 --> 00:12:14.305
<v Speaker 0>And it's always like, should

00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:17.269
<v Speaker 0>like, should all repositories

00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:19.990
<v Speaker 0>have GitGuard running against it? Is that something

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:22.310
<v Speaker 0>you'd feel brave enough encouraging,

00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:25.269
<v Speaker 0>or is there a moment, an inflection point

00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:26.790
<v Speaker 0>where people should be like, oh, okay. Now

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:28.389
<v Speaker 0>I should start taking a look at this.

00:12:29.225 --> 00:12:31.065
<v Speaker 1>Well, like I said, because you can run

00:12:31.065 --> 00:12:33.145
<v Speaker 1>it privately, nobody gets to see the results

00:12:33.145 --> 00:12:34.105
<v Speaker 1>other than you.

00:12:34.505 --> 00:12:37.865
<v Speaker 1>And, again, this is more useful for organization

00:12:37.865 --> 00:12:39.145
<v Speaker 1>rather than private

00:12:39.625 --> 00:12:42.025
<v Speaker 1>GitHub users. But if you have an organization,

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:44.130
<v Speaker 1>several repositories,

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.210
<v Speaker 1>you you you're working with teams, you're working

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:47.410
<v Speaker 1>with collaborators,

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:49.970
<v Speaker 1>sure. Run the report once a week, once

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:52.450
<v Speaker 1>a month, once a day. Doesn't matter. The

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:53.890
<v Speaker 1>report essentially

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:57.090
<v Speaker 1>produces a JSON, an XML, or a gist

00:12:57.135 --> 00:12:58.015
<v Speaker 1>file.

00:12:58.335 --> 00:12:59.615
<v Speaker 1>Look at it if you want to. If

00:12:59.615 --> 00:13:02.415
<v Speaker 1>you don't, at least if something happens, you'll

00:13:02.415 --> 00:13:03.775
<v Speaker 1>be able to go back and look at

00:13:03.775 --> 00:13:06.655
<v Speaker 1>it and see where something went wrong. Even

00:13:06.655 --> 00:13:08.495
<v Speaker 1>if you don't use the state,

00:13:08.655 --> 00:13:10.335
<v Speaker 1>you'll just get the same report every time.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.320
<v Speaker 1>At least if something happens, you'll be able

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.000
<v Speaker 1>to know about it. So I don't see

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.200
<v Speaker 1>any problem with

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.560
<v Speaker 1>either running it directly from

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.160
<v Speaker 1>an image or downloading it or, you know,

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.160
<v Speaker 1>forking it and running it yourself. There's lots

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.564
<v Speaker 1>of options. Because it's private, I don't really

00:13:26.564 --> 00:13:27.764
<v Speaker 1>see a problem with it.

00:13:28.165 --> 00:13:31.125
<v Speaker 0>Okay. And is that something that organizations

00:13:31.204 --> 00:13:32.884
<v Speaker 0>run once and they're done, or is this

00:13:32.884 --> 00:13:34.884
<v Speaker 0>something we expect them to run at a

00:13:34.884 --> 00:13:35.925
<v Speaker 0>regular cadence?

00:13:37.204 --> 00:13:39.444
<v Speaker 1>Because of the the state that we included,

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.300
<v Speaker 1>running it continuously is in encouraged.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.940
<v Speaker 1>I know because I I spoke to somebody

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.660
<v Speaker 1>in check marks that at least one department

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.500
<v Speaker 1>is running it continuously

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:51.700
<v Speaker 1>at least once a week.

00:13:53.055 --> 00:13:55.855
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That that that was the intended idea.

00:13:56.495 --> 00:13:58.495
<v Speaker 1>Just like with a lot of other security

00:13:58.814 --> 00:13:59.695
<v Speaker 1>tools,

00:13:59.774 --> 00:14:01.694
<v Speaker 1>running it once and being done with it

00:14:01.694 --> 00:14:03.935
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really help. Whatever

00:14:03.935 --> 00:14:05.774
<v Speaker 1>point at whatever point in time you're running

00:14:05.774 --> 00:14:08.150
<v Speaker 1>it, you might miss something. Only if you

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:11.270
<v Speaker 1>run the test continuously can you see changes

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:12.390
<v Speaker 1>or modifications

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:13.670
<v Speaker 1>and you risk

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.550
<v Speaker 1>less about missing something that happened.

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:18.390
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:14:19.325 --> 00:14:21.325
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I think we're about ready to start

00:14:21.325 --> 00:14:23.485
<v Speaker 0>getting hands on and showing people what they

00:14:23.485 --> 00:14:25.085
<v Speaker 0>can do with KitKat. But before I do,

00:14:25.085 --> 00:14:26.845
<v Speaker 0>I'll I'll pop James's comment on the screen.

00:14:26.845 --> 00:14:28.445
<v Speaker 0>He has informed us that in Japan, you

00:14:28.445 --> 00:14:31.005
<v Speaker 0>can buy a green with Zabi KitKat. So

00:14:31.005 --> 00:14:33.325
<v Speaker 0>there you go. Never been to Japan, but

00:14:33.325 --> 00:14:33.965
<v Speaker 0>it's on my list.

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:38.540
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.300
<v Speaker 0>To get started, the step one, according to

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.020
<v Speaker 0>the the readme documentation here on the repository

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.020
<v Speaker 0>is that I should go and get myself

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.180
<v Speaker 0>a GitHub personal access token,

00:14:49.805 --> 00:14:52.125
<v Speaker 0>and it requires some permissions,

00:14:52.764 --> 00:14:55.245
<v Speaker 0>the ability to read the organization user

00:14:55.884 --> 00:14:56.685
<v Speaker 0>and

00:14:56.685 --> 00:14:57.964
<v Speaker 0>public keys,

00:14:58.125 --> 00:15:01.165
<v Speaker 0>repository status, deployments, repo hooks, public repo, I

00:15:01.165 --> 00:15:04.045
<v Speaker 0>guess. So nothing Mhmm. Nothing frightening. I'm not

00:15:04.045 --> 00:15:06.590
<v Speaker 0>I'm not scared of that. Yeah. I should

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:09.070
<v Speaker 1>also say that GitGat, because I haven't mentioned

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:10.110
<v Speaker 1>it before,

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:14.350
<v Speaker 1>GitGat is written in in Regal with OPA.

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:17.310
<v Speaker 1>Essentially, we're using the GitHub at least in

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:20.295
<v Speaker 1>this instance, we're using the GitHub API to

00:15:20.295 --> 00:15:22.935
<v Speaker 1>gather information. All the information that GitGat is

00:15:22.935 --> 00:15:25.574
<v Speaker 1>using is meta information that is available through

00:15:25.574 --> 00:15:26.375
<v Speaker 1>the API,

00:15:26.615 --> 00:15:27.654
<v Speaker 1>and we're using

00:15:28.134 --> 00:15:29.095
<v Speaker 1>OPA

00:15:29.175 --> 00:15:30.055
<v Speaker 1>queries

00:15:30.055 --> 00:15:32.540
<v Speaker 1>to get the information that we need or

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.300
<v Speaker 1>or actually that GitGap needs to generate the

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.180
<v Speaker 1>report. So it it it doesn't actually look

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:40.459
<v Speaker 1>into your code. It doesn't look into anything

00:15:40.459 --> 00:15:43.260
<v Speaker 1>that you might be worried about sharing.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.660
<v Speaker 1>All the permissions that GitGap requires

00:15:45.845 --> 00:15:48.325
<v Speaker 1>are, like you saw, essentially read

00:15:48.645 --> 00:15:49.285
<v Speaker 1>reading

00:15:49.525 --> 00:15:51.205
<v Speaker 1>permissions except for gist,

00:15:51.685 --> 00:15:53.845
<v Speaker 1>and we include a gist so that you

00:15:53.845 --> 00:15:55.525
<v Speaker 1>can get the report not just as a

00:15:55.525 --> 00:15:57.765
<v Speaker 1>JSON, but you can have it sent immediately

00:15:57.765 --> 00:15:59.365
<v Speaker 1>to your gist. And if you're not familiar

00:15:59.365 --> 00:16:00.885
<v Speaker 1>with gist, I'll show you where it is

00:16:00.885 --> 00:16:01.285
<v Speaker 1>in a second.

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:04.810
<v Speaker 1>And it's much easier for most users to

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:06.570
<v Speaker 1>look at the report in the gist and

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:07.850
<v Speaker 1>as a JSON file.

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:09.770
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:12.410
<v Speaker 0>So we need to talk in and I'm

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:14.090
<v Speaker 0>curious if I can do this from

00:16:14.885 --> 00:16:16.725
<v Speaker 0>the g h command line. I've never tried

00:16:16.725 --> 00:16:17.445
<v Speaker 0>it before.

00:16:18.165 --> 00:16:20.725
<v Speaker 1>I have the the full path of creating

00:16:20.725 --> 00:16:22.645
<v Speaker 1>it with the UI, but you're welcome to

00:16:22.645 --> 00:16:24.085
<v Speaker 1>try it anyway you want.

00:16:25.445 --> 00:16:26.245
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Let's see.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.490
<v Speaker 0>I'll print the off talking GitHub. Oh, no.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.170
<v Speaker 0>No. Okay. We don't want that. Alright. I'll

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:33.370
<v Speaker 0>just do it for the guy.

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:36.250
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:41.690
<v Speaker 0>but I should probably keep that up. Right?

00:16:48.005 --> 00:16:48.485
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

00:16:49.925 --> 00:16:52.245
<v Speaker 0>come on, browser. There we go.

00:16:53.365 --> 00:16:55.285
<v Speaker 0>Because I need to see the permissions.

00:16:55.285 --> 00:16:56.644
<v Speaker 0>We're gonna go to settings,

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:00.060
<v Speaker 0>developer settings.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.820
<v Speaker 0>And can it be one of the new

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.819
<v Speaker 0>scoped tokens or does it have to be

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:07.260
<v Speaker 0>a classic? I guess the scope to stay

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.259
<v Speaker 0>in based on No. It doesn't really matter.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.020
<v Speaker 1>Essentially, you're you're going to look for a

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:14.045
<v Speaker 1>personal access token. That's that's what you're looking

00:17:14.045 --> 00:17:14.525
<v Speaker 1>for.

00:17:15.405 --> 00:17:17.645
<v Speaker 1>And I see that you will have, just

00:17:17.645 --> 00:17:19.565
<v Speaker 1>like me, a two

00:17:19.724 --> 00:17:21.244
<v Speaker 1>factor authentication,

00:17:21.244 --> 00:17:22.845
<v Speaker 1>which is good. It's one of the things

00:17:22.845 --> 00:17:24.285
<v Speaker 1>that, GitGuard is checking.

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:28.609
<v Speaker 0>Alright. And it will inspire us

00:17:28.929 --> 00:17:30.929
<v Speaker 0>seven days, so they'll hopefully sooner.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:34.289
<v Speaker 0>And public repositories read only or all repositories,

00:17:34.289 --> 00:17:35.889
<v Speaker 0>I guess. We're fine.

00:17:37.785 --> 00:17:39.225
<v Speaker 0>And we need

00:17:43.145 --> 00:17:43.945
<v Speaker 0>status.

00:17:46.105 --> 00:17:47.625
<v Speaker 0>Maybe I should have done this a classic

00:17:47.625 --> 00:17:48.985
<v Speaker 0>way because I don't know if these match

00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:50.585
<v Speaker 0>up. Yeah. I I don't know this much

00:17:50.585 --> 00:17:53.090
<v Speaker 1>up either. I I it's it's too new.

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:55.650
<v Speaker 1>I always did it the classic way. Yeah.

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:57.090
<v Speaker 0>I I don't feel brave enough to try

00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:58.610
<v Speaker 0>to do that live on the stream. So

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:01.650
<v Speaker 0>let's just expire this instead of this. But

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:03.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I'm gonna expire tomorrow.

00:18:03.825 --> 00:18:06.065
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Tomorrow because, you know, we don't want

00:18:06.065 --> 00:18:08.784
<v Speaker 1>anybody seeing this to get permissions

00:18:08.784 --> 00:18:11.585
<v Speaker 1>to your GitHub account. I again, you don't

00:18:11.585 --> 00:18:12.784
<v Speaker 1>need all of it. No. No. No. No.

00:18:12.784 --> 00:18:13.904
<v Speaker 1>You you marked all of it. You don't

00:18:13.904 --> 00:18:15.345
<v Speaker 1>need all of it. Oyman.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.559
<v Speaker 1>You also need the third one, public.

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:22.279
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:18:23.559 --> 00:18:24.440
<v Speaker 1>K.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:25.960
<v Speaker 1>We need

00:18:29.559 --> 00:18:30.120
<v Speaker 1>user.

00:18:31.765 --> 00:18:33.765
<v Speaker 1>Just is right above that. Yep. Just is

00:18:33.765 --> 00:18:36.645
<v Speaker 1>right over there. Yep. There it is. And

00:18:36.645 --> 00:18:37.684
<v Speaker 0>admin

00:18:37.765 --> 00:18:38.885
<v Speaker 0>redark

00:18:41.045 --> 00:18:42.404
<v Speaker 0>and public key. Yeah.

00:18:43.045 --> 00:18:44.325
<v Speaker 1>I don't let's see.

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.120
<v Speaker 1>+1, 236.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.600
<v Speaker 1>You need to have 8. Make sure you

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.040
<v Speaker 1>have 8 because I can't I can't really

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:56.759
<v Speaker 1>see clearly. Alright. +1, 24567.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.360
<v Speaker 1>You're still missing one.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:18:59.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You're missing one.

00:19:02.015 --> 00:19:02.894
<v Speaker 0>Status.

00:19:02.895 --> 00:19:04.414
<v Speaker 0>No. No. We have status.

00:19:05.455 --> 00:19:06.815
<v Speaker 1>Which one are you missing?

00:19:09.934 --> 00:19:11.695
<v Speaker 1>Makes it a little There

00:19:15.054 --> 00:19:15.455
<v Speaker 1>we go.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:17.740
<v Speaker 1>There it is. Yep.

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So now that you have all of

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:21.020
<v Speaker 1>them

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah. And you need to copy it, of

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:27.100
<v Speaker 1>course. Make sure you have it somewhere accessible

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.460
<v Speaker 1>because, hopefully, we'll get to

00:19:29.485 --> 00:19:31.885
<v Speaker 1>running it continuously later, and we're going to

00:19:31.885 --> 00:19:32.524
<v Speaker 1>need it.

00:19:33.404 --> 00:19:35.164
<v Speaker 1>Now that you have it yeah.

00:19:35.725 --> 00:19:38.604
<v Speaker 1>DH token. There it is. Awesome.

00:19:39.245 --> 00:19:41.965
<v Speaker 1>Now the easiest way the easiest way to

00:19:41.965 --> 00:19:42.524
<v Speaker 1>run

00:19:42.845 --> 00:19:46.040
<v Speaker 1>git get is by using the Docker image.

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.880
<v Speaker 1>You can just copy the

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.240
<v Speaker 1>the line

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:50.840
<v Speaker 1>from the

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.760
<v Speaker 1>from the documentation.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Docker run g h tokens, Stripe security, giddyup

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.875
<v Speaker 1>latest, data g h post gist. The post

00:19:58.875 --> 00:20:00.715
<v Speaker 1>gist means that the report

00:20:00.875 --> 00:20:01.755
<v Speaker 1>will be

00:20:02.235 --> 00:20:03.035
<v Speaker 1>immediately

00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:04.475
<v Speaker 1>exported to your gist.

00:20:04.795 --> 00:20:06.635
<v Speaker 1>Now depending on how

00:20:06.715 --> 00:20:09.835
<v Speaker 1>big and complex your GitHub account is or,

00:20:09.835 --> 00:20:11.755
<v Speaker 1>you know, whatever it is connected to, it

00:20:11.755 --> 00:20:14.230
<v Speaker 1>might take thirty seconds or so to to

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:15.350
<v Speaker 1>finish the report.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:19.030
<v Speaker 1>If everything works fine, you should get the

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:21.750
<v Speaker 1>results of 201201

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:23.510
<v Speaker 1>created, and everything will be fine. And then

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:24.790
<v Speaker 1>we'll go to the gists and

00:20:25.045 --> 00:20:27.445
<v Speaker 1>look at the report you got. So just

00:20:27.445 --> 00:20:31.285
<v Speaker 0>to clarify what happens and Mhmm. My OCD

00:20:31.285 --> 00:20:32.005
<v Speaker 0>will

00:20:32.325 --> 00:20:34.005
<v Speaker 0>never let me get away because no to

00:20:34.005 --> 00:20:35.205
<v Speaker 0>go to her commands. So

00:20:36.885 --> 00:20:38.325
<v Speaker 0>is it this is going to use my

00:20:38.325 --> 00:20:40.645
<v Speaker 0>GitHub token, and it's going to scan

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.059
<v Speaker 0>my my whole account. It's not, like, a

00:20:44.059 --> 00:20:45.820
<v Speaker 0>single repository. It's not a single team. It's

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 0>not a single organization. It's whatever I have

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.860
<v Speaker 0>access. Okay. Yep. Now, again, it's it's not

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:51.740
<v Speaker 1>mandatory.

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:54.524
<v Speaker 1>Obviously, you can limit the the report to

00:20:54.524 --> 00:20:57.485
<v Speaker 1>a single repository or a single whatever, but

00:20:57.485 --> 00:21:00.284
<v Speaker 1>that's slightly more fine grained. And as a

00:21:00.284 --> 00:21:03.005
<v Speaker 1>beginning, as the simplest thing you can do

00:21:03.005 --> 00:21:04.205
<v Speaker 1>to get the report

00:21:04.684 --> 00:21:06.605
<v Speaker 1>is is to run it this way and

00:21:06.605 --> 00:21:08.684
<v Speaker 1>see whatever it is you're you're you're doing.

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:10.950
<v Speaker 1>Obviously, because this is private or at least

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:12.870
<v Speaker 1>that's usually private when you're not doing it

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:15.429
<v Speaker 1>live on YouTube or LinkedIn,

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:18.950
<v Speaker 1>you want to see everything that you're connected

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:22.230
<v Speaker 1>to, whatever teams or or collaborators

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.790
<v Speaker 1>or

00:21:23.375 --> 00:21:24.175
<v Speaker 1>public

00:21:24.175 --> 00:21:26.735
<v Speaker 1>repositories that you forgot about that that you

00:21:26.735 --> 00:21:27.535
<v Speaker 1>have somewhere.

00:21:29.055 --> 00:21:29.615
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:21:29.855 --> 00:21:32.255
<v Speaker 0>Is that it? It's it's finished? Unable to

00:21:32.255 --> 00:21:35.135
<v Speaker 1>find no. It's not usually. Unable to find

00:21:35.135 --> 00:21:35.855
<v Speaker 1>image.

00:21:35.935 --> 00:21:37.215
<v Speaker 1>I have not

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:39.190
<v Speaker 1>encountered that. I then pulled it, and we

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:41.110
<v Speaker 0>got empty premises at the end. I think

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:43.270
<v Speaker 0>it it just finished. Right? Well, if it's

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:44.870
<v Speaker 1>finished, then we can go back to your

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:46.790
<v Speaker 1>GitHub and look at your gists and see

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:47.670
<v Speaker 1>if we got the report.

00:21:55.685 --> 00:21:57.925
<v Speaker 0>I think the last one is some rust,

00:21:57.925 --> 00:21:59.365
<v Speaker 0>so I don't think

00:22:00.405 --> 00:22:02.165
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. We got a report. See it here.

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Can you run it again? I I don't

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:07.670
<v Speaker 1>know why it wouldn't work because I ran

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:09.590
<v Speaker 1>it just before we started, and it went

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:10.390
<v Speaker 1>just fine.

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:14.870
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to to download the

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:17.465
<v Speaker 1>the image just to run it through your

00:22:17.465 --> 00:22:18.184
<v Speaker 1>Docker.

00:22:18.825 --> 00:22:19.945
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.

00:22:21.545 --> 00:22:23.385
<v Speaker 1>Well, we can always try running it

00:22:24.905 --> 00:22:25.865
<v Speaker 1>locally

00:22:27.545 --> 00:22:29.065
<v Speaker 1>just to see

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:32.670
<v Speaker 1>just to see if we can get the

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:35.790
<v Speaker 1>the JSON file and not the gist.

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:38.750
<v Speaker 1>That's the second thing we can try. Okay.

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:41.310
<v Speaker 0>So what I write Just a second. Yeah.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:42.270
<v Speaker 0>Sure. Just a second.

00:22:45.655 --> 00:22:47.575
<v Speaker 1>Eval, get get latest.

00:22:47.895 --> 00:22:49.654
<v Speaker 0>I hope I didn't miss any permissions.

00:22:50.055 --> 00:22:52.855
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so. You you get every

00:22:53.015 --> 00:22:54.455
<v Speaker 1>all the permissions that you needed to.

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:58.270
<v Speaker 1>Let me just remove here.

00:23:01.309 --> 00:23:02.590
<v Speaker 1>JSON file.

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:04.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm just making sure I didn't miss anything,

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:06.750
<v Speaker 1>so I'm I'm looking at the the commands

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:07.869
<v Speaker 1>that I ran

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:09.309
<v Speaker 1>before we started.

00:23:11.205 --> 00:23:13.605
<v Speaker 1>And just to make sure that everything is

00:23:13.605 --> 00:23:15.924
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same, I'm going to send that

00:23:15.924 --> 00:23:18.485
<v Speaker 1>command over to you. There it is. Let's

00:23:18.485 --> 00:23:21.205
<v Speaker 1>run minus e g h token, swipe security

00:23:21.205 --> 00:23:23.284
<v Speaker 1>get latest to data g h eval.

00:23:23.899 --> 00:23:25.579
<v Speaker 0>Let's try to eval that. Yeah.

00:23:26.139 --> 00:23:27.339
<v Speaker 1>That should give you

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:28.940
<v Speaker 1>the report

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.059
<v Speaker 0>It's taking longer. On

00:23:32.779 --> 00:23:34.940
<v Speaker 1>the screen. Yeah. That should give you the

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.259
<v Speaker 1>the JSON report immediately on the screen so

00:23:37.259 --> 00:23:38.940
<v Speaker 1>that at least you can see that it's

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:39.259
<v Speaker 1>working.

00:23:44.705 --> 00:23:46.945
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's definitely doing something this time, which

00:23:46.945 --> 00:23:47.345
<v Speaker 0>is good.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And if if we need to, we

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:56.290
<v Speaker 1>can always I can always share my screen

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:58.450
<v Speaker 1>and show the the gist report just because

00:23:58.450 --> 00:23:59.010
<v Speaker 1>I

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:01.170
<v Speaker 1>want people to be able to see it.

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:03.890
<v Speaker 1>And I don't have any embarrassing secrets on

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:06.210
<v Speaker 1>my GitHub account that people shouldn't see. No.

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:07.330
<v Speaker 1>Of course, I do, but, you know, I

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:08.524
<v Speaker 0>don't mind sharing.

00:24:10.285 --> 00:24:12.605
<v Speaker 1>Because I wasn't always into in insecurity,

00:24:12.605 --> 00:24:15.325
<v Speaker 1>and some of my very, very old

00:24:17.164 --> 00:24:18.124
<v Speaker 1>repositories

00:24:18.125 --> 00:24:19.565
<v Speaker 1>have embarrassing

00:24:19.565 --> 00:24:20.365
<v Speaker 1>stuff in them.

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:26.210
<v Speaker 0>So I guess You you I must have,

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:27.890
<v Speaker 0>like, get have a. Yeah.

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:29.570
<v Speaker 1>You you probably do.

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:32.050
<v Speaker 0>I've been an open source contributor for about

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:35.410
<v Speaker 0>sixteen years, so probably Yeah. Then you probably.

00:24:35.835 --> 00:24:38.075
<v Speaker 1>I I know that one of the reasons

00:24:38.075 --> 00:24:39.195
<v Speaker 1>I can share

00:24:39.835 --> 00:24:42.075
<v Speaker 1>my screen and show my account is because

00:24:42.075 --> 00:24:43.754
<v Speaker 1>other than my private account,

00:24:43.995 --> 00:24:44.875
<v Speaker 1>I'm also

00:24:45.515 --> 00:24:46.874
<v Speaker 1>I also got this

00:24:47.674 --> 00:24:50.554
<v Speaker 1>Scribe demo account in which I'm an admin.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.360
<v Speaker 1>And I'm also a member

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.840
<v Speaker 1>of the Scribe you know, the usual account

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.360
<v Speaker 1>of of Scribe, which is

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.760
<v Speaker 1>usually, most of it is private. But because

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:01.960
<v Speaker 1>mister

00:25:03.235 --> 00:25:06.034
<v Speaker 1>permissions to all of them, GitKat scans all

00:25:06.034 --> 00:25:08.274
<v Speaker 1>of them. So it wouldn't just tell me

00:25:08.595 --> 00:25:10.594
<v Speaker 1>if there are, for example,

00:25:10.835 --> 00:25:14.514
<v Speaker 1>too many admins in my own repository. It

00:25:14.514 --> 00:25:15.554
<v Speaker 1>would also check

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.550
<v Speaker 1>the the scribe demo, and it would also

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:20.950
<v Speaker 1>check scribe the the regular scribe as it

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:22.149
<v Speaker 1>were, scribe public.

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't want people to be staring

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:27.990
<v Speaker 1>at a blank screen,

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:32.710
<v Speaker 1>how about I just open the

00:25:31.495 --> 00:25:33.815
<v Speaker 1>share my screen and show

00:25:34.375 --> 00:25:34.934
<v Speaker 1>the

00:25:35.414 --> 00:25:36.695
<v Speaker 1>the reports?

00:25:37.655 --> 00:25:38.854
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Go for it.

00:25:39.815 --> 00:25:41.335
<v Speaker 1>Just because, you know, I don't know how

00:25:41.335 --> 00:25:43.335
<v Speaker 1>long this will take, and it just feels

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:46.010
<v Speaker 1>yeah. Okay. Share.

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:47.450
<v Speaker 1>Can you see my screen?

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:50.570
<v Speaker 0>Let me just click a few magic buttons,

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:53.770
<v Speaker 0>swap the scene over, and now, yes, we

00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:55.450
<v Speaker 0>see get get account security audits.

00:25:56.075 --> 00:25:56.794
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.

00:25:56.955 --> 00:25:58.475
<v Speaker 1>So what you can see at the top

00:25:58.475 --> 00:26:00.155
<v Speaker 1>here is report.JSON.

00:26:00.155 --> 00:26:02.555
<v Speaker 1>I know it's a very imaginative name. So

00:26:02.555 --> 00:26:04.235
<v Speaker 1>if you really want to look at the

00:26:04.235 --> 00:26:06.555
<v Speaker 1>JSON, can copy it, look at it, you

00:26:06.555 --> 00:26:08.555
<v Speaker 1>know, whatever you need to if a JSON

00:26:08.555 --> 00:26:10.475
<v Speaker 1>really speaks to you and then you're more

00:26:10.475 --> 00:26:12.739
<v Speaker 1>comfortable looking at that. But for most people,

00:26:12.899 --> 00:26:14.980
<v Speaker 1>I imagine that a gist will be more

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:15.619
<v Speaker 1>comfortable.

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Now the report MD, which is markdown language,

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.980
<v Speaker 1>is appears in your gist. To those of

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:24.580
<v Speaker 1>you who are not familiar, in order to

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:27.275
<v Speaker 1>get your gist, just go to your little

00:26:27.275 --> 00:26:29.595
<v Speaker 1>icon image, and you can see your GISTs.

00:26:30.875 --> 00:26:33.115
<v Speaker 1>Just to show you how they look, these

00:26:33.115 --> 00:26:34.395
<v Speaker 1>are all my GISTs.

00:26:34.555 --> 00:26:36.075
<v Speaker 1>You can see that I ran this earlier

00:26:36.075 --> 00:26:39.280
<v Speaker 1>today about six hours ago. Clicking here would

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.040
<v Speaker 1>just get me back to the report.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:44.560
<v Speaker 1>Now this is the GitGat account security audit.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.160
<v Speaker 1>There's overview,

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.840
<v Speaker 1>most of the stuff that it checks.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.400
<v Speaker 1>We wanted it to be, you know, clear.

00:26:50.735 --> 00:26:52.414
<v Speaker 1>So we have the motivation,

00:26:52.415 --> 00:26:53.375
<v Speaker 1>the findings,

00:26:53.455 --> 00:26:54.495
<v Speaker 1>and recommendations.

00:26:54.655 --> 00:26:57.055
<v Speaker 1>Motivation would usually explain what it is we're

00:26:57.055 --> 00:27:00.015
<v Speaker 1>checking and why. Findings are the actual, you

00:27:00.015 --> 00:27:03.375
<v Speaker 1>know, information. And recommendations is useful because if

00:27:03.375 --> 00:27:04.975
<v Speaker 1>there's

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.240
<v Speaker 1>activities that you need to do or are

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.880
<v Speaker 1>recommended to do, you can just do them

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.200
<v Speaker 1>using the links. So let's take a look

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.679
<v Speaker 1>at what GitGad is looking at. First of

00:27:13.679 --> 00:27:15.519
<v Speaker 1>all, public access.

00:27:15.679 --> 00:27:18.080
<v Speaker 1>Very easy to know that or at least

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.534
<v Speaker 1>most people know when you create a repository

00:27:20.534 --> 00:27:22.695
<v Speaker 1>on on GitHub, it can either be public

00:27:22.695 --> 00:27:25.015
<v Speaker 1>or private. If it's private, you're the only

00:27:25.015 --> 00:27:26.534
<v Speaker 1>one who has access to it. It's not

00:27:26.534 --> 00:27:27.335
<v Speaker 1>visible

00:27:27.414 --> 00:27:29.734
<v Speaker 1>online. Nobody sees it. Nobody knows about it.

00:27:29.815 --> 00:27:30.695
<v Speaker 1>But if it's public,

00:27:31.429 --> 00:27:33.750
<v Speaker 1>everybody can see it. Even if you didn't

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:34.789
<v Speaker 1>tell anybody

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:37.429
<v Speaker 1>and it's public, it's still visible online, and

00:27:37.429 --> 00:27:38.870
<v Speaker 1>if people can search for it, people can

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:39.590
<v Speaker 1>find it,

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:42.549
<v Speaker 1>and people can essentially look at the code,

00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:44.150
<v Speaker 1>fork it, do whatever they want with it.

00:27:44.674 --> 00:27:46.355
<v Speaker 1>Now this one tells me that I have

00:27:46.355 --> 00:27:48.995
<v Speaker 1>30 repositories that are public. It says 30

00:27:48.995 --> 00:27:50.995
<v Speaker 1>out of 30 just because it doesn't see

00:27:50.995 --> 00:27:52.674
<v Speaker 1>my private ones, and there are a few

00:27:52.674 --> 00:27:53.554
<v Speaker 1>private ones.

00:27:54.034 --> 00:27:56.115
<v Speaker 1>So I have 30 repositories

00:27:56.115 --> 00:27:58.034
<v Speaker 1>that are public. Now the interesting thing that

00:27:58.034 --> 00:27:59.960
<v Speaker 1>you can see here is that it checks

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.280
<v Speaker 1>mister b lightning, which is me on GitHub.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:05.080
<v Speaker 1>It also checks scribe demo, and it also

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.760
<v Speaker 1>checks scribe public

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.800
<v Speaker 1>and scribe security. So it checks everything that

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm somehow

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.040
<v Speaker 1>connected with, not just, you know, me.

00:28:15.725 --> 00:28:17.325
<v Speaker 1>And it tells me that if I want

00:28:17.325 --> 00:28:18.124
<v Speaker 1>to change

00:28:19.245 --> 00:28:19.964
<v Speaker 1>public

00:28:20.764 --> 00:28:22.365
<v Speaker 1>repositories to private, all I need to do

00:28:22.365 --> 00:28:24.365
<v Speaker 1>is go for one of these links. And

00:28:24.365 --> 00:28:26.205
<v Speaker 1>let's click on this one just as an

00:28:26.205 --> 00:28:29.110
<v Speaker 1>example. Takes me to this repository, which is

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:30.950
<v Speaker 1>I feel you build. And if I wanna

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:31.990
<v Speaker 1>change the

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:34.470
<v Speaker 1>the visibility, I just go to the danger

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:35.270
<v Speaker 1>zone. It's

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:40.470
<v Speaker 1>Let's get through this. Two factor authentication,

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:41.910
<v Speaker 1>extremely important.

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:44.605
<v Speaker 1>If you use two factor authentication,

00:28:45.005 --> 00:28:47.164
<v Speaker 1>people would have a slightly harder time

00:28:48.045 --> 00:28:51.085
<v Speaker 1>breaking into your account, stealing things, changing things.

00:28:51.165 --> 00:28:52.765
<v Speaker 1>We want to make it as difficult as

00:28:52.765 --> 00:28:54.365
<v Speaker 1>possible for people to do bad things in

00:28:54.365 --> 00:28:56.900
<v Speaker 1>your account. Now it's not just about you

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.380
<v Speaker 1>personally. If you have an organizational account,

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:02.419
<v Speaker 1>the peep the person controlling that account can

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:03.700
<v Speaker 1>essentially force

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:06.900
<v Speaker 1>everybody on that organization to use two factor

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:07.540
<v Speaker 1>authentication.

00:29:08.085 --> 00:29:10.325
<v Speaker 1>The key finding here is that no organization

00:29:10.325 --> 00:29:13.924
<v Speaker 1>has members with two factor authentication disabled,

00:29:13.924 --> 00:29:15.924
<v Speaker 1>which is a convoluted way to say

00:29:16.485 --> 00:29:18.645
<v Speaker 1>that all the people, it is access to

00:29:18.645 --> 00:29:19.364
<v Speaker 1>checking.

00:29:20.164 --> 00:29:20.725
<v Speaker 1>What was that?

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:23.750
<v Speaker 0>That was a motor breaker. I saved my

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:24.549
<v Speaker 0>window. Sorry.

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Sounded ominous.

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:30.790
<v Speaker 1>It's a convoluted way of saying that everybody

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:32.710
<v Speaker 1>has two factor authentication enabled,

00:29:34.405 --> 00:29:37.125
<v Speaker 1>and all organizations have overall enforcement, which is

00:29:37.125 --> 00:29:39.685
<v Speaker 1>good. The recommendation is is pretty much the

00:29:39.685 --> 00:29:40.245
<v Speaker 1>same.

00:29:40.885 --> 00:29:43.125
<v Speaker 1>It tells you where to go in order

00:29:43.125 --> 00:29:44.404
<v Speaker 1>to set up

00:29:44.645 --> 00:29:45.445
<v Speaker 1>your

00:29:45.525 --> 00:29:46.405
<v Speaker 1>organizational

00:29:46.405 --> 00:29:48.485
<v Speaker 1>two factor authentication or your private one if

00:29:48.485 --> 00:29:49.685
<v Speaker 1>you are not an organization.

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:52.540
<v Speaker 1>Since the link is right there and you

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.620
<v Speaker 1>can read about two factor authentication just on

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:55.900
<v Speaker 1>GitHub documentation,

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:57.419
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna, you know, explain too much

00:29:57.419 --> 00:30:00.299
<v Speaker 1>about it. Admin permissions, very simple.

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:04.154
<v Speaker 1>Admins have extensive permissions on GitHub, so you

00:30:04.154 --> 00:30:06.234
<v Speaker 1>want to keep the admin number

00:30:06.475 --> 00:30:09.274
<v Speaker 1>as small as possible, the the minimum that

00:30:09.274 --> 00:30:12.154
<v Speaker 1>is actually required. There's a lot of organizations

00:30:12.154 --> 00:30:14.154
<v Speaker 1>in which people, if they have a problem

00:30:14.154 --> 00:30:16.554
<v Speaker 1>on GitHub, we just give the the IT

00:30:16.554 --> 00:30:19.110
<v Speaker 1>department, we just give them admin permissions to

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:21.670
<v Speaker 1>get over whatever problem it is, which is

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:24.150
<v Speaker 1>wrong because admins have, like I said, extensive

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:26.950
<v Speaker 1>permissions. They can do bad bad things if

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:27.750
<v Speaker 1>unchecked.

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:30.470
<v Speaker 1>It actually shows that on Scribe demo, there

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:32.934
<v Speaker 1>are three admins. On Scribe security, there are

00:30:32.934 --> 00:30:35.095
<v Speaker 1>seven. And on Scribe security test, there are

00:30:35.095 --> 00:30:37.174
<v Speaker 1>three. Notice that mister b Lightning, which is

00:30:37.174 --> 00:30:38.294
<v Speaker 1>me personally,

00:30:38.455 --> 00:30:40.615
<v Speaker 1>is not actually represented here because it's a

00:30:40.615 --> 00:30:41.575
<v Speaker 1>private account

00:30:41.895 --> 00:30:43.575
<v Speaker 1>or actually it's not an organization.

00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:46.950
<v Speaker 1>And it this this the admin permissions is

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:49.749
<v Speaker 1>only relevant for organizations because, obviously,

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:52.070
<v Speaker 1>if if I'm the only person

00:30:52.389 --> 00:30:55.110
<v Speaker 1>that is representing mister b lightning, there's no

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:56.870
<v Speaker 1>point in checking the number of admins. It's

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:57.590
<v Speaker 1>not really relevant.

00:30:58.684 --> 00:31:00.605
<v Speaker 1>And like I said, the the recommendation is

00:31:00.605 --> 00:31:03.325
<v Speaker 1>to have the bare minimum, the the only

00:31:03.405 --> 00:31:06.125
<v Speaker 1>the actual people who need that level of

00:31:06.125 --> 00:31:07.004
<v Speaker 1>permission

00:31:07.325 --> 00:31:08.044
<v Speaker 1>added.

00:31:08.285 --> 00:31:10.525
<v Speaker 1>The next thing that GitGuard is checking is

00:31:10.525 --> 00:31:10.845
<v Speaker 1>teams.

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:13.470
<v Speaker 1>The idea is

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:16.270
<v Speaker 1>to, again, make sure that team members have

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:17.550
<v Speaker 1>only the permissions

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:19.550
<v Speaker 1>and the the the access

00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:22.510
<v Speaker 1>level that they need, nothing beyond that.

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:26.110
<v Speaker 1>Because team members can sometimes change teams or

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:26.990
<v Speaker 1>get shuffled around,

00:31:27.685 --> 00:31:30.245
<v Speaker 1>It's not people don't always make sure to

00:31:30.245 --> 00:31:30.885
<v Speaker 1>to

00:31:31.125 --> 00:31:32.005
<v Speaker 1>curb

00:31:32.325 --> 00:31:33.845
<v Speaker 1>excess access.

00:31:34.005 --> 00:31:36.165
<v Speaker 1>I know it's like a complicated sentence. The

00:31:36.165 --> 00:31:38.565
<v Speaker 1>idea here is that if a team member

00:31:38.565 --> 00:31:40.725
<v Speaker 1>changes team and needs to work on different

00:31:40.725 --> 00:31:43.960
<v Speaker 1>repositories or suddenly has a different job, make

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.680
<v Speaker 1>sure that their access level is changed accordingly.

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Again, this is more relevant, obviously, for organizational

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.240
<v Speaker 1>accounts than private ones.

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:54.040
<v Speaker 1>Collaborators is pretty much the same. You need

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:56.040
<v Speaker 1>to check your collaborators, make sure that if

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:58.365
<v Speaker 1>a person is no longer a collaborator,

00:31:58.365 --> 00:32:00.045
<v Speaker 1>you should revoke their access.

00:32:00.925 --> 00:32:03.485
<v Speaker 1>Branch protection is probably the most comprehensive thing

00:32:03.485 --> 00:32:05.805
<v Speaker 1>that we can cover. I'm not going to

00:32:05.805 --> 00:32:07.645
<v Speaker 1>go too far into it, but I will

00:32:07.645 --> 00:32:09.325
<v Speaker 1>show you what that means.

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Notice here that there are 92 branches that

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.020
<v Speaker 1>are lacking any protection rules.

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:18.220
<v Speaker 1>If you're not familiar with GitHub's branch protection

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.380
<v Speaker 1>rules, we'll take a look right here at

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:21.660
<v Speaker 1>what they look like.

00:32:25.184 --> 00:32:28.225
<v Speaker 1>Branch protection rules are one of GitHub's

00:32:28.225 --> 00:32:29.985
<v Speaker 1>best way of protecting

00:32:30.065 --> 00:32:30.945
<v Speaker 1>branches.

00:32:31.265 --> 00:32:33.585
<v Speaker 1>Obviously, the most important branch you wanna protect

00:32:33.585 --> 00:32:36.225
<v Speaker 1>is main. So, you know, if you can

00:32:36.225 --> 00:32:38.800
<v Speaker 1>just add the main name here. The things

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.200
<v Speaker 1>you can do with branch protection rules are

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:44.640
<v Speaker 1>require pull request before merging, require status checks

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:45.440
<v Speaker 1>to pass,

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.679
<v Speaker 1>require conversation resolution,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.200
<v Speaker 1>require signed commits. Very, very important to help

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:54.475
<v Speaker 1>prevent fraud because, you know, unless you know,

00:32:54.475 --> 00:32:57.595
<v Speaker 1>in case you didn't know, anybody can appear

00:32:57.595 --> 00:32:59.275
<v Speaker 1>to be anybody else on GitHub. All you

00:32:59.275 --> 00:33:01.435
<v Speaker 1>need is their username and email, and you

00:33:01.435 --> 00:33:03.435
<v Speaker 1>can appear to be somebody else. Just like

00:33:03.435 --> 00:33:04.955
<v Speaker 1>you can appear to be anybody else on

00:33:04.955 --> 00:33:07.355
<v Speaker 1>Slack. Again, very common. If you didn't know,

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.500
<v Speaker 1>check it out. It's frighteningly

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:10.220
<v Speaker 1>easy

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:12.780
<v Speaker 1>to impersonate other people on GitHub unless you

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:13.980
<v Speaker 1>use signed commits.

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:17.900
<v Speaker 1>Require linear history, require deployments to succeed. There's

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:19.980
<v Speaker 1>a whole bunch of rules here, including preventing

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:22.060
<v Speaker 1>admins from being able to circumvent these rules.

00:33:22.505 --> 00:33:24.505
<v Speaker 1>Also, you know, very useful. And just like

00:33:24.505 --> 00:33:25.545
<v Speaker 1>you can protect

00:33:26.265 --> 00:33:28.985
<v Speaker 1>main, there are also other branches you want

00:33:28.985 --> 00:33:31.225
<v Speaker 1>want you might want to protect, but this

00:33:31.225 --> 00:33:32.265
<v Speaker 1>is up to you.

00:33:32.745 --> 00:33:34.665
<v Speaker 1>Notice that the reports

00:33:34.825 --> 00:33:36.185
<v Speaker 1>only checks if there

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:38.570
<v Speaker 1>branch protection rules,

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:41.370
<v Speaker 1>any rules. It doesn't check for the presence

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:42.570
<v Speaker 1>of all of them or even some of

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:44.250
<v Speaker 1>them. So even if you have a branch

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:46.409
<v Speaker 1>protected by one single rule, whichever,

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:48.809
<v Speaker 1>it would already could be considered protected. It's

00:33:48.809 --> 00:33:51.845
<v Speaker 1>completely up to you. But having main particularly

00:33:51.845 --> 00:33:54.004
<v Speaker 1>main branches without any protection

00:33:54.325 --> 00:33:55.604
<v Speaker 1>is probably

00:33:55.605 --> 00:33:58.005
<v Speaker 1>not the best idea. And notice there are

00:33:58.005 --> 00:33:59.284
<v Speaker 1>92 branches

00:33:59.525 --> 00:34:02.960
<v Speaker 1>that I personally have never bothered protecting on

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.400
<v Speaker 1>my personal account

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.240
<v Speaker 1>because I'm an Audible.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.480
<v Speaker 1>Signed commits, I already mentioned, and it's so

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.480
<v Speaker 1>so important that we figured we wanted to

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.840
<v Speaker 1>check that separately.

00:34:15.574 --> 00:34:16.855
<v Speaker 1>Deploy keys

00:34:16.855 --> 00:34:19.734
<v Speaker 1>and SSH keys are both very important because

00:34:19.734 --> 00:34:20.775
<v Speaker 1>they enable

00:34:20.855 --> 00:34:22.215
<v Speaker 1>external

00:34:22.855 --> 00:34:25.415
<v Speaker 1>applications to access your GitHub account. So you

00:34:25.415 --> 00:34:27.895
<v Speaker 1>wanna make sure that you revoke them

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:31.719
<v Speaker 1>over time, that you rotate them over time.

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:34.440
<v Speaker 1>And, again, I I don't wanna go too

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.760
<v Speaker 1>deeply into this because you can always check

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:38.599
<v Speaker 1>it out later. Just know that this is

00:34:38.599 --> 00:34:40.520
<v Speaker 1>part of the report. So even if you

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.545
<v Speaker 1>forgot about some deploy key or SSH key

00:34:43.545 --> 00:34:45.705
<v Speaker 1>that you previously set up for whatever reason,

00:34:45.864 --> 00:34:48.585
<v Speaker 1>this will remind you of it. So we're

00:34:48.585 --> 00:34:50.265
<v Speaker 1>already about half an hour in,

00:34:50.505 --> 00:34:51.705
<v Speaker 1>and I showed you

00:34:52.105 --> 00:34:53.465
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the reports.

00:34:53.705 --> 00:34:55.679
<v Speaker 1>And I think, you know, even if you

00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:58.080
<v Speaker 1>had no idea what you could use this

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.160
<v Speaker 1>for, you can see that it's incredibly fine

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:00.800
<v Speaker 1>grained.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.560
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that there are links here

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.320
<v Speaker 1>to enable you to go exactly to where

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.320
<v Speaker 1>you need to go to do what you

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.920
<v Speaker 1>would theoretically want to do with

00:35:08.525 --> 00:35:10.925
<v Speaker 1>and and learn about it is quite useful.

00:35:10.925 --> 00:35:12.445
<v Speaker 1>And, again, the fact that it appears in

00:35:12.445 --> 00:35:14.205
<v Speaker 1>the gist is also quite useful.

00:35:14.525 --> 00:35:16.045
<v Speaker 1>And if you wanna use

00:35:16.125 --> 00:35:18.925
<v Speaker 1>the the JSON for a machine readable file

00:35:18.925 --> 00:35:20.685
<v Speaker 1>to send it wherever, you can also do

00:35:20.685 --> 00:35:23.200
<v Speaker 1>that. So this is the basic level

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:25.120
<v Speaker 1>of the GitHub

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:28.080
<v Speaker 1>currently, GitHub security posture report.

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.360
<v Speaker 1>Like I said, more relevant to organizational

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.915
<v Speaker 1>accounts than private accounts, but even if you're

00:35:33.915 --> 00:35:35.675
<v Speaker 1>a private account, you can still learn something.

00:35:35.835 --> 00:35:38.155
<v Speaker 1>For example, even if you, for for example,

00:35:38.155 --> 00:35:41.755
<v Speaker 1>were a collaborator or have some access to

00:35:41.755 --> 00:35:43.915
<v Speaker 1>some organization, you'll be able to see the

00:35:43.915 --> 00:35:46.315
<v Speaker 1>information on that as well as as as

00:35:46.315 --> 00:35:47.435
<v Speaker 1>far as it pertains

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:49.790
<v Speaker 1>to you or, you know, the the things

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:51.150
<v Speaker 1>that you have access to.

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:52.350
<v Speaker 1>I

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:54.990
<v Speaker 1>will now stop sharing so we can go

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:56.030
<v Speaker 1>back to seeing

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:57.310
<v Speaker 1>where you are.

00:35:58.270 --> 00:35:58.910
<v Speaker 1>So

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:01.470
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if that report finished.

00:36:02.115 --> 00:36:04.275
<v Speaker 0>It did finish. I even ran it again

00:36:04.275 --> 00:36:06.115
<v Speaker 0>and put it through JQ so we could

00:36:06.115 --> 00:36:07.715
<v Speaker 0>get better color as well. So

00:36:08.355 --> 00:36:09.395
<v Speaker 0>we have

00:36:10.115 --> 00:36:11.315
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Lots.

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.590
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:17.390
<v Speaker 0>Yep. It's chunky. And and and yeah. You

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:19.390
<v Speaker 1>can see yeah. You can see that seeing

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:20.430
<v Speaker 1>it as a

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:23.550
<v Speaker 1>as a JSON is definitely not as

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:25.230
<v Speaker 1>user friendly.

00:36:26.225 --> 00:36:27.985
<v Speaker 1>You can learn a lot from the JSON.

00:36:27.985 --> 00:36:30.225
<v Speaker 1>Obviously, there's a lot of information there.

00:36:30.545 --> 00:36:32.225
<v Speaker 1>It's just not as

00:36:32.865 --> 00:36:33.825
<v Speaker 1>readable,

00:36:34.305 --> 00:36:36.545
<v Speaker 1>at least not immediately. If you're experienced, you

00:36:36.545 --> 00:36:37.425
<v Speaker 1>can definitely

00:36:37.585 --> 00:36:40.410
<v Speaker 1>read it pretty easily. But I believe that

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:41.290
<v Speaker 1>the gist

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:45.050
<v Speaker 1>solution is is quite handy. That's why I

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:48.090
<v Speaker 1>requested it so that anybody can look at

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:50.730
<v Speaker 1>the at the markdown report and and be

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:51.850
<v Speaker 1>able to immediately

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:53.930
<v Speaker 1>understand what was happening even if they didn't

00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:55.255
<v Speaker 1>have any

00:36:55.655 --> 00:36:56.855
<v Speaker 1>too heavily

00:36:57.575 --> 00:37:00.055
<v Speaker 1>developing background that are not that familiar with

00:37:00.055 --> 00:37:01.495
<v Speaker 1>reading JSON files.

00:37:02.055 --> 00:37:03.655
<v Speaker 1>So like I said, this is the basic

00:37:03.655 --> 00:37:06.055
<v Speaker 1>level, the the easiest, most immediate thing that

00:37:06.055 --> 00:37:07.895
<v Speaker 1>you can do with GitGat. It doesn't require

00:37:07.895 --> 00:37:09.655
<v Speaker 1>almost anything other than having

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.740
<v Speaker 1>the token which you created for it. You

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:14.900
<v Speaker 1>know, handily, it didn't even take you five

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:17.700
<v Speaker 1>minutes. And running the report, again, it could

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:20.180
<v Speaker 1>take longer depending on how complicated your GitHub

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:22.820
<v Speaker 1>account is, but it's not no. It it

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:24.660
<v Speaker 1>doesn't take minutes or hours to run the

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:26.595
<v Speaker 1>report. And now that you have this JSON

00:37:26.595 --> 00:37:27.875
<v Speaker 1>file, you can keep it and use it

00:37:27.875 --> 00:37:29.155
<v Speaker 1>as a reference to,

00:37:29.875 --> 00:37:32.195
<v Speaker 1>you know, what happens in your account over

00:37:32.195 --> 00:37:32.755
<v Speaker 1>time.

00:37:33.395 --> 00:37:35.475
<v Speaker 0>Sure. Now that we said over time,

00:37:35.795 --> 00:37:36.755
<v Speaker 1>let's

00:37:37.075 --> 00:37:37.555
<v Speaker 1>jump.

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:40.840
<v Speaker 0>Well, I don't know if you're about to

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:42.280
<v Speaker 0>go into something I was about to ask

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.520
<v Speaker 0>you ask you about. Yeah. Sorry.

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.000
<v Speaker 0>Don't know. It's Sure. Ask ask ask away.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.160
<v Speaker 0>I think my latency is is bad today.

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:50.280
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure what's going on. Like, even

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:52.360
<v Speaker 0>my camera, I can see myself lagging behind.

00:37:53.225 --> 00:37:55.305
<v Speaker 0>Anyway, we're not gonna worry about that.

00:37:56.985 --> 00:37:57.785
<v Speaker 0>You know, the

00:37:58.505 --> 00:37:59.385
<v Speaker 0>JSON

00:37:59.545 --> 00:38:00.985
<v Speaker 0>is great. Right? So I I don't have

00:38:00.985 --> 00:38:03.465
<v Speaker 0>kind of machine programmatic access to be able

00:38:03.465 --> 00:38:04.825
<v Speaker 0>to do things with this that that I

00:38:04.825 --> 00:38:06.905
<v Speaker 0>want, which I think is really interesting. The

00:38:06.905 --> 00:38:10.150
<v Speaker 0>guest is just sorry. It's even it's much

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:11.110
<v Speaker 0>more consumable

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:13.590
<v Speaker 0>for humans. And then you mentioned over time,

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:14.790
<v Speaker 0>which is great because the thing I was

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:17.350
<v Speaker 0>thinking about as well. If I run this,

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:19.910
<v Speaker 0>say every day, every week, every month, whatever

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:22.045
<v Speaker 0>that cadence is going to be, is that

00:38:22.045 --> 00:38:24.445
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna wanna track improvement. It's like, we

00:38:24.445 --> 00:38:25.565
<v Speaker 0>have the ability

00:38:25.725 --> 00:38:27.965
<v Speaker 0>is is any of this exported as metrics?

00:38:27.965 --> 00:38:30.845
<v Speaker 0>Like, could I build a Grafana previous dashboard

00:38:30.845 --> 00:38:32.685
<v Speaker 0>from some of this information? Is that something

00:38:32.685 --> 00:38:33.405
<v Speaker 0>that's possible today?

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:36.490
<v Speaker 1>You could definitely do that as long as

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:37.770
<v Speaker 1>you, you know, as long as you have

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:39.130
<v Speaker 1>access to the information,

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:42.170
<v Speaker 1>which is why the next part of running

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:44.090
<v Speaker 1>it continuously requires you to

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:45.530
<v Speaker 1>fork

00:38:45.609 --> 00:38:48.845
<v Speaker 1>GitGap, putting it on your personal GitHub account,

00:38:48.845 --> 00:38:50.445
<v Speaker 1>and then using

00:38:51.405 --> 00:38:53.724
<v Speaker 1>a workflow to run it continuously, which is

00:38:53.724 --> 00:38:55.805
<v Speaker 1>what we're going to do now to show

00:38:55.805 --> 00:38:58.204
<v Speaker 1>how easy it is. And, obviously, once you

00:38:58.204 --> 00:38:58.845
<v Speaker 1>have

00:38:59.484 --> 00:39:02.289
<v Speaker 1>a workflow and GitGat in as part of

00:39:02.289 --> 00:39:03.970
<v Speaker 1>your GitHub, you can do whatever you want

00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:04.930
<v Speaker 1>with the information.

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:06.369
<v Speaker 1>You can

00:39:06.849 --> 00:39:09.650
<v Speaker 1>export the files. You can save them in

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:09.970
<v Speaker 1>in

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:12.930
<v Speaker 1>either on GitHub or on your own machine.

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Do whatever you want with them.

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:17.045
<v Speaker 1>But what again, once you have it on

00:39:17.045 --> 00:39:19.205
<v Speaker 1>your own GitHub and you start working with

00:39:19.205 --> 00:39:21.125
<v Speaker 1>the workflow and with the state, which is

00:39:21.125 --> 00:39:22.805
<v Speaker 1>where we're going to get to the state

00:39:22.805 --> 00:39:23.445
<v Speaker 1>later

00:39:24.085 --> 00:39:26.485
<v Speaker 1>after I explain how to run it continuously,

00:39:26.725 --> 00:39:28.405
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that, like you said, there's a

00:39:28.405 --> 00:39:29.525
<v Speaker 1>lot more options

00:39:30.325 --> 00:39:32.085
<v Speaker 1>and a lot you can play with.

00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:36.109
<v Speaker 1>Let's start with showing you how to run

00:39:36.109 --> 00:39:38.270
<v Speaker 1>it continuously because I feel like it's an

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:38.830
<v Speaker 1>important

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:40.510
<v Speaker 1>advancement

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:43.069
<v Speaker 1>over running it once, seeing the report saying,

00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:44.589
<v Speaker 1>hey. That's cool, and then forgetting about it.

00:39:44.835 --> 00:39:46.515
<v Speaker 1>So let's let's see how to run it

00:39:46.515 --> 00:39:47.395
<v Speaker 1>continuously.

00:39:47.714 --> 00:39:48.355
<v Speaker 1>So

00:39:49.395 --> 00:39:51.715
<v Speaker 1>fork GitGat over to your GitHub.

00:39:57.315 --> 00:39:57.875
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:04.110
<v Speaker 0>And should I run it on the organization?

00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:10.510
<v Speaker 1>Again, as long sure. Sure.

00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:12.670
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't it doesn't really matter as long

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:15.155
<v Speaker 1>as it's on your GitHub. Because remember,

00:40:15.795 --> 00:40:18.275
<v Speaker 1>you already created an access token, and we're

00:40:18.275 --> 00:40:20.035
<v Speaker 1>going to use that access token

00:40:20.515 --> 00:40:21.235
<v Speaker 1>in

00:40:21.795 --> 00:40:24.355
<v Speaker 1>your, essentially, copy of GitGat.

00:40:24.355 --> 00:40:26.355
<v Speaker 1>So now that you have GitGat as part

00:40:26.355 --> 00:40:27.955
<v Speaker 1>of Rawkode Academy,

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:30.230
<v Speaker 1>yep, you go to settings.

00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:40.310
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming we're adding Settings and then essentially,

00:40:41.474 --> 00:40:42.035
<v Speaker 1>yeah,

00:40:42.755 --> 00:40:44.515
<v Speaker 1>essentially, you're you're adding

00:40:44.914 --> 00:40:45.795
<v Speaker 1>a new

00:40:46.835 --> 00:40:48.915
<v Speaker 1>a new repository secret.

00:40:49.394 --> 00:40:51.315
<v Speaker 0>So is this some like, when you run

00:40:51.315 --> 00:40:53.155
<v Speaker 0>a GitHub action, you actually get

00:40:53.634 --> 00:40:54.434
<v Speaker 0>ephemeral

00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:56.110
<v Speaker 0>GitHub

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:58.430
<v Speaker 0>token available and you can tweak the permissions

00:40:58.430 --> 00:41:01.150
<v Speaker 0>inside of the the run. But I I

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:03.310
<v Speaker 0>don't know if that's scoped purely to, like,

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:05.950
<v Speaker 0>the repository itself or if you can elevate

00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:07.310
<v Speaker 0>it to the organization.

00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:08.670
<v Speaker 0>But that that could be something fun to

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:10.994
<v Speaker 0>experiment with as well, actually. Like I said,

00:41:10.994 --> 00:41:13.955
<v Speaker 1>you can actually run the report

00:41:14.115 --> 00:41:16.115
<v Speaker 1>on a particular repository

00:41:16.275 --> 00:41:18.994
<v Speaker 1>or even if you want to, one particular

00:41:18.994 --> 00:41:21.075
<v Speaker 1>folder or or particular

00:41:21.075 --> 00:41:21.795
<v Speaker 1>files.

00:41:22.035 --> 00:41:24.435
<v Speaker 1>But I feel like that it's more

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:28.560
<v Speaker 1>useful to run it over an entire organization

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:29.600
<v Speaker 1>unless

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.880
<v Speaker 1>once I, you know, introduce you to the

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.360
<v Speaker 1>idea of state, unless the state

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:37.600
<v Speaker 1>is significantly

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:39.760
<v Speaker 1>different enough between different repositories

00:41:39.795 --> 00:41:41.474
<v Speaker 1>that you wanna have a different report for

00:41:41.474 --> 00:41:42.515
<v Speaker 1>each repository,

00:41:42.674 --> 00:41:44.595
<v Speaker 1>and you can do that. You can you

00:41:44.595 --> 00:41:45.155
<v Speaker 1>can

00:41:45.474 --> 00:41:46.115
<v Speaker 1>have

00:41:46.355 --> 00:41:49.555
<v Speaker 1>separate workflows running, get the a different GitKat

00:41:49.555 --> 00:41:52.035
<v Speaker 1>report on different repositories with different states,

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:55.090
<v Speaker 1>Slightly more work intensive to do or to

00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:56.690
<v Speaker 1>set up, but once you set it up,

00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:57.970
<v Speaker 1>it would continuously

00:41:57.970 --> 00:42:00.210
<v Speaker 1>run however you set it up, and you

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:02.450
<v Speaker 1>can always modify the state to get whatever

00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:05.250
<v Speaker 1>results you're you're after. But we haven't gotten

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:08.045
<v Speaker 1>into state yet, So let's concentrate

00:42:08.045 --> 00:42:10.285
<v Speaker 1>on getting this to work. You already set

00:42:10.285 --> 00:42:11.965
<v Speaker 1>up the the g h token.

00:42:12.125 --> 00:42:13.565
<v Speaker 1>Yep. So now

00:42:13.885 --> 00:42:15.724
<v Speaker 1>or I believe you did. I I might

00:42:15.724 --> 00:42:17.484
<v Speaker 1>have missed it because I was talking.

00:42:17.964 --> 00:42:19.724
<v Speaker 1>Now that you did, you go to actions.

00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:24.690
<v Speaker 1>In the the token, you you copied the

00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:26.610
<v Speaker 1>the same token you had earlier. Right? That's

00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:27.410
<v Speaker 0>correct. Yeah.

00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Great. That's exactly the token you needed. So

00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:33.170
<v Speaker 1>now you go into

00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:33.970
<v Speaker 1>actions.

00:42:36.315 --> 00:42:38.315
<v Speaker 1>Not not here. No. On the top. On

00:42:38.315 --> 00:42:40.155
<v Speaker 1>the top line, there's actions there. Yep. That's

00:42:40.155 --> 00:42:40.795
<v Speaker 1>the one.

00:42:41.595 --> 00:42:43.115
<v Speaker 1>Yep. You understand.

00:42:46.155 --> 00:42:48.795
<v Speaker 1>Right. Now on the left side,

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:51.670
<v Speaker 1>continuously run GitGap.

00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:56.550
<v Speaker 1>Now the first time you run it, it'll

00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:58.390
<v Speaker 1>just, you know, just to see that you've

00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:00.470
<v Speaker 1>run it, that everything is fine. You can

00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:01.910
<v Speaker 1>see on the right there, run

00:43:03.015 --> 00:43:04.055
<v Speaker 1>the workflow.

00:43:04.615 --> 00:43:05.975
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Run it.

00:43:09.895 --> 00:43:12.214
<v Speaker 1>So now it's running. And, you know, like

00:43:12.214 --> 00:43:13.974
<v Speaker 1>we saw earlier, it might take a while,

00:43:13.974 --> 00:43:15.575
<v Speaker 1>but because you now have it as a

00:43:15.575 --> 00:43:17.575
<v Speaker 1>as a workflow there, now it's running,

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:20.750
<v Speaker 1>it will take as as much time as

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:23.070
<v Speaker 1>as needed. But now that you have it

00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:24.510
<v Speaker 1>as part of a workflow,

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:27.790
<v Speaker 1>you can well, obviously, now it's running once.

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:29.070
<v Speaker 1>But if you want to,

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:29.950
<v Speaker 1>you can

00:43:30.725 --> 00:43:32.485
<v Speaker 1>set it up as a Chrome job. So

00:43:32.485 --> 00:43:34.965
<v Speaker 1>in order to set up currently

00:43:35.205 --> 00:43:37.365
<v Speaker 1>and the easiest way to do this as

00:43:37.365 --> 00:43:39.925
<v Speaker 1>as something that runs continuously, you go to

00:43:39.925 --> 00:43:40.645
<v Speaker 1>code.

00:43:41.125 --> 00:43:42.965
<v Speaker 1>I see that it didn't finish for whatever

00:43:42.965 --> 00:43:44.805
<v Speaker 1>reason, but we can worry about that later.

00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:46.150
<v Speaker 1>Go to code,

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:47.270
<v Speaker 1>which is the

00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:48.390
<v Speaker 1>leftmost

00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:49.510
<v Speaker 1>marker there.

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:53.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And the top folder is now

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:55.110
<v Speaker 1>GitHub workflows.

00:43:58.955 --> 00:44:01.515
<v Speaker 1>And the top one is right. Yep.

00:44:02.235 --> 00:44:04.075
<v Speaker 1>And you can see

00:44:04.635 --> 00:44:07.515
<v Speaker 1>that in order to make this run continuously,

00:44:07.515 --> 00:44:09.515
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do is remove the

00:44:09.515 --> 00:44:12.390
<v Speaker 1>commenting on the those two lines. Not the

00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:13.589
<v Speaker 1>top one because

00:44:13.589 --> 00:44:15.589
<v Speaker 1>it tells you to, you know, remove the

00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:16.710
<v Speaker 1>next two. Right?

00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:19.829
<v Speaker 1>And if you remove the commenting on the

00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:20.550
<v Speaker 1>schedule

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:21.670
<v Speaker 1>and

00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:25.750
<v Speaker 1>yeah. Essentially, you run every 23.

00:44:28.704 --> 00:44:30.545
<v Speaker 1>Now this, again, it's we try to make

00:44:30.545 --> 00:44:32.865
<v Speaker 1>it as easy, as simple as possible for

00:44:32.865 --> 00:44:35.505
<v Speaker 1>people to who didn't understand too much about

00:44:35.505 --> 00:44:38.305
<v Speaker 1>this to do this relatively easily.

00:44:39.105 --> 00:44:40.145
<v Speaker 1>If you are not

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.480
<v Speaker 1>familiar with

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:45.200
<v Speaker 1>Chrome or how to set up

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:48.480
<v Speaker 1>Chrome jobs and stuff like that, I'm now

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.760
<v Speaker 1>sending a link to David, and and hopefully,

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:52.960
<v Speaker 1>he can show it on screen

00:44:54.515 --> 00:44:57.715
<v Speaker 1>that you can essentially use that link just

00:44:57.715 --> 00:44:58.915
<v Speaker 1>to specify

00:44:58.915 --> 00:44:59.715
<v Speaker 1>whatever

00:45:01.555 --> 00:45:02.435
<v Speaker 1>whatever

00:45:02.835 --> 00:45:04.275
<v Speaker 1>iteration you want,

00:45:05.075 --> 00:45:06.995
<v Speaker 1>and it will show you how to

00:45:07.315 --> 00:45:09.715
<v Speaker 1>specify that

00:45:08.829 --> 00:45:10.990
<v Speaker 1>in a Chrome, you know, manner.

00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:15.470
<v Speaker 1>You can set up the you can you

00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:16.589
<v Speaker 1>can tell it to to run at a

00:45:16.589 --> 00:45:19.470
<v Speaker 1>specific date, specific time, every so and so

00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:21.550
<v Speaker 1>time. There this

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:22.829
<v Speaker 1>is just one that I found. I'm sure

00:45:22.829 --> 00:45:25.615
<v Speaker 1>there are others either more useful or or

00:45:25.615 --> 00:45:28.015
<v Speaker 1>more fun or whatever. But even if you

00:45:28.015 --> 00:45:30.174
<v Speaker 1>have absolutely no idea about how to set

00:45:30.174 --> 00:45:31.694
<v Speaker 1>up a Cron job, you can find one

00:45:31.694 --> 00:45:33.135
<v Speaker 1>of these sites or this one

00:45:33.454 --> 00:45:35.775
<v Speaker 1>and and figure out the

00:45:36.174 --> 00:45:38.575
<v Speaker 1>the iteration that you wanted to run it.

00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:41.770
<v Speaker 1>And now that you have that, you essentially

00:45:42.010 --> 00:45:44.570
<v Speaker 1>have a way of running GitGat continuously.

00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Once it's it is done continuously, you will

00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:50.890
<v Speaker 1>always get the the results

00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:52.810
<v Speaker 1>presumably in your gist if you set it

00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:53.290
<v Speaker 1>up that way.

00:45:54.055 --> 00:45:57.415
<v Speaker 1>And, also, it enables you to start working

00:45:57.415 --> 00:45:59.575
<v Speaker 1>with a state. Now before we go into

00:45:59.575 --> 00:46:00.295
<v Speaker 1>a state,

00:46:01.255 --> 00:46:03.095
<v Speaker 1>any questions so far?

00:46:05.175 --> 00:46:07.575
<v Speaker 0>No. I think I understand what's happening.

00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:10.330
<v Speaker 0>I'm curious of why

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:12.490
<v Speaker 0>my run failed.

00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:14.970
<v Speaker 1>It didn't it didn't yeah.

00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:18.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I can't really see it clearly enough

00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:19.930
<v Speaker 1>to be able to tell. Yeah. There's no

00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:22.650
<v Speaker 0>error message. It just says process completed with

00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:23.930
<v Speaker 0>exit code 125.

00:46:25.185 --> 00:46:26.785
<v Speaker 0>But there's no error message. I

00:46:27.265 --> 00:46:27.825
<v Speaker 1>can

00:46:28.065 --> 00:46:30.705
<v Speaker 1>yeah. I'll I'll ask the developer

00:46:30.785 --> 00:46:31.505
<v Speaker 1>who

00:46:32.145 --> 00:46:34.545
<v Speaker 1>who wrote it what 125 is.

00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:39.070
<v Speaker 1>Since, like I said, I didn't write the

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:41.310
<v Speaker 1>code myself, since I didn't, I don't really

00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:42.030
<v Speaker 1>remember

00:46:42.110 --> 00:46:44.830
<v Speaker 1>what 125 is, but I can definitely ask.

00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:47.230
<v Speaker 1>And we can add it as a comment

00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:48.270
<v Speaker 1>once the

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:50.830
<v Speaker 1>the stream is is done

00:46:51.405 --> 00:46:53.085
<v Speaker 1>because I don't know if he's available right

00:46:53.085 --> 00:46:55.485
<v Speaker 1>now. In case, you know, our viewers are

00:46:55.485 --> 00:46:58.125
<v Speaker 1>not aware, it is now about 07:00 in

00:46:58.125 --> 00:47:01.005
<v Speaker 1>the evening where I am, so most people

00:47:01.005 --> 00:47:02.845
<v Speaker 1>are no longer at the office or available.

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:05.980
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So But, yeah, we we try to

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:07.100
<v Speaker 0>variable possible

00:47:07.579 --> 00:47:09.420
<v Speaker 1>to for for new people to

00:47:10.859 --> 00:47:11.580
<v Speaker 1>mhmm.

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:14.299
<v Speaker 0>So and Again, I can't see the the

00:47:14.299 --> 00:47:15.260
<v Speaker 1>the screen clearly.

00:47:16.425 --> 00:47:17.145
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:47:17.705 --> 00:47:20.265
<v Speaker 0>Variable inside of the GitHub action is GitHub

00:47:20.265 --> 00:47:22.825
<v Speaker 0>secret rather than g h token.

00:47:23.145 --> 00:47:24.425
<v Speaker 0>Well, let's let's see if I can fix

00:47:24.425 --> 00:47:26.985
<v Speaker 0>this. It should be g h token. Sure.

00:47:26.985 --> 00:47:28.425
<v Speaker 1>I I I ran it like I said,

00:47:28.425 --> 00:47:29.865
<v Speaker 1>I ran it everything earlier

00:47:30.119 --> 00:47:32.039
<v Speaker 1>and it seemed to have worked fine. I

00:47:32.039 --> 00:47:33.960
<v Speaker 1>don't know why it didn't. Okay. Can't rename

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:36.839
<v Speaker 0>them. Okay. Let's add a new one. You

00:47:36.839 --> 00:47:38.920
<v Speaker 1>can create a new one. Yeah.

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:40.200
<v Speaker 0>GitHub

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.240
<v Speaker 0>secret.

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:42.440
<v Speaker 0>And is it still on my buffer?

00:47:43.095 --> 00:47:43.735
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:47:44.215 --> 00:47:46.135
<v Speaker 0>Let me grab that from up here.

00:47:47.095 --> 00:47:48.295
<v Speaker 0>I don't know why I'm hiding it. I

00:47:48.295 --> 00:47:50.215
<v Speaker 0>mean, I'm done this pasting directly in front

00:47:50.215 --> 00:47:52.535
<v Speaker 0>of everybody. We already showed it. Yeah. We

00:47:52.535 --> 00:47:53.575
<v Speaker 1>already showed it.

00:47:53.975 --> 00:47:58.455
<v Speaker 1>Like, I I highly recommend you disable it

00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:58.900
<v Speaker 1>as soon as the stream is done. Oh,

00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:01.460
<v Speaker 0>we can't start it. It's GitHub.

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:05.220
<v Speaker 0>Let's check out this actually. You just go

00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:06.420
<v Speaker 1>to actions. Yeah.

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:08.180
<v Speaker 1>You just go to actions and run it

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:09.860
<v Speaker 1>again. You can always go to actions. Oh,

00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:11.220
<v Speaker 0>alright. Okay. Yeah. The

00:48:12.355 --> 00:48:14.755
<v Speaker 0>g h secret, not g h token. Okay.

00:48:14.915 --> 00:48:17.235
<v Speaker 0>Now we're okay. Now I can fix this.

00:48:22.675 --> 00:48:23.555
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Okay.

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.320
<v Speaker 0>But you probably told me to do that,

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.160
<v Speaker 0>and I probably just I I yeah. It

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:30.400
<v Speaker 1>was supposed to be the yeah. Like

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:32.720
<v Speaker 1>I said, I'm I'm looking at several things

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.760
<v Speaker 1>at the same time, so must have missed

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:38.240
<v Speaker 1>it. Alright. So let's run that again.

00:48:39.775 --> 00:48:40.895
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's Yeah.

00:48:44.495 --> 00:48:46.255
<v Speaker 0>And this triggered the manual

00:48:46.495 --> 00:48:48.495
<v Speaker 0>run. Yeah. Mhmm.

00:48:50.095 --> 00:48:51.535
<v Speaker 0>And we'll give that just a moment. So

00:48:51.535 --> 00:48:53.609
<v Speaker 0>hopefully that runs a bit better. But maybe,

00:48:53.609 --> 00:48:55.930
<v Speaker 0>well, that does hopefully run. You can tell

00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:57.290
<v Speaker 0>us a little bit about

00:48:57.529 --> 00:48:58.250
<v Speaker 0>state.

00:48:58.809 --> 00:49:00.730
<v Speaker 1>Sure. Sure. I would love to.

00:49:02.329 --> 00:49:04.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay. The idea behind state

00:49:04.809 --> 00:49:05.450
<v Speaker 1>is

00:49:05.849 --> 00:49:07.769
<v Speaker 1>we wanted to enable people

00:49:08.705 --> 00:49:10.385
<v Speaker 1>to tell the report

00:49:10.545 --> 00:49:12.065
<v Speaker 1>what they're interested in,

00:49:12.545 --> 00:49:14.945
<v Speaker 1>what things they no longer want to hear

00:49:14.945 --> 00:49:16.545
<v Speaker 1>about because they're fine,

00:49:17.025 --> 00:49:19.025
<v Speaker 1>and being able to tell the report essentially

00:49:19.025 --> 00:49:21.425
<v Speaker 1>various things that they want to pay particular

00:49:21.425 --> 00:49:23.985
<v Speaker 1>attention to. What does that mean? Well, let's

00:49:23.985 --> 00:49:27.050
<v Speaker 1>say let's take the the my report that

00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:28.810
<v Speaker 1>I showed you earlier as an example.

00:49:29.290 --> 00:49:32.010
<v Speaker 1>It said that there are 30 repositories

00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:33.450
<v Speaker 1>that are

00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:35.370
<v Speaker 1>currently public.

00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:38.090
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that this is the fifth time

00:49:38.090 --> 00:49:40.365
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting the report, and it keeps telling

00:49:40.365 --> 00:49:41.965
<v Speaker 1>me the exact same thing. Now I know

00:49:41.965 --> 00:49:43.965
<v Speaker 1>about these third wave repositories. I know they're

00:49:43.965 --> 00:49:45.885
<v Speaker 1>public. I'm fine with the fact that they're

00:49:45.885 --> 00:49:47.645
<v Speaker 1>public. If I don't wanna get the same

00:49:47.645 --> 00:49:49.645
<v Speaker 1>notification again, all I can say well, I

00:49:49.645 --> 00:49:51.325
<v Speaker 1>can go to the state and set up

00:49:51.325 --> 00:49:52.685
<v Speaker 1>these repositories

00:49:52.685 --> 00:49:53.245
<v Speaker 1>as public,

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:56.510
<v Speaker 1>And, essentially, everything in the state is fine.

00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:57.870
<v Speaker 1>It's it's how it's supposed to be. So

00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:00.350
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't alert me once again to things

00:50:00.350 --> 00:50:02.670
<v Speaker 1>that I've already told them is fine. Now

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:03.630
<v Speaker 1>it's particularly

00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:06.430
<v Speaker 1>relevant if you're in a big organization and

00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:09.235
<v Speaker 1>you have not a couple of dozen repositories,

00:50:09.235 --> 00:50:11.555
<v Speaker 1>but a couple hundreds or more repositories and

00:50:11.555 --> 00:50:14.755
<v Speaker 1>you have hunt potentially hundreds of people, including

00:50:14.755 --> 00:50:15.635
<v Speaker 1>collaborators,

00:50:15.635 --> 00:50:16.755
<v Speaker 1>including teams,

00:50:16.915 --> 00:50:18.275
<v Speaker 1>including admins,

00:50:18.355 --> 00:50:20.915
<v Speaker 1>and going over all the information all the

00:50:20.915 --> 00:50:23.130
<v Speaker 1>time is extremely tiring. I see that the

00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:25.290
<v Speaker 1>report finished successfully this time.

00:50:27.369 --> 00:50:29.450
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is, again, once you get

00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:31.690
<v Speaker 1>the report and you check everything,

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:33.609
<v Speaker 1>you fix whatever you wanted to fix, and

00:50:33.609 --> 00:50:35.210
<v Speaker 1>you have a basic state

00:50:35.545 --> 00:50:36.985
<v Speaker 1>of, you know, your

00:50:37.385 --> 00:50:40.025
<v Speaker 1>security posture that you want to keep it

00:50:40.025 --> 00:50:42.505
<v Speaker 1>that way. You put everything in the state,

00:50:42.505 --> 00:50:43.865
<v Speaker 1>which you can do because,

00:50:44.025 --> 00:50:46.105
<v Speaker 1>essentially, the state is just a JSON file,

00:50:46.105 --> 00:50:47.145
<v Speaker 1>and you can copy

00:50:47.545 --> 00:50:50.280
<v Speaker 1>the things that you want into it from

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:52.680
<v Speaker 1>the report that you got as a JSON.

00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Once you put the stuff in the state,

00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:56.680
<v Speaker 1>which, you know, I'll I'll show you some

00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:58.040
<v Speaker 1>of the basic stuff later,

00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:00.040
<v Speaker 1>once you copy stuff into the state, all

00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:01.720
<v Speaker 1>the stuff that is in there, you will

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:04.175
<v Speaker 1>no longer get in the report. It's fine.

00:51:04.255 --> 00:51:06.575
<v Speaker 1>That means that once you set up the

00:51:06.575 --> 00:51:08.495
<v Speaker 1>state and you run the report continuously,

00:51:08.655 --> 00:51:10.735
<v Speaker 1>all the the only things you will get

00:51:11.055 --> 00:51:12.255
<v Speaker 1>are the deltas.

00:51:12.575 --> 00:51:13.775
<v Speaker 1>What is different

00:51:13.855 --> 00:51:16.415
<v Speaker 1>from the state? Let's say you added more

00:51:16.415 --> 00:51:17.215
<v Speaker 1>repositories,

00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:20.460
<v Speaker 1>added more team members, more admins,

00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:23.740
<v Speaker 1>people that have somehow failed, disabled

00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:26.380
<v Speaker 1>their multifactor authentication,

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:29.980
<v Speaker 1>disabled their signed commits, various things

00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:31.180
<v Speaker 1>that are new.

00:51:32.405 --> 00:51:34.405
<v Speaker 1>That makes the report a lot shorter and

00:51:34.405 --> 00:51:36.964
<v Speaker 1>a lot easier to work with than seeing

00:51:36.964 --> 00:51:38.885
<v Speaker 1>a gigantic organizational

00:51:38.885 --> 00:51:40.165
<v Speaker 1>GitHub account

00:51:40.565 --> 00:51:43.205
<v Speaker 1>report every single time. So the first thing

00:51:43.205 --> 00:51:45.045
<v Speaker 1>that the state is for is to enable

00:51:45.045 --> 00:51:45.605
<v Speaker 1>you to work,

00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:48.430
<v Speaker 1>you know, make your work a lot easier.

00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:50.430
<v Speaker 1>And the second thing is to use it

00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:52.350
<v Speaker 1>to set up specific

00:51:53.070 --> 00:51:54.990
<v Speaker 1>use cases, but, you know, we'll get to

00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:56.430
<v Speaker 1>that possibly later.

00:51:56.830 --> 00:51:59.390
<v Speaker 1>So let's now that I, you know, basically

00:51:59.390 --> 00:52:01.390
<v Speaker 1>explained what the state is and because the

00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:04.005
<v Speaker 1>report has run successfully and you've set up

00:52:04.085 --> 00:52:05.925
<v Speaker 1>the cron job to make it run every

00:52:05.925 --> 00:52:08.165
<v Speaker 1>twenty three hours currently, which is fine,

00:52:09.125 --> 00:52:11.765
<v Speaker 1>let's talk a little bit about the state

00:52:11.765 --> 00:52:13.205
<v Speaker 1>or, you know, where to

00:52:14.244 --> 00:52:16.005
<v Speaker 1>find it, where to play with it.

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:18.340
<v Speaker 1>So

00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:21.780
<v Speaker 1>if you will look in your

00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:23.540
<v Speaker 1>GitHub account

00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:26.180
<v Speaker 1>or should should I say GitGat, actually,

00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:28.740
<v Speaker 1>you will notice you can just go back

00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:29.220
<v Speaker 1>to code.

00:52:34.135 --> 00:52:36.935
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You will notice a folder called data.

00:52:39.575 --> 00:52:40.215
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:52:40.694 --> 00:52:42.295
<v Speaker 1>But in data right now,

00:52:42.535 --> 00:52:43.734
<v Speaker 1>there are two files.

00:52:44.055 --> 00:52:45.575
<v Speaker 1>One is an empty input.

00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:47.480
<v Speaker 1>Essentially,

00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:49.880
<v Speaker 1>you know, that's an example file that you

00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:50.600
<v Speaker 1>can use,

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.960
<v Speaker 1>rename, use what however you want as as

00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:56.440
<v Speaker 1>some sort of input file. We'll get to

00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:57.720
<v Speaker 1>the input later, and

00:52:58.119 --> 00:52:59.720
<v Speaker 1>there is a sample

00:53:00.425 --> 00:53:01.305
<v Speaker 1>input.

00:53:01.385 --> 00:53:03.385
<v Speaker 1>Now the sample input is there to show

00:53:03.385 --> 00:53:03.945
<v Speaker 1>you

00:53:04.585 --> 00:53:07.065
<v Speaker 1>various things that you could

00:53:07.145 --> 00:53:08.025
<v Speaker 1>theoretically

00:53:08.025 --> 00:53:10.665
<v Speaker 1>put in an input file and how they

00:53:10.665 --> 00:53:12.744
<v Speaker 1>would look. Let's open that and just, you

00:53:12.744 --> 00:53:13.865
<v Speaker 1>know, take a look at it for a

00:53:13.865 --> 00:53:14.105
<v Speaker 1>second.

00:53:17.309 --> 00:53:19.310
<v Speaker 1>Again, a JSON file.

00:53:19.869 --> 00:53:22.349
<v Speaker 1>You can see by the let me just

00:53:22.349 --> 00:53:23.950
<v Speaker 1>open it on my screen because, like I

00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:25.630
<v Speaker 1>said, I can't really look at it on

00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:27.069
<v Speaker 1>yours. Just a second.

00:53:31.605 --> 00:53:33.845
<v Speaker 1>Got the workflows. I'm going to

00:53:34.325 --> 00:53:35.445
<v Speaker 1>get to

00:53:35.445 --> 00:53:36.325
<v Speaker 1>data

00:53:36.565 --> 00:53:38.645
<v Speaker 1>to the sample input. Yeah.

00:53:39.845 --> 00:53:41.685
<v Speaker 1>Obviously, the first line that you see is

00:53:41.685 --> 00:53:42.565
<v Speaker 1>token.

00:53:43.445 --> 00:53:45.285
<v Speaker 1>It just makes it easier. You no longer

00:53:45.365 --> 00:53:47.680
<v Speaker 1>if you include that here and g h

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:49.920
<v Speaker 1>token has been, you know, defined, you no

00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:52.000
<v Speaker 1>longer have to put the the g h

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.560
<v Speaker 1>token every time you you run the report.

00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:56.320
<v Speaker 1>Organizations,

00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:58.560
<v Speaker 1>you can set up whichever organizations you want

00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:01.495
<v Speaker 1>the report to be running on. You don't

00:54:01.495 --> 00:54:02.775
<v Speaker 1>have to include all of them in case

00:54:02.775 --> 00:54:05.815
<v Speaker 1>you are a member or running several organizations.

00:54:06.375 --> 00:54:08.135
<v Speaker 1>Two factor authentication,

00:54:08.375 --> 00:54:09.175
<v Speaker 1>admins,

00:54:09.175 --> 00:54:09.895
<v Speaker 1>commits,

00:54:10.375 --> 00:54:12.215
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the stuff here is essentially

00:54:12.215 --> 00:54:15.000
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same as what we saw in

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.280
<v Speaker 1>the gist report.

00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:17.560
<v Speaker 1>So the the naming

00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.760
<v Speaker 1>conventions is pretty pretty standard, pretty easy to

00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:21.400
<v Speaker 1>follow.

00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:25.000
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I can show

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.000
<v Speaker 1>you, for example, is if you go slightly

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.360
<v Speaker 1>lower, you can see files

00:54:28.905 --> 00:54:30.185
<v Speaker 1>with permissions.

00:54:31.145 --> 00:54:33.705
<v Speaker 1>This will enable you if you want to

00:54:34.025 --> 00:54:37.385
<v Speaker 1>set up particular files which have particular

00:54:37.625 --> 00:54:38.585
<v Speaker 1>permissions

00:54:39.465 --> 00:54:42.185
<v Speaker 1>as in if somebody who is not supposed

00:54:42.185 --> 00:54:45.350
<v Speaker 1>to handle those particular files or repositories,

00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:47.510
<v Speaker 1>the report will alert to it. One of

00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:49.030
<v Speaker 1>the things that I I really need to

00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:50.870
<v Speaker 1>to stress here is that GitKat, because it

00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:52.790
<v Speaker 1>it's a read only report and it's a

00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:53.670
<v Speaker 1>report only,

00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:55.990
<v Speaker 1>it can't do anything. It can't stop, for

00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:57.590
<v Speaker 1>example, an admin

00:54:57.305 --> 00:55:00.345
<v Speaker 1>from accessing something. It can't really, you know,

00:55:00.345 --> 00:55:02.825
<v Speaker 1>make any sort of of stance on on

00:55:02.825 --> 00:55:03.705
<v Speaker 1>protecting

00:55:03.705 --> 00:55:06.105
<v Speaker 1>anything. The only thing it can do is

00:55:06.105 --> 00:55:08.185
<v Speaker 1>note when something that you didn't want happen

00:55:08.185 --> 00:55:09.225
<v Speaker 1>happen and,

00:55:09.545 --> 00:55:10.745
<v Speaker 1>you know, tell you about it in the

00:55:10.745 --> 00:55:13.390
<v Speaker 1>report. Now assuming you're running the report every

00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:13.950
<v Speaker 1>day,

00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:17.870
<v Speaker 1>let's say somebody with admin access touched something

00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:20.350
<v Speaker 1>they're not supposed to, the very next day,

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:21.950
<v Speaker 1>you'll get that in the report.

00:55:22.350 --> 00:55:22.750
<v Speaker 1>So

00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:25.070
<v Speaker 1>that's a useful thing to have. Even if

00:55:25.070 --> 00:55:26.350
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't stop it, at least you know

00:55:26.350 --> 00:55:26.670
<v Speaker 1>about it.

00:55:28.035 --> 00:55:30.355
<v Speaker 1>You have hooks here. You have teams. You

00:55:30.355 --> 00:55:31.395
<v Speaker 1>have branches.

00:55:31.395 --> 00:55:32.995
<v Speaker 1>Once again, you can you can

00:55:33.714 --> 00:55:37.474
<v Speaker 1>set particular branches to be slightly more protected

00:55:37.474 --> 00:55:38.515
<v Speaker 1>than others.

00:55:39.075 --> 00:55:40.994
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of stuff here, but because

00:55:40.994 --> 00:55:42.035
<v Speaker 1>this is an example,

00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:44.320
<v Speaker 1>you can essentially look at it and and

00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:46.960
<v Speaker 1>figure out how your input file

00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:49.119
<v Speaker 1>should look if you want to to do

00:55:49.119 --> 00:55:50.240
<v Speaker 1>something specific.

00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:51.840
<v Speaker 1>You can just play with it, run the

00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:53.360
<v Speaker 1>report, see what you get,

00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:55.359
<v Speaker 1>you know, if if you want to.

00:55:56.964 --> 00:55:58.805
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I can

00:56:00.244 --> 00:56:02.005
<v Speaker 1>show you as an example

00:56:03.045 --> 00:56:04.565
<v Speaker 1>and, again, I can I can show this

00:56:04.565 --> 00:56:06.964
<v Speaker 1>to you, but, you know, running it will

00:56:06.964 --> 00:56:08.405
<v Speaker 1>not really be

00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:11.170
<v Speaker 1>that effective because, you know, it it depends

00:56:11.170 --> 00:56:13.170
<v Speaker 1>on the the initial report that I ran

00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:14.050
<v Speaker 1>for myself?

00:56:14.930 --> 00:56:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that

00:56:16.850 --> 00:56:18.210
<v Speaker 1>Inscribe demo,

00:56:18.210 --> 00:56:20.370
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the organizations that I'm

00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:22.690
<v Speaker 1>in charge of because it's a demo, there

00:56:22.690 --> 00:56:23.490
<v Speaker 1>was a user

00:56:23.975 --> 00:56:27.095
<v Speaker 1>who didn't have two factor authentication

00:56:27.175 --> 00:56:28.615
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason.

00:56:28.855 --> 00:56:29.415
<v Speaker 1>But

00:56:29.815 --> 00:56:32.455
<v Speaker 1>that user, which I happen to know,

00:56:32.935 --> 00:56:35.095
<v Speaker 1>is is located in a different country, and

00:56:35.095 --> 00:56:36.935
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have two factor authentication

00:56:37.015 --> 00:56:38.980
<v Speaker 1>for a good reason. There's a problem with

00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:41.460
<v Speaker 1>the network. It didn't work. Whatever. It needed

00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:42.820
<v Speaker 1>to be able to access

00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:45.060
<v Speaker 1>the organizational

00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:47.540
<v Speaker 1>GitHub without two factor authentication.

00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:48.980
<v Speaker 1>Now I didn't want

00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:49.940
<v Speaker 1>to get

00:56:50.595 --> 00:56:53.235
<v Speaker 1>the reports telling me every single time that

00:56:53.235 --> 00:56:55.315
<v Speaker 1>user was problematic.

00:56:55.635 --> 00:56:56.275
<v Speaker 1>So

00:56:57.075 --> 00:56:58.195
<v Speaker 1>what I would do

00:56:59.715 --> 00:57:00.755
<v Speaker 1>let me just

00:57:01.395 --> 00:57:03.395
<v Speaker 1>write essentially, I I would write it

00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:05.740
<v Speaker 1>in your in the

00:57:06.540 --> 00:57:09.260
<v Speaker 1>in the chat, and, hopefully, you can

00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:12.619
<v Speaker 1>show that. Actually, you know what? No. I

00:57:12.619 --> 00:57:15.500
<v Speaker 1>can just show it by sharing my screen.

00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:17.260
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That would be simpler.

00:57:18.675 --> 00:57:20.275
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:57:21.635 --> 00:57:22.675
<v Speaker 1>There it is. Okay.

00:57:23.235 --> 00:57:24.915
<v Speaker 1>So this is the example I was talking

00:57:24.915 --> 00:57:27.555
<v Speaker 1>about. Obviously, the first line is token,

00:57:27.795 --> 00:57:29.955
<v Speaker 1>which is, in our case, g h token.

00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:32.890
<v Speaker 1>And in order to make sure that this

00:57:32.890 --> 00:57:35.850
<v Speaker 1>weak authenticated user, which is the example user

00:57:35.850 --> 00:57:38.490
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about, wasn't popping up on

00:57:38.490 --> 00:57:40.250
<v Speaker 1>the report every single time,

00:57:40.570 --> 00:57:42.570
<v Speaker 1>I would include TFA,

00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:46.724
<v Speaker 1>disabled members, scribe demo, this user. Now the

00:57:46.724 --> 00:57:48.724
<v Speaker 1>fact that this user is now included in

00:57:48.724 --> 00:57:49.765
<v Speaker 1>the TFA

00:57:49.765 --> 00:57:51.605
<v Speaker 1>or two factor authentication

00:57:52.565 --> 00:57:55.525
<v Speaker 1>list or or essentially, you know, TFA

00:57:56.724 --> 00:57:59.240
<v Speaker 1>section of the report means that when the

00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:01.880
<v Speaker 1>report shows that this particular user doesn't have

00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:04.040
<v Speaker 1>2FA, because it's part of the state,

00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:06.200
<v Speaker 1>he would no longer be included in the

00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:08.119
<v Speaker 1>report. This the the the state says, it's

00:58:08.119 --> 00:58:10.680
<v Speaker 1>fine. I know about it. I accepted it.

00:58:10.775 --> 00:58:12.775
<v Speaker 1>I wrote it. It's fine. I I don't

00:58:12.935 --> 00:58:14.935
<v Speaker 1>I no longer need to be alerted to

00:58:14.935 --> 00:58:17.175
<v Speaker 1>this fact every single time.

00:58:17.655 --> 00:58:18.535
<v Speaker 1>It's fine.

00:58:19.095 --> 00:58:22.055
<v Speaker 1>There are other examples that we can

00:58:22.855 --> 00:58:24.295
<v Speaker 1>like, I think I can show you. Let

00:58:24.295 --> 00:58:26.349
<v Speaker 1>me roll down a little bit. No. That

00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:29.150
<v Speaker 1>that's, like, a very, very simplified example

00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:30.350
<v Speaker 1>that shows

00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:33.230
<v Speaker 1>shows what it can do. I think that

00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:34.910
<v Speaker 1>I have a better example

00:58:35.230 --> 00:58:36.510
<v Speaker 1>a little later.

00:58:37.550 --> 00:58:40.375
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Now remember I said that we can

00:58:42.055 --> 00:58:42.855
<v Speaker 1>protect

00:58:42.934 --> 00:58:44.455
<v Speaker 1>particular files.

00:58:44.694 --> 00:58:46.535
<v Speaker 1>So this is the example for that,

00:58:46.775 --> 00:58:49.015
<v Speaker 1>for a file level permission.

00:58:49.815 --> 00:58:51.015
<v Speaker 1>In files,

00:58:51.095 --> 00:58:51.734
<v Speaker 1>permissions

00:58:52.590 --> 00:58:54.510
<v Speaker 1>in this particular

00:58:56.350 --> 00:58:57.230
<v Speaker 1>repository,

00:58:57.790 --> 00:58:58.990
<v Speaker 1>the README

00:58:59.070 --> 00:59:00.350
<v Speaker 1>MD file

00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:04.270
<v Speaker 1>can be accessed by these author authors and

00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:05.630
<v Speaker 1>these committers.

00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:06.350
<v Speaker 1>Essentially,

00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:07.710
<v Speaker 1>both these are

00:59:08.555 --> 00:59:10.394
<v Speaker 1>an array, so I can have this as

00:59:10.394 --> 00:59:12.234
<v Speaker 1>a as a, you know, as many as

00:59:12.234 --> 00:59:14.795
<v Speaker 1>I want. But that means that if a

00:59:14.795 --> 00:59:17.275
<v Speaker 1>different author or a different committer than the

00:59:17.275 --> 00:59:20.875
<v Speaker 1>ones written in my list have done anything

00:59:20.875 --> 00:59:22.560
<v Speaker 1>to this file,

00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:25.280
<v Speaker 1>my report will tell me about it. So

00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:27.280
<v Speaker 1>this is a way for me to protect

00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:30.960
<v Speaker 1>particular files in particular repositories

00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:32.000
<v Speaker 1>from

00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:34.960
<v Speaker 1>unwanted access. Now, again, when I say protect,

00:59:35.195 --> 00:59:37.355
<v Speaker 1>just means I'll be alerted to it. I'll

00:59:37.355 --> 00:59:39.275
<v Speaker 1>know about it. I can't really stop

00:59:39.435 --> 00:59:41.755
<v Speaker 1>people who have legitimate access,

00:59:42.075 --> 00:59:42.955
<v Speaker 1>but I can

00:59:43.355 --> 00:59:45.035
<v Speaker 1>make sure that I know about it.

00:59:47.275 --> 00:59:49.115
<v Speaker 1>I think this is one of the better

00:59:49.115 --> 00:59:52.500
<v Speaker 1>examples for fine grained file protection that you

00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:54.020
<v Speaker 1>can set up using GitKat.

00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:56.820
<v Speaker 1>GitHub itself doesn't really enable you to do

00:59:56.820 --> 00:59:57.940
<v Speaker 1>this, but GitKat

00:59:57.940 --> 00:59:58.660
<v Speaker 1>does.

00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:00.740
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Any questions

01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:04.660
<v Speaker 1>any questions so far?

01:00:06.954 --> 01:00:08.954
<v Speaker 0>No. I think a lot of this is

01:00:08.954 --> 01:00:11.035
<v Speaker 0>making sense. I love the fact that we

01:00:11.035 --> 01:00:11.595
<v Speaker 0>can

01:00:11.915 --> 01:00:14.395
<v Speaker 0>kind of put all this together, get the

01:00:14.395 --> 01:00:17.275
<v Speaker 0>report, monitor things, continue to improve. You know,

01:00:17.275 --> 01:00:19.355
<v Speaker 0>it's not all about finding a silver bullet

01:00:19.355 --> 01:00:22.280
<v Speaker 0>with security. It's all about continuous improvement and

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.880
<v Speaker 0>making sure that whatever we have today was

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:25.000
<v Speaker 0>better than yesterday.

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:27.000
<v Speaker 0>The only thing that's really kind of floating

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.600
<v Speaker 0>around my head is that, you know, you

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:30.600
<v Speaker 0>said all of this is written on Regal.

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:32.760
<v Speaker 0>Like, what if I wanted to contribute my

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:35.480
<v Speaker 0>own policies or have my own private policies?

01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:36.200
<v Speaker 0>Is this something

01:00:36.714 --> 01:00:38.235
<v Speaker 0>that is possible?

01:00:38.795 --> 01:00:42.795
<v Speaker 1>Of course, is. Yeah. Just now, you essentially

01:00:42.795 --> 01:00:44.795
<v Speaker 1>forged Git Gat. It is now

01:00:45.595 --> 01:00:46.395
<v Speaker 1>essentially

01:00:46.395 --> 01:00:48.475
<v Speaker 1>yours to play with as you want.

01:00:49.194 --> 01:00:52.234
<v Speaker 1>One of the the chapters which I've added

01:00:52.599 --> 01:00:53.640
<v Speaker 1>to the

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.080
<v Speaker 1>Linux Foundation

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.160
<v Speaker 1>course, which I mentioned

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:58.840
<v Speaker 1>and actually, because

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:02.359
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to make sure that our viewers

01:01:02.359 --> 01:01:03.080
<v Speaker 1>have

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:05.000
<v Speaker 1>the link if they want to,

01:01:05.585 --> 01:01:07.744
<v Speaker 1>I'll now share the link with you so

01:01:07.744 --> 01:01:09.665
<v Speaker 1>you can show it on screen

01:01:10.144 --> 01:01:11.665
<v Speaker 1>just because, you know,

01:01:12.065 --> 01:01:14.704
<v Speaker 1>I you can consider it a cheat sheet

01:01:14.944 --> 01:01:17.345
<v Speaker 1>for GitGat having the course,

01:01:17.825 --> 01:01:20.224
<v Speaker 1>you know, available. It's free. There's absolutely no

01:01:20.224 --> 01:01:21.025
<v Speaker 1>reason not to

01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:23.310
<v Speaker 1>look at it. So

01:01:24.190 --> 01:01:25.789
<v Speaker 1>Linux Foundation

01:01:25.789 --> 01:01:27.710
<v Speaker 1>one two two x is the name of

01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:29.230
<v Speaker 1>the course or, you know, their name for

01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:32.349
<v Speaker 1>it. It's GitHub Supply Chain Security using GitGap.

01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:33.790
<v Speaker 1>The final chapter

01:01:34.029 --> 01:01:36.349
<v Speaker 1>is how to add additional

01:01:36.935 --> 01:01:37.815
<v Speaker 1>queries

01:01:37.975 --> 01:01:39.015
<v Speaker 1>to the report.

01:01:39.255 --> 01:01:42.375
<v Speaker 1>Now I know that most people or at

01:01:42.375 --> 01:01:44.375
<v Speaker 1>least most of our viewers would not be

01:01:44.375 --> 01:01:45.735
<v Speaker 1>familiar with OPA

01:01:45.895 --> 01:01:47.175
<v Speaker 1>or with Regal,

01:01:47.415 --> 01:01:48.455
<v Speaker 1>which is fine.

01:01:49.095 --> 01:01:51.700
<v Speaker 1>The the chapter assumes that you don't have

01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:54.260
<v Speaker 1>that much information about either Rigo or OPA,

01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:56.420
<v Speaker 1>but you do have some,

01:01:56.820 --> 01:01:59.060
<v Speaker 1>not a lot, some understanding

01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:01.540
<v Speaker 1>of how to code. It shows you what

01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:02.980
<v Speaker 1>you need to do, where you need to

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:06.175
<v Speaker 1>do it. And because everything is reliant on

01:02:06.255 --> 01:02:07.455
<v Speaker 1>GitHub API,

01:02:07.455 --> 01:02:09.135
<v Speaker 1>at least as much as, you know, we're

01:02:09.135 --> 01:02:11.055
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about GitHub

01:02:11.775 --> 01:02:13.295
<v Speaker 1>security posture right now,

01:02:13.695 --> 01:02:15.375
<v Speaker 1>so we are using the GitHub API,

01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:18.809
<v Speaker 1>In order to look at the GitHub API,

01:02:18.809 --> 01:02:20.650
<v Speaker 1>see what you need to get, it's it's

01:02:20.650 --> 01:02:24.490
<v Speaker 1>very simple. GitHub has very handy API links.

01:02:24.569 --> 01:02:26.250
<v Speaker 1>So you figure out what what you wanna

01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:28.569
<v Speaker 1>ask the API, you figure out the information

01:02:28.569 --> 01:02:31.285
<v Speaker 1>you want from it, and the how to

01:02:31.445 --> 01:02:31.845
<v Speaker 1>essentially,

01:02:32.485 --> 01:02:34.165
<v Speaker 1>the example is how to add it as

01:02:34.165 --> 01:02:34.885
<v Speaker 1>a query.

01:02:35.445 --> 01:02:37.045
<v Speaker 1>The query that

01:02:37.285 --> 01:02:39.525
<v Speaker 1>we're the the last

01:02:39.525 --> 01:02:40.245
<v Speaker 1>chapter

01:02:40.485 --> 01:02:42.485
<v Speaker 1>of the course is adding

01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:44.100
<v Speaker 1>is how to

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:47.380
<v Speaker 1>make or or add different organization, get essentially

01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:49.220
<v Speaker 1>a list of the organizations

01:02:49.539 --> 01:02:51.780
<v Speaker 1>that you are a member of

01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:53.380
<v Speaker 1>separately,

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:55.460
<v Speaker 1>just as an example, obviously.

01:02:56.845 --> 01:02:58.605
<v Speaker 1>But just like you can do that, you

01:02:58.605 --> 01:03:01.085
<v Speaker 1>can essentially play with it to have your

01:03:01.085 --> 01:03:01.645
<v Speaker 1>own

01:03:01.885 --> 01:03:03.565
<v Speaker 1>queries, your own information.

01:03:03.965 --> 01:03:06.445
<v Speaker 1>Obviously, would be happy to you know, once

01:03:06.445 --> 01:03:08.125
<v Speaker 1>you figure out a query,

01:03:08.365 --> 01:03:10.740
<v Speaker 1>you can just add it, send the PR

01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:12.580
<v Speaker 1>or or, you know, do a PR to

01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:13.460
<v Speaker 1>the actual

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:16.420
<v Speaker 1>scribe GitGat, and we'll be happy to add

01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:18.180
<v Speaker 1>it so that everybody can use it.

01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:21.300
<v Speaker 1>Like I mentioned earlier, GitLab is just on

01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:22.260
<v Speaker 1>the verge of being added.

01:03:23.165 --> 01:03:25.005
<v Speaker 1>Obviously, it will be slightly different. It will

01:03:25.005 --> 01:03:27.085
<v Speaker 1>be more of GitLab than GitHub.

01:03:28.125 --> 01:03:28.925
<v Speaker 1>Eventually,

01:03:28.925 --> 01:03:30.125
<v Speaker 1>we're hoping to add

01:03:30.365 --> 01:03:32.445
<v Speaker 1>all the other SCMs as well.

01:03:33.005 --> 01:03:35.165
<v Speaker 1>The more people play with this, the more

01:03:35.165 --> 01:03:37.484
<v Speaker 1>people add queries and useful information,

01:03:37.970 --> 01:03:40.289
<v Speaker 1>the better it'll be for everybody. And even

01:03:40.289 --> 01:03:43.410
<v Speaker 1>if you choose not to share whatever queries

01:03:43.410 --> 01:03:46.049
<v Speaker 1>you develop yourself with everybody, the fact that

01:03:46.049 --> 01:03:47.810
<v Speaker 1>you can custom

01:03:47.970 --> 01:03:48.609
<v Speaker 1>fit

01:03:49.010 --> 01:03:52.049
<v Speaker 1>the state and the input to exactly what

01:03:52.049 --> 01:03:54.355
<v Speaker 1>it is you need, what your organizational

01:03:54.355 --> 01:03:55.795
<v Speaker 1>requirements are,

01:03:56.115 --> 01:03:58.595
<v Speaker 1>I think, essentially means that you can take

01:03:58.595 --> 01:04:00.355
<v Speaker 1>it yet and make it your own tool.

01:04:00.515 --> 01:04:02.675
<v Speaker 1>You take the basic, you know, package that

01:04:02.675 --> 01:04:04.595
<v Speaker 1>we created and you make it your own.

01:04:05.075 --> 01:04:06.835
<v Speaker 1>You can you know, even if

01:04:07.070 --> 01:04:08.990
<v Speaker 1>you're fine with people not using two f

01:04:08.990 --> 01:04:10.830
<v Speaker 1>a, you're fine with every single one of

01:04:10.830 --> 01:04:12.350
<v Speaker 1>your users being admin,

01:04:12.430 --> 01:04:15.150
<v Speaker 1>you're fine with nobody using signed commits, if

01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:17.230
<v Speaker 1>you're fine with it, just put it in

01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:18.030
<v Speaker 1>the input.

01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:20.430
<v Speaker 1>The report will no longer, you know, bother

01:04:20.430 --> 01:04:20.910
<v Speaker 1>you about it.

01:04:21.654 --> 01:04:23.815
<v Speaker 1>Just, you know, as long as you are

01:04:23.815 --> 01:04:24.775
<v Speaker 1>aware

01:04:25.015 --> 01:04:27.174
<v Speaker 1>of the ramifications

01:04:27.174 --> 01:04:29.175
<v Speaker 1>of your actions and your choices,

01:04:29.654 --> 01:04:31.894
<v Speaker 1>it's your repository. Do whatever you want with

01:04:31.894 --> 01:04:32.454
<v Speaker 1>it.

01:04:33.575 --> 01:04:34.134
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:37.690
<v Speaker 0>I guess, again, a final question for me

01:04:37.690 --> 01:04:39.849
<v Speaker 0>is, like, is get get done?

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:42.170
<v Speaker 0>Like, what what's on the road map?

01:04:42.410 --> 01:04:43.130
<v Speaker 1>No.

01:04:43.369 --> 01:04:45.690
<v Speaker 1>No. No. No. Like I said,

01:04:46.089 --> 01:04:47.450
<v Speaker 1>the the the next

01:04:47.875 --> 01:04:50.195
<v Speaker 1>closest thing within, like, let's say, a week

01:04:50.195 --> 01:04:52.435
<v Speaker 1>or so is adding GitLab

01:04:52.515 --> 01:04:54.275
<v Speaker 1>almost completely ready,

01:04:54.755 --> 01:04:55.155
<v Speaker 1>and

01:04:56.515 --> 01:04:59.475
<v Speaker 1>it's in testing right now. Once it's done,

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:02.240
<v Speaker 1>I'll update the documentation

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:04.480
<v Speaker 1>so that people who use GitLab

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:06.880
<v Speaker 1>would know how to use it essentially just

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.960
<v Speaker 1>as easily as people who use GitHub right

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.400
<v Speaker 1>now can.

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:14.240
<v Speaker 1>Obviously, GitLab is slightly different slightly different

01:05:14.465 --> 01:05:17.105
<v Speaker 1>UI. So I'll make sure that everything I

01:05:17.105 --> 01:05:18.785
<v Speaker 1>write is is just as clear.

01:05:19.345 --> 01:05:21.745
<v Speaker 1>After that, there are other SCMs.

01:05:21.825 --> 01:05:23.585
<v Speaker 1>And once we're done with

01:05:23.745 --> 01:05:26.065
<v Speaker 1>we're actually in parallel with adding

01:05:26.225 --> 01:05:27.665
<v Speaker 1>additional SCMs,

01:05:27.665 --> 01:05:30.760
<v Speaker 1>we're constant queries because there are other things

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:31.800
<v Speaker 1>that the

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:33.640
<v Speaker 1>GitHub API

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.160
<v Speaker 1>can allow us to

01:05:35.559 --> 01:05:36.280
<v Speaker 1>check,

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:39.640
<v Speaker 1>and there's more things that we want to

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:42.119
<v Speaker 1>be able to show people. This is essentially,

01:05:42.119 --> 01:05:44.175
<v Speaker 1>like, this when we built it, this was

01:05:44.175 --> 01:05:45.295
<v Speaker 1>our basic list,

01:05:45.455 --> 01:05:46.735
<v Speaker 1>stuff that we absolutely

01:05:46.735 --> 01:05:49.935
<v Speaker 1>wanted or had to show people, especially, for

01:05:49.935 --> 01:05:53.215
<v Speaker 1>example, the branch protection rules, which definitely not

01:05:53.215 --> 01:05:56.130
<v Speaker 1>enough people are familiar or aware of,

01:05:56.849 --> 01:05:58.369
<v Speaker 1>which is, I think, a very, very useful

01:05:58.369 --> 01:06:00.210
<v Speaker 1>tool by GitHub. It's a shame more people

01:06:00.210 --> 01:06:01.490
<v Speaker 1>are not aware of it.

01:06:02.210 --> 01:06:03.650
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sure GitLab

01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:05.809
<v Speaker 1>and and Bitbucket and others have other things

01:06:05.809 --> 01:06:07.089
<v Speaker 1>like that, and we wanna make sure people

01:06:07.089 --> 01:06:09.410
<v Speaker 1>know about it. And seeing it in the

01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:10.050
<v Speaker 1>report

01:06:10.464 --> 01:06:12.224
<v Speaker 1>is one of the ways to make sure

01:06:12.224 --> 01:06:13.185
<v Speaker 1>people are aware.

01:06:13.905 --> 01:06:16.465
<v Speaker 1>Essentially, the whole thing is just, you know,

01:06:16.625 --> 01:06:18.065
<v Speaker 1>make people aware

01:06:18.065 --> 01:06:20.385
<v Speaker 1>of SCM security posture,

01:06:20.785 --> 01:06:21.984
<v Speaker 1>protect your code better.

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:24.080
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.880
<v Speaker 0>Is there anything else that we haven't covered

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:28.160
<v Speaker 0>yet that you want to cover before we

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:29.200
<v Speaker 0>finish up today?

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:34.560
<v Speaker 1>Well, there like I said, there's a lot

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:35.605
<v Speaker 1>of fine

01:06:35.925 --> 01:06:38.805
<v Speaker 1>fine grained, fine details that you can do

01:06:38.805 --> 01:06:40.805
<v Speaker 1>that, you know, we haven't really covered, but

01:06:40.805 --> 01:06:42.725
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like we need to. Like,

01:06:42.725 --> 01:06:45.525
<v Speaker 1>setting up GitKid to run on a particular

01:06:46.005 --> 01:06:47.045
<v Speaker 1>repository

01:06:47.045 --> 01:06:49.970
<v Speaker 1>or a particular file, It's all in the

01:06:49.970 --> 01:06:50.930
<v Speaker 1>documentation.

01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:55.170
<v Speaker 1>I want to encourage people so I don't

01:06:55.170 --> 01:06:57.089
<v Speaker 1>wanna show everything. I want to encourage people

01:06:57.089 --> 01:06:59.730
<v Speaker 1>to go to GitGat, play with it themselves,

01:07:01.170 --> 01:07:04.434
<v Speaker 1>play with the actual code, add queries,

01:07:04.434 --> 01:07:05.395
<v Speaker 1>play with the

01:07:05.635 --> 01:07:06.915
<v Speaker 1>with the state,

01:07:07.315 --> 01:07:08.755
<v Speaker 1>and define their own

01:07:09.635 --> 01:07:10.515
<v Speaker 1>definitions

01:07:10.515 --> 01:07:12.675
<v Speaker 1>and and conditions to it just to see

01:07:12.675 --> 01:07:13.555
<v Speaker 1>what they get.

01:07:13.875 --> 01:07:15.635
<v Speaker 1>The more people play with it, the more

01:07:15.635 --> 01:07:17.980
<v Speaker 1>they make it their own, and, hopefully, we'll

01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:19.580
<v Speaker 1>get additional maintainers

01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:21.660
<v Speaker 1>for for this repository

01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:22.700
<v Speaker 1>for this project.

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:24.380
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:26.940
<v Speaker 0>Well, thank you so much for taking time

01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:29.340
<v Speaker 0>out of your day for sitting down and

01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:31.660
<v Speaker 0>guiding us through this and for your work

01:07:31.415 --> 01:07:33.015
<v Speaker 0>on all the documentation.

01:07:33.015 --> 01:07:34.935
<v Speaker 0>I think that's gonna be really useful to

01:07:34.935 --> 01:07:37.335
<v Speaker 0>people as they start to explore and bring

01:07:37.335 --> 01:07:39.175
<v Speaker 0>get get into their organizations.

01:07:39.575 --> 01:07:41.494
<v Speaker 0>I think what I love about it is,

01:07:41.494 --> 01:07:43.655
<v Speaker 0>again, it's got this educational

01:07:43.655 --> 01:07:45.910
<v Speaker 0>aspect to it. You know, we don't often

01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:48.390
<v Speaker 0>think about our security posture outside of the

01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:50.150
<v Speaker 0>code that we write, but, you know, there's

01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:51.750
<v Speaker 0>lots of things that have to be taken

01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:52.870
<v Speaker 0>into consideration.

01:07:53.350 --> 01:07:55.750
<v Speaker 0>And, you know, something like branch protection, you're

01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:57.684
<v Speaker 0>right. It's like just one of those features

01:07:57.684 --> 01:07:59.204
<v Speaker 0>is right there staring you in the face

01:07:59.204 --> 01:08:01.045
<v Speaker 0>and yet most of the time we rarely

01:08:01.045 --> 01:08:03.204
<v Speaker 0>turn that on. And I think just having

01:08:03.204 --> 01:08:05.445
<v Speaker 0>something we can stick in the GitHub action,

01:08:05.684 --> 01:08:07.605
<v Speaker 0>let it just run and get a report

01:08:07.605 --> 01:08:09.620
<v Speaker 0>once a week or whenever. But just as,

01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:11.300
<v Speaker 0>hey, you've still not changed the branch protection

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:13.060
<v Speaker 0>rules. You're still not unable to FA for

01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:15.220
<v Speaker 0>the issues or you're still having

01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:18.740
<v Speaker 0>random interns right to your production environment fail.

01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:20.020
<v Speaker 0>Like, these are things you don't want to

01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:22.899
<v Speaker 0>happen and until you have that constant nagging

01:08:22.899 --> 01:08:24.825
<v Speaker 0>thing on your shoulder. Not that get guys

01:08:24.825 --> 01:08:27.305
<v Speaker 0>nagging, but you have that awareness. Right?

01:08:27.545 --> 01:08:29.865
<v Speaker 0>You're it's it's too easy forgotten, too easy

01:08:29.865 --> 01:08:31.465
<v Speaker 0>just to sweep under the rug and we'll

01:08:31.465 --> 01:08:33.785
<v Speaker 0>get around to it later. And unfortunately, later

01:08:34.105 --> 01:08:36.025
<v Speaker 0>is never soon enough when we have malicious

01:08:36.025 --> 01:08:38.260
<v Speaker 0>hackers on the internet. So very cool to

01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:40.100
<v Speaker 0>know. Things that yeah. A couple of things,

01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:43.140
<v Speaker 1>like I said earlier, that people can easily

01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:44.100
<v Speaker 1>forget about,

01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:46.340
<v Speaker 1>SSH keys and deploy keys.

01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:49.060
<v Speaker 1>You set them up. You say Yep. Oh,

01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:50.420
<v Speaker 1>they'll set it for six months

01:08:51.045 --> 01:08:52.885
<v Speaker 1>or or, you know, a year.

01:08:53.444 --> 01:08:55.285
<v Speaker 1>That application

01:08:55.285 --> 01:08:57.444
<v Speaker 1>is no longer running after three months, but

01:08:57.444 --> 01:08:59.925
<v Speaker 1>the key is still there. If somebody who's

01:08:59.925 --> 01:09:02.644
<v Speaker 1>not approved to get access to that key,

01:09:02.965 --> 01:09:05.960
<v Speaker 1>they can have access GitHub account. You really

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:08.439
<v Speaker 1>wanna keep on top of these keys,

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:10.040
<v Speaker 1>and this report is one of the ways

01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:10.760
<v Speaker 1>to do that

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:13.719
<v Speaker 1>to make sure you're not missing any keys,

01:09:13.719 --> 01:09:15.080
<v Speaker 1>you didn't forget about any keys.

01:09:16.055 --> 01:09:18.135
<v Speaker 1>You know, if if somebody for example, you

01:09:18.135 --> 01:09:20.215
<v Speaker 1>get an an alert that somebody accessed your

01:09:20.215 --> 01:09:22.295
<v Speaker 1>GitHub account, the first thing you wanna do

01:09:22.295 --> 01:09:24.854
<v Speaker 1>is make sure you disable all your keys.

01:09:25.575 --> 01:09:27.335
<v Speaker 1>Just, you know, on the off chance we

01:09:27.335 --> 01:09:28.535
<v Speaker 1>might have gotten off with one.

01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:31.389
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

01:09:31.710 --> 01:09:33.710
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let me pop this back over to

01:09:33.710 --> 01:09:34.590
<v Speaker 0>big Facebook.

01:09:35.869 --> 01:09:38.590
<v Speaker 0>But, again, thank you so much for spending

01:09:38.590 --> 01:09:40.829
<v Speaker 0>time. If people have any questions, if you're

01:09:40.829 --> 01:09:44.085
<v Speaker 0>watching us after the fact, then links to

01:09:44.085 --> 01:09:46.484
<v Speaker 0>Twitter profiles and GitHub repositories. I'll even add

01:09:46.484 --> 01:09:48.245
<v Speaker 0>the Linux Foundation course will all be in

01:09:48.245 --> 01:09:50.165
<v Speaker 0>the description below momentarily.

01:09:50.885 --> 01:09:52.885
<v Speaker 0>Any last parts before we wrap up? Yeah.

01:09:52.885 --> 01:09:54.085
<v Speaker 1>And all all my

01:09:54.245 --> 01:09:56.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah. I think that you can also add

01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:58.710
<v Speaker 1>all the links to me. I think you

01:09:58.710 --> 01:10:00.230
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned that, but I'm I'm not sure

01:10:00.230 --> 01:10:01.989
<v Speaker 1>you did. So I'm I'm saying if you

01:10:01.989 --> 01:10:04.469
<v Speaker 1>didn't, you can add those, my email, my

01:10:04.469 --> 01:10:05.269
<v Speaker 1>LinkedIn,

01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.909
<v Speaker 1>my Twitter.

01:10:06.755 --> 01:10:09.074
<v Speaker 1>Feel free to to ask me anything either

01:10:09.074 --> 01:10:12.594
<v Speaker 1>about GitGat or about what Sprite Security does.

01:10:12.994 --> 01:10:15.395
<v Speaker 1>I'm the developer advocate. That's my job to

01:10:15.395 --> 01:10:18.114
<v Speaker 1>explain things. So feel free to ask.

01:10:19.170 --> 01:10:20.449
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Awesome.

01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:25.170
<v Speaker 0>Cool. Alright. Well, you have a wonderful evening.

01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:27.570
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully, speak to you again soon. And if

01:10:27.570 --> 01:10:29.650
<v Speaker 0>there's any major feature updates, if you wanna

01:10:29.650 --> 01:10:31.650
<v Speaker 0>reach back out, please feel free to anytime.

01:10:32.224 --> 01:10:34.545
<v Speaker 0>To everyone who watched, have a wonderful day,

01:10:34.545 --> 01:10:37.024
<v Speaker 0>and we'll see you all next time. Adios.

01:10:37.425 --> 01:10:37.905
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.
