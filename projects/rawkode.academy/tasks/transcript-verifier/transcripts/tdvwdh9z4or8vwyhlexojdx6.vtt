00:01:51.895 --> 00:01:52.695
<v Speaker 0>Hello.

00:01:55.335 --> 00:01:56.375
<v Speaker 0>Welcome.

00:01:59.655 --> 00:02:01.255
<v Speaker 0>I'm just gonna wait

00:02:01.415 --> 00:02:02.295
<v Speaker 0>a minute

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.860
<v Speaker 0>so that I can confirm

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.540
<v Speaker 0>I can see myself

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.660
<v Speaker 0>down here.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.780
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.260
<v Speaker 0>Hello.

00:02:16.415 --> 00:02:18.015
<v Speaker 0>Stupid voice me. Alright.

00:02:21.694 --> 00:02:24.095
<v Speaker 0>So yesterday wasn't very successful.

00:02:26.095 --> 00:02:28.974
<v Speaker 0>If you didn't watch that video, then we

00:02:28.974 --> 00:02:30.174
<v Speaker 0>spent two hours yesterday.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.690
<v Speaker 0>The first thirty minutes were fine.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.570
<v Speaker 0>We got alerting configured

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.570
<v Speaker 0>on pods

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:39.850
<v Speaker 0>that were

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.530
<v Speaker 0>struggling to start.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.090
<v Speaker 0>Then we moved on to trying to provide

00:02:44.425 --> 00:02:47.785
<v Speaker 0>a kind of logging section of our dashboard.

00:02:48.905 --> 00:02:50.665
<v Speaker 0>And we ran into a few problems.

00:02:51.225 --> 00:02:52.825
<v Speaker 0>Now after much,

00:02:52.825 --> 00:02:53.945
<v Speaker 0>much debugging,

00:02:54.505 --> 00:02:57.145
<v Speaker 0>it turns out that there was a problem

00:02:57.145 --> 00:02:58.425
<v Speaker 0>in the InfluxDB

00:02:58.425 --> 00:02:59.785
<v Speaker 0>with FluentD plugin.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.800
<v Speaker 0>The problem was

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.160
<v Speaker 0>even though it was staring me right in

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.160
<v Speaker 0>the face and I I didn't see it

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.520
<v Speaker 0>was just

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.880
<v Speaker 0>that

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.800
<v Speaker 0>the

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.720
<v Speaker 0>there is a nested JSON.

00:03:13.675 --> 00:03:15.355
<v Speaker 0>Well, I thought it was a string

00:03:17.035 --> 00:03:20.075
<v Speaker 0>that was heading the conditional statement

00:03:20.875 --> 00:03:22.395
<v Speaker 0>and the Ruby plugin.

00:03:22.875 --> 00:03:24.315
<v Speaker 0>Okay. We can even just take a look

00:03:24.315 --> 00:03:25.755
<v Speaker 0>at that code again.

00:03:26.235 --> 00:03:27.355
<v Speaker 0>Even though we looked at that a fair

00:03:27.355 --> 00:03:28.395
<v Speaker 0>amount yesterday.

00:03:29.435 --> 00:03:30.770
<v Speaker 0>It was down here

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.290
<v Speaker 0>where it says, you know, oops, go back.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.010
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.530
<v Speaker 0>Where are you?

00:03:42.775 --> 00:03:45.095
<v Speaker 0>Well, wonder if he fixed this fixed this

00:03:45.095 --> 00:03:46.135
<v Speaker 0>in two.

00:03:53.335 --> 00:03:56.295
<v Speaker 0>I'm sure there was a string that is

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.360
<v Speaker 0>skipped. Anyway, this is out here that was

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.799
<v Speaker 0>part of the add field function anyway. So

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.040
<v Speaker 0>the the add field function has a check

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.879
<v Speaker 0>on it. At least for being a string

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:04.680
<v Speaker 0>and that

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.680
<v Speaker 0>it quotes the key and the value appropriately.

00:04:10.545 --> 00:04:13.745
<v Speaker 0>However, the string handling is also just

00:04:14.065 --> 00:04:15.504
<v Speaker 0>it has an else field on it that

00:04:15.504 --> 00:04:17.985
<v Speaker 0>just says okay, just just use key value

00:04:17.985 --> 00:04:19.264
<v Speaker 0>pairs. We don't really know what we're dealing

00:04:19.264 --> 00:04:20.065
<v Speaker 0>with here.

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:20.625
<v Speaker 0>So

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.970
<v Speaker 0>what the maintainer now has handled is we

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.490
<v Speaker 0>actually, if we notice that it is an

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.490
<v Speaker 0>object or hash in Ruby chat,

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.410
<v Speaker 0>look over the the those pairs and actually

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.170
<v Speaker 0>process them each as fields.

00:04:35.745 --> 00:04:38.545
<v Speaker 0>And he was very kind to do a

00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:40.065
<v Speaker 0>pre release for me

00:04:41.585 --> 00:04:43.265
<v Speaker 0>that I have updated

00:04:44.385 --> 00:04:45.665
<v Speaker 0>in my Docker file.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.170
<v Speaker 0>So we're now running the one four o

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.810
<v Speaker 0>pre release of the fluid deep plugin. I

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.490
<v Speaker 0>have triggered a rebuild

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.370
<v Speaker 0>and that's where we are.

00:05:00.155 --> 00:05:02.235
<v Speaker 0>So hopefully my cluster is in the same

00:05:02.235 --> 00:05:03.835
<v Speaker 0>state I left in and

00:05:04.875 --> 00:05:05.915
<v Speaker 0>it is

00:05:07.115 --> 00:05:09.195
<v Speaker 0>our fluent plugin has been running for twenty

00:05:09.195 --> 00:05:11.355
<v Speaker 0>two hours. We wanna cause this pod to

00:05:11.355 --> 00:05:12.410
<v Speaker 0>re star.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.009
<v Speaker 0>But let's just take a look at what

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:17.449
<v Speaker 0>we were getting. So

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.850
<v Speaker 0>big blob of text

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.090
<v Speaker 0>and valid billion here.

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:24.889
<v Speaker 0>Just struggling to process this.

00:05:26.175 --> 00:05:27.535
<v Speaker 0>So I'm hoping

00:05:28.975 --> 00:05:30.415
<v Speaker 0>very quickly,

00:05:30.655 --> 00:05:33.135
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna delete this pod. The new image

00:05:33.135 --> 00:05:35.695
<v Speaker 0>is already on many QPM.

00:05:36.015 --> 00:05:38.255
<v Speaker 0>It's gonna deploy it with an update

00:05:39.055 --> 00:05:40.015
<v Speaker 0>and magically,

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.010
<v Speaker 0>we're gonna see logs.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.810
<v Speaker 0>Is that too much to ask? I don't

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:47.610
<v Speaker 0>think so.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.170
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So tell to tell, that's all of

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.170
<v Speaker 0>our container logging files.

00:05:56.065 --> 00:05:58.145
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure if we'll see any sort

00:05:58.145 --> 00:05:59.665
<v Speaker 0>of output to indicate that the metrics have

00:05:59.665 --> 00:06:01.505
<v Speaker 0>been written, but I am gonna give this

00:06:01.905 --> 00:06:03.345
<v Speaker 0>around thirty seconds

00:06:03.505 --> 00:06:06.065
<v Speaker 0>because it is batch and buffered.

00:06:06.865 --> 00:06:08.785
<v Speaker 0>So we won't see it right and if

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:09.585
<v Speaker 0>an immediately

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.580
<v Speaker 0>and we'll see what happens.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.380
<v Speaker 0>Now if we pull up our dashboard again,

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.460
<v Speaker 0>will need my port forward.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:23.340
<v Speaker 0>Get lab.

00:06:26.305 --> 00:06:27.105
<v Speaker 0>Fire.

00:06:29.905 --> 00:06:31.185
<v Speaker 0>Port art.

00:06:34.865 --> 00:06:36.545
<v Speaker 0>Let's pull this back up.

00:06:36.945 --> 00:06:38.945
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully, I remember the username and password.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:45.980
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no. Wait.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.980
<v Speaker 0>This is configured by the cluster.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.100
<v Speaker 0>You go away for one day

00:06:53.565 --> 00:06:55.485
<v Speaker 0>and you forget how your computer

00:06:57.005 --> 00:06:58.445
<v Speaker 0>gets secrets

00:06:58.685 --> 00:07:00.045
<v Speaker 0>admin password.

00:07:01.805 --> 00:07:04.205
<v Speaker 0>We do need to basically code this. I'm

00:07:04.205 --> 00:07:06.205
<v Speaker 0>sure everyone is so fed up of watching

00:07:06.205 --> 00:07:07.850
<v Speaker 0>me do this. I should just save it

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.050
<v Speaker 0>somewhere, shouldn't I?

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.410
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So password.

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:16.170
<v Speaker 0>So we go to our fire dashboard.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.170
<v Speaker 0>We can see our broken pods.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:20.810
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:07:24.765 --> 00:07:25.405
<v Speaker 0>Good.

00:07:25.645 --> 00:07:27.165
<v Speaker 0>We want logs.

00:07:27.485 --> 00:07:29.165
<v Speaker 0>We definitely want logs.

00:07:29.485 --> 00:07:31.485
<v Speaker 0>So I'm gonna come in here, our logs

00:07:31.645 --> 00:07:33.565
<v Speaker 0>Oh, nice. Our logs are being run into

00:07:33.565 --> 00:07:35.485
<v Speaker 0>the telegraph bucket because

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.320
<v Speaker 0>stupid thing that's how decided to configure it.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.480
<v Speaker 0>We have a measurement

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.440
<v Speaker 0>for each

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.080
<v Speaker 0>of our containers.

00:07:48.095 --> 00:07:49.295
<v Speaker 0>So let's

00:07:50.495 --> 00:07:52.735
<v Speaker 0>let's try and understand this data a little

00:07:52.735 --> 00:07:55.455
<v Speaker 0>bit more. I don't wanna filter on measurement.

00:07:55.455 --> 00:07:57.535
<v Speaker 0>I'm actually gonna pull them all out

00:07:58.095 --> 00:08:00.575
<v Speaker 0>and see if there's something else I can

00:08:00.575 --> 00:08:01.375
<v Speaker 0>filter on.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:04.750
<v Speaker 0>We only need the last five minutes.

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:07.870
<v Speaker 0>View the raw data.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:08.750
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:10.110
<v Speaker 0>And

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:14.830
<v Speaker 0>alright. So we do have container name here.

00:08:22.285 --> 00:08:23.725
<v Speaker 0>What else do I have?

00:08:25.245 --> 00:08:27.405
<v Speaker 0>I got generation information.

00:08:27.645 --> 00:08:29.085
<v Speaker 0>I got the pod ID.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.760
<v Speaker 0>We've got the

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.919
<v Speaker 0>log itself.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:44.760
<v Speaker 0>No. I think that was just confusing me

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.495
<v Speaker 0>there. I think this is just the fluent

00:08:46.495 --> 00:08:48.574
<v Speaker 0>d log lines from when it prints out

00:08:48.574 --> 00:08:50.495
<v Speaker 0>its own config at the start.

00:08:51.295 --> 00:08:53.615
<v Speaker 0>And so let's just skip over that

00:08:53.935 --> 00:08:54.814
<v Speaker 0>and

00:08:54.814 --> 00:08:56.254
<v Speaker 0>we have the host. So

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.740
<v Speaker 0>this is rather unusual right

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:03.100
<v Speaker 0>now.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.420
<v Speaker 0>What we need to do is pivot this

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.060
<v Speaker 0>data.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:07.660
<v Speaker 0>So

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:09.660
<v Speaker 0>by default,

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.780
<v Speaker 0>when you query measurements with flux,

00:09:13.185 --> 00:09:15.105
<v Speaker 0>you get back data in a column or

00:09:15.105 --> 00:09:15.745
<v Speaker 0>fashion

00:09:16.545 --> 00:09:20.305
<v Speaker 0>which means that we get a table stream

00:09:20.305 --> 00:09:22.865
<v Speaker 0>for each series key

00:09:23.345 --> 00:09:24.785
<v Speaker 0>and if we want to view that on

00:09:24.785 --> 00:09:26.910
<v Speaker 0>a row based fashion, we need to decide

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:29.709
<v Speaker 0>how we group those columns together to form

00:09:29.709 --> 00:09:31.949
<v Speaker 0>a row and then use the pivot function.

00:09:32.189 --> 00:09:34.430
<v Speaker 0>And I think that is step one because

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:35.470
<v Speaker 0>right now,

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.069
<v Speaker 0>this is gobbledygook.

00:09:39.069 --> 00:09:40.509
<v Speaker 0>I don't understand what this is.

00:09:49.894 --> 00:09:51.894
<v Speaker 0>So how do we group this?

00:09:52.055 --> 00:09:55.255
<v Speaker 0>I think we can go on pod

00:09:55.735 --> 00:09:56.214
<v Speaker 0>name.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.080
<v Speaker 0>So

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.960
<v Speaker 0>let's try a

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.240
<v Speaker 0>group

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.720
<v Speaker 0>columns.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.360
<v Speaker 0>Sometimes

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.680
<v Speaker 0>you get all complete on actual data values

00:10:12.235 --> 00:10:13.275
<v Speaker 0>like here.

00:10:13.835 --> 00:10:15.995
<v Speaker 0>Don't know why it doesn't work for columns.

00:10:16.075 --> 00:10:16.635
<v Speaker 0>So

00:10:17.435 --> 00:10:19.275
<v Speaker 0>let's try to to to

00:10:19.515 --> 00:10:21.355
<v Speaker 0>pod container

00:10:22.395 --> 00:10:22.955
<v Speaker 0>name.

00:10:24.395 --> 00:10:26.555
<v Speaker 0>Let's just try container name.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.700
<v Speaker 0>Let's just comment out and actually do

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:33.100
<v Speaker 0>that's the reason it wasn't working was probably

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.180
<v Speaker 0>this, so comment back in.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.940
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We do have some grouping going on

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:39.260
<v Speaker 0>here,

00:10:40.505 --> 00:10:42.105
<v Speaker 0>That could just be

00:10:43.625 --> 00:10:44.505
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes.

00:10:47.065 --> 00:10:48.505
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no. Wait. Well, it's

00:10:52.985 --> 00:10:55.730
<v Speaker 0>let's work this out. We wanna grip on

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:57.250
<v Speaker 0>fluent d tag.

00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:59.570
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So fluent.

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:02.770
<v Speaker 0>So when we configure fluent d, we had

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.090
<v Speaker 0>a we had a fluent d tag and

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:07.570
<v Speaker 0>it adds a tag with the file name

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:08.930
<v Speaker 0>for the

00:11:11.065 --> 00:11:13.785
<v Speaker 0>it's just a container or the pod. I

00:11:13.785 --> 00:11:15.145
<v Speaker 0>think it's a container.

00:11:15.145 --> 00:11:16.985
<v Speaker 0>So if I group by that

00:11:18.025 --> 00:11:20.345
<v Speaker 0>and then let's just go straight onto a

00:11:20.345 --> 00:11:21.785
<v Speaker 0>numb on

00:11:22.745 --> 00:11:23.145
<v Speaker 0>pivot.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.279
<v Speaker 0>We probably don't need to grip because we

00:11:28.279 --> 00:11:30.680
<v Speaker 0>can specify the Rawkode is

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:31.720
<v Speaker 0>fluent D.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.200
<v Speaker 0>We wanna

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.360
<v Speaker 0>all of our columns will be anything that

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.600
<v Speaker 0>has a field. The value is always value.

00:11:39.464 --> 00:11:40.345
<v Speaker 0>Yay.

00:11:42.904 --> 00:11:44.505
<v Speaker 0>So now we have

00:11:44.904 --> 00:11:47.065
<v Speaker 0>that's our broken and a container

00:11:50.584 --> 00:11:53.519
<v Speaker 0>and that's each of the broken ones because

00:11:53.519 --> 00:11:55.040
<v Speaker 0>we have two pods.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.320
<v Speaker 0>We got the namespace. We got the labels.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.080
<v Speaker 0>We got the host.

00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:05.839
<v Speaker 0>Docker container ID.

00:12:12.355 --> 00:12:14.435
<v Speaker 0>We got pod ID. Now I think pod

00:12:14.435 --> 00:12:16.835
<v Speaker 0>ID is a slightly nicer

00:12:18.275 --> 00:12:19.635
<v Speaker 0>thing to group

00:12:20.515 --> 00:12:21.235
<v Speaker 0>potentially.

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:26.730
<v Speaker 0>I don't know. You probably want to view

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:27.610
<v Speaker 0>your logs

00:12:29.769 --> 00:12:32.410
<v Speaker 0>from each container. Would you want the logs

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:34.649
<v Speaker 0>from each container in a pod group together?

00:12:38.285 --> 00:12:39.165
<v Speaker 0>Potentially.

00:12:40.845 --> 00:12:42.365
<v Speaker 0>I think there's definitely a use case for

00:12:42.365 --> 00:12:43.485
<v Speaker 0>that but I don't

00:12:43.725 --> 00:12:45.725
<v Speaker 0>think I understand it well enough just yet.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.140
<v Speaker 0>Let's see what it looks like.

00:13:07.834 --> 00:13:08.635
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:13:09.195 --> 00:13:10.154
<v Speaker 0>Cancel that.

00:13:10.555 --> 00:13:13.514
<v Speaker 0>The reason that is is because it's field

00:13:13.514 --> 00:13:14.795
<v Speaker 0>and not tag.

00:13:14.875 --> 00:13:16.875
<v Speaker 0>So when it's a field, I would have

00:13:16.875 --> 00:13:17.515
<v Speaker 0>to

00:13:20.394 --> 00:13:21.595
<v Speaker 0>yeah. That wouldn't work.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:23.230
<v Speaker 0>We can only really

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:26.430
<v Speaker 0>we can only pivot based on a tag

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.990
<v Speaker 0>key. So okay. We're gonna force here to

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:30.750
<v Speaker 0>use this one we have in fluent.

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.710
<v Speaker 0>If we did want to group all of

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:34.830
<v Speaker 0>the containers

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:36.910
<v Speaker 0>to view the logs on a pod level,

00:13:37.455 --> 00:13:39.775
<v Speaker 0>I would have to change the fluent deconfig

00:13:39.775 --> 00:13:40.735
<v Speaker 0>I believe.

00:13:41.055 --> 00:13:43.695
<v Speaker 0>Just to expose a few extra things

00:13:45.535 --> 00:13:48.015
<v Speaker 0>as a tag. I think the pod ID

00:13:48.015 --> 00:13:49.775
<v Speaker 0>would definitely be one of those I'd want.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.400
<v Speaker 0>And there's a few other things in here

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.160
<v Speaker 0>that I don't think are tags

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.200
<v Speaker 0>such as the, you know, the node name

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.360
<v Speaker 0>and things that we may want to slice

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.400
<v Speaker 0>and dice by.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:03.800
<v Speaker 0>But for now,

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.880
<v Speaker 0>we're just gonna go with

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:06.600
<v Speaker 0>this.

00:14:07.205 --> 00:14:09.925
<v Speaker 0>So if I view this as a table

00:14:15.685 --> 00:14:16.885
<v Speaker 0>well, I'm on raw data.

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.089
<v Speaker 0>What do we have?

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:25.450
<v Speaker 0>Not what I was expecting.

00:14:31.815 --> 00:14:33.575
<v Speaker 0>So now I look at the raw data

00:14:33.575 --> 00:14:34.295
<v Speaker 0>again.

00:14:34.455 --> 00:14:36.215
<v Speaker 0>Where's my log lane?

00:14:42.135 --> 00:14:42.455
<v Speaker 0>Log.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.070
<v Speaker 0>Log.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:54.750
<v Speaker 0>I just cannot

00:15:05.645 --> 00:15:06.685
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:15:06.925 --> 00:15:07.805
<v Speaker 0>So I think

00:15:08.205 --> 00:15:10.045
<v Speaker 0>the problem is

00:15:10.125 --> 00:15:11.565
<v Speaker 0>my grip key.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:17.980
<v Speaker 0>Because of the pivot.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.380
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's try

00:15:29.065 --> 00:15:31.785
<v Speaker 0>and get our key correct first.

00:15:32.825 --> 00:15:34.905
<v Speaker 0>And I think we're gonna use Linde.

00:15:35.945 --> 00:15:37.465
<v Speaker 0>What we should see here

00:15:38.025 --> 00:15:41.385
<v Speaker 0>is many many entries

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.480
<v Speaker 0>table which is each of the log lines.

00:15:44.839 --> 00:15:45.959
<v Speaker 0>And I can kinda

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.600
<v Speaker 0>encourage only seeing log lines for now but

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.200
<v Speaker 0>we will take this out.

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.959
<v Speaker 0>And what we wanna see is where a

00:15:56.665 --> 00:15:57.545
<v Speaker 0>field

00:15:57.625 --> 00:15:58.505
<v Speaker 0>equals

00:15:58.745 --> 00:16:00.505
<v Speaker 0>log, I think it was.

00:16:02.265 --> 00:16:04.425
<v Speaker 0>Yep. So now we've the log lines

00:16:04.905 --> 00:16:08.025
<v Speaker 0>for this this is just one container

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:13.250
<v Speaker 0>because the group key is on fluent d,

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:14.930
<v Speaker 0>which is a container tag

00:16:15.329 --> 00:16:17.490
<v Speaker 0>and I should have multiple tables, yep, for

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:18.529
<v Speaker 0>each container.

00:16:19.889 --> 00:16:21.010
<v Speaker 0>So that is

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:21.730
<v Speaker 0>better.

00:16:25.634 --> 00:16:26.274
<v Speaker 0>This

00:16:27.714 --> 00:16:29.875
<v Speaker 0>I mean, it feels like

00:16:30.194 --> 00:16:33.074
<v Speaker 0>I shouldn't have any tables with one line.

00:16:33.074 --> 00:16:34.755
<v Speaker 0>Do I have a container that's only logged

00:16:34.755 --> 00:16:35.635
<v Speaker 0>one line?

00:16:36.274 --> 00:16:37.394
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.560
<v Speaker 0>Let's keep moving forward.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.960
<v Speaker 0>So if I then pivot now,

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.320
<v Speaker 0>we're back to one log line. Okay. So

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.360
<v Speaker 0>that's not right.

00:16:57.475 --> 00:17:00.355
<v Speaker 0>What am I not doing correctly here?

00:17:01.155 --> 00:17:02.355
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So the pivot,

00:17:04.049 --> 00:17:06.129
<v Speaker 0>working on fluent d.

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:11.489
<v Speaker 0>I think I need to

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:15.730
<v Speaker 0>add the time.

00:17:18.464 --> 00:17:20.704
<v Speaker 0>So if we throw in this,

00:17:21.265 --> 00:17:23.505
<v Speaker 0>I don't think these are needed right now.

00:17:26.224 --> 00:17:27.585
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's better.

00:17:28.545 --> 00:17:30.784
<v Speaker 0>Because obviously the timestamp is different.

00:17:31.025 --> 00:17:32.465
<v Speaker 0>We have a different role.

00:17:36.779 --> 00:17:38.459
<v Speaker 0>So we have

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.739
<v Speaker 0>something. Yeah. This is much better.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.835
<v Speaker 0>And I don't think I need the grip

00:17:45.835 --> 00:17:47.754
<v Speaker 0>but let's confirm here.

00:17:47.914 --> 00:17:49.114
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Perfect.

00:17:50.635 --> 00:17:51.354
<v Speaker 0>So

00:17:56.315 --> 00:17:58.075
<v Speaker 0>the group key already has

00:17:58.315 --> 00:17:59.434
<v Speaker 0>the measurement name there.

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:07.250
<v Speaker 0>We're good.

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:10.530
<v Speaker 0>I think that cleans up our series key.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:12.770
<v Speaker 0>We do that. I'll remove measurement

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:13.410
<v Speaker 0>per chance.

00:18:16.325 --> 00:18:18.965
<v Speaker 0>Yep. So we just got the d as

00:18:18.965 --> 00:18:20.965
<v Speaker 0>it's just a pod indicator.

00:18:22.565 --> 00:18:25.125
<v Speaker 0>We can do logs for each pod. Also,

00:18:25.125 --> 00:18:26.565
<v Speaker 0>we're getting a little bit

00:18:26.885 --> 00:18:27.524
<v Speaker 0>too

00:18:27.685 --> 00:18:29.125
<v Speaker 0>much information

00:18:29.125 --> 00:18:30.885
<v Speaker 0>at the moment. So

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.140
<v Speaker 0>let's try and work out what we actually

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:33.700
<v Speaker 0>want

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.220
<v Speaker 0>and we can use keep to do that.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.500
<v Speaker 0>I think it's just columns but

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.580
<v Speaker 0>we'll just do this.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:45.700
<v Speaker 0>Delete mine.

00:18:46.654 --> 00:18:48.014
<v Speaker 0>But it's columns.

00:18:48.654 --> 00:18:49.695
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So

00:18:51.855 --> 00:18:52.815
<v Speaker 0>we don't

00:18:53.855 --> 00:18:55.854
<v Speaker 0>need to keep this. This is here.

00:18:56.815 --> 00:18:58.014
<v Speaker 0>Start and stop.

00:18:58.975 --> 00:19:00.654
<v Speaker 0>No. I think I just want

00:19:00.975 --> 00:19:01.375
<v Speaker 0>time.

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:06.450
<v Speaker 0>Do I need to know the container ID?

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:11.090
<v Speaker 0>Might be handy.

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.250
<v Speaker 0>Do I want to know the container name?

00:19:16.075 --> 00:19:17.515
<v Speaker 0>I believe so.

00:19:19.995 --> 00:19:21.275
<v Speaker 0>So we'll keep that.

00:19:22.155 --> 00:19:23.995
<v Speaker 0>Do I need to know the host? I

00:19:23.995 --> 00:19:25.035
<v Speaker 0>believe that's viable.

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:32.229
<v Speaker 0>Do I need labels?

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:32.869
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:35.590
<v Speaker 0>At least not not right now. I don't

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:37.510
<v Speaker 0>need to know the name Swiss ID. No.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.350
<v Speaker 0>But the name Swiss name, I will keep

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:40.149
<v Speaker 0>a hold of that.

00:19:47.045 --> 00:19:48.485
<v Speaker 0>Have port ID.

00:19:53.845 --> 00:19:56.325
<v Speaker 0>Maybe I would rather the port ID than

00:19:56.325 --> 00:19:57.845
<v Speaker 0>the container ID.

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:00.559
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.240
<v Speaker 0>Let's do that. So we'll do Kubernetes,

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.640
<v Speaker 0>pod ID,

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.880
<v Speaker 0>with the container name,

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.880
<v Speaker 0>the host, the namespace.

00:20:11.375 --> 00:20:13.214
<v Speaker 0>We definitely need to log

00:20:16.495 --> 00:20:18.495
<v Speaker 0>and I may wish to filter on the

00:20:18.495 --> 00:20:18.975
<v Speaker 0>stream.

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.860
<v Speaker 0>Looks like maybe every finish is standard out,

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.219
<v Speaker 0>so maybe not. Okay.

00:20:30.539 --> 00:20:31.820
<v Speaker 0>We'll come back to that.

00:20:32.539 --> 00:20:33.899
<v Speaker 0>So if I had to go on this,

00:20:38.135 --> 00:20:40.375
<v Speaker 0>So I don't think maybe

00:20:40.375 --> 00:20:42.934
<v Speaker 0>like me not keeping that in.

00:20:43.815 --> 00:20:44.375
<v Speaker 0>We

00:20:45.815 --> 00:20:47.655
<v Speaker 0>can hide that on the table level though.

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:48.549
<v Speaker 0>So

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:50.790
<v Speaker 0>not too big a deal. So we can

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:51.830
<v Speaker 0>just go over here.

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:53.910
<v Speaker 0>We just see it on show.

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:58.470
<v Speaker 0>Let's sort by the time.

00:21:01.895 --> 00:21:04.854
<v Speaker 0>I'm still disappointed I can't pick the order,

00:21:04.934 --> 00:21:07.894
<v Speaker 0>but that where it's ascending or descending.

00:21:08.775 --> 00:21:10.934
<v Speaker 0>But that's a feature request that's been made

00:21:11.414 --> 00:21:12.455
<v Speaker 0>and

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.159
<v Speaker 0>we have the ability to view the logs.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.559
<v Speaker 0>So let's save this to fire.

00:21:20.399 --> 00:21:21.119
<v Speaker 0>Fire.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.440
<v Speaker 0>And we'll call this

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:26.799
<v Speaker 0>container

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:28.399
<v Speaker 0>logs.

00:21:31.665 --> 00:21:33.345
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna come back over here

00:21:34.225 --> 00:21:36.625
<v Speaker 0>and let's put it in a rather unhelpful

00:21:36.625 --> 00:21:39.184
<v Speaker 0>position, but it's okay. We'll move it.

00:21:39.825 --> 00:21:41.025
<v Speaker 0>Let's stick that here.

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:47.010
<v Speaker 0>And I just got a bit bigger.

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:52.049
<v Speaker 0>Oh, that's annoying.

00:21:57.410 --> 00:21:58.530
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Getting there.

00:22:01.625 --> 00:22:02.985
<v Speaker 0>I

00:22:06.025 --> 00:22:07.865
<v Speaker 0>think there needs to be like a little

00:22:08.665 --> 00:22:10.905
<v Speaker 0>maybe it's just my browser up. Yeah. There

00:22:10.905 --> 00:22:11.625
<v Speaker 0>we go.

00:22:12.745 --> 00:22:14.905
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:16.859
<v Speaker 0>now we can see that we have

00:22:18.539 --> 00:22:20.460
<v Speaker 0>our fluent d logs.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.340
<v Speaker 0>I should probably change the

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:25.020
<v Speaker 0>order of this.

00:22:28.725 --> 00:22:30.725
<v Speaker 0>So what do I want?

00:22:34.085 --> 00:22:36.885
<v Speaker 0>I'll start and stop aren't kept anyway. Measurement

00:22:36.885 --> 00:22:39.925
<v Speaker 0>isn't kept. Container ID wasn't kept. Container name.

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:42.980
<v Speaker 0>Put the host above that,

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.899
<v Speaker 0>labels aren't kept,

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:46.419
<v Speaker 0>that wasn't kept.

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:53.540
<v Speaker 0>Namespace name. So yeah, we'll have host, namespace

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:54.660
<v Speaker 0>name, container name,

00:22:55.985 --> 00:22:57.344
<v Speaker 0>pod ID,

00:23:03.664 --> 00:23:04.784
<v Speaker 0>pod name.

00:23:05.264 --> 00:23:08.225
<v Speaker 0>Don't think I'm doing anything with that. And

00:23:08.225 --> 00:23:09.904
<v Speaker 0>then we want to log

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.720
<v Speaker 0>Field value

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.200
<v Speaker 0>to one stream and let's get the time

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.880
<v Speaker 0>at the start. I want this to feel

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.520
<v Speaker 0>like actual

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.920
<v Speaker 0>I'm actually doing log data.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:22.800
<v Speaker 0>So

00:23:24.525 --> 00:23:25.245
<v Speaker 0>go.

00:23:28.445 --> 00:23:30.125
<v Speaker 0>Okay. I like it.

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:45.290
<v Speaker 0>The log actually has a timestamp and stuff

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:46.649
<v Speaker 0>in it too. That's

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:48.570
<v Speaker 0>particularly annoying.

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:52.650
<v Speaker 0>I'm sure the plug in

00:23:53.835 --> 00:23:55.434
<v Speaker 0>can clean that up.

00:23:59.275 --> 00:24:01.274
<v Speaker 0>But it's not important for now.

00:24:03.915 --> 00:24:06.235
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Really, I I wanna see

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.679
<v Speaker 0>much more of this.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.480
<v Speaker 0>What if we just remove some context then?

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:14.919
<v Speaker 0>Go away.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.880
<v Speaker 0>Just give me the time and the log.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.440
<v Speaker 0>Keep the log.

00:24:23.684 --> 00:24:25.284
<v Speaker 0>Woah. Don't do that.

00:24:25.924 --> 00:24:26.644
<v Speaker 0>Don't

00:24:26.884 --> 00:24:28.565
<v Speaker 0>I haven't even wait.

00:24:29.205 --> 00:24:30.325
<v Speaker 0>That doesn't help me.

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:35.969
<v Speaker 0>My computer's

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:37.889
<v Speaker 0>going a little bit slow.

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:40.450
<v Speaker 0>I can't resize that.

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:47.330
<v Speaker 0>I mean obviously the log is useless to

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:49.409
<v Speaker 0>me without the time, but the time is

00:24:49.805 --> 00:24:51.245
<v Speaker 0>well it's only on some.

00:24:55.245 --> 00:24:57.085
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Okay. There's a little bit of work

00:24:57.085 --> 00:24:58.445
<v Speaker 0>to be done here for sure.

00:25:00.445 --> 00:25:02.684
<v Speaker 0>The API server just has one.

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.659
<v Speaker 0>So the broken in it,

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:08.980
<v Speaker 0>kinda what I'm looking for.

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:14.580
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:15.620
<v Speaker 0>That's good.

00:25:17.665 --> 00:25:19.905
<v Speaker 0>Fluent d. I mean, I'm not particularly fussed

00:25:19.905 --> 00:25:21.505
<v Speaker 0>about edge logs anyway.

00:25:21.585 --> 00:25:23.345
<v Speaker 0>These are the ones that I care about.

00:25:23.345 --> 00:25:23.905
<v Speaker 0>So

00:25:24.385 --> 00:25:25.985
<v Speaker 0>I kinda have what I need for now.

00:25:25.985 --> 00:25:27.985
<v Speaker 0>I think it can be better. It could

00:25:27.985 --> 00:25:29.105
<v Speaker 0>and can be better.

00:25:32.159 --> 00:25:34.000
<v Speaker 0>So

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.359
<v Speaker 0>I'll need to get

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.599
<v Speaker 0>my typescript hands dirty

00:25:39.759 --> 00:25:41.360
<v Speaker 0>and try and provide the features we need

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.639
<v Speaker 0>to make log in a bit better. So

00:25:42.639 --> 00:25:44.879
<v Speaker 0>what I what I will say is

00:25:46.575 --> 00:25:47.774
<v Speaker 0>the table viewer

00:25:48.815 --> 00:25:52.654
<v Speaker 0>isn't for viewing and consuming log data. Right?

00:25:52.655 --> 00:25:54.414
<v Speaker 0>This is what I have to do right

00:25:54.414 --> 00:25:54.975
<v Speaker 0>now.

00:25:55.775 --> 00:25:59.294
<v Speaker 0>The team is working on supporting

00:25:59.294 --> 00:26:00.014
<v Speaker 0>the

00:26:00.414 --> 00:26:03.269
<v Speaker 0>an actual log viewer. Similar to what we

00:26:03.269 --> 00:26:05.429
<v Speaker 0>had in chronograph one.

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:08.149
<v Speaker 0>Log

00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.789
<v Speaker 0>viewer.

00:26:09.269 --> 00:26:11.669
<v Speaker 0>It just hasn't really been repurposed for two

00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:12.549
<v Speaker 0>point x yet.

00:26:15.265 --> 00:26:17.184
<v Speaker 0>So if you're not familiar with what we

00:26:17.184 --> 00:26:19.105
<v Speaker 0>had in one point x,

00:26:19.985 --> 00:26:21.825
<v Speaker 0>I don't think I can make that

00:26:22.385 --> 00:26:23.025
<v Speaker 0>bigger.

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.279
<v Speaker 0>You know, I had a nice log viewer.

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.360
<v Speaker 0>I had, you know, tools that handled syslog

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.920
<v Speaker 0>format by pulling in the severity and, you

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.160
<v Speaker 0>know, allowed you to kind of the logs

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.240
<v Speaker 0>would move as you moved across

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.480
<v Speaker 0>the x y plots, the graphs.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:41.360
<v Speaker 0>So

00:26:42.895 --> 00:26:44.174
<v Speaker 0>this is just what I have to do

00:26:44.174 --> 00:26:46.174
<v Speaker 0>right now and not something that I'm telling

00:26:46.174 --> 00:26:48.174
<v Speaker 0>you would be part of your final solution.

00:26:48.174 --> 00:26:50.174
<v Speaker 0>Obviously two point X is still in beta,

00:26:50.174 --> 00:26:52.815
<v Speaker 0>lots of improvements to come and this definitely

00:26:52.815 --> 00:26:54.255
<v Speaker 0>needs a little bit of loving.

00:26:57.429 --> 00:26:59.269
<v Speaker 0>But for the time being, you know, as

00:26:59.269 --> 00:27:01.269
<v Speaker 0>we're just really trying to put together a

00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:02.070
<v Speaker 0>dashboard.

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:04.470
<v Speaker 0>So let's talk about the Kubernetes monitoring aspect

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:05.190
<v Speaker 0>first.

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:06.070
<v Speaker 0>Right.

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.990
<v Speaker 0>So

00:27:09.715 --> 00:27:11.315
<v Speaker 0>there are three components

00:27:11.634 --> 00:27:12.514
<v Speaker 0>needed

00:27:12.835 --> 00:27:15.954
<v Speaker 0>for production grade monitoring of Kubernetes.

00:27:18.595 --> 00:27:21.154
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes runs on hardware

00:27:21.154 --> 00:27:22.434
<v Speaker 0>even if it's virtualized.

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.520
<v Speaker 0>So what doesn't go away because you're using

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:29.040
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes is understanding how to monitor the bare

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.799
<v Speaker 0>metal or the VMs.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.960
<v Speaker 0>And we have dashboards for that.

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.240
<v Speaker 0>You know, Linux system dashboard gives us a

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.040
<v Speaker 0>way to look

00:27:37.534 --> 00:27:40.015
<v Speaker 0>at, you know, our CPU usage. We've got

00:27:40.015 --> 00:27:41.934
<v Speaker 0>load, processes, swap,

00:27:42.095 --> 00:27:43.695
<v Speaker 0>desks, network.

00:27:44.015 --> 00:27:46.654
<v Speaker 0>None of that changes. You know, Brendan Greg's

00:27:46.654 --> 00:27:48.815
<v Speaker 0>use framework is still the de facto standard

00:27:48.815 --> 00:27:49.455
<v Speaker 0>here.

00:27:50.735 --> 00:27:52.799
<v Speaker 0>We're just understanding the host. And if you

00:27:52.799 --> 00:27:54.879
<v Speaker 0>keep your host healthy and happy,

00:27:55.759 --> 00:27:57.200
<v Speaker 0>then you're then

00:27:57.679 --> 00:28:00.080
<v Speaker 0>really just focusing on the other two components

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.320
<v Speaker 0>of the Kubernetes monitoring experience.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.440
<v Speaker 0>The third component, I'll skip the second for

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:05.919
<v Speaker 0>now

00:28:06.255 --> 00:28:08.495
<v Speaker 0>Is the application and service layer.

00:28:09.375 --> 00:28:09.934
<v Speaker 0>And

00:28:11.055 --> 00:28:11.855
<v Speaker 0>again,

00:28:12.495 --> 00:28:13.375
<v Speaker 0>we're

00:28:13.375 --> 00:28:16.015
<v Speaker 0>not reinventing the wheel there either.

00:28:16.335 --> 00:28:19.455
<v Speaker 0>So we're still using either four golden signals

00:28:19.455 --> 00:28:22.110
<v Speaker 0>if you've read the Google SRE book, the

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:24.590
<v Speaker 0>red method, if you're familiar with the work

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:25.309
<v Speaker 0>of

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:27.309
<v Speaker 0>Tom Welke.

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:31.310
<v Speaker 0>You know, understanding your application through requests, errors,

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:32.750
<v Speaker 0>duration, saturation.

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:35.710
<v Speaker 0>That is still really important there.

00:28:36.475 --> 00:28:38.794
<v Speaker 0>So when we actually talk about Kubernetes monitoring,

00:28:38.794 --> 00:28:40.554
<v Speaker 0>we're talking about this little bit in the

00:28:40.554 --> 00:28:41.195
<v Speaker 0>middle,

00:28:41.995 --> 00:28:43.355
<v Speaker 0>which is just understanding

00:28:43.355 --> 00:28:44.075
<v Speaker 0>that

00:28:44.235 --> 00:28:46.955
<v Speaker 0>controller loop, the reconciliation loop that happens within

00:28:46.955 --> 00:28:47.754
<v Speaker 0>the cluster.

00:28:48.475 --> 00:28:50.635
<v Speaker 0>So really all we want from this Kubernetes

00:28:50.635 --> 00:28:51.835
<v Speaker 0>fire dashboard

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:52.850
<v Speaker 0>is,

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:55.330
<v Speaker 0>I mean, on very basic level for now

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:57.490
<v Speaker 0>is to understand, do we have pods aren't

00:28:57.490 --> 00:28:59.330
<v Speaker 0>running that we want to be running? Now,

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:00.770
<v Speaker 0>yes, there's other stuff I'm gonna add in

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:01.250
<v Speaker 0>here.

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:03.330
<v Speaker 0>I wanna understand the

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:05.090
<v Speaker 0>PVCs.

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:07.434
<v Speaker 0>I wanna know what PVCs are unbound, why

00:29:07.434 --> 00:29:09.595
<v Speaker 0>they're unbound. I wanna know if those PVCs

00:29:09.595 --> 00:29:11.754
<v Speaker 0>are approaching capacity.

00:29:11.995 --> 00:29:13.515
<v Speaker 0>I wanna try and do that proactively as

00:29:13.515 --> 00:29:15.835
<v Speaker 0>possible. So we're trying to linear protections to

00:29:15.835 --> 00:29:17.115
<v Speaker 0>to protect

00:29:18.395 --> 00:29:19.595
<v Speaker 0>those desks filling up.

00:29:20.429 --> 00:29:22.990
<v Speaker 0>We wanna predict that in office hours whatever

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:24.349
<v Speaker 0>those mean for your team

00:29:24.669 --> 00:29:25.549
<v Speaker 0>versus

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:27.309
<v Speaker 0>getting woken up at 3AM.

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:29.549
<v Speaker 0>That's

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:31.950
<v Speaker 0>the goal. We're not gonna do PVCs today

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:33.070
<v Speaker 0>but there will be a video on that

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:34.815
<v Speaker 0>I guess within the next week as we

00:29:34.815 --> 00:29:36.335
<v Speaker 0>kinda mature this dashboard.

00:29:36.975 --> 00:29:39.535
<v Speaker 0>But for our pods solution right now, we

00:29:39.535 --> 00:29:42.414
<v Speaker 0>do have the ability to alert and detect

00:29:42.415 --> 00:29:44.575
<v Speaker 0>when we have a reconciliation

00:29:44.575 --> 00:29:47.294
<v Speaker 0>problem. Something cannot be started or scheduled.

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:50.910
<v Speaker 0>And we have the reasons. We made the

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:53.470
<v Speaker 0>changes to the telegraph plugin for that yesterday.

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:57.150
<v Speaker 0>We know we have pod initializing problem here.

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:02.830
<v Speaker 0>We have the container pod logs.

00:30:04.285 --> 00:30:06.605
<v Speaker 0>We know that it can't initialize because it's

00:30:06.605 --> 00:30:09.404
<v Speaker 0>looking for a service that doesn't exist.

00:30:09.885 --> 00:30:11.804
<v Speaker 0>So on this one dashboard,

00:30:11.885 --> 00:30:13.565
<v Speaker 0>we have identified a problem.

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.480
<v Speaker 0>We know which pods we need to look

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.720
<v Speaker 0>at. We know what the status of that

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:22.679
<v Speaker 0>pod is.

00:30:22.919 --> 00:30:25.000
<v Speaker 0>We can filter the container logs on that

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:25.639
<v Speaker 0>pod

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.640
<v Speaker 0>and we have the error message right in

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.720
<v Speaker 0>front of us with not a lot of

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:30.440
<v Speaker 0>vertical scroll.

00:30:32.555 --> 00:30:33.995
<v Speaker 0>So to fix this,

00:30:37.115 --> 00:30:40.395
<v Speaker 0>my broken deployment, I kept in a different

00:30:40.395 --> 00:30:42.635
<v Speaker 0>folder because we were using a really good

00:30:42.635 --> 00:30:44.315
<v Speaker 0>example library from Ian.

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:47.889
<v Speaker 0>GitHub

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:50.929
<v Speaker 0>Ian, Kubernetes examples.

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:54.369
<v Speaker 0>We deployed the broken in it.

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:57.410
<v Speaker 0>We can pop that open.

00:31:08.455 --> 00:31:09.734
<v Speaker 0>And we know

00:31:10.695 --> 00:31:12.695
<v Speaker 0>I'm sorry. This is very contrived example.

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:14.929
<v Speaker 0>We know that service

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:16.370
<v Speaker 0>doesn't exist.

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:18.210
<v Speaker 0>We know that it's in the in the

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:19.010
<v Speaker 0>container.

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:22.370
<v Speaker 0>So this is an easy fix.

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:24.930
<v Speaker 0>I'm not going to replace this. I mean,

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:26.610
<v Speaker 0>if we wanted to fix this, I could

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:27.490
<v Speaker 0>fix the host name.

00:31:31.085 --> 00:31:33.085
<v Speaker 0>Google.com.

00:31:33.245 --> 00:31:34.845
<v Speaker 0>Maybe that's what I meant.

00:31:36.205 --> 00:31:37.405
<v Speaker 0>Or maybe not, but.

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.340
<v Speaker 0>And we can apply.

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:51.500
<v Speaker 0>So we run a watcher.

00:32:04.325 --> 00:32:06.005
<v Speaker 0>And if we come back to our dashboard

00:32:06.005 --> 00:32:06.404
<v Speaker 0>here.

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:10.290
<v Speaker 0>We have our five second refresh on.

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:13.170
<v Speaker 0>Pod waiting pods have gone up. That's okay.

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:14.450
<v Speaker 0>I

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:17.970
<v Speaker 0>would expect this to drop as those

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:20.130
<v Speaker 0>metrics come in.

00:32:22.965 --> 00:32:24.804
<v Speaker 0>One says with a slight

00:32:25.684 --> 00:32:27.364
<v Speaker 0>bit of hope in his voice.

00:32:31.845 --> 00:32:33.605
<v Speaker 0>So I think that's just because we're waiting

00:32:33.605 --> 00:32:35.924
<v Speaker 0>on those old ones terminating there.

00:32:36.325 --> 00:32:37.924
<v Speaker 0>So this was the two new ones we

00:32:37.924 --> 00:32:40.630
<v Speaker 0>spun up, which became healthy, dropped back down,

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:42.150
<v Speaker 0>and then we're waiting for the two old

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:43.750
<v Speaker 0>ones to be cleaned up.

00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:46.150
<v Speaker 0>The old replica set to be removed.

00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:49.190
<v Speaker 0>Terminating. Terminating.

00:32:51.475 --> 00:32:53.955
<v Speaker 0>I'm

00:32:53.955 --> 00:32:54.594
<v Speaker 0>happy.

00:32:56.595 --> 00:32:57.394
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:32:57.794 --> 00:32:58.514
<v Speaker 0>So

00:32:59.475 --> 00:33:01.955
<v Speaker 0>as a dashboard for debugging,

00:33:01.955 --> 00:33:03.394
<v Speaker 0>I think we're making good progress.

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:07.789
<v Speaker 0>We still wanna clean up these numbers.

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:11.950
<v Speaker 0>I don't want a total over the last

00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:13.070
<v Speaker 0>five minutes.

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:15.790
<v Speaker 0>I really just want what is waiting now.

00:33:17.795 --> 00:33:19.315
<v Speaker 0>But I do have a graph that shows

00:33:19.315 --> 00:33:21.955
<v Speaker 0>me that. So it's not my most pressing

00:33:21.955 --> 00:33:23.875
<v Speaker 0>concern. Now I only have an hour to

00:33:23.875 --> 00:33:25.715
<v Speaker 0>stream today which means I have twenty nine

00:33:25.715 --> 00:33:27.635
<v Speaker 0>minutes left before I have a meeting.

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:31.180
<v Speaker 0>So what I want to do next is

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:32.620
<v Speaker 0>take a look at vector.

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.659
<v Speaker 0>So what we've deployed here

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:37.580
<v Speaker 0>and again,

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:39.740
<v Speaker 0>have you have you seen yesterday's video, you

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:41.340
<v Speaker 0>know, I'm not happy with what we had

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:42.700
<v Speaker 0>to put together to deploy this.

00:33:44.595 --> 00:33:46.434
<v Speaker 0>We had to build our own flow of

00:33:46.434 --> 00:33:48.995
<v Speaker 0>the image. We had to configure all of

00:33:48.995 --> 00:33:51.955
<v Speaker 0>the Kubernetes stuff and the InfluxDB stuff and

00:33:51.955 --> 00:33:52.994
<v Speaker 0>the stuff.

00:33:54.515 --> 00:33:55.794
<v Speaker 0>It was quite a lot of effort.

00:33:57.610 --> 00:33:59.690
<v Speaker 0>And I want to make that easier.

00:34:01.049 --> 00:34:01.690
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:03.769
<v Speaker 0>I wanna make that a lot a lot

00:34:03.769 --> 00:34:04.649
<v Speaker 0>easier.

00:34:06.169 --> 00:34:08.010
<v Speaker 0>So I think my stream

00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:10.969
<v Speaker 0>won't be tomorrow.

00:34:11.755 --> 00:34:12.554
<v Speaker 0>Tomorrow

00:34:12.795 --> 00:34:14.875
<v Speaker 0>our company has given us time off for

00:34:14.875 --> 00:34:15.755
<v Speaker 0>Juneteenth.

00:34:16.554 --> 00:34:18.074
<v Speaker 0>A lot of us in the company have

00:34:18.074 --> 00:34:20.474
<v Speaker 0>decided to use the day to read up

00:34:20.474 --> 00:34:21.195
<v Speaker 0>on

00:34:21.915 --> 00:34:23.994
<v Speaker 0>on history and educate ourselves more in the

00:34:23.994 --> 00:34:25.355
<v Speaker 0>current situation around the world.

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:27.750
<v Speaker 0>So I won't be streaming.

00:34:28.390 --> 00:34:29.990
<v Speaker 0>So maybe on Monday,

00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:33.590
<v Speaker 0>we will clean up the fluid deployment so

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:34.950
<v Speaker 0>that I can package up in a really

00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:37.190
<v Speaker 0>nice fashion for you all to consume.

00:34:40.914 --> 00:34:42.594
<v Speaker 0>So what I want to do next,

00:34:44.434 --> 00:34:46.514
<v Speaker 0>and I'm just gonna we don't need any

00:34:46.514 --> 00:34:47.795
<v Speaker 0>of this running now.

00:34:48.994 --> 00:34:50.915
<v Speaker 0>Clear screen, close tab.

00:34:51.234 --> 00:34:52.915
<v Speaker 0>What I wanna do is see

00:34:53.315 --> 00:34:55.234
<v Speaker 0>I can't put forward, which is why this

00:34:55.234 --> 00:34:55.875
<v Speaker 0>has disappeared.

00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:00.150
<v Speaker 0>What I want to have a go at

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:02.470
<v Speaker 0>now is can I deploy vector? I have

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:04.630
<v Speaker 0>never used vector before. I think it looks

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:05.510
<v Speaker 0>really cool.

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:08.230
<v Speaker 0>I like, if I believe correctly, it's written

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.710
<v Speaker 0>in Rust.

00:35:09.865 --> 00:35:12.265
<v Speaker 0>Rust is the new shiny language that I'm

00:35:12.265 --> 00:35:14.585
<v Speaker 0>trying to get familiar with and good at.

00:35:18.585 --> 00:35:20.745
<v Speaker 0>I like their website. It shouldn't be a

00:35:20.745 --> 00:35:22.585
<v Speaker 0>decision factor, but it kinda is.

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:24.860
<v Speaker 0>I like this graph that shows it is

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:25.660
<v Speaker 0>super

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:27.580
<v Speaker 0>good with the disk IO.

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:30.300
<v Speaker 0>I find it weird that they hide the

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:32.300
<v Speaker 0>fact, not hide I guess because as on

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:33.980
<v Speaker 0>the page but it's just not the default,

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:35.980
<v Speaker 0>know. Sell your best self first to guess.

00:35:36.755 --> 00:35:38.835
<v Speaker 0>From memory consumption point of view is really

00:35:38.835 --> 00:35:41.235
<v Speaker 0>good. Little right behind file beat. And from

00:35:41.235 --> 00:35:43.075
<v Speaker 0>a CPU, seems to be kinda middle of

00:35:43.075 --> 00:35:45.315
<v Speaker 0>the road. Flint D and Flint B actually

00:35:45.315 --> 00:35:47.555
<v Speaker 0>surprised me better. I wouldn't have thought that.

00:35:48.515 --> 00:35:51.155
<v Speaker 0>Of course, this is a particular use case.

00:35:51.235 --> 00:35:52.720
<v Speaker 0>You know, if we

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:55.920
<v Speaker 0>pop along, it does change.

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.240
<v Speaker 0>Fluent bit is surprisingly fast. It is written

00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:58.960
<v Speaker 0>in C.

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.440
<v Speaker 0>And the reason I'm not going to try

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.960
<v Speaker 0>and get a fluent bit to work in

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:03.520
<v Speaker 0>the cluster

00:36:04.345 --> 00:36:05.385
<v Speaker 0>is

00:36:05.705 --> 00:36:06.985
<v Speaker 0>there's not a

00:36:07.225 --> 00:36:08.025
<v Speaker 0>plugin

00:36:08.185 --> 00:36:10.505
<v Speaker 0>that would allow me to write to InfluxDB

00:36:10.505 --> 00:36:11.225
<v Speaker 0>two.

00:36:11.865 --> 00:36:14.265
<v Speaker 0>There's no c client library, which means I

00:36:14.265 --> 00:36:16.025
<v Speaker 0>would have to be straight up using a

00:36:16.025 --> 00:36:17.785
<v Speaker 0>c http library

00:36:18.425 --> 00:36:21.089
<v Speaker 0>too much move too many moving parts. I

00:36:21.089 --> 00:36:22.369
<v Speaker 0>don't wanna do that. So

00:36:23.089 --> 00:36:25.329
<v Speaker 0>for the next twenty six minutes now, we

00:36:25.329 --> 00:36:27.490
<v Speaker 0>are gonna do our best and our damnedest

00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:29.089
<v Speaker 0>to deploy vector.

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:31.730
<v Speaker 0>First things first.

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:33.809
<v Speaker 0>Do we have a docker image?

00:36:46.385 --> 00:36:50.464
<v Speaker 0>Maybe I should search

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.680
<v Speaker 0>timber

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.280
<v Speaker 0>vector.

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.720
<v Speaker 0>So if I do u

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:55.920
<v Speaker 0>10

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.160
<v Speaker 0>I mean, that's a long shot, isn't it?

00:37:03.805 --> 00:37:05.565
<v Speaker 0>I got interested when I seen the fluent

00:37:05.565 --> 00:37:07.005
<v Speaker 0>d there, but it just I think it's

00:37:07.005 --> 00:37:08.125
<v Speaker 0>just just

00:37:08.925 --> 00:37:09.725
<v Speaker 0>a

00:37:10.125 --> 00:37:11.085
<v Speaker 0>bit random.

00:37:11.725 --> 00:37:12.525
<v Speaker 0>Timber IO.

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:16.200
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.120
<v Speaker 0>There you go. Second time lucky.

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:21.240
<v Speaker 0>So we do have an image.

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:23.800
<v Speaker 0>So let's copy this.

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.720
<v Speaker 0>Now, I did

00:37:28.395 --> 00:37:29.515
<v Speaker 0>I did what?

00:37:29.675 --> 00:37:30.795
<v Speaker 0>Timber

00:37:31.435 --> 00:37:32.315
<v Speaker 0>vector

00:37:32.555 --> 00:37:33.355
<v Speaker 0>dev

00:37:36.315 --> 00:37:37.835
<v Speaker 0>deployment. I don't think there's gonna be a

00:37:37.835 --> 00:37:39.915
<v Speaker 0>health chart, do you? I don't.

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.200
<v Speaker 0>I'll check.

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.120
<v Speaker 0>I think I did check.

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.280
<v Speaker 0>Or was I looking for something else? Who

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:49.840
<v Speaker 0>knows?

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.520
<v Speaker 0>Who knows?

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:52.400
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.160
<v Speaker 0>So really

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:55.120
<v Speaker 0>simple deployment.

00:37:58.765 --> 00:38:00.125
<v Speaker 0>What do we need to do?

00:38:02.845 --> 00:38:05.805
<v Speaker 0>So we can pass a custom configuration fail

00:38:07.165 --> 00:38:07.965
<v Speaker 0>because

00:38:07.965 --> 00:38:09.165
<v Speaker 0>the default

00:38:09.165 --> 00:38:11.245
<v Speaker 0>doesn't do anything

00:38:11.725 --> 00:38:12.285
<v Speaker 0>nice.

00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:15.250
<v Speaker 0>I'm okay with that.

00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:17.329
<v Speaker 0>I'm

00:38:17.329 --> 00:38:19.890
<v Speaker 0>gonna deploy the nation in Alpine one though.

00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:24.850
<v Speaker 0>And

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:28.690
<v Speaker 0>let's take a look at this

00:38:29.075 --> 00:38:30.755
<v Speaker 0>config doc then.

00:38:31.315 --> 00:38:32.915
<v Speaker 0>Where do I need to put this?

00:38:35.954 --> 00:38:38.515
<v Speaker 0>Fetra vector default toml.

00:38:38.674 --> 00:38:41.555
<v Speaker 0>Oh, so that is their default. Gotcha. Okay.

00:38:43.234 --> 00:38:45.860
<v Speaker 0>So let's add a config map.

00:39:00.705 --> 00:39:01.905
<v Speaker 0>V one

00:39:02.625 --> 00:39:03.505
<v Speaker 0>config.

00:39:03.505 --> 00:39:05.745
<v Speaker 0>Oh, now you're offering me a config then.

00:39:05.745 --> 00:39:06.305
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

00:39:09.665 --> 00:39:11.025
<v Speaker 0>vector dot pommel.

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:18.140
<v Speaker 0>Oh, is that just

00:39:22.059 --> 00:39:22.940
<v Speaker 0>there we go.

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:27.900
<v Speaker 0>Stuff. Okay. Alright. We've got a conflict now.

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:34.175
<v Speaker 0>So I already have an examples folder that

00:39:34.175 --> 00:39:35.215
<v Speaker 0>makes me happy.

00:39:36.735 --> 00:39:38.495
<v Speaker 0>Less I have to do,

00:39:39.215 --> 00:39:40.575
<v Speaker 0>the happier I am.

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:47.930
<v Speaker 0>I was hoping there would be Kubernetes

00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:49.050
<v Speaker 0>example.

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:50.730
<v Speaker 0>So let's click on

00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:57.530
<v Speaker 0>let's click on sources.

00:40:00.255 --> 00:40:01.934
<v Speaker 0>We wanted to log, so I'll look at

00:40:01.934 --> 00:40:04.015
<v Speaker 0>it as a metric collector layer.

00:40:09.694 --> 00:40:10.015
<v Speaker 0>Docker.

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:22.280
<v Speaker 0>So that would require me to mount in

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:26.120
<v Speaker 0>the docker socket

00:40:28.715 --> 00:40:29.755
<v Speaker 0>from

00:40:34.475 --> 00:40:35.755
<v Speaker 0>and the deployment.

00:40:35.755 --> 00:40:36.715
<v Speaker 0>We probably

00:40:37.275 --> 00:40:38.955
<v Speaker 0>want to run that as a daemon set,

00:40:38.955 --> 00:40:41.035
<v Speaker 0>not deployment, meant under docker socket.

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:46.030
<v Speaker 0>But wouldn't be ubiquitous. A lot of people

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:47.550
<v Speaker 0>don't use

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:50.190
<v Speaker 0>Docker run time by default anymore.

00:40:51.869 --> 00:40:53.310
<v Speaker 0>So let's not do that.

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:56.270
<v Speaker 0>Would

00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:57.950
<v Speaker 0>have been nice if there was a

00:40:59.025 --> 00:41:00.545
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes option,

00:41:00.545 --> 00:41:02.385
<v Speaker 0>but I guess they just want us to

00:41:02.385 --> 00:41:04.225
<v Speaker 0>use the fail from that.

00:41:06.305 --> 00:41:08.305
<v Speaker 0>So we could just point it at the

00:41:08.305 --> 00:41:09.265
<v Speaker 0>directory.

00:41:09.345 --> 00:41:10.305
<v Speaker 0>Let's try that.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.840
<v Speaker 0>So drop this.

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:19.880
<v Speaker 0>Don't need to use list comments.

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.119
<v Speaker 0>Type fail.

00:41:22.119 --> 00:41:24.200
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna call this Kubernetes.

00:41:25.425 --> 00:41:26.865
<v Speaker 0>File collector,

00:41:27.185 --> 00:41:28.785
<v Speaker 0>optional, no default,

00:41:28.865 --> 00:41:30.145
<v Speaker 0>ignore older.

00:41:32.625 --> 00:41:34.625
<v Speaker 0>Let's just collect everything.

00:41:36.305 --> 00:41:38.465
<v Speaker 0>Where did those live? File, log

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:40.450
<v Speaker 0>containers.

00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:43.250
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully,

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:45.250
<v Speaker 0>that persistent offset.

00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:50.530
<v Speaker 0>Let's just remove that. Let's confirm what those

00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:53.650
<v Speaker 0>logs are first. So many cube

00:41:54.245 --> 00:41:55.205
<v Speaker 0>SSH.

00:41:55.205 --> 00:41:55.685
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:41:56.325 --> 00:41:57.445
<v Speaker 0>Bar, let,

00:41:58.725 --> 00:41:59.685
<v Speaker 0>containers.

00:42:00.565 --> 00:42:01.365
<v Speaker 0>Nope.

00:42:02.485 --> 00:42:03.605
<v Speaker 0>Bar log

00:42:04.325 --> 00:42:05.285
<v Speaker 0>containers.

00:42:05.525 --> 00:42:07.045
<v Speaker 0>Yep. Start out log.

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:09.330
<v Speaker 0>Let's just tail.

00:42:10.289 --> 00:42:11.890
<v Speaker 0>Acube controller manager.

00:42:25.115 --> 00:42:25.835
<v Speaker 0>And

00:42:27.275 --> 00:42:29.515
<v Speaker 0>it's JSON structured.

00:42:31.915 --> 00:42:32.955
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:35.800
<v Speaker 0>So

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.000
<v Speaker 0>next.

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.240
<v Speaker 0>What is it?

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.160
<v Speaker 0>Lots of options.

00:42:49.335 --> 00:42:51.095
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Hard passer now.

00:42:52.455 --> 00:42:53.735
<v Speaker 0>Definitely interesting.

00:42:54.375 --> 00:42:56.935
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's keep moving. So now that we

00:42:56.935 --> 00:42:57.575
<v Speaker 0>have

00:42:58.055 --> 00:43:01.230
<v Speaker 0>assuming that can I just out put

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:02.830
<v Speaker 0>syncs,

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:05.390
<v Speaker 0>log syncs?

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:11.550
<v Speaker 0>I might just do console for now. I

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:12.270
<v Speaker 0>just wanna

00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:14.350
<v Speaker 0>get this working.

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:15.470
<v Speaker 0>Make sure it

00:43:16.545 --> 00:43:18.224
<v Speaker 0>so I can get our feedback loop going.

00:43:18.224 --> 00:43:19.825
<v Speaker 0>I wanna get this running as quickly as

00:43:19.825 --> 00:43:22.385
<v Speaker 0>possible consuming, I'll put into our console. I'll

00:43:22.385 --> 00:43:24.145
<v Speaker 0>just tell the logs and vector

00:43:24.704 --> 00:43:26.464
<v Speaker 0>and I'll run it as a deployment on

00:43:26.464 --> 00:43:28.704
<v Speaker 0>one node for now and we'll see what's

00:43:28.704 --> 00:43:30.625
<v Speaker 0>happening because I think I'm gonna have to

00:43:30.625 --> 00:43:32.770
<v Speaker 0>play with these transformation functions

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:37.250
<v Speaker 0>to do something with the JSON,

00:43:39.569 --> 00:43:40.690
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming.

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:43.650
<v Speaker 0>So sync console

00:43:45.089 --> 00:43:45.569
<v Speaker 0>inputs.

00:43:50.265 --> 00:43:51.305
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes.

00:43:51.305 --> 00:43:52.665
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if it wants source dot

00:43:52.665 --> 00:43:53.465
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes.

00:43:54.905 --> 00:43:56.665
<v Speaker 0>Let's assume maybe.

00:43:57.465 --> 00:43:59.065
<v Speaker 0>Right. Just standard out.

00:44:00.585 --> 00:44:01.945
<v Speaker 0>This is required.

00:44:01.945 --> 00:44:04.250
<v Speaker 0>So let's just leave it as is.

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:08.330
<v Speaker 0>And then we wanna mount this into our

00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:09.610
<v Speaker 0>deployment.

00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:10.250
<v Speaker 0>So

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:12.970
<v Speaker 0>volumes,

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:13.850
<v Speaker 0>name,

00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:15.130
<v Speaker 0>config,

00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:17.369
<v Speaker 0>config map,

00:44:19.105 --> 00:44:20.065
<v Speaker 0>name,

00:44:22.065 --> 00:44:23.025
<v Speaker 0>enter

00:44:23.505 --> 00:44:24.385
<v Speaker 0>config.

00:44:27.105 --> 00:44:28.625
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. No need to be.

00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:33.820
<v Speaker 0>Volume,

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:34.380
<v Speaker 0>etcetera,

00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:40.140
<v Speaker 0>vector,

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:40.780
<v Speaker 0>config,

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:42.220
<v Speaker 0>toml.

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:44.380
<v Speaker 0>Maybe

00:44:48.605 --> 00:44:50.205
<v Speaker 0>Vector dot TOML.

00:44:54.525 --> 00:44:56.045
<v Speaker 0>I don't think that's right.

00:44:57.645 --> 00:44:58.365
<v Speaker 0>Name,

00:44:59.645 --> 00:45:00.365
<v Speaker 0>config

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:06.660
<v Speaker 0>one.

00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:10.180
<v Speaker 0>Cool. Let's

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:12.980
<v Speaker 0>I think let's just go for it.

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:16.180
<v Speaker 0>For a config map,

00:45:18.095 --> 00:45:19.295
<v Speaker 0>deploy the deployment.

00:45:21.214 --> 00:45:22.415
<v Speaker 0>See what happens.

00:45:23.135 --> 00:45:24.494
<v Speaker 0>So right now it's gonna be pulling down

00:45:24.494 --> 00:45:25.295
<v Speaker 0>the image.

00:45:28.815 --> 00:45:31.790
<v Speaker 0>And I have seventeen minutes before my meeting.

00:45:33.310 --> 00:45:34.270
<v Speaker 0>Drats.

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:35.470
<v Speaker 0>What I get wrong?

00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:40.110
<v Speaker 0>I mean, should we use my dashboard?

00:45:48.225 --> 00:45:50.865
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I could describe it, but you

00:45:50.865 --> 00:45:52.545
<v Speaker 0>know, we're building this for a reason and

00:45:52.545 --> 00:45:54.385
<v Speaker 0>if I don't find it useful, other people

00:45:54.385 --> 00:45:55.745
<v Speaker 0>won't find it useful.

00:45:59.105 --> 00:46:00.065
<v Speaker 0>Broken part.

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:04.820
<v Speaker 0>We have a

00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:07.460
<v Speaker 0>run container error.

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:10.740
<v Speaker 0>Where are my logs?

00:46:18.234 --> 00:46:20.954
<v Speaker 0>There won't be any logs. So there we

00:46:20.954 --> 00:46:21.515
<v Speaker 0>go.

00:46:21.915 --> 00:46:24.155
<v Speaker 0>I know there's a run container error,

00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:29.490
<v Speaker 0>but I'm not getting the message.

00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:32.050
<v Speaker 0>Do I have did I add that field

00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:33.090
<v Speaker 0>to telegraph?

00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:37.730
<v Speaker 0>So let's we're gonna have to keep

00:46:38.290 --> 00:46:39.090
<v Speaker 0>and see.

00:46:43.205 --> 00:46:44.405
<v Speaker 0>So I've got

00:46:45.125 --> 00:46:47.365
<v Speaker 0>we wanna move remove that field.

00:46:51.445 --> 00:46:52.645
<v Speaker 0>And terminated reason.

00:46:56.350 --> 00:46:57.790
<v Speaker 0>Restart state

00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:59.550
<v Speaker 0>code, state reason we have

00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:04.910
<v Speaker 0>alright. I think we can make another change

00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:06.750
<v Speaker 0>to telegraph layer

00:47:07.005 --> 00:47:07.805
<v Speaker 0>because

00:47:07.805 --> 00:47:10.685
<v Speaker 0>we're obviously missing some context that I want.

00:47:11.404 --> 00:47:14.924
<v Speaker 0>That context should be here when I describe

00:47:14.924 --> 00:47:16.125
<v Speaker 0>the pod.

00:47:16.684 --> 00:47:17.005
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:21.800
<v Speaker 0>I want this.

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:24.440
<v Speaker 0>Although these are the cubelet logs. So

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:26.920
<v Speaker 0>I probably do have them.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:29.800
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:34.440
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:47:35.415 --> 00:47:38.295
<v Speaker 0>There's something we need to work on. Okay.

00:47:38.295 --> 00:47:40.375
<v Speaker 0>But my mount is wrong. Let's fix that

00:47:40.375 --> 00:47:41.015
<v Speaker 0>first.

00:47:42.855 --> 00:47:45.335
<v Speaker 0>So the problem is my config map, although

00:47:45.335 --> 00:47:46.695
<v Speaker 0>only has one key

00:47:47.015 --> 00:47:49.415
<v Speaker 0>and we should specify the sub path.

00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:55.630
<v Speaker 0>I only wanna mount vector dot toml.

00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:58.110
<v Speaker 0>That should

00:48:00.829 --> 00:48:01.790
<v Speaker 0>hopefully

00:48:01.869 --> 00:48:02.510
<v Speaker 0>fix it.

00:48:06.954 --> 00:48:08.155
<v Speaker 0>Container creating.

00:48:09.994 --> 00:48:11.675
<v Speaker 0>And we still got an adder.

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:21.080
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:23.640
<v Speaker 0>So something wrong with our config, is that

00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:24.920
<v Speaker 0>in my dashboard?

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:28.120
<v Speaker 0>Just a hard refresh.

00:48:32.945 --> 00:48:34.865
<v Speaker 0>Contain an impact. Alright. Good.

00:48:37.745 --> 00:48:38.865
<v Speaker 0>Oh, wait. That's

00:48:39.265 --> 00:48:40.225
<v Speaker 0>that's the Y.

00:48:40.305 --> 00:48:41.905
<v Speaker 0>I'll crash look back off.

00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:47.950
<v Speaker 0>Why is fluent d

00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:50.670
<v Speaker 0>not giving me all of my log data?

00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:52.270
<v Speaker 0>It didn't give me the cubelet.

00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:56.670
<v Speaker 0>And it's not giving me vector.

00:48:58.164 --> 00:49:00.724
<v Speaker 0>I wonder if there's just a delay

00:49:01.525 --> 00:49:02.405
<v Speaker 0>from

00:49:03.605 --> 00:49:05.125
<v Speaker 0>bucket. Let's

00:49:05.285 --> 00:49:06.085
<v Speaker 0>telegraph

00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:11.650
<v Speaker 0>range.

00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:13.810
<v Speaker 0>I'm just gonna do this very quickly so

00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:15.810
<v Speaker 0>that we can make progress again.

00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:18.530
<v Speaker 0>Give me everything. Give me the raw data.

00:49:24.405 --> 00:49:26.805
<v Speaker 0>So let's filter on containers,

00:49:26.805 --> 00:49:28.245
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes name.

00:49:29.765 --> 00:49:30.645
<v Speaker 0>Filter

00:49:31.605 --> 00:49:33.765
<v Speaker 0>function takes a role.

00:49:34.645 --> 00:49:36.165
<v Speaker 0>Our dot

00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:37.570
<v Speaker 0>build

00:49:38.130 --> 00:49:39.250
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes

00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:40.050
<v Speaker 0>container

00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:40.770
<v Speaker 0>name.

00:49:51.275 --> 00:49:52.795
<v Speaker 0>Weird syntax of me.

00:49:54.795 --> 00:49:57.755
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So container name is Flint, Flint, Flint,

00:49:57.755 --> 00:49:58.955
<v Speaker 0>Flint, Flint, Flint,

00:50:00.795 --> 00:50:01.995
<v Speaker 0>etcd

00:50:03.355 --> 00:50:03.835
<v Speaker 0>vector.

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:10.130
<v Speaker 0>Was I just too impatient?

00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:14.050
<v Speaker 0>I

00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:16.210
<v Speaker 0>wonder if we can tweak the buffer on

00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:16.450
<v Speaker 0>that.

00:50:18.395 --> 00:50:21.194
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we can see here that we've

00:50:21.194 --> 00:50:23.595
<v Speaker 0>got unknown variant, codec,

00:50:23.675 --> 00:50:25.675
<v Speaker 0>expected text or JSON.

00:50:27.675 --> 00:50:30.075
<v Speaker 0>I'm sure I copied this from their docs.

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:44.619
<v Speaker 0>And then variant codec

00:50:45.045 --> 00:50:47.765
<v Speaker 0>expected text or JSON for key syncs on

00:50:47.765 --> 00:50:48.645
<v Speaker 0>console.

00:50:53.925 --> 00:50:54.805
<v Speaker 0>It is JSON?

00:51:15.575 --> 00:51:17.495
<v Speaker 0>Doesn't give me a lane number,

00:51:20.615 --> 00:51:22.375
<v Speaker 0>but it does not have a console output.

00:51:22.375 --> 00:51:24.615
<v Speaker 0>So definitely getting my config

00:51:24.615 --> 00:51:25.255
<v Speaker 0>fail.

00:51:28.109 --> 00:51:29.950
<v Speaker 0>Let's have a look

00:51:31.150 --> 00:51:32.270
<v Speaker 0>here.

00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:34.109
<v Speaker 0>I'm sorry. Syncs.

00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:36.910
<v Speaker 0>Console.

00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:40.829
<v Speaker 0>And this is where I copied it from.

00:51:46.075 --> 00:51:46.955
<v Speaker 0>And

00:51:49.915 --> 00:51:51.435
<v Speaker 0>I I

00:51:52.555 --> 00:51:53.675
<v Speaker 0>mean, that looks okay.

00:51:59.970 --> 00:52:01.570
<v Speaker 0>Alright. When in doubt

00:52:03.010 --> 00:52:04.290
<v Speaker 0>my favorite

00:52:05.010 --> 00:52:06.850
<v Speaker 0>hack approach to everything ever.

00:52:11.545 --> 00:52:13.705
<v Speaker 0>I'm sorry for anyone that sees me doing

00:52:13.705 --> 00:52:14.425
<v Speaker 0>this.

00:52:19.865 --> 00:52:21.705
<v Speaker 0>But I want inside of this container.

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:29.600
<v Speaker 0>Ash.

00:52:31.119 --> 00:52:32.640
<v Speaker 0>Back to our cat,

00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:33.760
<v Speaker 0>my config.

00:52:41.375 --> 00:52:43.375
<v Speaker 0>Me using the wrong

00:52:45.295 --> 00:52:46.415
<v Speaker 0>thing here.

00:52:51.375 --> 00:52:54.255
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. The dash will strip the trailing. Right.

00:52:54.255 --> 00:52:54.494
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:58.350
<v Speaker 0>Remove the sleep.

00:52:58.990 --> 00:52:59.950
<v Speaker 0>Remove

00:52:59.950 --> 00:53:00.910
<v Speaker 0>the sleep.

00:53:01.150 --> 00:53:03.310
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna delete it. Oh, that tells me

00:53:03.310 --> 00:53:04.190
<v Speaker 0>I might need it.

00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:07.230
<v Speaker 0>Run pods.

00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:09.870
<v Speaker 0>Two seconds.

00:53:10.855 --> 00:53:12.215
<v Speaker 0>Crash load.

00:53:12.535 --> 00:53:14.215
<v Speaker 0>I use my dashboard.

00:53:14.935 --> 00:53:16.375
<v Speaker 0>Although then I need to wait for the

00:53:16.375 --> 00:53:17.015
<v Speaker 0>buffer.

00:53:19.095 --> 00:53:20.215
<v Speaker 0>Maybe I should

00:53:22.935 --> 00:53:25.655
<v Speaker 0>twelve seventeen twelve. Yeah. It's a couple

00:53:25.655 --> 00:53:26.695
<v Speaker 0>of minutes

00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:29.660
<v Speaker 0>behind. I'm not gonna wait a couple of

00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:30.940
<v Speaker 0>minutes because that will happen.

00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:33.740
<v Speaker 0>So

00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:34.780
<v Speaker 0>vector,

00:53:34.859 --> 00:53:36.540
<v Speaker 0>the new one is five.

00:53:44.305 --> 00:53:46.385
<v Speaker 0>Alright, sleep. You're back in the game.

00:53:53.025 --> 00:53:53.425
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:56.770
<v Speaker 0>Oh, wait. That that would be my sleep.

00:53:56.770 --> 00:53:57.330
<v Speaker 0>Right?

00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:01.810
<v Speaker 0>Am I jogging too many pods?

00:54:08.495 --> 00:54:10.175
<v Speaker 0>And that's just the same one.

00:54:10.735 --> 00:54:12.895
<v Speaker 0>I haven't deployed the config map.

00:54:13.535 --> 00:54:15.295
<v Speaker 0>Oh, come on YouTube. You should have told

00:54:15.295 --> 00:54:15.455
<v Speaker 0>me.

00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:21.800
<v Speaker 0>Call it that out.

00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:23.720
<v Speaker 0>Let's just do

00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:27.080
<v Speaker 0>should've just done a briefing anyway.

00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:28.520
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:32.440
<v Speaker 0>Damn you, error.

00:54:35.045 --> 00:54:35.444
<v Speaker 0>Five.

00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:50.650
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Tagging back in the sleep.

00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:56.650
<v Speaker 0>We are going to get this working in

00:54:56.650 --> 00:54:59.210
<v Speaker 0>the next five minutes. I assure you. I

00:54:59.210 --> 00:55:00.970
<v Speaker 0>am going to just

00:55:02.975 --> 00:55:03.855
<v Speaker 0>delete,

00:55:03.855 --> 00:55:05.135
<v Speaker 0>delete, delete.

00:55:09.135 --> 00:55:13.775
<v Speaker 0>Alright. That's the one we want. 74GAsh.

00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:17.980
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna take a look at the fail.

00:55:22.299 --> 00:55:23.420
<v Speaker 0>Looks better.

00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:27.260
<v Speaker 0>Better.

00:55:41.345 --> 00:55:43.105
<v Speaker 0>I still don't have that new line. Is

00:55:43.105 --> 00:55:44.065
<v Speaker 0>that the problem?

00:55:44.305 --> 00:55:44.865
<v Speaker 0>Oh, it's a.

00:55:55.330 --> 00:55:57.650
<v Speaker 0>You know what? Let's

00:56:00.704 --> 00:56:01.665
<v Speaker 0>x.

00:56:03.265 --> 00:56:05.424
<v Speaker 0>And sometimes I guess you can copy weird

00:56:05.424 --> 00:56:07.265
<v Speaker 0>quotes. That's been a thing before.

00:56:08.224 --> 00:56:09.825
<v Speaker 0>Let's reapply both.

00:56:10.144 --> 00:56:11.105
<v Speaker 0>Get pods.

00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:13.990
<v Speaker 0>Delete

00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:16.710
<v Speaker 0>part. I mean, that config map where we

00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:18.310
<v Speaker 0>load, but let's just

00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:23.029
<v Speaker 0>get parts.

00:56:37.335 --> 00:56:39.335
<v Speaker 0>No matter what software I use,

00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:40.660
<v Speaker 0>just

00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:42.740
<v Speaker 0>I run into bugs.

00:56:51.060 --> 00:56:52.020
<v Speaker 0>Take a screenshot.

00:56:56.235 --> 00:56:57.275
<v Speaker 0>And

00:56:57.915 --> 00:56:58.795
<v Speaker 0>save.

00:57:03.675 --> 00:57:04.795
<v Speaker 0>Disappointing.

00:57:04.955 --> 00:57:06.635
<v Speaker 0>I really wanted

00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:07.960
<v Speaker 0>vector running,

00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:09.560
<v Speaker 0>but unfortunately,

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:12.520
<v Speaker 0>time is against me today

00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:14.520
<v Speaker 0>and

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:15.560
<v Speaker 0>bugs.

00:57:21.395 --> 00:57:22.515
<v Speaker 0>I

00:57:22.515 --> 00:57:24.115
<v Speaker 0>mean, I could just attach it in FluxDB

00:57:24.115 --> 00:57:25.555
<v Speaker 0>output, but I'd need to do it in

00:57:25.555 --> 00:57:27.555
<v Speaker 0>like three and a half minutes. No. Okay.

00:57:29.555 --> 00:57:30.755
<v Speaker 0>We're stopping for today.

00:57:34.869 --> 00:57:35.590
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:37.590
<v Speaker 0>We did get fluent D working.

00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:39.830
<v Speaker 0>We do have a dashboard that allows me

00:57:39.830 --> 00:57:40.550
<v Speaker 0>to do

00:57:42.070 --> 00:57:42.870
<v Speaker 0>decent

00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:47.750
<v Speaker 0>retroactive debugging for problems

00:57:48.734 --> 00:57:51.135
<v Speaker 0>In combination with the alerting, we will,

00:57:51.615 --> 00:57:53.375
<v Speaker 0>you know, make this all a lot nicer

00:57:53.375 --> 00:57:54.655
<v Speaker 0>over the next week,

00:57:54.815 --> 00:57:55.375
<v Speaker 0>but

00:57:55.615 --> 00:57:57.055
<v Speaker 0>we're making progress.

00:57:57.934 --> 00:58:00.255
<v Speaker 0>I will speak to the team. We'll work

00:58:00.255 --> 00:58:00.815
<v Speaker 0>out

00:58:01.230 --> 00:58:02.190
<v Speaker 0>what

00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:04.990
<v Speaker 0>the timelines are for a nice log viewer,

00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:07.630
<v Speaker 0>which would be very exciting for me. I

00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:09.390
<v Speaker 0>may see if there's any short term improvements

00:58:09.390 --> 00:58:11.230
<v Speaker 0>I can make to the table viewer for

00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:12.030
<v Speaker 0>logs.

00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:15.150
<v Speaker 0>I think even just having the ascending, the

00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:16.590
<v Speaker 0>descending option

00:58:17.595 --> 00:58:18.395
<v Speaker 0>on

00:58:20.635 --> 00:58:21.195
<v Speaker 0>on

00:58:21.435 --> 00:58:22.715
<v Speaker 0>just on the

00:58:23.355 --> 00:58:25.435
<v Speaker 0>table customizer would be really good just to

00:58:25.435 --> 00:58:26.955
<v Speaker 0>get those logs. You want the most recent

00:58:26.955 --> 00:58:27.995
<v Speaker 0>ones first.

00:58:28.395 --> 00:58:30.190
<v Speaker 0>As far as the D goes, plugins working

00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:32.190
<v Speaker 0>well. I like we have loads of fields

00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:34.670
<v Speaker 0>available that we consume but I really wanna

00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:35.710
<v Speaker 0>be able to control

00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:38.510
<v Speaker 0>the size of that buffer and that batch.

00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:40.590
<v Speaker 0>I don't want to wait three minutes

00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:42.030
<v Speaker 0>when there are logs.

00:58:42.924 --> 00:58:45.484
<v Speaker 0>I think thirty seconds, maybe one minute I'll

00:58:45.484 --> 00:58:47.885
<v Speaker 0>deal with, but if longer, maybe too much.

00:58:48.765 --> 00:58:49.565
<v Speaker 0>Anyway,

00:58:50.125 --> 00:58:53.165
<v Speaker 0>I will dig into this vector bug. I

00:58:53.165 --> 00:58:55.690
<v Speaker 0>will see if there's already an issue failed.

00:58:55.770 --> 00:58:57.610
<v Speaker 0>And if not, I will try to fix

00:58:57.610 --> 00:58:58.810
<v Speaker 0>it myself.

00:58:59.770 --> 00:59:01.370
<v Speaker 0>I won't be back tomorrow. I will be

00:59:01.370 --> 00:59:03.610
<v Speaker 0>back on Monday. Have a great weekend, and

00:59:03.610 --> 00:59:05.530
<v Speaker 0>thank you very much for tuning in. Have

00:59:05.530 --> 00:59:06.010
<v Speaker 0>a good day.
