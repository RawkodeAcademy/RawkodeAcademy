<v Speaker 1>everyone. So I'm Rohit Gumbre, and I'm from

00:04:29.515 --> 00:04:32.475
<v Speaker 1>Mumbai, India. And I'm currently working as a

00:04:32.475 --> 00:04:34.850
<v Speaker 1>developer at Rocketitesolo.io.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.650
<v Speaker 1>So

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.010
<v Speaker 1>talking about myself, you know, on the Twitter

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.890
<v Speaker 1>and LinkedIn, like, I'm sharing various resources on

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.970
<v Speaker 1>the DevOps and talking about the DevOps in

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.010
<v Speaker 1>various communities

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.370
<v Speaker 1>as well as promoting the DevOps technology everywhere

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.604
<v Speaker 1>as I can. So I am the guy

00:04:50.604 --> 00:04:53.645
<v Speaker 1>who can talk about DevOps, communities,

00:04:53.645 --> 00:04:54.765
<v Speaker 1>the well stuff,

00:04:54.925 --> 00:04:57.165
<v Speaker 1>and many more things. Currently,

00:04:57.885 --> 00:05:00.925
<v Speaker 1>I'm wearing various hats, like, you say ambassador,

00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:04.044
<v Speaker 1>you say developer, you say DevOps, I don't

00:05:04.044 --> 00:05:06.090
<v Speaker 1>get, or you can say the DevOps engineer

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.410
<v Speaker 1>SRE role. So previously,

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.290
<v Speaker 1>I had, like, lot of things.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.170
<v Speaker 1>Like, I didn't know how to land into

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:15.130
<v Speaker 1>the DevOps

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:16.570
<v Speaker 1>profiles

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.810
<v Speaker 1>and developer advocate profiles.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:19.370
<v Speaker 1>But

00:05:19.755 --> 00:05:21.915
<v Speaker 1>if you come to my journey, you can

00:05:21.915 --> 00:05:23.915
<v Speaker 1>learn my journey, then it is like I

00:05:23.915 --> 00:05:26.715
<v Speaker 1>have done everything in the last two and

00:05:26.715 --> 00:05:27.755
<v Speaker 1>a half years.

00:05:28.075 --> 00:05:30.795
<v Speaker 1>So it is nice one. So we will

00:05:31.115 --> 00:05:33.500
<v Speaker 1>come to the journey part afterwards. But for

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.460
<v Speaker 1>introduction

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.500
<v Speaker 1>of myself, it is like, currently, I work

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.980
<v Speaker 1>as a developer at so solo.io,

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.140
<v Speaker 1>and I'm promoting the dev ops stuff. And

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.860
<v Speaker 1>you can

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.020
<v Speaker 1>learn more more thing about me on the

00:05:46.255 --> 00:05:48.655
<v Speaker 1>various open source platforms, like,

00:05:49.295 --> 00:05:51.535
<v Speaker 1>what we say, block platforms like Medium.

00:05:51.695 --> 00:05:54.015
<v Speaker 1>You can contact me on the GitHub

00:05:54.575 --> 00:05:58.255
<v Speaker 1>GitHub LinkedIn plat Twitter and many more platforms.

00:05:58.255 --> 00:06:00.330
<v Speaker 1>So, yeah, if you want to learn our

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.650
<v Speaker 1>DevOps and envelopes, ping me anytime. I am

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:03.450
<v Speaker 1>free. Yeah.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.010
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I think that's the wonder I don't

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.450
<v Speaker 0>know if it's wonderful. Maybe it's good and

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.850
<v Speaker 0>bad. Right? But the wonderful thing about 2022

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.130
<v Speaker 0>is that, you know, people are so approachable

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.465
<v Speaker 0>now on so many different platforms. And I

00:06:15.465 --> 00:06:18.185
<v Speaker 0>would encourage anybody to send Twitter DMs to

00:06:18.185 --> 00:06:20.585
<v Speaker 0>either of us or emails or any of

00:06:20.585 --> 00:06:22.745
<v Speaker 0>the LinkedIn platforms, anything else. Like, you know,

00:06:22.745 --> 00:06:25.465
<v Speaker 0>people are there, and people generally don't mind

00:06:25.465 --> 00:06:27.950
<v Speaker 0>answering questions to help people. At least, I

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.310
<v Speaker 0>mean, I I don't I don't think you

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.670
<v Speaker 0>don't. I'm sure there are many more people

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.830
<v Speaker 0>that does it. They're happy to answer questions.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:33.230
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.630
<v Speaker 1>Best thing about the online platform is, like,

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.110
<v Speaker 1>I would give one tip to everyone. Like,

00:06:40.515 --> 00:06:43.155
<v Speaker 1>if you see, like, social media influencers or

00:06:43.155 --> 00:06:46.675
<v Speaker 1>digital nomads on the various platform like LinkedIn

00:06:46.675 --> 00:06:47.555
<v Speaker 1>and Twitter,

00:06:47.715 --> 00:06:50.195
<v Speaker 1>but they are having, like, 100 k followers

00:06:50.195 --> 00:06:52.995
<v Speaker 1>and one twenty k followers. So don't directly

00:06:52.995 --> 00:06:55.440
<v Speaker 1>reach out to them, I would suggest. Check

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.520
<v Speaker 1>the other platforms where they are not that

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.800
<v Speaker 1>much visible to people. Yeah. And, like, emails

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.680
<v Speaker 1>are there for, like, team for collaboration type

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.400
<v Speaker 1>of emails. And, otherwise, they have some platform

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.000
<v Speaker 1>like Polywork or

00:07:08.425 --> 00:07:10.745
<v Speaker 1>other platform like Insta where they don't have

00:07:10.745 --> 00:07:13.065
<v Speaker 1>the followings. So they will easily reach out

00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:15.145
<v Speaker 1>to you. Like, they will reply to you.

00:07:15.145 --> 00:07:17.145
<v Speaker 1>So this is some of the best tips

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:18.025
<v Speaker 1>I can say.

00:07:18.345 --> 00:07:20.104
<v Speaker 1>So this type of tips will come up

00:07:20.104 --> 00:07:20.585
<v Speaker 1>towards us.

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:24.120
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That signal versus noise ratio for people

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.880
<v Speaker 0>on some platforms can be very

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.919
<v Speaker 0>like, through no ill intent may just mess

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:30.599
<v Speaker 0>your message. You're right. Like, you try and

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:32.039
<v Speaker 0>find if you need to ask someone a

00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:34.440
<v Speaker 0>question, there's usually maybe other platforms or profiles

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.205
<v Speaker 0>that you can go through. And I see

00:07:36.205 --> 00:07:37.805
<v Speaker 0>a friend of both of ours, Marino, in

00:07:37.805 --> 00:07:40.205
<v Speaker 0>the chat saying a % about approachability. So

00:07:40.205 --> 00:07:42.605
<v Speaker 0>hey, Marino. Thanks for joining We

00:07:43.885 --> 00:07:45.965
<v Speaker 0>already have our first question from Samantha. But

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:48.139
<v Speaker 0>before we we tackle that, should we both

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:50.460
<v Speaker 0>gonna share our our journeys and our stories

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.819
<v Speaker 0>about where we are and how we got

00:07:51.819 --> 00:07:52.940
<v Speaker 0>to where we are today?

00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:56.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You'll go first, and then I will

00:07:56.939 --> 00:07:59.580
<v Speaker 0>Hey. That's not how this works. Right. Okay.

00:08:00.219 --> 00:08:01.580
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So I've been

00:08:02.085 --> 00:08:03.845
<v Speaker 0>try not to date myself too much. I've

00:08:03.845 --> 00:08:06.405
<v Speaker 0>been working professionally in software for twenty years

00:08:06.405 --> 00:08:07.125
<v Speaker 0>now.

00:08:07.285 --> 00:08:09.045
<v Speaker 0>So, I mean, I've wearing a lot of

00:08:09.045 --> 00:08:10.645
<v Speaker 0>hats. I have a lot of experience in

00:08:10.645 --> 00:08:12.805
<v Speaker 0>different things. But one thing that has remained

00:08:12.805 --> 00:08:14.645
<v Speaker 0>true for me throughout my entire career is

00:08:14.645 --> 00:08:16.165
<v Speaker 0>that I'm eternally curious.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.400
<v Speaker 0>I'm always always

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.120
<v Speaker 0>playing with new technologies and trying to, you

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.440
<v Speaker 0>know, expand my knowledge as much as possible.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.520
<v Speaker 0>And I think the reason I always share

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.640
<v Speaker 0>that, and I always say it's like I'm

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.240
<v Speaker 0>a bit of a technology magpie,

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.960
<v Speaker 0>is that because I think that curiosity and

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.785
<v Speaker 0>continuous learning is is so important. Like, there's

00:08:33.785 --> 00:08:34.425
<v Speaker 0>nothing

00:08:34.665 --> 00:08:36.825
<v Speaker 0>worse you can do as someone who wants

00:08:36.825 --> 00:08:37.785
<v Speaker 0>to be a

00:08:38.505 --> 00:08:41.705
<v Speaker 0>you know, end technology for their foreseeable future

00:08:41.785 --> 00:08:43.785
<v Speaker 0>is to get stagnant and stop learning because

00:08:43.785 --> 00:08:46.670
<v Speaker 0>the the technology landscape isn't stopping

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.270
<v Speaker 0>by any means. I mean, let's look at

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:51.070
<v Speaker 0>the last ten years. So I'm diversion already.

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:53.710
<v Speaker 0>But, you know, we've went from DevOps to

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.270
<v Speaker 0>SRE and cloud native and Kubernetes. Like, it's

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.350
<v Speaker 0>just constant. You always have to build around

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.230
<v Speaker 0>and do stuff. So there's one tip for

00:09:00.195 --> 00:09:01.475
<v Speaker 0>people's security.

00:09:01.715 --> 00:09:02.435
<v Speaker 0>However,

00:09:03.155 --> 00:09:05.155
<v Speaker 0>throughout my career, I've always ended up doing

00:09:05.155 --> 00:09:07.715
<v Speaker 0>operations in DevOps. I've been very lucky and

00:09:07.715 --> 00:09:08.515
<v Speaker 0>unlucky.

00:09:08.835 --> 00:09:10.675
<v Speaker 0>My first job was working for a company

00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:12.959
<v Speaker 0>where I was responsible for a better systems,

00:09:12.959 --> 00:09:16.000
<v Speaker 0>EPOS systems, Linux GUI applications. I had to

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.680
<v Speaker 0>wear a lot of hats.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.040
<v Speaker 0>And we

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.920
<v Speaker 0>were a small company in Glasgow, so we

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.080
<v Speaker 0>also didn't have, like, this throw over the

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.680
<v Speaker 0>wall mentality of operations.

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.005
<v Speaker 0>I why it was operations? If I wrote

00:09:28.005 --> 00:09:29.605
<v Speaker 0>the code, I had to run it. And

00:09:29.605 --> 00:09:31.845
<v Speaker 0>that has that has stuck with me. And

00:09:31.845 --> 00:09:33.925
<v Speaker 0>probably the most viable thing I've I've taken

00:09:33.925 --> 00:09:35.365
<v Speaker 0>with me over the last twenty years is

00:09:35.365 --> 00:09:36.325
<v Speaker 0>that I've never

00:09:36.725 --> 00:09:38.965
<v Speaker 0>never not been responsible for my own code

00:09:38.965 --> 00:09:41.930
<v Speaker 0>in production. And I think that curse I

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:43.050
<v Speaker 0>don't know. I don't mean to call it

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:45.209
<v Speaker 0>a curse, but it makes you think a

00:09:45.209 --> 00:09:47.209
<v Speaker 0>lot about the things that you're you're shipping.

00:09:47.209 --> 00:09:49.050
<v Speaker 0>So I was very fortunate that

00:09:49.449 --> 00:09:52.490
<v Speaker 0>I wanted to improve that productionization

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:55.209
<v Speaker 0>and deployment pipeline. So I very early got

00:09:55.209 --> 00:09:56.170
<v Speaker 0>into

00:09:56.015 --> 00:09:58.815
<v Speaker 0>Puffit when it first launched in 02/2006.

00:09:59.375 --> 00:10:01.295
<v Speaker 0>Migrated to SaltStack.

00:10:01.375 --> 00:10:02.895
<v Speaker 0>And when that came out, it must've been

00:10:02.895 --> 00:10:04.735
<v Speaker 0>like 02/2009. It was maybe a few years

00:10:04.735 --> 00:10:05.535
<v Speaker 0>after that.

00:10:07.055 --> 00:10:09.535
<v Speaker 0>As of that company, I did some consulting

00:10:09.535 --> 00:10:12.655
<v Speaker 0>for a while and then I ended up

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.830
<v Speaker 0>being director of development for a media company.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:15.630
<v Speaker 0>And that was

00:10:16.269 --> 00:10:19.470
<v Speaker 0>that was, like, super hard for me because

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:21.230
<v Speaker 0>I was writing less code, but I was

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.390
<v Speaker 0>also still the only person that ever deployed

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.149
<v Speaker 0>anything to production. So I was kinda still

00:10:25.149 --> 00:10:26.269
<v Speaker 0>doing the operational side.

00:10:27.435 --> 00:10:30.875
<v Speaker 0>And what I hadn't appreciated before that role

00:10:30.875 --> 00:10:33.514
<v Speaker 0>was this how to scale applications.

00:10:33.514 --> 00:10:35.995
<v Speaker 0>So this was my first company where my

00:10:36.074 --> 00:10:39.115
<v Speaker 0>application wasn't being used by 12 people on

00:10:39.115 --> 00:10:41.355
<v Speaker 0>a physical site. It was, like, all websites.

00:10:41.355 --> 00:10:43.750
<v Speaker 0>It was virtual. It was a company that

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.750
<v Speaker 0>owned magazines and radio stations.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.310
<v Speaker 0>So our scale could be anywhere from

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:52.390
<v Speaker 0>a hundred requests per second to 50,000 requests

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:53.990
<v Speaker 0>per second, but I had never dealt with

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.790
<v Speaker 0>that before.

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:57.535
<v Speaker 0>So that was a very valuable learning experience

00:10:57.535 --> 00:10:59.455
<v Speaker 0>for me, and I actually dictated the next

00:10:59.455 --> 00:11:00.735
<v Speaker 0>five years of my life

00:11:01.055 --> 00:11:03.295
<v Speaker 0>moving into the container space because I needed

00:11:03.295 --> 00:11:05.375
<v Speaker 0>to be able to scale faster and virtual

00:11:05.375 --> 00:11:08.380
<v Speaker 0>machines are are quite slow. I mean, I

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:09.500
<v Speaker 0>can go into all of this in more

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.020
<v Speaker 0>detail, but I'm trying to not go on

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.220
<v Speaker 0>for thirty minutes here.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.580
<v Speaker 0>And so we adopted containers and then I

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:16.860
<v Speaker 0>found out a lot of people were trying

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.300
<v Speaker 0>to adopt containers at the time. So I

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.860
<v Speaker 0>actually went back to consulting and I found

00:11:21.595 --> 00:11:23.835
<v Speaker 0>I was speaking at more events about containers

00:11:23.835 --> 00:11:26.235
<v Speaker 0>and getting more gig. And I think that's

00:11:26.235 --> 00:11:28.235
<v Speaker 0>when I realized that I actually prefer

00:11:28.795 --> 00:11:32.315
<v Speaker 0>sharing knowledge and helping people than shipping products

00:11:32.315 --> 00:11:34.315
<v Speaker 0>or code or containers.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.660
<v Speaker 0>And I started speaking at more events. And

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.420
<v Speaker 0>that's how I got into DevRel because I

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.620
<v Speaker 0>was like, you know what? I do have

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.140
<v Speaker 0>a lot of experience, and I wanna be

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.540
<v Speaker 0>able to make other people's lives easier.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.700
<v Speaker 0>And because I'm always learning, I have this

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.140
<v Speaker 0>continuous curiosity.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.660
<v Speaker 0>I I'm always learning new stuff that I

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.695
<v Speaker 0>can also share, which is which is why

00:11:50.695 --> 00:11:52.215
<v Speaker 0>we're sat here. Right? Like, I wanna be

00:11:52.215 --> 00:11:54.455
<v Speaker 0>able to learn from my guests and share

00:11:54.455 --> 00:11:56.055
<v Speaker 0>that knowledge with other people. And I hope

00:11:56.055 --> 00:11:57.975
<v Speaker 0>that other people enjoy that too. So

00:11:58.455 --> 00:12:00.855
<v Speaker 0>I've been doing DevRel for the last five

00:12:00.855 --> 00:12:01.655
<v Speaker 0>years now,

00:12:01.975 --> 00:12:04.615
<v Speaker 0>mostly in the container cloud native Kubernetes space.

00:12:04.615 --> 00:12:07.709
<v Speaker 0>Really enjoying it. Currently working at Pulumi, which

00:12:07.709 --> 00:12:08.589
<v Speaker 0>is a very

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:13.709
<v Speaker 0>not DevOps exactly, but definitely operation developer crossover

00:12:13.709 --> 00:12:15.550
<v Speaker 0>platform or tool.

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:18.190
<v Speaker 0>So I'm very much keen to have this

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:18.990
<v Speaker 0>conversation today.

00:12:19.865 --> 00:12:22.584
<v Speaker 0>So how about you share your story now,

00:12:22.584 --> 00:12:24.824
<v Speaker 0>please? Mhmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Also, it is

00:12:24.824 --> 00:12:26.985
<v Speaker 1>very nice to hear that you have you

00:12:27.065 --> 00:12:29.944
<v Speaker 1>have, like, diverse type of knowledge from consulting,

00:12:29.944 --> 00:12:33.545
<v Speaker 1>shipping to, like, having the developer advocacy, developer

00:12:33.545 --> 00:12:36.300
<v Speaker 1>relation. Best thing our developer relations is, like,

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.860
<v Speaker 1>you can you are, like, learning every time.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like, you are having this conversation also.

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:43.580
<v Speaker 1>You are having some knowledge. So I'm gaining

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.500
<v Speaker 1>some knowledge. You are getting some knowledge. You

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:48.220
<v Speaker 1>are having the mutual learning type of a

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.574
<v Speaker 1>thing here. So, yeah, public sharing comes this

00:12:51.574 --> 00:12:53.495
<v Speaker 1>type of roles. So, yeah,

00:12:53.975 --> 00:12:56.535
<v Speaker 1>talking about my life journey is like

00:12:57.574 --> 00:13:00.454
<v Speaker 1>I my life journey started in 2020 lockdown.

00:13:00.454 --> 00:13:03.759
<v Speaker 1>Corona situation was there. And I was sitting

00:13:03.759 --> 00:13:04.560
<v Speaker 1>idly,

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.720
<v Speaker 1>and I saw, like, yeah, I have done

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.000
<v Speaker 1>nothing in my life.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm I'm just studying my bachelor's degree, and,

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.680
<v Speaker 1>yeah, computer engineering is going slowly, slowly.

00:13:16.665 --> 00:13:19.385
<v Speaker 1>So I've I thought, like, I should do

00:13:19.385 --> 00:13:21.785
<v Speaker 1>something about this. I mean, I I am

00:13:21.785 --> 00:13:24.825
<v Speaker 1>learning the data science, but how means I'm

00:13:24.825 --> 00:13:27.785
<v Speaker 1>not enjoying that thing. So I learned about

00:13:27.785 --> 00:13:30.105
<v Speaker 1>machine learning, and then I saw, like, machine

00:13:30.105 --> 00:13:33.120
<v Speaker 1>learning can be integrated with various things. So

00:13:33.199 --> 00:13:36.880
<v Speaker 1>I learned about the data analysis, data visualization,

00:13:36.959 --> 00:13:38.959
<v Speaker 1>and how can you scrap the data,

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.480
<v Speaker 1>move the data to various things. So, yeah,

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.720
<v Speaker 1>it was going fun smoothly, and all data

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.585
<v Speaker 1>science was fun. But it is like Spark

00:13:47.585 --> 00:13:50.625
<v Speaker 1>we have. Right? That Spark was not there.

00:13:50.625 --> 00:13:53.265
<v Speaker 1>So I thought, like, yeah, I should explore

00:13:53.265 --> 00:13:57.265
<v Speaker 1>other tracks also. Then I learned about the

00:13:57.265 --> 00:14:00.865
<v Speaker 1>Java and various tech Java and then product

00:14:00.865 --> 00:14:01.345
<v Speaker 1>development.

00:14:01.779 --> 00:14:02.900
<v Speaker 1>So I joined one

00:14:03.779 --> 00:14:05.779
<v Speaker 1>it's like it was, like, part time type

00:14:05.779 --> 00:14:07.700
<v Speaker 1>of a thing where I was working as

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.700
<v Speaker 1>a school and developer. I was teaching assistant

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.900
<v Speaker 1>also at the that small startup during my

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.140
<v Speaker 1>college period, final year period. So it was

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.060
<v Speaker 1>kind of all too. So it was fun.

00:14:17.235 --> 00:14:19.154
<v Speaker 1>Like, I was enjoying, but,

00:14:19.635 --> 00:14:22.515
<v Speaker 1>yeah, I didn't found that spot there also.

00:14:22.515 --> 00:14:22.995
<v Speaker 1>Then

00:14:23.394 --> 00:14:25.475
<v Speaker 1>I moved to the machine learning

00:14:25.875 --> 00:14:29.315
<v Speaker 1>integration with the various things. Right? So then

00:14:29.315 --> 00:14:30.995
<v Speaker 1>I come to know, like, there is a

00:14:30.995 --> 00:14:33.350
<v Speaker 1>cloud technologies out there There are hybrid multi

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:34.950
<v Speaker 1>cloud. There is a

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:37.990
<v Speaker 1>AWS cloud providers out there. Various flow cloud

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:41.270
<v Speaker 1>providers are AWS, Azure, and GCP. Various type

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.750
<v Speaker 1>of cloud providers are. So I saw, like,

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.245
<v Speaker 1>that the it is nice platform. Like, we

00:14:46.245 --> 00:14:49.125
<v Speaker 1>can have various services, and it is helping

00:14:49.125 --> 00:14:51.605
<v Speaker 1>us to learn everything, and we can start

00:14:51.605 --> 00:14:55.285
<v Speaker 1>everything at just one click or, like, we

00:14:55.285 --> 00:14:57.445
<v Speaker 1>can have anything on the web UI, and

00:14:57.445 --> 00:14:59.850
<v Speaker 1>we can use that. So it was fun.

00:15:00.329 --> 00:15:02.329
<v Speaker 1>That type that time, I learned about the

00:15:02.329 --> 00:15:04.889
<v Speaker 1>DevOps technology. So when I was integrating the

00:15:04.889 --> 00:15:06.889
<v Speaker 1>machine learning with this technology, like, how can

00:15:06.889 --> 00:15:07.370
<v Speaker 1>we

00:15:07.769 --> 00:15:11.050
<v Speaker 1>deploy one machine learning model into the DevOps?

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:13.610
<v Speaker 1>And I saw, like yeah. I mean, it's,

00:15:14.115 --> 00:15:14.755
<v Speaker 1>what

00:15:15.155 --> 00:15:18.035
<v Speaker 1>which thing I was doing manually. Like, I

00:15:18.035 --> 00:15:20.915
<v Speaker 1>was training that model, and I was finding

00:15:20.915 --> 00:15:23.875
<v Speaker 1>the error. And that again, that error, I'm

00:15:23.875 --> 00:15:26.435
<v Speaker 1>rectifying. I was thinking, like, yeah. This is

00:15:26.435 --> 00:15:28.790
<v Speaker 1>the error. So let's move again to the

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:31.750
<v Speaker 1>previous step first step and, again, train that

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:32.390
<v Speaker 1>model.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:35.190
<v Speaker 1>So it was hectic thing in the data

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:37.030
<v Speaker 1>science field. So, yeah,

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.764
<v Speaker 1>that time I learned, like, how can you

00:15:39.764 --> 00:15:42.165
<v Speaker 1>integrate the ML with the DevOps, and it

00:15:42.165 --> 00:15:44.404
<v Speaker 1>is, like, complete ML ops pipeline. So you

00:15:44.404 --> 00:15:46.885
<v Speaker 1>just have to deploy that model to the

00:15:47.125 --> 00:15:50.725
<v Speaker 1>DevOps pipeline, and it will train automatically for

00:15:50.725 --> 00:15:53.045
<v Speaker 1>you. You don't have to do anything after

00:15:53.045 --> 00:15:54.725
<v Speaker 1>that. So it is complete automation.

00:15:55.149 --> 00:15:57.709
<v Speaker 1>So, yeah, that spark I got that time,

00:15:57.709 --> 00:15:59.230
<v Speaker 1>and I enjoyed DevOps.

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Then

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.750
<v Speaker 1>after that, I joined one company as a

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:05.630
<v Speaker 1>DevOps cloud engineer. It was fun, but that

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:08.045
<v Speaker 1>company was has having some problems, so it

00:16:08.045 --> 00:16:10.205
<v Speaker 1>was start up. So then I moved to

00:16:10.205 --> 00:16:12.765
<v Speaker 1>another company that where I joined as NLP

00:16:12.765 --> 00:16:14.925
<v Speaker 1>and ML ops engineer type of role. So

00:16:14.925 --> 00:16:17.005
<v Speaker 1>it was fun. I enjoyed mostly

00:16:17.565 --> 00:16:19.565
<v Speaker 1>everything. Like, I learned about NLP,

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:22.230
<v Speaker 1>can we integrate the machine learning with testing,

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:25.030
<v Speaker 1>research and development part of things. So I

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:28.550
<v Speaker 1>was working as a research and development

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:31.670
<v Speaker 1>engineer, you can say. So I was checking

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:32.470
<v Speaker 1>the papers

00:16:32.685 --> 00:16:35.245
<v Speaker 1>and learning from them and how can you

00:16:35.645 --> 00:16:37.885
<v Speaker 1>so in machine learning and DevOps,

00:16:38.525 --> 00:16:41.165
<v Speaker 1>DevOps is mostly about the tools. But if

00:16:41.165 --> 00:16:42.925
<v Speaker 1>you want to develop your tools, you have

00:16:42.925 --> 00:16:45.885
<v Speaker 1>to learn what other companies are doing. Right?

00:16:45.885 --> 00:16:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Cloud tech cloud native platforms are there. Projects

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:50.650
<v Speaker 1>are there on the Linux foundation. It is

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:53.610
<v Speaker 1>easily available. So you can check. And so

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:56.090
<v Speaker 1>there are platform projects. You can check their

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:58.650
<v Speaker 1>documents. So research about the things, how they

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:01.690
<v Speaker 1>build, how their case studies were running. So

00:17:01.055 --> 00:17:03.535
<v Speaker 1>So I learned everything in the machine learning

00:17:03.535 --> 00:17:06.015
<v Speaker 1>field also and on the devs. So it

00:17:06.015 --> 00:17:08.255
<v Speaker 1>is never everything, but I tried to learn

00:17:08.255 --> 00:17:11.214
<v Speaker 1>everything. So I enjoyed that thing. So research

00:17:11.214 --> 00:17:13.214
<v Speaker 1>and development was fun. And

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:15.200
<v Speaker 1>that company,

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:15.919
<v Speaker 1>most

00:17:16.159 --> 00:17:18.079
<v Speaker 1>of the part of my work was going

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:20.959
<v Speaker 1>to the machine learning. So what I did,

00:17:21.519 --> 00:17:23.760
<v Speaker 1>I thought, like, now is the time I

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.119
<v Speaker 1>should move to

00:17:25.405 --> 00:17:27.565
<v Speaker 1>next part next time of next part of

00:17:27.565 --> 00:17:29.645
<v Speaker 1>my life. And, yeah, I joined as a

00:17:29.645 --> 00:17:31.645
<v Speaker 1>developer, okay, at solo.io.

00:17:31.645 --> 00:17:34.765
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, developer relations is, like, fun. You

00:17:34.765 --> 00:17:36.684
<v Speaker 1>can explore anything, like, every

00:17:37.805 --> 00:17:40.840
<v Speaker 1>any technology you want. But I will suggest

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.640
<v Speaker 1>go with the tech stack you already know.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.840
<v Speaker 1>So today,

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.200
<v Speaker 1>there is a lot of hype in the

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.080
<v Speaker 1>developer relations market. So everyone is trying to

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.200
<v Speaker 1>get the developer relations role, developer advocacy role.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.565
<v Speaker 1>So I will suggest choose the tech stack

00:17:54.565 --> 00:17:55.924
<v Speaker 1>you know already and

00:17:57.125 --> 00:17:59.604
<v Speaker 1>company which is using that tech stack. So,

00:17:59.684 --> 00:18:01.764
<v Speaker 1>like, I'm in the solo dot I'm working

00:18:01.764 --> 00:18:03.125
<v Speaker 1>at the solo dot I o, the that

00:18:03.125 --> 00:18:05.284
<v Speaker 1>work on the Istio service mesh and

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.580
<v Speaker 1>Silly and maybe be a flight technologies.

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:09.539
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,

00:18:10.179 --> 00:18:12.100
<v Speaker 1>your Rawkode is

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.820
<v Speaker 1>working David is working on the Pulumi.

00:18:14.899 --> 00:18:17.380
<v Speaker 1>So Pulumi is the infrastructure as a infrastructure

00:18:17.475 --> 00:18:20.914
<v Speaker 1>provisioning company. So you can launch the everything

00:18:20.914 --> 00:18:22.835
<v Speaker 1>in just one click type of a thing.

00:18:22.835 --> 00:18:24.835
<v Speaker 1>So it is also the DevOps kind of

00:18:24.835 --> 00:18:27.075
<v Speaker 1>a thing. So it is one of the

00:18:27.075 --> 00:18:29.715
<v Speaker 1>tool. So this type of a companies, have

00:18:29.715 --> 00:18:32.195
<v Speaker 1>to check-in the DevOps way. So similarly, I

00:18:32.195 --> 00:18:33.635
<v Speaker 1>did. I

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:35.970
<v Speaker 1>so I know I I'm going to share,

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:38.370
<v Speaker 1>like, what was the entire process to apply

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.690
<v Speaker 1>to these jobs, how I got this job.

00:18:40.929 --> 00:18:41.970
<v Speaker 1>So previously,

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:44.450
<v Speaker 1>I had various offers before this company.

00:18:45.255 --> 00:18:47.015
<v Speaker 1>It was senior senior

00:18:47.015 --> 00:18:49.975
<v Speaker 1>site reliability engineer role, site reliability engineer role,

00:18:49.975 --> 00:18:52.455
<v Speaker 1>DevOps engineer role. So how can you get

00:18:52.455 --> 00:18:55.575
<v Speaker 1>everything in this just one point five years

00:18:55.575 --> 00:18:57.910
<v Speaker 1>of experience and two years of experience? So

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:00.550
<v Speaker 1>because everyone is reaching out to me on

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:03.190
<v Speaker 1>the Twitter and LinkedIn, like, asking me, yeah.

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:06.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, bro. How means, like, does refresher don't

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:09.590
<v Speaker 1>get the DevOps jobs? So thing is in

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:12.135
<v Speaker 1>in it's, like, not only Indian colleges, but

00:19:12.135 --> 00:19:15.495
<v Speaker 1>everywhere. Will thing is, like, they are teaching

00:19:15.495 --> 00:19:17.095
<v Speaker 1>you the teaching

00:19:17.095 --> 00:19:17.735
<v Speaker 1>you the tech

00:19:18.455 --> 00:19:19.494
<v Speaker 1>what we say?

00:19:20.855 --> 00:19:22.215
<v Speaker 1>Teaching you the things,

00:19:22.375 --> 00:19:23.014
<v Speaker 1>but

00:19:23.335 --> 00:19:26.140
<v Speaker 1>they are not giving the industrial learning. So

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:28.620
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have the industrial learning, how

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.940
<v Speaker 1>the companies will hire you? Right? You are

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:33.100
<v Speaker 1>not doing any open source contribution. You are

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.059
<v Speaker 1>not doing the

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:37.260
<v Speaker 1>what actually needed for the interviews. Right? They're

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.220
<v Speaker 1>just learning the theory knowledge. So what you

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.605
<v Speaker 1>can do, and how can you get this

00:19:42.605 --> 00:19:43.725
<v Speaker 1>job interviews?

00:19:43.725 --> 00:19:46.044
<v Speaker 1>How can you go get the offers from

00:19:46.044 --> 00:19:48.924
<v Speaker 1>front side? Not you have to, like, apply

00:19:48.924 --> 00:19:50.205
<v Speaker 1>to the websites,

00:19:50.205 --> 00:19:52.205
<v Speaker 1>and then you will get the job. That

00:19:52.205 --> 00:19:53.885
<v Speaker 1>type of things are happening.

00:19:54.289 --> 00:19:56.690
<v Speaker 1>But there are different ways. We will discuss

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:57.570
<v Speaker 1>it later.

00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:00.610
<v Speaker 1>So that was my journey till now. And,

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:03.090
<v Speaker 1>yeah, currently, I'm working as a developer advocate.

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:06.130
<v Speaker 1>So developer relations is also fun, but choose

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:09.225
<v Speaker 1>the tech stack you know. So today's decision

00:20:09.225 --> 00:20:11.305
<v Speaker 1>will be completely on the DevOps. We will

00:20:11.305 --> 00:20:13.945
<v Speaker 1>discuss the devo developer relations kind of a

00:20:13.945 --> 00:20:15.625
<v Speaker 1>thing later. So, yeah,

00:20:16.905 --> 00:20:18.425
<v Speaker 1>this was my part of a journey in

00:20:18.425 --> 00:20:20.585
<v Speaker 1>the DevOps. So I currently, I know the

00:20:20.585 --> 00:20:21.465
<v Speaker 1>AWS

00:20:21.465 --> 00:20:22.745
<v Speaker 1>cloud providers,

00:20:22.905 --> 00:20:23.784
<v Speaker 1>GCP,

00:20:23.785 --> 00:20:24.345
<v Speaker 1>Azure,

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:27.060
<v Speaker 1>and there are cloud native projects, some of

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.700
<v Speaker 1>them, which is necessary for the DevOps technologies.

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:32.580
<v Speaker 1>And, there are some products

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.900
<v Speaker 1>out there. So you should,

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.300
<v Speaker 1>know various things about this thing, and

00:20:38.715 --> 00:20:40.475
<v Speaker 1>there is a compulsion. Like, you should have

00:20:40.475 --> 00:20:43.835
<v Speaker 1>the certification also. So that is myth. Right?

00:20:43.915 --> 00:20:44.554
<v Speaker 1>If

00:20:44.875 --> 00:20:46.715
<v Speaker 1>I ask the David also, you have any

00:20:46.715 --> 00:20:48.875
<v Speaker 1>certification, global certification exam?

00:20:49.755 --> 00:20:50.875
<v Speaker 1>You are going in there?

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:55.850
<v Speaker 1>Any type of a global certification.

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:58.010
<v Speaker 1>So yeah. See, there it is a big

00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:00.010
<v Speaker 1>need in the market. Like, you should have

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:00.570
<v Speaker 1>the

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:04.730
<v Speaker 1>any global certification to get the DevOps roles.

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:07.210
<v Speaker 1>So we will discuss everything. So yeah. Yeah.

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:10.055
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I went through like, when the

00:21:10.055 --> 00:21:13.175
<v Speaker 0>Cloud Data Foundation did their CK and CKAD,

00:21:13.495 --> 00:21:15.095
<v Speaker 0>I I did do them, but I haven't

00:21:15.095 --> 00:21:15.975
<v Speaker 0>renewed them

00:21:16.855 --> 00:21:18.935
<v Speaker 0>for personal choice. I just didn't think that

00:21:18.935 --> 00:21:20.535
<v Speaker 0>they brought a lot of value to me

00:21:20.535 --> 00:21:20.935
<v Speaker 0>personally.

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:23.870
<v Speaker 0>But I I'm curious about what other people

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:26.670
<v Speaker 0>in the industry think. And there and also,

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:28.670
<v Speaker 0>you mentioned there's a lot. You're joining there.

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:30.110
<v Speaker 0>So thank you for sharing all that. Yeah.

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:31.710
<v Speaker 0>But there's two things that stuck out to

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:32.990
<v Speaker 0>me that I thought would be really cool

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:34.190
<v Speaker 0>for us to dive into.

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:36.430
<v Speaker 0>One, you mentioned DevOps,

00:21:36.875 --> 00:21:37.755
<v Speaker 0>CloudOps,

00:21:37.835 --> 00:21:39.035
<v Speaker 0>MLOps.

00:21:40.555 --> 00:21:43.115
<v Speaker 0>There was something else. So I'm curious

00:21:43.115 --> 00:21:44.075
<v Speaker 0>to you

00:21:44.555 --> 00:21:46.395
<v Speaker 0>what DevOps means.

00:21:46.475 --> 00:21:47.995
<v Speaker 0>And I know that this is a global

00:21:48.155 --> 00:21:49.755
<v Speaker 0>not global. There's, like, this

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:53.460
<v Speaker 0>debate, I would say, in our industry about

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.380
<v Speaker 0>whether it's a culture, whether it's a role,

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.299
<v Speaker 0>whether it's a, you know, it's a an

00:21:57.299 --> 00:21:58.739
<v Speaker 0>idea and methodology.

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:00.260
<v Speaker 0>There's a whole bunch there. So we'll dive

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.914
<v Speaker 0>into that. But I'm also curious. Like, you

00:22:02.914 --> 00:22:04.835
<v Speaker 0>said you've been doing this since 2020,

00:22:04.835 --> 00:22:06.434
<v Speaker 0>so, like, two and a half years.

00:22:06.835 --> 00:22:07.715
<v Speaker 0>I wonder,

00:22:08.034 --> 00:22:10.195
<v Speaker 0>like, is it intimidating

00:22:10.195 --> 00:22:12.034
<v Speaker 0>for you, like or for anyone new to

00:22:12.034 --> 00:22:13.955
<v Speaker 0>this industry? Because, like, you come in and

00:22:13.955 --> 00:22:16.520
<v Speaker 0>right away, there's, like, containers and virtual machines

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.880
<v Speaker 0>and clouds and DevOps and SRE and Kubernetes

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.600
<v Speaker 0>and, like, wow. Like, I can't even imagine

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.040
<v Speaker 0>what that would be like these days for

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.720
<v Speaker 0>people that are coming new into our industry

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.759
<v Speaker 0>just to be overwhelmed

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.785
<v Speaker 0>and flooded with all these things that people

00:22:29.785 --> 00:22:31.305
<v Speaker 0>must be telling them they need to know.

00:22:31.305 --> 00:22:33.145
<v Speaker 0>And I I'm curious about how you found

00:22:33.145 --> 00:22:35.225
<v Speaker 0>that and what that was like for you.

00:22:36.265 --> 00:22:39.385
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Okay. So thing is, like, everyone is

00:22:39.385 --> 00:22:41.705
<v Speaker 1>getting the it's like, it is

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:45.770
<v Speaker 1>hard to find the resources available on the

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:46.650
<v Speaker 1>Internet

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:49.050
<v Speaker 1>because no one is sharing with you. So

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.890
<v Speaker 1>college student and beginner,

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:53.370
<v Speaker 1>what they do, they ask the seniors. Right?

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:55.690
<v Speaker 1>So but if senior is not doing the

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:58.250
<v Speaker 1>DevOps job, so how can you ask them?

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:00.745
<v Speaker 1>Right? So he's not no. He he didn't

00:23:00.745 --> 00:23:02.345
<v Speaker 1>know, like, how the how to get the

00:23:02.345 --> 00:23:04.265
<v Speaker 1>jobs in the DevOps. Right? But he will

00:23:04.265 --> 00:23:06.265
<v Speaker 1>share. Like, you are my junior, so I

00:23:06.265 --> 00:23:08.345
<v Speaker 1>will give some knowledge to you, like, some

00:23:08.345 --> 00:23:10.185
<v Speaker 1>type of we say in Hindi, like, it

00:23:10.185 --> 00:23:12.680
<v Speaker 1>is a yarn type of thing. So it

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.000
<v Speaker 1>is like, they will give you those knowledge,

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.200
<v Speaker 1>which they don't have. Like, do this thing,

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.400
<v Speaker 1>do the DSA,

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.680
<v Speaker 1>do the coding,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.240
<v Speaker 1>and then you can easily get the job.

00:23:23.615 --> 00:23:25.294
<v Speaker 1>But that is not a part.

00:23:25.775 --> 00:23:28.335
<v Speaker 1>That how I means how I got the

00:23:28.335 --> 00:23:29.455
<v Speaker 1>learning

00:23:29.455 --> 00:23:31.215
<v Speaker 1>of the DevOps and knowledge of the DevOps

00:23:31.215 --> 00:23:34.815
<v Speaker 1>is, like, I joined one of the courses

00:23:34.815 --> 00:23:35.775
<v Speaker 1>who are there.

00:23:36.175 --> 00:23:37.930
<v Speaker 1>It means, like, I didn't

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:40.250
<v Speaker 1>pay anything to learn about DevOps or any

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:41.370
<v Speaker 1>type of a technology.

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:44.010
<v Speaker 1>First, I learned about data science in the

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:47.290
<v Speaker 1>mid twenty twenty nineties, and and that that

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:47.850
<v Speaker 1>time,

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:49.290
<v Speaker 1>I did the course certification.

00:23:50.345 --> 00:23:53.065
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't go go into the deep

00:23:53.145 --> 00:23:54.265
<v Speaker 1>into that certification,

00:23:54.265 --> 00:23:56.585
<v Speaker 1>but just learning of that thing. So how

00:23:56.585 --> 00:23:59.065
<v Speaker 1>I get that certification? You can easily apply

00:23:59.065 --> 00:24:01.385
<v Speaker 1>for the financial aid. So Coursera has the

00:24:01.385 --> 00:24:03.545
<v Speaker 1>financial aid. Apply to that twelve days you

00:24:03.545 --> 00:24:05.650
<v Speaker 1>can have, you can easily get that course

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:07.090
<v Speaker 1>for free. Wow.

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:10.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So many people don't know. So I

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:12.690
<v Speaker 1>did a YouTube video and blog for the

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:15.570
<v Speaker 1>same, and that blog has crossed 800,000,000

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:16.770
<v Speaker 1>views. So you can

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:20.665
<v Speaker 1>it is like yeah. It is it is

00:24:20.665 --> 00:24:24.345
<v Speaker 1>really big thing. So that that that blog

00:24:24.345 --> 00:24:26.585
<v Speaker 1>has spread me well. That is other thing.

00:24:26.585 --> 00:24:27.304
<v Speaker 1>But, yeah,

00:24:27.865 --> 00:24:30.105
<v Speaker 1>if you are sharing if you know anything,

00:24:30.265 --> 00:24:33.065
<v Speaker 1>share directly on the Internet. So anyone

00:24:33.625 --> 00:24:36.620
<v Speaker 1>not everyone has the knowledge which you you

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:37.259
<v Speaker 1>have.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.940
<v Speaker 1>In 02/2019

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:40.860
<v Speaker 1>in 02/1020,

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:43.580
<v Speaker 1>if you met to me, I was similar

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:45.980
<v Speaker 1>to any beginner. I didn't had any knowledge

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.220
<v Speaker 1>and everything. Just the thing is, like, you

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:48.700
<v Speaker 1>have to

00:24:49.304 --> 00:24:49.945
<v Speaker 1>start.

00:24:50.105 --> 00:24:52.184
<v Speaker 1>You have to start anything. Like, if you

00:24:52.184 --> 00:24:54.105
<v Speaker 1>want to learn the DevOps, go to my

00:24:54.105 --> 00:24:56.985
<v Speaker 1>Twitter threads or go to YouTube videos of

00:24:56.985 --> 00:24:58.024
<v Speaker 1>various people.

00:24:58.184 --> 00:24:59.065
<v Speaker 1>So Okay.

00:24:59.625 --> 00:25:01.865
<v Speaker 1>We know, like, various people. It's into the

00:25:01.865 --> 00:25:03.865
<v Speaker 1>DevOps. But, yeah, I will recommend some

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:05.780
<v Speaker 1>certificate

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.340
<v Speaker 1>what we say, YouTube channels. Like, there is

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:09.299
<v Speaker 1>a Nana,

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:12.500
<v Speaker 1>Tech World with Nana. Another is Rawkode. Rawkode

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:13.779
<v Speaker 1>has some various

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:14.820
<v Speaker 1>videos

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:17.059
<v Speaker 1>awesome videos with the Just a few. Forecast

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:19.220
<v Speaker 1>forecast of interviews

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:19.780
<v Speaker 1>where

00:25:20.035 --> 00:25:23.155
<v Speaker 1>inviting various folks from various industries. So there

00:25:23.155 --> 00:25:25.155
<v Speaker 1>are DevOps people also. There are Cloudinary people

00:25:25.155 --> 00:25:28.515
<v Speaker 1>also and different type of job

00:25:28.515 --> 00:25:31.315
<v Speaker 1>roles are there. So other thing is, like,

00:25:31.315 --> 00:25:33.794
<v Speaker 1>there is. He's also saying that DevOps

00:25:33.875 --> 00:25:36.809
<v Speaker 1>various boot camps and things. So there are

00:25:36.809 --> 00:25:38.090
<v Speaker 1>you you

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:40.169
<v Speaker 1>you should not focus on learning through this

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:44.250
<v Speaker 1>YouTube and Twitter only. I would suggest go

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:46.010
<v Speaker 1>to this cloud native projects and dev ops

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:46.809
<v Speaker 1>technologies

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:47.610
<v Speaker 1>and

00:25:47.945 --> 00:25:50.025
<v Speaker 1>read their docs. So that is a Terraform.

00:25:50.025 --> 00:25:52.345
<v Speaker 1>Right? Terraform is a infrastructure as a core.

00:25:52.345 --> 00:25:53.065
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,

00:25:53.145 --> 00:25:55.304
<v Speaker 1>Pulumi is there. Similarly,

00:25:55.385 --> 00:25:57.065
<v Speaker 1>Crossplane

00:25:57.065 --> 00:25:57.865
<v Speaker 1>is there.

00:25:58.184 --> 00:25:59.785
<v Speaker 1>They have the awesome documents.

00:26:00.259 --> 00:26:02.339
<v Speaker 1>But how what can you can do?

00:26:02.659 --> 00:26:05.460
<v Speaker 1>Learn the read their docs well. So they

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.460
<v Speaker 1>have step by step installation

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:09.940
<v Speaker 1>and then how they did that set the

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:10.499
<v Speaker 1>setup.

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:14.019
<v Speaker 1>Read that terms, smaller smaller terms, like, if

00:26:14.019 --> 00:26:14.740
<v Speaker 1>there is a word.

00:26:15.585 --> 00:26:17.985
<v Speaker 1>Let's take example of a word Istio. So

00:26:17.985 --> 00:26:20.465
<v Speaker 1>what is Istio? Google the Istio word, and

00:26:20.465 --> 00:26:22.784
<v Speaker 1>then Istio has a well versed document.

00:26:23.025 --> 00:26:25.105
<v Speaker 1>So this type of a thing you have

00:26:25.105 --> 00:26:27.505
<v Speaker 1>to do. You are already learning in the

00:26:27.505 --> 00:26:30.750
<v Speaker 1>college, universities college and universities that you are

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:32.350
<v Speaker 1>reading big, big documents.

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:34.830
<v Speaker 1>You are doing the assignments. So this is

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:36.669
<v Speaker 1>nothing for you. So start.

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:39.390
<v Speaker 1>Another thing is, like, how I did, I

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:42.030
<v Speaker 1>I started with the DevOps, and I followed

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:44.590
<v Speaker 1>one path. It is like you have to

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:46.465
<v Speaker 1>clear Linux technology.

00:26:46.945 --> 00:26:50.065
<v Speaker 1>So learn about Linux well. So how how

00:26:50.065 --> 00:26:52.385
<v Speaker 1>well, I will suggest, don't you go into

00:26:52.385 --> 00:26:54.544
<v Speaker 1>deep into the security type of stuff.

00:26:54.784 --> 00:26:57.424
<v Speaker 1>So first of all, I am telling these

00:26:57.424 --> 00:26:59.664
<v Speaker 1>things on the path to get the job,

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:02.809
<v Speaker 1>not to get the expert. So don't come

00:27:02.809 --> 00:27:05.210
<v Speaker 1>back to me and attack like, yeah, you

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:07.130
<v Speaker 1>are or you are wrong. You should go

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:09.210
<v Speaker 1>into the deep and learn DevOps in the

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:11.450
<v Speaker 1>deep. So I will suggest to get the

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:13.370
<v Speaker 1>job, this is the path I followed, and

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:16.195
<v Speaker 1>you can follow follow if

00:27:16.195 --> 00:27:19.155
<v Speaker 1>you want. But I'm just recommending you. So

00:27:19.155 --> 00:27:22.195
<v Speaker 1>other thing is, like, I started first learning

00:27:22.195 --> 00:27:24.595
<v Speaker 1>about the Linux. So Linux, you have to

00:27:24.595 --> 00:27:26.994
<v Speaker 1>learn learn about the Red Hat Linux,

00:27:27.235 --> 00:27:30.659
<v Speaker 1>learn about the Ubuntu if you want, anything

00:27:30.659 --> 00:27:33.700
<v Speaker 1>you want. But thing is, like, clear the

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:36.020
<v Speaker 1>what we say, that Linux command. So there

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:38.020
<v Speaker 1>are different type of Linux command. So there

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:41.745
<v Speaker 1>are networking command. There are SSH commands. So

00:27:41.745 --> 00:27:43.905
<v Speaker 1>as what is SSH? This is like local

00:27:43.905 --> 00:27:46.225
<v Speaker 1>hosting and server hosting type of link connection

00:27:46.225 --> 00:27:49.265
<v Speaker 1>between the protocols and server clients and server

00:27:49.265 --> 00:27:49.904
<v Speaker 1>systems.

00:27:51.665 --> 00:27:53.425
<v Speaker 1>So that type of commands you have to

00:27:53.425 --> 00:27:56.370
<v Speaker 1>learn. Then another step is, like, learn about

00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:58.210
<v Speaker 1>the Linux networking

00:27:58.210 --> 00:27:59.009
<v Speaker 1>fundamentals.

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:01.730
<v Speaker 1>So thing is, like, if you are directly

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:03.730
<v Speaker 1>diving into the tools

00:28:03.809 --> 00:28:07.010
<v Speaker 1>so thing is, like, when you are hearing

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:08.289
<v Speaker 1>about the DevOps word,

00:28:08.815 --> 00:28:10.895
<v Speaker 1>people has that misunderstanding,

00:28:10.895 --> 00:28:12.815
<v Speaker 1>like, you have to learn every tool. So

00:28:12.815 --> 00:28:15.535
<v Speaker 1>don't go deep into the tools directly.

00:28:15.775 --> 00:28:17.135
<v Speaker 1>Learn about the

00:28:17.455 --> 00:28:20.495
<v Speaker 1>Linux and then networking fundamentals.

00:28:20.575 --> 00:28:23.615
<v Speaker 1>So networking fundamentals is, like, basics of networking,

00:28:23.615 --> 00:28:24.015
<v Speaker 1>not

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:25.300
<v Speaker 1>completely

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:27.780
<v Speaker 1>deep dive into the same because you you

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:30.180
<v Speaker 1>are not going into the security and networking

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:31.940
<v Speaker 1>kind of a role. You have you should

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:34.260
<v Speaker 1>have some basics of networking for sure.

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:36.020
<v Speaker 1>So clear the fundamentals,

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:39.140
<v Speaker 1>then you can easily learn about anything in

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:39.540
<v Speaker 1>the future.

00:28:40.325 --> 00:28:42.645
<v Speaker 1>After the networking is done, learn about the

00:28:42.645 --> 00:28:44.404
<v Speaker 1>containerization, I would suggest.

00:28:44.885 --> 00:28:46.085
<v Speaker 1>So containerization,

00:28:46.085 --> 00:28:47.445
<v Speaker 1>there are different kind

00:28:47.605 --> 00:28:50.164
<v Speaker 1>of tools. There are Docker. There is Cryo.

00:28:50.165 --> 00:28:52.164
<v Speaker 1>There is a Portman. So

00:28:52.405 --> 00:28:54.550
<v Speaker 1>there are different types of things. So learn

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:55.430
<v Speaker 1>about them.

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:56.390
<v Speaker 1>Docker,

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:59.110
<v Speaker 1>many people say, like, what is a Docker?

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:00.870
<v Speaker 1>So they say, if

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:04.070
<v Speaker 1>there is one big example everyone knows, like,

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.630
<v Speaker 1>this

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:07.030
<v Speaker 1>thing is working on my computer. I don't

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:08.790
<v Speaker 1>know if if it will work on my

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:10.230
<v Speaker 1>manager's

00:29:09.645 --> 00:29:10.365
<v Speaker 1>PC.

00:29:10.525 --> 00:29:13.405
<v Speaker 1>So if Docker is there, you can directly

00:29:15.085 --> 00:29:16.925
<v Speaker 1>deploy it on on your computer

00:29:16.925 --> 00:29:19.565
<v Speaker 1>and share that link with your manager.

00:29:19.645 --> 00:29:21.965
<v Speaker 1>And they can easily view that link and,

00:29:21.965 --> 00:29:25.150
<v Speaker 1>yeah, your model is deployed or anything application

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:26.030
<v Speaker 1>is deployed.

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:28.590
<v Speaker 1>So Docker is similar to that. Other thing

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:30.510
<v Speaker 1>is after containerization,

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:33.790
<v Speaker 1>you should move to the orchestration part. So

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:35.550
<v Speaker 1>you have learned the container.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:37.470
<v Speaker 1>Right? Docker, you have learned or you have

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:40.684
<v Speaker 1>learned the. So orchestrate that. So you can't

00:29:40.684 --> 00:29:42.845
<v Speaker 1>do everything in just containerization.

00:29:42.845 --> 00:29:44.844
<v Speaker 1>You have to orchestrate that containers.

00:29:44.845 --> 00:29:47.085
<v Speaker 1>So, like, there is a thing

00:29:47.085 --> 00:29:48.364
<v Speaker 1>which is Kubernetes.

00:29:48.845 --> 00:29:49.965
<v Speaker 1>So Kubernetes,

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:53.019
<v Speaker 1>there is a big, what do we say,

00:29:53.659 --> 00:29:55.580
<v Speaker 1>big hype in the market. Like, you should

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:57.419
<v Speaker 1>learn about the Kubernetes to get the job.

00:29:57.419 --> 00:29:59.419
<v Speaker 1>You should learn about the Kubernetes. But I

00:29:59.419 --> 00:30:01.340
<v Speaker 1>have seen it is my experience. I don't

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:03.340
<v Speaker 1>know, like, hey. It should have the everybody's

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:03.979
<v Speaker 1>experience.

00:30:04.299 --> 00:30:04.539
<v Speaker 1>So

00:30:05.745 --> 00:30:08.385
<v Speaker 1>you need the Kubernetes for the interviews,

00:30:08.385 --> 00:30:10.225
<v Speaker 1>but when you get the job, they will

00:30:10.225 --> 00:30:12.945
<v Speaker 1>not give you the job for the it's

00:30:12.945 --> 00:30:14.625
<v Speaker 1>like live job to

00:30:14.625 --> 00:30:15.825
<v Speaker 1>work on the Kubernetes.

00:30:16.065 --> 00:30:17.825
<v Speaker 1>I don't know it has happened with everyone

00:30:17.825 --> 00:30:20.144
<v Speaker 1>because we are working in the cloud native

00:30:20.145 --> 00:30:22.610
<v Speaker 1>like, what we say. We are working in

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:23.969
<v Speaker 1>the Kubernetes company,

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:26.850
<v Speaker 1>but we don't know. But but if you

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:28.450
<v Speaker 1>work in some companies,

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:30.609
<v Speaker 1>I don't wanna take name,

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:32.450
<v Speaker 1>but they they will not give you the

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:35.409
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes job. They just take your interviews for

00:30:35.409 --> 00:30:36.210
<v Speaker 1>the Kubernetes.

00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:38.905
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know. Like, you are taking

00:30:38.905 --> 00:30:40.665
<v Speaker 1>the interviews on the Kubernetes, but you are

00:30:40.665 --> 00:30:43.705
<v Speaker 1>not giving the job to the student,

00:30:44.105 --> 00:30:45.865
<v Speaker 1>job to the professionals who

00:30:46.185 --> 00:30:47.705
<v Speaker 1>who are you hiring.

00:30:47.865 --> 00:30:48.425
<v Speaker 1>So

00:30:48.825 --> 00:30:50.745
<v Speaker 1>that is different thing. So learn about the

00:30:50.745 --> 00:30:51.385
<v Speaker 1>orchestration.

00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:53.809
<v Speaker 1>So what is it what it will do?

00:30:53.809 --> 00:30:55.969
<v Speaker 1>It will scale your containers.

00:30:56.529 --> 00:30:58.289
<v Speaker 1>It will scale your website.

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:01.169
<v Speaker 1>So if you are launching any website so

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:04.209
<v Speaker 1>let's see. Like, I have my website. So

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:04.769
<v Speaker 1>Lingtree

00:31:06.315 --> 00:31:08.955
<v Speaker 1>let's take example as a rockboardacademy.com.

00:31:08.955 --> 00:31:10.475
<v Speaker 1>So if

00:31:10.475 --> 00:31:12.875
<v Speaker 1>I am clicking on that website, I'm just

00:31:12.875 --> 00:31:15.835
<v Speaker 1>one person clicking on it. But there are

00:31:15.835 --> 00:31:17.914
<v Speaker 1>various people in this world who is clicking

00:31:17.914 --> 00:31:20.110
<v Speaker 1>on their website. So it it should handle

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:23.230
<v Speaker 1>everything, every website. Right? So every person should

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:24.110
<v Speaker 1>easily

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:25.790
<v Speaker 1>handle that groups. I mean, it's like, see

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:28.670
<v Speaker 1>that website and, yeah, I get my my

00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:29.710
<v Speaker 1>photo and

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:32.905
<v Speaker 1>they will put there. So it is should

00:31:32.905 --> 00:31:35.785
<v Speaker 1>be visible to them clearly. Right? So that

00:31:35.785 --> 00:31:37.305
<v Speaker 1>is a part of orchestration.

00:31:37.305 --> 00:31:39.145
<v Speaker 1>So there are various things Kubernetes

00:31:39.145 --> 00:31:40.425
<v Speaker 1>and orchestration

00:31:40.425 --> 00:31:43.225
<v Speaker 1>platforms can do, but this is one thing

00:31:43.225 --> 00:31:44.105
<v Speaker 1>I'm just suggesting.

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:47.640
<v Speaker 1>There are various alternatives for the Kubernetes also.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.640
<v Speaker 1>You can go and look out for that.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.600
<v Speaker 1>Another thing is after the orchestration,

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.760
<v Speaker 1>I will suggest learn about the cloud providers

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:55.480
<v Speaker 1>also,

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:58.360
<v Speaker 1>and there is next part, which is CICD

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.815
<v Speaker 1>pipeline. So cloud providers, what are the cloud

00:32:00.815 --> 00:32:03.455
<v Speaker 1>providers? I will just give you the brief.

00:32:03.455 --> 00:32:05.294
<v Speaker 1>So there are some companies,

00:32:06.335 --> 00:32:07.215
<v Speaker 1>AWS,

00:32:07.215 --> 00:32:08.014
<v Speaker 1>Azure,

00:32:08.495 --> 00:32:09.374
<v Speaker 1>GCP,

00:32:10.014 --> 00:32:10.894
<v Speaker 1>OCI.

00:32:11.054 --> 00:32:12.095
<v Speaker 1>So what are they doing?

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:14.930
<v Speaker 1>They are providing you

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:18.690
<v Speaker 1>there is also now. So that that is

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:20.130
<v Speaker 1>another big competitor.

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:22.930
<v Speaker 1>So let's take a name of them also.

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:25.570
<v Speaker 1>So thing is when you are taking the

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:28.515
<v Speaker 1>cloud providers, what they provide, they provide various

00:32:28.515 --> 00:32:32.275
<v Speaker 1>services to you. So thing services like if

00:32:32.275 --> 00:32:34.675
<v Speaker 1>you want to create any app, just write

00:32:34.675 --> 00:32:35.795
<v Speaker 1>the code in them.

00:32:36.515 --> 00:32:37.475
<v Speaker 1>You you

00:32:37.635 --> 00:32:40.275
<v Speaker 1>you can create the app without coding also.

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:42.380
<v Speaker 1>So they provide that type of things also

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:44.300
<v Speaker 1>now. Other thing is, like, if you want

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:46.220
<v Speaker 1>to deploy the app, they can provide you

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.220
<v Speaker 1>the platform for deploying also.

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Another thing is, like, if you have if

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:53.355
<v Speaker 1>you have that laptop,

00:32:53.995 --> 00:32:55.995
<v Speaker 1>it's like you you are seeing laptop.

00:32:56.235 --> 00:32:58.715
<v Speaker 1>You have this that system. So you can

00:32:58.715 --> 00:32:59.595
<v Speaker 1>use

00:32:59.595 --> 00:33:01.434
<v Speaker 1>this system virtually

00:33:01.515 --> 00:33:03.755
<v Speaker 1>so that virtual machines are provided by the

00:33:03.755 --> 00:33:04.475
<v Speaker 1>cloud providers.

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:07.270
<v Speaker 1>So it is nice to learn everything about

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:10.150
<v Speaker 1>these cloud providers, but, yeah, you should know

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:12.710
<v Speaker 1>the fundamentals also. So that's why I'm sharing

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:13.590
<v Speaker 1>this part,

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:16.390
<v Speaker 1>which is alternate to the cloud cloud providers

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:19.190
<v Speaker 1>also. So you can build this

00:33:19.605 --> 00:33:22.885
<v Speaker 1>this virtualization on your local system also. So

00:33:22.885 --> 00:33:23.924
<v Speaker 1>there are some

00:33:24.405 --> 00:33:26.884
<v Speaker 1>things like what we say on premises.

00:33:27.125 --> 00:33:28.804
<v Speaker 1>So that also you can learn.

00:33:29.365 --> 00:33:31.765
<v Speaker 1>After that, after you learn this thing, I

00:33:31.765 --> 00:33:34.245
<v Speaker 1>will suggest going to the CICD pipeline. So

00:33:34.245 --> 00:33:35.605
<v Speaker 1>what is CICD pipeline?

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:38.110
<v Speaker 1>So full form of the CICD first, you

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:40.990
<v Speaker 1>have to know. I'm I have seen horrible

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:43.630
<v Speaker 1>type of acronyms for the CICD.

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:45.870
<v Speaker 1>But, yeah, I will give you idea. It

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:46.830
<v Speaker 1>is continuous

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:50.135
<v Speaker 1>integration and continuous deployment, we say. So thing

00:33:50.135 --> 00:33:53.095
<v Speaker 1>is, like, what is CICD when

00:33:53.255 --> 00:33:54.134
<v Speaker 1>you are

00:33:54.455 --> 00:33:55.174
<v Speaker 1>having any

00:33:56.855 --> 00:33:57.815
<v Speaker 1>let's see.

00:33:58.775 --> 00:33:59.815
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen

00:34:00.615 --> 00:34:02.775
<v Speaker 1>in any company you are working? It is

00:34:02.775 --> 00:34:04.455
<v Speaker 1>MNC or any company.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.080
<v Speaker 1>You see, like, there is a build reports

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:07.800
<v Speaker 1>or

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.880
<v Speaker 1>you are getting the testing,

00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:13.239
<v Speaker 1>then you see, like, deploy that kind of

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:15.400
<v Speaker 1>terms you have heard previously.

00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:18.614
<v Speaker 1>But how that terms internally work? How that

00:34:18.614 --> 00:34:21.415
<v Speaker 1>deployment is working? How the build success comes?

00:34:21.415 --> 00:34:23.015
<v Speaker 1>How the build failure comes?

00:34:23.175 --> 00:34:25.415
<v Speaker 1>So that part comes into the build, what

00:34:25.415 --> 00:34:26.775
<v Speaker 1>we say, CICD.

00:34:26.935 --> 00:34:29.655
<v Speaker 1>So there are various tools, which are, like,

00:34:29.655 --> 00:34:30.295
<v Speaker 1>Jenkins

00:34:31.219 --> 00:34:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Jenkins CI is there, Circle CI is there.

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:36.659
<v Speaker 1>So today, we use the

00:34:37.219 --> 00:34:41.380
<v Speaker 1>GitOps also. GitOps is like that is and

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:43.594
<v Speaker 1>various things are there. So what they are

00:34:43.594 --> 00:34:44.074
<v Speaker 1>doing,

00:34:45.755 --> 00:34:48.315
<v Speaker 1>let's take example of one project to go

00:34:48.315 --> 00:34:49.594
<v Speaker 1>go and tell.

00:34:49.675 --> 00:34:50.235
<v Speaker 1>So,

00:34:51.434 --> 00:34:53.675
<v Speaker 1>yeah, I think I missed one big part

00:34:53.675 --> 00:34:55.915
<v Speaker 1>of this thing. After the learning of the

00:34:55.915 --> 00:34:59.835
<v Speaker 1>Linux and networking, you should learn about the

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:00.130
<v Speaker 1>SVN.

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:02.290
<v Speaker 1>So what is SVN? GitHub,

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:05.250
<v Speaker 1>and that is SCM

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:08.530
<v Speaker 1>tools. So these tools are like yeah. GitHub

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:11.250
<v Speaker 1>so when GitHub is like service

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:14.095
<v Speaker 1>provisioning, it is doing. So whatever packages you

00:35:14.095 --> 00:35:16.655
<v Speaker 1>have, whatever code you have, you can store

00:35:16.655 --> 00:35:18.575
<v Speaker 1>it on the online type kind of a

00:35:18.575 --> 00:35:20.415
<v Speaker 1>thing. So that is done by the GitHub

00:35:20.415 --> 00:35:21.535
<v Speaker 1>and these companies.

00:35:21.855 --> 00:35:24.735
<v Speaker 1>So let's take example of one project. So

00:35:24.735 --> 00:35:25.535
<v Speaker 1>you have the GitHub.

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:28.619
<v Speaker 1>You have stored the code inside. So then

00:35:28.619 --> 00:35:29.900
<v Speaker 1>use that code

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:30.540
<v Speaker 1>and

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:34.140
<v Speaker 1>create the Dockerfile of so Docker provides the

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:37.740
<v Speaker 1>Dockerfile. Right? So create the Dockerfile and write

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:38.540
<v Speaker 1>the code to

00:35:39.654 --> 00:35:42.375
<v Speaker 1>get that GitHub repository inside. So it will

00:35:42.375 --> 00:35:45.655
<v Speaker 1>install that application inside that Dockerfile,

00:35:45.734 --> 00:35:47.655
<v Speaker 1>and then you have some links.

00:35:47.815 --> 00:35:50.615
<v Speaker 1>So you have both of the things. Right?

00:35:50.615 --> 00:35:52.775
<v Speaker 1>So then what will our

00:35:52.855 --> 00:35:56.190
<v Speaker 1>CSID pipeline will do? Will take that code,

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:58.830
<v Speaker 1>and they will automate that code. So, like,

00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:00.350
<v Speaker 1>if you want to integrate

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:03.070
<v Speaker 1>you you want to deploy that application on

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:05.150
<v Speaker 1>the server or any kind of a thing,

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:07.710
<v Speaker 1>so they will take that code and connect

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:08.510
<v Speaker 1>it with the

00:36:09.285 --> 00:36:10.245
<v Speaker 1>automation.

00:36:10.325 --> 00:36:12.645
<v Speaker 1>And then if it is successful,

00:36:12.724 --> 00:36:15.045
<v Speaker 1>then it will send the there are various

00:36:15.045 --> 00:36:17.365
<v Speaker 1>jobs. So in one of the job, it

00:36:17.365 --> 00:36:19.685
<v Speaker 1>will send the message to the developer. Right?

00:36:19.685 --> 00:36:22.885
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Developer, your code is successfully

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:24.060
<v Speaker 1>deployed,

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:26.380
<v Speaker 1>and, yeah, you can enjoy your weekend.

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:28.940
<v Speaker 1>But if it is not successful,

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:31.660
<v Speaker 1>then it will go pre go to previous

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:32.220
<v Speaker 1>job,

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:34.140
<v Speaker 1>and it will it will show you a

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:36.060
<v Speaker 1>health checks, like, red red red kind of

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.580
<v Speaker 1>thing. And you don't enjoy your weekend?

00:36:39.625 --> 00:36:41.704
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. And it will show, like, mail,

00:36:41.704 --> 00:36:44.744
<v Speaker 1>fail, errors, and, yeah, that kind of hectic

00:36:44.744 --> 00:36:45.625
<v Speaker 1>things have

00:36:45.944 --> 00:36:46.505
<v Speaker 1>have seen

00:36:46.825 --> 00:36:48.744
<v Speaker 1>by every kind of developer. So I don't

00:36:48.744 --> 00:36:49.464
<v Speaker 1>want to

00:36:49.865 --> 00:36:52.345
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to explain that things. Right?

00:36:52.345 --> 00:36:55.230
<v Speaker 1>Because every everyone has failed the same. So

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:56.830
<v Speaker 1>that kind of a thing is done by

00:36:56.830 --> 00:36:58.030
<v Speaker 1>the our CSUD.

00:36:58.110 --> 00:36:59.310
<v Speaker 1>So after that

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:02.030
<v Speaker 1>yeah. Today, GitOps is also

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:03.950
<v Speaker 1>training inside this

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:05.230
<v Speaker 1>CSUD.

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:05.950
<v Speaker 1>So

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:09.145
<v Speaker 1>learn about the GitOps, I would suggest, and

00:37:09.145 --> 00:37:10.984
<v Speaker 1>it is kind of a future kind of

00:37:10.984 --> 00:37:13.785
<v Speaker 1>a thing. So learn about it. So in

00:37:13.785 --> 00:37:16.345
<v Speaker 1>that, I think there is a Jenkins x

00:37:16.345 --> 00:37:17.465
<v Speaker 1>also now.

00:37:17.545 --> 00:37:19.545
<v Speaker 1>So previously, it was not there. So it

00:37:19.545 --> 00:37:20.184
<v Speaker 1>is nice tool.

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:24.000
<v Speaker 1>So after that, you learn the CICD,

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.640
<v Speaker 1>then it comes to monitoring tools. So you

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:29.359
<v Speaker 1>have deployed the application, but in future, how

00:37:29.359 --> 00:37:31.920
<v Speaker 1>you will know, like, everything is going fine.

00:37:32.885 --> 00:37:35.765
<v Speaker 1>You don't has the your application is deployed

00:37:35.765 --> 00:37:39.045
<v Speaker 1>and yeah. But, like, this website is visible

00:37:39.045 --> 00:37:39.845
<v Speaker 1>to everyone.

00:37:40.085 --> 00:37:42.405
<v Speaker 1>So how will you will know that because

00:37:42.405 --> 00:37:45.605
<v Speaker 1>you have developed deployed the thing. Right? So

00:37:45.605 --> 00:37:46.565
<v Speaker 1>operations

00:37:46.724 --> 00:37:47.605
<v Speaker 1>operations

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:49.250
<v Speaker 1>comes under the monitoring.

00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:51.570
<v Speaker 1>So what kind of monitoring tools are there?

00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:53.650
<v Speaker 1>There are various monitoring tools are there. So

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:54.930
<v Speaker 1>you know about the.

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:57.650
<v Speaker 1>There is a. There is Grafana. There is

00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:58.770
<v Speaker 1>stack.

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:01.010
<v Speaker 1>So there are various tools you have to

00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:01.490
<v Speaker 1>learn.

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:03.655
<v Speaker 1>You can learn. You don't have to learn

00:38:03.655 --> 00:38:06.295
<v Speaker 1>everything. Right? So I will suggest whatever I

00:38:06.295 --> 00:38:07.494
<v Speaker 1>suggest you previously,

00:38:07.655 --> 00:38:11.095
<v Speaker 1>learn one one tool of anything for interviews.

00:38:11.095 --> 00:38:13.815
<v Speaker 1>Not going to learning everything. You don't have

00:38:13.815 --> 00:38:15.910
<v Speaker 1>to be expert on everything.

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:18.950
<v Speaker 1>You just you should be learning one one

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:21.030
<v Speaker 1>tool, and it should be, like,

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:23.910
<v Speaker 1>intermediate kind of a thing. No. Don't you

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:25.670
<v Speaker 1>don't need to master because it is impossible

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:28.515
<v Speaker 1>to master any tool. Because if you learn

00:38:28.515 --> 00:38:30.994
<v Speaker 1>today and you will master that tool, today,

00:38:30.994 --> 00:38:33.234
<v Speaker 1>there will be next kind of a thing

00:38:33.234 --> 00:38:35.395
<v Speaker 1>which will be coming to the market and

00:38:35.395 --> 00:38:37.234
<v Speaker 1>it is trending. So what is what is

00:38:37.234 --> 00:38:39.234
<v Speaker 1>the use of your line? So you have

00:38:39.234 --> 00:38:41.795
<v Speaker 1>the knowledge. You should make the fundamentals clear,

00:38:41.795 --> 00:38:43.450
<v Speaker 1>not get

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:45.130
<v Speaker 1>the close with low

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:47.610
<v Speaker 1>relationship with your tool.

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:49.050
<v Speaker 1>So, yeah,

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:53.610
<v Speaker 1>once you learn this CSID and then then

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:55.050
<v Speaker 1>you have learned the monitoring,

00:38:55.355 --> 00:38:58.234
<v Speaker 1>Monitoring is something like you are getting that

00:38:59.275 --> 00:39:02.555
<v Speaker 1>whatever you got into deployments and all, get

00:39:02.555 --> 00:39:05.515
<v Speaker 1>that query, put into the Prometheus or any

00:39:05.674 --> 00:39:06.075
<v Speaker 1>yeah.

00:39:06.474 --> 00:39:08.075
<v Speaker 1>Logstash or something.

00:39:08.234 --> 00:39:09.194
<v Speaker 1>So and

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:12.200
<v Speaker 1>that Prometheus will give some

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:15.000
<v Speaker 1>what we say, query to you that input

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.080
<v Speaker 1>it into the your graph on our dashboard.

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:20.040
<v Speaker 1>So you will see, like, which was beautiful,

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:23.000
<v Speaker 1>which was, like, yeah, graph, that different kind

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:23.960
<v Speaker 1>of graphs.

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:26.145
<v Speaker 1>You will see, like, visualization and,

00:39:26.865 --> 00:39:29.265
<v Speaker 1>yeah, my mic's visualization. That kind of a

00:39:29.265 --> 00:39:32.065
<v Speaker 1>thing is there. So, yeah, if that is

00:39:32.785 --> 00:39:34.865
<v Speaker 1>you will see, like, yeah, this type of

00:39:34.865 --> 00:39:35.505
<v Speaker 1>strength

00:39:36.145 --> 00:39:39.905
<v Speaker 1>we have. These many people are

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:41.810
<v Speaker 1>visualizing our website really well.

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:43.730
<v Speaker 1>We don't have any downtime.

00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:45.650
<v Speaker 1>So this downtime,

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:47.170
<v Speaker 1>this kind of things

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:49.570
<v Speaker 1>you will learn once you go into this

00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:51.170
<v Speaker 1>deep dive into the DevOps.

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:53.170
<v Speaker 1>But, yeah, I have shared,

00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:55.570
<v Speaker 1>I think, some of them

00:39:55.145 --> 00:39:58.265
<v Speaker 1>very well. But, yeah, you will learn about

00:39:58.265 --> 00:40:01.224
<v Speaker 1>various things other than this also. But I

00:40:01.224 --> 00:40:03.545
<v Speaker 1>think this is the necessary part

00:40:03.705 --> 00:40:04.745
<v Speaker 1>till now

00:40:05.065 --> 00:40:07.945
<v Speaker 1>to follow and get into the jobs of

00:40:07.945 --> 00:40:08.425
<v Speaker 1>the DevOps.

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:11.560
<v Speaker 1>So, yeah, we will come to

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.240
<v Speaker 1>various points again.

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Stigations.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:15.480
<v Speaker 1>But

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:20.040
<v Speaker 0>That is possibly the most comprehensive road map

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.560
<v Speaker 0>for DevOps I have ever heard in my

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.280
<v Speaker 0>life. Damn.

00:40:22.805 --> 00:40:25.125
<v Speaker 0>Now you covered everything there. So

00:40:25.445 --> 00:40:27.685
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna look pretty much everything you've just

00:40:27.685 --> 00:40:30.885
<v Speaker 0>said there right back to Samad's question. Samad

00:40:30.885 --> 00:40:31.925
<v Speaker 0>is just asking,

00:40:32.885 --> 00:40:34.565
<v Speaker 0>I work as a cloud support engineer. I

00:40:34.565 --> 00:40:35.845
<v Speaker 0>have two and a half years experience with

00:40:35.845 --> 00:40:38.010
<v Speaker 0>vCenter, vSphere, Windows, Grafana. I had a special

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:39.930
<v Speaker 0>DevOps profile. Like, I think that road map

00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:41.850
<v Speaker 0>well, my comments went off the screen, but

00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:44.650
<v Speaker 0>that that road map is, like, spot on.

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:46.170
<v Speaker 0>And, you know, he also follows up saying

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:47.930
<v Speaker 0>he does have some knowledge of AWS, Linux,

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:49.930
<v Speaker 0>and Ansible. You covered that. You covered source

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:50.330
<v Speaker 0>control,

00:40:50.735 --> 00:40:53.855
<v Speaker 0>the Linux layer in the primitives, containers, orchestration,

00:40:53.855 --> 00:40:54.735
<v Speaker 0>monitoring.

00:40:54.815 --> 00:40:57.135
<v Speaker 0>Everything was in there. So, like, just start

00:40:57.135 --> 00:40:59.295
<v Speaker 0>checking at those things one at a time,

00:40:59.295 --> 00:41:01.375
<v Speaker 0>picking up Yeah. Yeah. Once once you learn

00:41:01.375 --> 00:41:03.375
<v Speaker 1>about the infrastructure as a core, which is

00:41:03.375 --> 00:41:04.655
<v Speaker 1>Terraform

00:41:04.655 --> 00:41:06.015
<v Speaker 1>and Pulumi and

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:08.610
<v Speaker 1>what another is a cross plan.

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:10.369
<v Speaker 1>Once you learn about them

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:13.330
<v Speaker 1>one of them, not all of them, you

00:41:13.330 --> 00:41:15.810
<v Speaker 1>can move to the infrastructure provisioning, which is

00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:17.170
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned Ansible.

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:19.410
<v Speaker 1>So Ansible is the infrastructure provisioning. It is

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:21.089
<v Speaker 1>like you can launch the

00:41:21.924 --> 00:41:23.125
<v Speaker 1>anything, like

00:41:23.765 --> 00:41:26.724
<v Speaker 1>if you have any files

00:41:26.724 --> 00:41:27.925
<v Speaker 1>in your folder.

00:41:28.005 --> 00:41:29.605
<v Speaker 1>So you can automate

00:41:29.605 --> 00:41:32.244
<v Speaker 1>to view that files, and you can check

00:41:32.244 --> 00:41:34.910
<v Speaker 1>any word. So if there is a word,

00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Rawkode is going to zoom in that file

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:41.390
<v Speaker 1>of any some folder. So you can directly

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:44.590
<v Speaker 1>view that file using the Linux commands also.

00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:47.295
<v Speaker 1>Some will talk that thing. But there is

00:41:47.295 --> 00:41:49.535
<v Speaker 1>a thing which is called an Ansible,

00:41:49.535 --> 00:41:52.734
<v Speaker 1>which will automate this thing on different systems

00:41:52.734 --> 00:41:55.375
<v Speaker 1>for you. So you you have different systems.

00:41:55.375 --> 00:41:58.015
<v Speaker 1>You can view anything on that systems just

00:41:58.015 --> 00:41:59.135
<v Speaker 1>by writing some

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:00.510
<v Speaker 1>do we say,

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:02.750
<v Speaker 1>Ansible code inventory.

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:05.470
<v Speaker 1>So, yeah, that is the thing. Yeah. Learn

00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:08.030
<v Speaker 1>about the YML also, I would suggest. YML

00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:09.230
<v Speaker 1>is not necessary,

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:11.310
<v Speaker 1>but learn our it is the easy language.

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:13.285
<v Speaker 1>It is not different. Yeah.

00:42:13.445 --> 00:42:15.205
<v Speaker 1>It is similar to what we call as

00:42:15.205 --> 00:42:15.765
<v Speaker 1>a

00:42:17.125 --> 00:42:19.445
<v Speaker 1>it is I I if I think it

00:42:19.445 --> 00:42:21.445
<v Speaker 1>is similar to JSON. I don't know about

00:42:21.445 --> 00:42:24.005
<v Speaker 1>others, but I think it is really similar

00:42:24.005 --> 00:42:26.290
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing. Yeah. Go ahead. Okay. I'm

00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:27.890
<v Speaker 1>sorry for this to be in a bit.

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:30.130
<v Speaker 0>No. All good, man. It's all good. So

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:33.890
<v Speaker 0>here's a next question then from Harsh Kumar.

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:36.690
<v Speaker 0>Is it possible to get remote jobs in

00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:39.170
<v Speaker 0>DevOps as a fresher with no prior experience

00:42:39.825 --> 00:42:41.905
<v Speaker 0>but having the relevant skills there. So do

00:42:41.905 --> 00:42:43.425
<v Speaker 0>you have any advice or tips?

00:42:43.825 --> 00:42:46.065
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I wanted to commit

00:42:46.705 --> 00:42:48.945
<v Speaker 1>come into this later, but, yeah, we can

00:42:48.945 --> 00:42:51.905
<v Speaker 1>have the possible opportunity now. So let's answer

00:42:51.905 --> 00:42:52.305
<v Speaker 1>that question.

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:55.940
<v Speaker 1>So, yeah, remote jobs or any jobs you

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:58.580
<v Speaker 1>are getting into DevOps, people have a myth,

00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:00.340
<v Speaker 1>like, you can't get as a fresher.

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:02.340
<v Speaker 1>So I have done it. You can do

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:03.540
<v Speaker 1>it too. So

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:05.780
<v Speaker 1>how can you get? So there are various

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:06.260
<v Speaker 1>platforms,

00:43:06.605 --> 00:43:09.085
<v Speaker 1>as I suggested, and there are projects on

00:43:09.085 --> 00:43:11.805
<v Speaker 1>the which is available everywhere. So cloud native

00:43:11.805 --> 00:43:13.724
<v Speaker 1>projects are there. There are platforms

00:43:13.724 --> 00:43:14.125
<v Speaker 1>like

00:43:15.724 --> 00:43:17.325
<v Speaker 1>there are platforms like

00:43:18.045 --> 00:43:21.110
<v Speaker 1>open source platforms like GitHub is there, and

00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:23.670
<v Speaker 1>there are GitHub is there. There are documents

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:26.070
<v Speaker 1>of these companies also. Like, if we take

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:27.510
<v Speaker 1>an example of a Pulumi.

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:30.870
<v Speaker 1>So Pulumi has various docs. So go to

00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:31.750
<v Speaker 1>that docs,

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:33.030
<v Speaker 1>learn about that docs,

00:43:33.654 --> 00:43:36.055
<v Speaker 1>and you know, like, this thing works like

00:43:36.055 --> 00:43:39.174
<v Speaker 1>this. So, yeah, how the pull Pulumi installation

00:43:39.174 --> 00:43:41.255
<v Speaker 1>is working? How the they are creating that

00:43:41.255 --> 00:43:42.214
<v Speaker 1>installation?

00:43:42.214 --> 00:43:44.775
<v Speaker 1>How can you indicate that you you don't

00:43:44.775 --> 00:43:46.375
<v Speaker 1>like you have the relearn skills, so you

00:43:46.375 --> 00:43:48.870
<v Speaker 1>can integrate that with another tools also.

00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:51.190
<v Speaker 1>Take that thing, build

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:52.630
<v Speaker 1>up a demo,

00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:53.830
<v Speaker 1>write

00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:55.750
<v Speaker 1>the blog for it, or share the course

00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:58.550
<v Speaker 1>snippets on the LinkedIn platform or Twitter platform.

00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Will

<v Speaker 1>we didn't knew, like, this can be done

00:44:14.975 --> 00:44:17.530
<v Speaker 1>like this also. So this this is happening

00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:19.770
<v Speaker 1>with their various employees of company. It is

00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:22.089
<v Speaker 1>not a fake thing I'm sharing. But, yeah,

00:44:22.089 --> 00:44:23.849
<v Speaker 1>if you are doing any real world use

00:44:23.849 --> 00:44:27.130
<v Speaker 1>case, some employees like me also don't know.

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:29.515
<v Speaker 1>Like, it can be that type of users

00:44:29.515 --> 00:44:32.235
<v Speaker 1>also resolved by our product.

00:44:32.475 --> 00:44:34.315
<v Speaker 1>So that kind of a thing is done.

00:44:34.315 --> 00:44:36.555
<v Speaker 1>So you are you are building anything,

00:44:36.715 --> 00:44:37.355
<v Speaker 1>share

00:44:37.675 --> 00:44:38.555
<v Speaker 1>online.

00:44:38.715 --> 00:44:41.195
<v Speaker 1>Go on go go means, like, public sharing

00:44:41.195 --> 00:44:43.520
<v Speaker 1>is the best thing you can do. So

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:45.839
<v Speaker 1>I always recommend that learn by doing and

00:44:45.839 --> 00:44:47.760
<v Speaker 1>public sharing is the best thing you can

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:50.080
<v Speaker 1>do to get the jobs. So how it

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:52.240
<v Speaker 1>is like, you are learning this you have

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.400
<v Speaker 1>the relevant skills. Right? So build

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.880
<v Speaker 1>the demos for it. Write the blogs or

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:59.975
<v Speaker 1>post snippets. Screenshot it. Share on the LinkedIn.

00:44:59.975 --> 00:45:01.335
<v Speaker 1>Share on the Twitter.

00:45:01.335 --> 00:45:03.815
<v Speaker 1>And you are if sharing day by day,

00:45:03.815 --> 00:45:06.455
<v Speaker 1>use some hashtag. Like, many people follow a

00:45:06.455 --> 00:45:08.455
<v Speaker 1>hundred days of course or ninety days of

00:45:08.455 --> 00:45:09.655
<v Speaker 1>DevOps and

00:45:09.735 --> 00:45:12.020
<v Speaker 1>various type of things they follow. You can

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:14.260
<v Speaker 1>follow the DevOps community hashtag also if you

00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:16.900
<v Speaker 1>want to recognize easily because I'm running that

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:18.740

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:20.260
<v Speaker 1>also because I will return.

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.020
<v Speaker 1>So that kind of a thing you can

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:24.020
<v Speaker 1>do. So if you are doing this daily,

00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:26.654
<v Speaker 1>you will will get the reach. Because once

00:45:26.815 --> 00:45:28.414
<v Speaker 1>one day, you will not get the reach.

00:45:28.414 --> 00:45:29.775
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Don't

<v Speaker 1>get sad.

00:45:32.095 --> 00:45:34.095
<v Speaker 1>Like, I'm I'm not getting the reach, so

00:45:34.095 --> 00:45:35.135
<v Speaker 1>I should shop.

00:45:35.934 --> 00:45:39.650
<v Speaker 1>Wait for the twenty days or not twenty

00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:42.210
<v Speaker 1>days, ten, fifteen days, twenty days, and you

<v Speaker 1>will see the results. People are recognizing

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:47.250
<v Speaker 1>you. They will reach out to your DMs.

00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:49.730
<v Speaker 1>So teach us or, like,

00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:52.535
<v Speaker 1>help with this use case. You will get

00:45:52.535 --> 00:45:55.575
<v Speaker 1>the freelancing opportunities also easily if that company

00:45:55.575 --> 00:45:57.895
<v Speaker 1>is not reaching to you. Another thing of

00:45:57.895 --> 00:46:00.215
<v Speaker 1>open source contribution you can do, go to

00:46:00.215 --> 00:46:03.575
<v Speaker 1>that company's GitHub repository and see, like, what

00:46:03.575 --> 00:46:05.175
<v Speaker 1>kind of a core they are building,

00:46:05.335 --> 00:46:06.775
<v Speaker 1>what you can add into that.

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:10.220
<v Speaker 1>Or third kind of a thing is, like,

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:11.020
<v Speaker 1>communities.

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:13.740
<v Speaker 1>So every company has a community. So, like,

<v Speaker 1>our solo dot has a community. Go into

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:17.500

<v Speaker 1>you can see, like, various employees are sorry.

00:46:30.205 --> 00:46:32.605
<v Speaker 1>Various users asking the doubts

<v Speaker 1>employees or developer advocate will see your efforts.

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:42.520
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, I I we will reach out

00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:44.440
<v Speaker 1>to you. We will ask for your guidance

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:46.680
<v Speaker 1>or, yeah, in future, you can get the

00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:49.000
<v Speaker 1>jobs also. I have seen various people getting

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.555
<v Speaker 1>jobs like this. I got the job by

00:46:51.555 --> 00:46:53.715
<v Speaker 1>Twitter reach out. So you can go to

00:46:53.715 --> 00:46:56.115
<v Speaker 1>anything. You can go you can get the

00:46:56.115 --> 00:46:57.635
<v Speaker 1>job by any so

00:46:58.035 --> 00:47:00.355
<v Speaker 1>this thing is happening. Like, I said, the

00:47:00.355 --> 00:47:02.670
<v Speaker 1>three steps to get the remote job. Fourth

00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:03.630
<v Speaker 1>is networking.

00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:06.590
<v Speaker 1>So now how you will grow your networking?

00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:09.869
<v Speaker 1>You will have you you should have submit

00:47:09.869 --> 00:47:12.430
<v Speaker 1>the CFPs in the various conferences.

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:14.525
<v Speaker 1>One of this thing you can do. Second

00:47:14.525 --> 00:47:16.525
<v Speaker 1>thing, write the cool blocks.

00:47:16.765 --> 00:47:19.085
<v Speaker 1>So your blocks will reach out to various

00:47:19.085 --> 00:47:19.725
<v Speaker 1>people.

00:47:20.125 --> 00:47:22.285
<v Speaker 1>My blocks reach out to various people. That's

00:47:22.285 --> 00:47:25.085
<v Speaker 1>why it was one type of open source

00:47:25.245 --> 00:47:26.685
<v Speaker 1>contributions you can

00:47:27.609 --> 00:47:28.410
<v Speaker 1>validate.

00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Because if I'm doing any project or something,

00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:34.890
<v Speaker 1>but in future, if someone do does that

00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:36.010
<v Speaker 1>project also,

00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:38.650
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter for you. Right? So what you

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:40.570
<v Speaker 1>can do for now, you had done that

00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:42.745
<v Speaker 1>project. Right? So write the blog for it.

00:47:42.985 --> 00:47:43.785
<v Speaker 1>You

00:47:43.865 --> 00:47:45.945
<v Speaker 1>have the validation for that project. Right? In

00:47:45.945 --> 00:47:48.265
<v Speaker 1>future, if you are applying the any jobs,

00:47:49.065 --> 00:47:51.385
<v Speaker 1>you have any adding the your projects in

00:47:51.385 --> 00:47:53.145
<v Speaker 1>the resume or your website.

00:47:53.385 --> 00:47:55.625
<v Speaker 1>So you have the validation for your work.

00:47:55.625 --> 00:47:58.080
<v Speaker 1>Right? So similarly, if you are doing any

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:01.680
<v Speaker 1>community sharing LinkedIn platform, like any that core

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:04.160
<v Speaker 1>snippets you shared, right, public sharing. That is

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:06.880
<v Speaker 1>also your validation of your work. So if

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:08.640
<v Speaker 1>you have the validation of your work, it

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.484
<v Speaker 1>is easy to get the jobs. You will

00:48:10.484 --> 00:48:11.765
<v Speaker 1>not get any problem.

00:48:12.085 --> 00:48:14.565
<v Speaker 1>So that things comes in the open source

00:48:14.565 --> 00:48:15.685
<v Speaker 1>contributions.

00:48:15.765 --> 00:48:17.125
<v Speaker 1>And another thing,

00:48:18.005 --> 00:48:18.645
<v Speaker 1>not

00:48:20.565 --> 00:48:21.845
<v Speaker 1>don't think, like

00:48:22.484 --> 00:48:24.724
<v Speaker 1>miss, many people

00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:27.000
<v Speaker 1>has many students has the afraid to write

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.240
<v Speaker 1>the blogs or come to the video screen.

00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:32.040
<v Speaker 1>So first time when I was giving the

00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:32.600
<v Speaker 1>talk,

00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:34.760

<v Speaker 1>from the English speaking countries.

00:48:43.575 --> 00:48:45.655
<v Speaker 1>So it is some kind of a

00:48:46.454 --> 00:48:47.095
<v Speaker 1>thing

00:48:47.414 --> 00:48:48.855
<v Speaker 1>which affects us.

00:48:49.015 --> 00:48:49.575

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:56.040
<v Speaker 0>think is really important is just sharing what

00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:58.120
<v Speaker 0>you learn, especially if you don't have a

00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:00.545
<v Speaker 0>lot of professional experience, being able to build

00:50:00.545 --> 00:50:03.505
<v Speaker 0>up that repertoire and that profile of just

00:50:03.505 --> 00:50:05.025
<v Speaker 0>being someone that goes out there and learn

00:50:05.025 --> 00:50:07.505
<v Speaker 0>stuff and shares it is is really, really

00:50:07.505 --> 00:50:08.704
<v Speaker 0>gonna help. Like,

00:50:09.105 --> 00:50:10.865
<v Speaker 0>there's just some amazing people out there sharing

00:50:10.865 --> 00:50:11.825
<v Speaker 0>content,

00:50:12.305 --> 00:50:13.265
<v Speaker 0>and we

00:50:13.345 --> 00:50:15.025
<v Speaker 0>need more of that. We definitely need more

00:50:15.025 --> 00:50:16.680
<v Speaker 0>of that. So one thing I would add

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.600
<v Speaker 0>to what you've said is just like,

00:50:20.119 --> 00:50:22.680
<v Speaker 0>you know, what makes an experienced engineer isn't

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:24.760
<v Speaker 0>how many jobs they've had. It's how many

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:25.880
<v Speaker 0>times they've failed.

00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:28.200
<v Speaker 0>Right? We all learn through failures. So I

00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:30.365
<v Speaker 0>would encourage people that are new to to

00:50:30.365 --> 00:50:33.085
<v Speaker 0>DevOps and Kubernetes and containers and cloud and

00:50:33.085 --> 00:50:35.085
<v Speaker 0>CICD and all of this stuff that we

00:50:35.085 --> 00:50:37.165
<v Speaker 0>were talking about is that it's it's okay

00:50:37.165 --> 00:50:38.525
<v Speaker 0>to make mistakes and it's okay to get

00:50:38.525 --> 00:50:40.125
<v Speaker 0>things wrong because that just means that you're

00:50:40.125 --> 00:50:41.244
<v Speaker 0>learning. So

00:50:41.244 --> 00:50:43.500
<v Speaker 0>get really comfortable with that. I've been doing

00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:45.100
<v Speaker 0>this twenty years and I still make mistakes

00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:47.020
<v Speaker 0>every single week. And and

00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:49.660
<v Speaker 0>what what you get better at is recovering

00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:51.820
<v Speaker 0>from those mistakes quicker and learning from them

00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:52.620
<v Speaker 0>faster.

00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:54.700
<v Speaker 0>And that I think that's a really important

00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:56.700
<v Speaker 0>part of the learning that we try to

00:50:57.295 --> 00:50:59.455
<v Speaker 0>not sweep under the carpet or hide, but,

00:50:59.455 --> 00:51:00.575
<v Speaker 0>you know, we definitely

00:51:00.895 --> 00:51:03.615
<v Speaker 0>twenty years ago, you were vilified for mistakes.

00:51:03.615 --> 00:51:04.975
<v Speaker 0>Like, people would say, oh, you shouldn't have

00:51:04.975 --> 00:51:06.735
<v Speaker 0>a job and you're crap. And that's just

00:51:06.735 --> 00:51:08.655
<v Speaker 0>a horrible, horrible culture

00:51:08.975 --> 00:51:10.735
<v Speaker 0>in our industry. And I'm really glad to

00:51:10.735 --> 00:51:11.455
<v Speaker 0>see that getting

00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:14.549
<v Speaker 0>better and improving and everyone being a lot

00:51:14.549 --> 00:51:16.150
<v Speaker 0>more welcoming within the industry.

00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:18.630
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, get comfortable with failure and listen to

00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:20.710
<v Speaker 0>everything that's been said here because, you know,

00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:22.549
<v Speaker 0>Rohit is dropping a ton of knowledge here.

00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:23.190
<v Speaker 0>This is wonderful.

00:51:25.255 --> 00:51:28.215
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We have another question, which is kind

00:51:28.215 --> 00:51:29.895
<v Speaker 0>of adjacent to what we're talking about now

00:51:29.895 --> 00:51:31.175
<v Speaker 0>and one that I I think is a

00:51:31.175 --> 00:51:32.055
<v Speaker 0>really good question,

00:51:32.535 --> 00:51:34.855
<v Speaker 0>which is about data structures and algorithm.

00:51:35.895 --> 00:51:38.695
<v Speaker 0>The question is, I don't like DSA.

00:51:38.775 --> 00:51:40.910
<v Speaker 0>Nobody likes data structures and algorithms. I I

00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:42.910
<v Speaker 0>guarantee you, nobody likes them.

00:51:43.310 --> 00:51:44.670
<v Speaker 0>Will that impact

00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:47.950
<v Speaker 0>their DevOps journey? You wanna tackle this or

00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:50.030
<v Speaker 0>you want me to I can add some

00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:51.950
<v Speaker 1>points, and you can add some points. Because

00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:54.510
<v Speaker 1>I know, like, you you

00:51:54.075 --> 00:51:56.075
<v Speaker 1>you have some knowledge over this, and you

00:51:56.075 --> 00:51:57.915
<v Speaker 1>you would have some awesome

00:51:58.075 --> 00:52:00.075
<v Speaker 1>points to add. So let's let me add

00:52:00.075 --> 00:52:01.915
<v Speaker 1>some, and you can add others.

00:52:02.155 --> 00:52:04.795
<v Speaker 1>So data structures and algorithms.

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:08.590
<v Speaker 1>About this thing, like DSA,

00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:11.870
<v Speaker 1>many people feel like DSA is only the

00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:13.870
<v Speaker 1>only the computer coding.

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:16.350
<v Speaker 1>So computer coding is a different. Programming is

00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:18.110
<v Speaker 1>different. DSA is different.

00:52:18.350 --> 00:52:20.750
<v Speaker 1>So you should know first that all. So

00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:21.390
<v Speaker 1>DSA

00:52:21.825 --> 00:52:25.505
<v Speaker 1>in college, there it was DSA was

00:52:25.665 --> 00:52:26.625
<v Speaker 1>our subject.

00:52:26.785 --> 00:52:29.025
<v Speaker 1>So I have learned there, and I cleared.

00:52:29.025 --> 00:52:31.585
<v Speaker 1>I was happy. But after that, I didn't

00:52:31.585 --> 00:52:33.984
<v Speaker 1>had much contact with DSA. I just learned

00:52:33.984 --> 00:52:36.145
<v Speaker 1>about the programming like Python, and

00:52:36.945 --> 00:52:39.340
<v Speaker 1>there is Python, Groovy, and

00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:41.500
<v Speaker 1>I am starting to learn about the Go

00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:44.460
<v Speaker 1>because, see, I'm working as a DevOps engineer

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:46.860
<v Speaker 1>and developer and don't know the Go language.

00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:47.820
<v Speaker 1>So

00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:50.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. Because thing is, like, you

00:52:50.620 --> 00:52:52.665
<v Speaker 1>you should you should learn

00:52:53.225 --> 00:52:55.945
<v Speaker 1>I I would suggest, like, learn one programming

00:52:55.945 --> 00:52:58.505
<v Speaker 1>language very well, and other, you can learn

00:52:58.505 --> 00:52:59.705
<v Speaker 1>easily afterwards.

00:52:59.785 --> 00:53:02.025
<v Speaker 1>So that is not a point. So

00:53:02.585 --> 00:53:05.545
<v Speaker 1>learn programming language. Data structure algorithms will not,

00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:06.660
<v Speaker 1>like,

00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:09.380
<v Speaker 1>learn the syntax well. So how why it

00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:11.380
<v Speaker 1>will disturb you in the DevOps general?

00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:13.940
<v Speaker 1>So DevOps only require the scripting.

00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:17.620
<v Speaker 1>So scripting is like Linux scripting, batch scripting,

00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:20.500
<v Speaker 1>and Groove scripting is there for the Jenkins

00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:20.900
<v Speaker 1>pipeline.

00:53:21.305 --> 00:53:22.985
<v Speaker 1>And there is another

00:53:22.985 --> 00:53:24.025
<v Speaker 1>scripting.

00:53:24.825 --> 00:53:27.625
<v Speaker 1>Today, Go scripting is there. So this scripting

00:53:27.625 --> 00:53:30.185
<v Speaker 1>is required to other thing is, like, the

00:53:30.185 --> 00:53:32.425
<v Speaker 1>telephone code if you are in in such

00:53:32.425 --> 00:53:32.985
<v Speaker 1>a support.

00:53:33.385 --> 00:53:35.609
<v Speaker 1>So that type of code is there. So

00:53:35.609 --> 00:53:38.250
<v Speaker 1>that also you you are doing the scripting.

00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:40.329
<v Speaker 1>So DSA will not impact you in your

00:53:40.329 --> 00:53:43.210
<v Speaker 1>cover. It doesn't impacted me. So, yeah, that

00:53:43.210 --> 00:53:45.609
<v Speaker 1>was my kind of knowledge in this thing.

00:53:45.609 --> 00:53:48.089
<v Speaker 1>So, yeah, David, you can add some points

00:53:48.089 --> 00:53:48.329
<v Speaker 1>here.

00:53:49.484 --> 00:53:50.525
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Of course.

00:53:50.845 --> 00:53:53.565
<v Speaker 0>I just wanna pop a comment up because

00:53:53.805 --> 00:53:55.724
<v Speaker 0>it's just saying how awesome you are and

00:53:55.724 --> 00:53:57.885
<v Speaker 0>how informative this has been. So, yeah, I

00:53:57.885 --> 00:54:00.045
<v Speaker 0>just wanna echo that. Like, there's there's there's

00:54:00.045 --> 00:54:02.049
<v Speaker 0>so much cool stuff here. And to add

00:54:02.049 --> 00:54:03.810
<v Speaker 0>to what you're talking about, I agree.

00:54:04.369 --> 00:54:05.730
<v Speaker 0>I don't think I've ever been on a

00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:06.930
<v Speaker 0>DevOps

00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:10.290
<v Speaker 0>interview or even given a DevOps interview where

00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:12.690
<v Speaker 0>DSA has been important. So, like, if you

00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:15.225
<v Speaker 0>find that data structures and algorithms are a

00:54:15.225 --> 00:54:17.305
<v Speaker 0>particular weakness of yours, and that's fine, they

00:54:17.305 --> 00:54:19.225
<v Speaker 0>are for a lot of people. And DevOps

00:54:19.225 --> 00:54:20.985
<v Speaker 0>is a good way to to go and

00:54:20.985 --> 00:54:23.145
<v Speaker 0>and work with all these cool tools without

00:54:23.145 --> 00:54:24.745
<v Speaker 0>necessarily having to know how to reverse a

00:54:24.745 --> 00:54:27.145
<v Speaker 0>binary tree. Right? And to be honest,

00:54:27.945 --> 00:54:29.225
<v Speaker 0>I spent a lot of time in my

00:54:29.225 --> 00:54:31.980
<v Speaker 0>youth doing data structures and algorithm stuff, and

00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:33.740
<v Speaker 0>it's never really been that useful to me

00:54:33.740 --> 00:54:35.100
<v Speaker 0>in my entire career.

00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:37.980
<v Speaker 0>Because we've moved up the stack language like,

00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:40.860
<v Speaker 0>programming languages and standard libraries for programming languages,

00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:43.100
<v Speaker 0>have these things implemented for you. If you

00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:45.285
<v Speaker 0>need a priority queue, hey. It's in the

00:54:45.285 --> 00:54:47.045
<v Speaker 0>standard library. Do you need a heap? It's

00:54:47.045 --> 00:54:48.325
<v Speaker 0>in the standard library. Do you need a

00:54:48.325 --> 00:54:49.684
<v Speaker 0>hash map and do need to sort it?

00:54:49.684 --> 00:54:51.925
<v Speaker 0>It's in the standard library. Like, I can't

00:54:51.925 --> 00:54:54.724
<v Speaker 0>remember the last time I had to break

00:54:54.724 --> 00:54:56.645
<v Speaker 0>out any of these algorithms for day to

00:54:56.645 --> 00:54:57.204
<v Speaker 0>day work.

00:54:57.789 --> 00:55:00.269
<v Speaker 0>And I'm really disappointed as an industry to

00:55:00.269 --> 00:55:01.390
<v Speaker 0>see organizations

00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:03.789
<v Speaker 0>still present these questions to people at job

00:55:03.789 --> 00:55:04.910
<v Speaker 0>interviews because

00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:07.869
<v Speaker 0>I think all they do is confirm that

00:55:07.869 --> 00:55:10.575
<v Speaker 0>someone went to university or a college. And

00:55:10.575 --> 00:55:12.575
<v Speaker 0>I think we're progressed so much further beyond

00:55:12.575 --> 00:55:14.095
<v Speaker 0>that now in our industry. Like, we have

00:55:14.095 --> 00:55:16.575
<v Speaker 0>people coming from nontraditional backgrounds that don't have

00:55:16.575 --> 00:55:18.895
<v Speaker 0>that knowledge, and I think these are disadvantaged.

00:55:18.895 --> 00:55:20.335
<v Speaker 0>These interview style questions

00:55:20.655 --> 00:55:22.494
<v Speaker 0>are disadvantaged to them, and I don't think

00:55:22.494 --> 00:55:25.130
<v Speaker 0>that's fair. Because, again, we just don't need

00:55:25.130 --> 00:55:26.490
<v Speaker 0>to do this stuff day to day. Now

00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:27.450
<v Speaker 0>there are some

00:55:27.850 --> 00:55:30.730
<v Speaker 0>programming languages that don't have as complete standard

00:55:30.730 --> 00:55:32.490
<v Speaker 0>languages like Cs. If you're going for a

00:55:32.490 --> 00:55:34.170
<v Speaker 0>C job, maybe you do know need to

00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:36.730
<v Speaker 0>know recursion and how to work with binary

00:55:36.730 --> 00:55:39.605
<v Speaker 0>trees or macro trees or bubble sort or

00:55:39.605 --> 00:55:42.085
<v Speaker 0>quick select, any of these things. But

00:55:42.325 --> 00:55:44.244
<v Speaker 0>nine times out of 10 or even 99

00:55:44.244 --> 00:55:46.085
<v Speaker 0>times out of a hundred, these things just

00:55:46.085 --> 00:55:48.005
<v Speaker 0>are not applicable anymore. But I'd like to

00:55:48.005 --> 00:55:48.805
<v Speaker 0>see organizations

00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:53.410
<v Speaker 0>give people tests or not even just tests,

00:55:53.410 --> 00:55:55.170
<v Speaker 0>but be able to, through conversation,

00:55:55.170 --> 00:55:57.730
<v Speaker 0>judge someone's experience and what they're interested in

00:55:57.730 --> 00:56:00.050
<v Speaker 0>and what they're capable of without resorting to

00:56:00.050 --> 00:56:02.050
<v Speaker 0>these horrible whiteboard DSAs.

00:56:02.625 --> 00:56:04.465
<v Speaker 0>I I think we can do better, and

00:56:04.465 --> 00:56:05.825
<v Speaker 0>I hope that we do better.

00:56:06.945 --> 00:56:08.705
<v Speaker 0>So, yeah, DevOps, I I don't think it

00:56:08.705 --> 00:56:09.985
<v Speaker 0>will be a problem for you.

00:56:10.385 --> 00:56:12.865
<v Speaker 0>You're very unlikely to get DSA questions. And

00:56:12.865 --> 00:56:14.385
<v Speaker 0>if you don't wanna move on to engineering,

00:56:15.279 --> 00:56:16.880
<v Speaker 0>you just have to find the right organization

00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:19.359
<v Speaker 0>that knows how to speak developers and understand

00:56:19.359 --> 00:56:21.599
<v Speaker 0>developers and what they're capable of without resorting

00:56:21.599 --> 00:56:23.760
<v Speaker 0>to traditional whiteboard and style questions,

00:56:24.319 --> 00:56:25.040
<v Speaker 0>which

00:56:25.359 --> 00:56:27.119
<v Speaker 0>I still think a few far between right

00:56:27.119 --> 00:56:28.319
<v Speaker 0>now, but it is getting better.

00:56:30.875 --> 00:56:31.595
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:56:32.235 --> 00:56:32.875
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

<v Speaker 0>There we go. Yeah. I am I am

00:56:39.675 --> 00:56:42.075
<v Speaker 1>I am like, I I saw

00:56:43.035 --> 00:56:46.200
<v Speaker 1>this mic on Kunal's video only. So I

00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:48.680
<v Speaker 1>thought, like, yeah, it is nice mice because

00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Kunal is using, so it will it will

00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:53.160
<v Speaker 1>be nice. Right? So I bought one. Yeah.

00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:54.280
<v Speaker 0>Very cool.

00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:57.400
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, we are approaching about an hour

00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:00.185
<v Speaker 0>now. Is there anything you're gonna share some

00:57:00.185 --> 00:57:02.505
<v Speaker 0>resources with us today. Right? You're gonna you've

00:57:02.505 --> 00:57:04.025
<v Speaker 0>got a a repository that could be a

00:57:04.025 --> 00:57:06.505
<v Speaker 0>valuable resource for people to learn more about

00:57:06.505 --> 00:57:08.345
<v Speaker 0>everything that we spoke about today.

00:57:08.665 --> 00:57:10.585
<v Speaker 0>So I think we should show people that.

00:57:10.905 --> 00:57:12.185
<v Speaker 0>Do you want me to share my screen,

00:57:12.185 --> 00:57:13.305
<v Speaker 0>or would you like to share your screen?

00:57:13.305 --> 00:57:14.740
<v Speaker 0>Do you have preference? Yeah. Yeah. You can

00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:17.380
<v Speaker 1>share that screen, so I will explain on

00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:18.900
<v Speaker 1>the video. Yeah.

00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:20.900
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:26.500
<v Speaker 0>Too many monitors.

00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:26.980
<v Speaker 0>Let me think.

00:57:36.435 --> 00:57:37.075
<v Speaker 0>There.

00:57:37.315 --> 00:57:37.715
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:46.069
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So this is your GitHub

00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.869
<v Speaker 0>username.

00:57:47.269 --> 00:57:49.670
<v Speaker 0>So that is rawkode g zero zero.

00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:53.269
<v Speaker 0>You have a repository called dev ops underscore

00:57:53.269 --> 00:57:53.910
<v Speaker 0>books,

00:57:54.069 --> 00:57:55.670
<v Speaker 0>which people can check out. Do you wanna

00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:57.585
<v Speaker 0>tell us a little bit about this? Why

00:57:57.585 --> 00:57:59.505
<v Speaker 0>you why you started it and and who

00:57:59.505 --> 00:58:00.225
<v Speaker 0>it's for?

00:58:00.625 --> 00:58:03.265
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. So thing is, like, it has

00:58:03.265 --> 00:58:05.265
<v Speaker 1>a books which is available

00:58:05.345 --> 00:58:06.625
<v Speaker 1>of various

00:58:06.625 --> 00:58:08.865
<v Speaker 1>dev ops what do we say? There are

00:58:08.865 --> 00:58:10.145
<v Speaker 1>various writers

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:12.880
<v Speaker 1>which which are writing out the system designing,

00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:14.800
<v Speaker 1>and they are writing about DevOps,

00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:16.160
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes,

00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:17.440
<v Speaker 1>Istio.

00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:20.720
<v Speaker 1>So they have various books which are e

00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:22.320
<v Speaker 1>freely available ebooks,

00:58:22.785 --> 00:58:23.345
<v Speaker 1>but

00:58:24.065 --> 00:58:26.145
<v Speaker 1>people are finding it hard to get that

00:58:26.145 --> 00:58:28.865
<v Speaker 1>resources easily. So what I did, I collected

00:58:28.865 --> 00:58:32.065
<v Speaker 1>everything, and I asked various people to add

00:58:32.065 --> 00:58:34.464
<v Speaker 1>that. I mean, whenever they find any books

00:58:34.464 --> 00:58:36.785
<v Speaker 1>or something, ebooks or something freely available,

00:58:37.359 --> 00:58:39.839
<v Speaker 1>can upload it to this web website, this

00:58:39.839 --> 00:58:42.000
<v Speaker 1>GitHub repository, and it is, like, open source

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000
<v Speaker 1>contribution for you also, and it will help

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000
<v Speaker 1>the other also. So it is, like, huge

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.320
<v Speaker 1>library where everyone can see that,

00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:49.280
<v Speaker 1>what we say,

00:58:50.415 --> 00:58:52.735
<v Speaker 1>books and read about them. And, yeah, it

00:58:52.735 --> 00:58:54.735
<v Speaker 1>is fully available. You can read the books

00:58:54.735 --> 00:58:56.815
<v Speaker 1>here. Other thing is, like,

00:58:57.855 --> 00:59:00.575
<v Speaker 1>I would I would share my

00:59:01.055 --> 00:59:02.655
<v Speaker 1>what do we say? You can go to

00:59:02.655 --> 00:59:06.040
<v Speaker 1>my Twitter profile. So there are communities like

00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:08.680
<v Speaker 1>should I share share the screen?

00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:10.280
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Sure. Go for it.

00:59:20.815 --> 00:59:24.095
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I guess I'm feeling some problem here.

00:59:24.095 --> 00:59:25.135
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Okay.

00:59:26.335 --> 00:59:28.095
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Is my screen visible?

00:59:28.815 --> 00:59:30.415
<v Speaker 0>No. I don't think you're shading yet.

00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:38.680
<v Speaker 0>Is it sharing on your site? Because I

00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:39.720
<v Speaker 0>don't see anything.

00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:44.280
<v Speaker 1>I guess there is some problem with my

00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:46.465
<v Speaker 1>new Mac. I just bought a new Mac,

00:59:46.465 --> 00:59:49.025
<v Speaker 1>so that's why it doesn't have any sharing

00:59:49.025 --> 00:59:52.145
<v Speaker 1>type of access. So, yeah, no problem. You

00:59:52.145 --> 00:59:53.265

<v Speaker 1>on the DevOps community, which will share the

01:00:10.484 --> 01:00:14.005
<v Speaker 1>answer for you. So whatever questions you want,

01:00:14.325 --> 01:00:16.885

<v Speaker 1>DevOps community

01:00:20.085 --> 01:00:21.045
<v Speaker 1>hashtag,

01:00:21.285 --> 01:00:23.444

<v Speaker 1>see that previous resources I have shared. So

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:36.040
<v Speaker 1>there are some dev ops road maps out

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:38.280
<v Speaker 1>there that that are dev ops part, like,

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:40.785
<v Speaker 1>how how I did my journey into the

01:00:40.785 --> 01:00:42.945

<v Speaker 1>far ahead of everyone into the DevOps

01:01:38.135 --> 01:01:38.855

<v Speaker 0>them in just a few minutes. I'll just

01:02:06.045 --> 01:02:07.565
<v Speaker 0>echo everyone should definitely

01:02:07.885 --> 01:02:08.765
<v Speaker 0>be following

01:02:09.005 --> 01:02:11.325
<v Speaker 0>here. So this is the profile. Lots of

01:02:11.325 --> 01:02:13.325
<v Speaker 0>good links here. There's a newsletter.

01:02:13.325 --> 01:02:14.605
<v Speaker 0>I love that you've got a nice little

01:02:14.605 --> 01:02:16.845
<v Speaker 0>kind of penned introduction as well just about

01:02:16.845 --> 01:02:18.685
<v Speaker 0>who you are. So yeah. Awesome.

01:02:19.089 --> 01:02:21.010
<v Speaker 0>And I wanna just point out this book's

01:02:21.010 --> 01:02:23.809
<v Speaker 0>list is awesome. Right? So there's books on

01:02:23.809 --> 01:02:25.250
<v Speaker 0>Ansible, AWS,

01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:25.970
<v Speaker 0>Azure.

01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:28.609
<v Speaker 0>Sorry. On you go. Other than this, I

01:02:28.609 --> 01:02:31.410
<v Speaker 1>I think we have missed one thing. It's

01:02:31.410 --> 01:02:33.855
<v Speaker 1>like MLOps kind of a thing. So I

01:02:33.855 --> 01:02:35.855
<v Speaker 1>will give the a little brief about ML

01:02:35.855 --> 01:02:37.615
<v Speaker 1>ops. It is like, if you know the

01:02:37.615 --> 01:02:40.975
<v Speaker 1>DevOps and machine learning, integrate that machine learning

01:02:40.975 --> 01:02:43.375
<v Speaker 1>and DevOps both. It is like machine learning

01:02:43.375 --> 01:02:45.630
<v Speaker 1>on DevOps. It's ML ops. So ML ops

01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:48.829
<v Speaker 1>is like monitoring the various machine learning models

01:02:48.829 --> 01:02:49.630
<v Speaker 1>easily.

01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:52.109
<v Speaker 1>So the today, I think it's like data

01:02:52.109 --> 01:02:54.750
<v Speaker 1>scientist is facing the problem to learn about

01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:58.030
<v Speaker 1>the various things. Like, data science data scientist

01:02:58.030 --> 01:02:58.750
<v Speaker 1>are

01:02:58.935 --> 01:03:01.575
<v Speaker 1>facing the problem to deploy the models. And

01:03:01.735 --> 01:03:03.975
<v Speaker 1>when they deploy the model, 60%

01:03:03.975 --> 01:03:05.895
<v Speaker 1>of their model goes into the

01:03:06.215 --> 01:03:07.015
<v Speaker 1>scrap.

01:03:07.175 --> 01:03:09.495
<v Speaker 1>So they have to look move again and

01:03:09.495 --> 01:03:12.295
<v Speaker 1>solve that errors and start again. So they

01:03:12.295 --> 01:03:14.510
<v Speaker 1>all solve that problem. So so it is

01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:16.270
<v Speaker 1>like if you deploy the model into the

01:03:16.270 --> 01:03:19.070
<v Speaker 1>CSID pipeline, it will automate for you. And

01:03:19.070 --> 01:03:20.990
<v Speaker 1>then after you do the automation,

01:03:21.550 --> 01:03:23.710
<v Speaker 1>and it will run the pipelines again and

01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:26.830
<v Speaker 1>again. So your code, you have written the

01:03:26.830 --> 01:03:28.910
<v Speaker 1>script in the that CSID, and it will

01:03:29.045 --> 01:03:30.405
<v Speaker 1>run that code for

01:03:31.045 --> 01:03:33.605
<v Speaker 1>again and again till you get that your

01:03:33.605 --> 01:03:36.165
<v Speaker 1>accuracy you which you want. So it is

01:03:36.165 --> 01:03:38.485
<v Speaker 1>nice. I have some blocks on the envelopes

01:03:38.485 --> 01:03:41.285
<v Speaker 1>also. You can go to my website, and

01:03:41.285 --> 01:03:42.325
<v Speaker 1>you can check that blocks.

01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:44.950
<v Speaker 1>I have some projects on the DevOps and

01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:47.109
<v Speaker 1>ML ops side also. You can check that.

01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:49.269
<v Speaker 1>So ML ops, how to line into the

01:03:49.269 --> 01:03:51.430
<v Speaker 1>ML ops? This is the best

01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:55.269
<v Speaker 1>career I will suggest for now because there

01:03:55.269 --> 01:03:57.349
<v Speaker 1>are only list companies working on the ML

01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:59.895
<v Speaker 1>ops. So you have you have the more

01:03:59.895 --> 01:04:02.055
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to go going to going into the

01:04:02.055 --> 01:04:03.175
<v Speaker 1>MLOps. So

01:04:04.775 --> 01:04:06.535
<v Speaker 1>learn about the ML into

01:04:06.695 --> 01:04:07.735
<v Speaker 1>basic basic,

01:04:08.375 --> 01:04:09.735
<v Speaker 1>like, of various

01:04:09.735 --> 01:04:12.375
<v Speaker 1>algorithms are there and then connect it into

01:04:12.375 --> 01:04:14.530
<v Speaker 1>the kind of a thing. So it is

01:04:14.530 --> 01:04:15.890
<v Speaker 1>easy. So as

01:04:16.130 --> 01:04:19.089
<v Speaker 1>David suggested, you don't need to learn deep

01:04:19.089 --> 01:04:21.170
<v Speaker 1>into the data structure. But

01:04:21.329 --> 01:04:24.210
<v Speaker 1>once you learn the Python, every every libraries

01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:26.609
<v Speaker 1>are there easily, which you can use that

01:04:26.609 --> 01:04:28.994
<v Speaker 1>library to build the packages, and

01:04:28.994 --> 01:04:30.275
<v Speaker 1>you can you

01:04:30.275 --> 01:04:32.355
<v Speaker 1>can build your own library also. So it

01:04:32.355 --> 01:04:34.515
<v Speaker 1>is not a issue. So, yeah,

01:04:34.755 --> 01:04:37.234
<v Speaker 1>thanks for having me, and, yeah, it was

01:04:37.234 --> 01:04:39.714
<v Speaker 1>nice. Yeah. So ask the questions if you

01:04:39.714 --> 01:04:40.595
<v Speaker 1>have. Everyone,

01:04:41.395 --> 01:04:43.779
<v Speaker 1>you can ask any questions you have, and

01:04:43.779 --> 01:04:45.940
<v Speaker 1>we will answer you for you. Another thing

01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:48.420
<v Speaker 1>is, like, there are various tools we have

01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:49.619
<v Speaker 1>not taken yet.

01:04:50.099 --> 01:04:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Under road map after this,

01:04:52.579 --> 01:04:56.260
<v Speaker 1>so there are various things after the basic

01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:58.994
<v Speaker 1>things has done. So, like, chaos engineering is

01:04:58.994 --> 01:05:01.635
<v Speaker 1>there, service meshes are there. Istio is there.

01:05:01.875 --> 01:05:03.715
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to learn anything about

01:05:03.715 --> 01:05:06.355
<v Speaker 1>the service mesh Istio, go to the solo.io

01:05:06.355 --> 01:05:08.435
<v Speaker 1>academy. So there are various

01:05:08.595 --> 01:05:09.315
<v Speaker 1>courses,

01:05:09.555 --> 01:05:11.880
<v Speaker 1>workshops we do for the same, and you

<v Speaker 1>help you to learn about the service message

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:20.920
<v Speaker 1>to you. Anything about DevOps, we will free
