00:02:07.755 --> 00:02:08.475
<v Speaker 0>Hello,

00:02:08.635 --> 00:02:11.595
<v Speaker 0>and welcome back to the Rawkode Academy. I

00:02:11.595 --> 00:02:13.995
<v Speaker 0>am your host for today, David Flanagan. Although

00:02:13.995 --> 00:02:15.755
<v Speaker 0>you probably and hopefully know me from across

00:02:15.755 --> 00:02:17.275
<v Speaker 0>the Internet as Rawkode.

00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:20.475
<v Speaker 0>Today is an episode of cluster. It has

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.500
<v Speaker 0>been a few weeks since we've had a

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.260
<v Speaker 0>Clustered, but I'm very excited

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.739
<v Speaker 0>to have two great teams they work with

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.020
<v Speaker 0>us to fix,

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:28.540
<v Speaker 0>well, some unknowns.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.980
<v Speaker 0>And we'll get to that just in a

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:30.460
<v Speaker 0>minute.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.620
<v Speaker 0>But I am on a new Mac, which

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.220
<v Speaker 0>means I don't have any of my scenes

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.115
<v Speaker 0>prepared, but, you know, I do want to

00:02:36.115 --> 00:02:39.555
<v Speaker 0>thank both of our sponsors, EquinixMail and Teleport.

00:02:39.635 --> 00:02:41.155
<v Speaker 0>So we use Teleport

00:02:41.155 --> 00:02:43.715
<v Speaker 0>every single week on Cluster. It's how we

00:02:43.715 --> 00:02:45.715
<v Speaker 0>give the teams access

00:02:45.715 --> 00:02:48.290
<v Speaker 0>to all the clusters using GitHub authentication.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.050
<v Speaker 0>It's very, very cool. And it's also what

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.810
<v Speaker 0>we use live on the stream as well

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.890
<v Speaker 0>when we're debugged. So we actually get shared

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.210
<v Speaker 0>terminal access where we can all collaborate and

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.970
<v Speaker 0>pair together, which is awesome.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.175
<v Speaker 0>So go check out Teleport by visiting Rawkode.link/Teleport.

00:03:03.735 --> 00:03:05.974
<v Speaker 0>And that keeps the sponsors happy and means

00:03:05.974 --> 00:03:08.295
<v Speaker 0>we can keep doing more episodes of cluster.

00:03:08.694 --> 00:03:10.455
<v Speaker 0>Also, all of the hardware that we use

00:03:10.455 --> 00:03:12.855
<v Speaker 0>for cluster, and then we go through a

00:03:12.855 --> 00:03:14.535
<v Speaker 0>fair amount of bare metal clusters here. We're

00:03:14.535 --> 00:03:15.495
<v Speaker 0>not doing things cheaply.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.970
<v Speaker 0>It's provided by Equinix Metals. So thank you

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 0>so much to Equinix Metals. You should try

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.690
<v Speaker 0>it out. We have a $200

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.330
<v Speaker 0>code.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.410
<v Speaker 0>Just use the code Rawkode.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.690
<v Speaker 0>And if you want to use that, go

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 0>to Rawkode.link/metal.

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:29.890
<v Speaker 0>Simple.

00:03:30.455 --> 00:03:33.015
<v Speaker 0>That $200 will get you, like, anywhere from

00:03:33.015 --> 00:03:35.254
<v Speaker 0>a hundred hours, two hundred hours depending on

00:03:35.254 --> 00:03:37.655
<v Speaker 0>the instance that you use. I enjoy spinning

00:03:37.655 --> 00:03:39.015
<v Speaker 0>up the big, beefy ones, but you go

00:03:39.015 --> 00:03:40.935
<v Speaker 0>nuts. Do whatever you want.

00:03:41.415 --> 00:03:43.334
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Thank you to both of them, and

00:03:43.334 --> 00:03:44.534
<v Speaker 0>thank you to our teams.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.720
<v Speaker 0>No easy task getting people to join me

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.200
<v Speaker 0>on a session and do live streaming of

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.880
<v Speaker 0>fixing broken Kubernetes.

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.360
<v Speaker 0>It can be stressful at times as much

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.280
<v Speaker 0>as we enjoy it and learn and watch

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.095
<v Speaker 0>and have fun. So I really wanna say

00:03:58.095 --> 00:03:59.694
<v Speaker 0>thank you to and

00:03:59.694 --> 00:04:00.575

00:04:59.675 --> 00:05:01.195

<v Speaker 0>page. That would be fantastic.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.300
<v Speaker 0>This is what I get for buying a

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.540
<v Speaker 0>new machine and not having everything set up.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.940
<v Speaker 0>Okay. I get an access denied.

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.940
<v Speaker 1>No.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.900

<v Speaker 2>well, we're we're halfway there. We're ready.

00:06:01.014 --> 00:06:01.815
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:06:02.535 --> 00:06:04.935
<v Speaker 0>We are running a new version of Teleport,

00:06:04.935 --> 00:06:07.335
<v Speaker 0>so I'm assuming I have also broken something.

00:06:07.335 --> 00:06:09.255
<v Speaker 0>So I'm gonna come into the JetStack rule.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.090
<v Speaker 0>I have given you access to all the

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.850
<v Speaker 0>nodes. You have access to log in as

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:14.650
<v Speaker 0>rich.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:21.210
<v Speaker 0>Looks fine.

00:06:23.974 --> 00:06:26.695
<v Speaker 1>Still an access to join sessions? Hello?

00:06:27.574 --> 00:06:29.815
<v Speaker 0>I bet this what that rule out. Okay.

00:06:30.375 --> 00:06:30.935
<v Speaker 0>I

00:06:35.974 --> 00:06:37.735
<v Speaker 0>don't know what to do. I'm gonna have

00:06:37.735 --> 00:06:39.300
<v Speaker 0>to fix this first aren't I?

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.860
<v Speaker 2>So this is a good excuse to look

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.060
<v Speaker 2>around teleport though.

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:51.539
<v Speaker 0>Normally, just add so normally, I just update

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:53.219
<v Speaker 0>the node labels which gives you access to

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:55.605
<v Speaker 0>the window. Can you join this? Can you

00:06:55.605 --> 00:06:57.925
<v Speaker 0>open your own session and grasp your backup?

00:06:58.005 --> 00:06:59.205
<v Speaker 0>You wanna try that?

00:07:00.565 --> 00:07:02.485
<v Speaker 0>Do you get permission denied too?

00:07:04.405 --> 00:07:06.245
<v Speaker 2>Are we okay to enter his route? Or

00:07:06.325 --> 00:07:07.764
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Go for it. Just I just wanna

00:07:07.764 --> 00:07:08.565
<v Speaker 0>know if that works.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I got it.

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:14.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I got the same. Should be fine.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.350
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Do we want to join each other's

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:18.790
<v Speaker 2>sessions rather than

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:22.950
<v Speaker 0>Well, I'll tell you what. I'll join one

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:23.830
<v Speaker 0>of yours then.

00:07:24.795 --> 00:07:25.835
<v Speaker 0>I'll join

00:07:26.315 --> 00:07:27.515
<v Speaker 0>David's.

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:44.940
<v Speaker 0>Test denied.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.260
<v Speaker 0>That was useful. Alright.

00:07:56.155 --> 00:07:57.035
<v Speaker 0>Let's

00:07:57.115 --> 00:07:58.395
<v Speaker 0>take a look at the

00:07:58.715 --> 00:07:59.835
<v Speaker 0>teleport config.

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.510
<v Speaker 0>So simple, there's nothing to do here.

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:12.150
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:17.830
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going on to the cluster teleport

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.509
<v Speaker 0>node. So this is

00:08:20.335 --> 00:08:22.335
<v Speaker 0>where everything is configured.

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:23.535
<v Speaker 0>There's going to be,

00:08:25.055 --> 00:08:26.895
<v Speaker 0>won't be GitHub in here. It's okay.

<v Speaker 0>please nobody join my cluster.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:34.950
<v Speaker 0>This must be a new change.

00:10:06.579 --> 00:10:09.615
<v Speaker 0>with the telephot. Let's call it telephot.

00:10:11.375 --> 00:10:13.215
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So there is some sort of join

00:10:13.215 --> 00:10:15.615
<v Speaker 0>sessions thing here that I can apply.

00:10:18.095 --> 00:10:18.655
<v Speaker 2>When

00:10:19.055 --> 00:10:20.895
<v Speaker 2>clustered gets gets clustered. So

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.360
<v Speaker 1>clusterception.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.280
<v Speaker 0>Resources session less than read.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.880
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We'll try like, I don't wanna spend

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.960
<v Speaker 0>long on this, so we will try very

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:35.280
<v Speaker 0>quickly.

00:10:36.325 --> 00:10:38.165
<v Speaker 0>And if we can't, I guess,

00:10:39.605 --> 00:10:41.285
<v Speaker 0>I'm just gonna be doing a lot of

00:10:41.524 --> 00:10:42.964
<v Speaker 0>typing and you're gonna be doing a lot

00:10:42.964 --> 00:10:44.644
<v Speaker 0>of talking or maybe one of you could

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:45.685
<v Speaker 0>share your screen.

00:10:46.005 --> 00:10:48.005
<v Speaker 0>But let's try and fix it first. I

00:10:48.005 --> 00:10:49.925
<v Speaker 0>don't wanna be here. I'm gonna go to

00:10:49.925 --> 00:10:50.485
<v Speaker 0>role,

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:53.210
<v Speaker 0>JetStack rule.

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:56.250
<v Speaker 0>And we want to allow

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:01.210
<v Speaker 0>that rules.

00:11:10.305 --> 00:11:11.425
<v Speaker 0>That gonna work?

00:11:13.345 --> 00:11:14.065
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:11:16.225 --> 00:11:17.825
<v Speaker 0>Now I don't know what's gonna happen here

00:11:17.825 --> 00:11:19.665
<v Speaker 0>if this is even going to work. But

00:11:19.665 --> 00:11:21.025
<v Speaker 0>could one of you just try and join

00:11:21.025 --> 00:11:21.505
<v Speaker 0>that session?

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:27.190
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:28.390
<v Speaker 0>It worked?

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:30.150
<v Speaker 1>No.

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:34.230
<v Speaker 0>Damn it.

00:11:45.245 --> 00:11:47.085
<v Speaker 0>Okay. I am

00:11:48.925 --> 00:11:50.765
<v Speaker 0>I'm rude. That this is what I don't

00:11:50.765 --> 00:11:51.245
<v Speaker 0>understand.

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.940
<v Speaker 0>The TCCL

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:57.300
<v Speaker 0>users

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:00.420
<v Speaker 0>get

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.340
<v Speaker 0>where do get users?

00:12:05.795 --> 00:12:07.555
<v Speaker 0>Oh, wait. I'm not on my control.

00:12:07.795 --> 00:12:09.315
<v Speaker 0>Right. Let's try one more thing, and then

00:12:09.315 --> 00:12:10.515
<v Speaker 0>we'll have to come up with a backup

00:12:10.515 --> 00:12:12.435
<v Speaker 0>plan. Very sorry about this.

00:12:14.275 --> 00:12:16.835
<v Speaker 0>So from here, I can run TCTR command.

00:12:16.835 --> 00:12:18.035
<v Speaker 0>So I should be able to run get

00:12:18.035 --> 00:12:18.515
<v Speaker 0>users.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.980
<v Speaker 0>But let's do a YAML file

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.660
<v Speaker 0>and modify all of our user accounts. Now

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.740
<v Speaker 0>what is annoying is I am here

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.065
<v Speaker 0>and I'm going to oh, actually, because I

00:12:32.065 --> 00:12:34.305
<v Speaker 0>don't use the normal rules. So let's do

00:12:34.305 --> 00:12:35.265
<v Speaker 0>auditor,

00:12:38.705 --> 00:12:39.745
<v Speaker 0>access,

00:12:41.024 --> 00:12:43.904
<v Speaker 0>and editor. These are the main rule and

00:12:43.904 --> 00:12:45.665
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna do that for all users.

00:12:45.904 --> 00:12:48.490
<v Speaker 0>It's gonna be fun. So three.

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:50.090
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.250
<v Speaker 0>Hey. Well, if anyone wants to learn how

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.090
<v Speaker 0>to configure Teleport, I do have a whole

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:57.690
<v Speaker 0>bunch of videos on my YouTube channel.

00:12:59.225 --> 00:13:00.745
<v Speaker 1>So we've got this.

00:13:04.105 --> 00:13:04.665
<v Speaker 0>Roll.

00:13:05.625 --> 00:13:08.024
<v Speaker 0>Let's just search for rolls, shouldn't that?

00:13:08.904 --> 00:13:10.024
<v Speaker 0>Crash beer.

00:13:10.345 --> 00:13:11.580
<v Speaker 0>Crash beer.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:13.660
<v Speaker 0>And we're good. Okay. Now we can do

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.180
<v Speaker 0>TCTL.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.940
<v Speaker 0>I think it's update-fuser.net.

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.220
<v Speaker 0>Or is it just update? I don't know.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:24.459
<v Speaker 0>Thanks.

00:13:27.855 --> 00:13:29.055
<v Speaker 0>I

00:13:30.815 --> 00:13:32.495
<v Speaker 0>remember how to apply the config.

00:13:34.575 --> 00:13:35.135
<v Speaker 0>Create

00:13:36.415 --> 00:13:38.335
<v Speaker 0>-fuser.yaml.

00:13:38.335 --> 00:13:38.735
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:41.910
<v Speaker 0>Now we all have mega rules. Now I

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:43.829
<v Speaker 0>don't think the rule permission is gonna work

00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:45.509
<v Speaker 0>right away, but you may have to log

00:13:45.509 --> 00:13:47.110
<v Speaker 0>out in back end. But, however, you should

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:48.870
<v Speaker 0>hopefully be able to join my session because

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.470
<v Speaker 0>I've given you access to pretty much the

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:51.029
<v Speaker 0>entire house.

00:13:51.725 --> 00:13:53.565
<v Speaker 0>So let's go. Peace.

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.740
<v Speaker 0>And if I don't see somebody typing in

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.420
<v Speaker 0>the sessions, then I'm gonna cry.

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.460
<v Speaker 2>No. I I don't think I've got access

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:14.940
<v Speaker 2>still.

00:14:18.405 --> 00:14:19.045
<v Speaker 0>Nope.

00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:20.805
<v Speaker 0>So you can't join?

00:14:22.805 --> 00:14:24.005
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately, not.

00:14:25.045 --> 00:14:26.405
<v Speaker 2>Do we do we think of this do

00:14:26.405 --> 00:14:27.685
<v Speaker 2>do we think at this point?

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.400
<v Speaker 0>Did you log out? Did that have my

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.680
<v Speaker 1>share screen? Or

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.120
<v Speaker 1>I logged back out. Like, out and back

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.120
<v Speaker 1>in again. It still doesn't work.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Say Don't run that. I logged out.

00:14:43.035 --> 00:14:44.795
<v Speaker 1>Telepath internal join.

00:14:46.075 --> 00:14:47.435
<v Speaker 1>Access the name.

00:14:48.075 --> 00:14:49.275
<v Speaker 0>If I keep it,

00:14:50.795 --> 00:14:52.315
<v Speaker 0>it gives you everything.

00:14:54.235 --> 00:14:55.275
<v Speaker 0>Users,

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.160
<v Speaker 0>rules, author access, editor.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:04.680
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.720
<v Speaker 0>login is just wrong. Alright. Okay.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:08.760
<v Speaker 0>Last try.

00:15:14.565 --> 00:15:16.805
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. User. We've got this.

00:15:18.725 --> 00:15:20.084
<v Speaker 0>I'm not the one that's supposed to be

00:15:20.084 --> 00:15:21.605
<v Speaker 0>under pressure here. That's supposed to be

00:15:24.805 --> 00:15:25.925
<v Speaker 2>feel completely safe.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.720
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So

00:15:31.959 --> 00:15:34.360
<v Speaker 0>I think what I missed here is

00:15:36.759 --> 00:15:37.959
<v Speaker 0>logins.

00:15:39.319 --> 00:15:41.399
<v Speaker 0>So I think you've got the permission now,

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:42.680
<v Speaker 0>but not for this user.

00:15:45.535 --> 00:15:48.335
<v Speaker 0>So I'm gonna pop all of this in.

00:15:53.375 --> 00:15:54.495
<v Speaker 0>Let's save.

00:15:55.135 --> 00:15:56.335
<v Speaker 0>Create dash f.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.580
<v Speaker 0>Alright. All the users have been updated.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.260
<v Speaker 0>Let's let's see where we are, and then

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.220
<v Speaker 0>we'll just need to go up with a

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.740
<v Speaker 0>backup plan if this doesn't work.

00:16:13.935 --> 00:16:16.095
<v Speaker 0>No. Did you log out back then?

00:16:16.975 --> 00:16:19.215
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Logged out. Logged back in.

00:16:21.215 --> 00:16:22.015
<v Speaker 0>Damn it.

00:16:22.655 --> 00:16:23.455
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:16:24.255 --> 00:16:25.375
<v Speaker 0>Then backup plan.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.600
<v Speaker 0>I will be your typey typey.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.200
<v Speaker 0>Unless one of you wants to share your

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.560
<v Speaker 0>screen, in which case, I'm happy with that

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.640
<v Speaker 0>too. But otherwise, I am happy to type,

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.720
<v Speaker 0>and we can work through that.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.040
<v Speaker 2>It's up to David, really, because I think

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.760
<v Speaker 2>we we elected David as the as the

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:41.240
<v Speaker 2>typist.

00:16:42.235 --> 00:16:44.555
<v Speaker 2>So it's up to him whether he'd rather

00:16:45.035 --> 00:16:46.475
<v Speaker 2>whether we rather we

00:16:46.875 --> 00:16:47.915
<v Speaker 2>instruct you or

00:16:49.835 --> 00:16:52.235
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Amazing. I'll do the type in then.

00:16:52.235 --> 00:16:54.395
<v Speaker 0>I've exported the kube config. We now have

00:16:54.395 --> 00:16:56.555
<v Speaker 0>the ability to run a kube control command.

00:16:56.555 --> 00:16:57.790
<v Speaker 0>Which one would you like me to start

00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:58.270
<v Speaker 0>with?

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:01.950
<v Speaker 0>Oh, wait. I should've seen you're sharing your

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:03.390
<v Speaker 0>screen. So I I can share your screen

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:04.589
<v Speaker 0>if you want to do that. It's a

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:08.109
<v Speaker 1>That's fine. Yeah. I'm happy with that. Okay.

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:09.310
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:17:10.755 --> 00:17:11.794
<v Speaker 0>Seven.

00:17:13.795 --> 00:17:14.835
<v Speaker 1>Need to go to the game

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:24.049
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:26.210
<v Speaker 0>Can you zoom in and your font size

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:26.690
<v Speaker 0>will be

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:29.250
<v Speaker 0>perfect.

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.490
<v Speaker 0>No. I got it. I got it. One

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:32.049
<v Speaker 0>more.

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:35.410
<v Speaker 0>K. Go for it. That's all good.

00:17:36.345 --> 00:17:37.065
<v Speaker 1>Cool.

00:17:37.145 --> 00:17:38.504
<v Speaker 1>Right.

00:17:39.465 --> 00:17:40.585
<v Speaker 2>Where do we start?

00:17:40.745 --> 00:17:42.504
<v Speaker 2>Okay. Nice. Do

00:17:46.424 --> 00:17:47.785
<v Speaker 1>do we have a CubeC panel?

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.039
<v Speaker 1>No. Well, yes. But

00:17:53.679 --> 00:17:54.799
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. That's what I was about to see.

00:17:54.799 --> 00:17:56.559
<v Speaker 2>What are the permissions on QTTL?

00:18:06.555 --> 00:18:08.555
<v Speaker 0>We have seen this before on clustered. So

00:18:08.555 --> 00:18:10.395
<v Speaker 0>now I'm gonna find out who has paid

00:18:10.395 --> 00:18:12.075
<v Speaker 0>attention to the previous episodes.

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:15.690
<v Speaker 1>Normally, do I

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:18.090
<v Speaker 1>slightly mutable, but yeah.

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:19.130
<v Speaker 1>But

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:27.290
<v Speaker 0>your binary

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:29.290
<v Speaker 0>does not have the executable bit.

00:18:30.145 --> 00:18:33.345
<v Speaker 0>That's

00:18:33.345 --> 00:18:34.305
<v Speaker 0>what it looks like to me.

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:46.129
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:48.930
<v Speaker 1>I can't read it there. You can't chamad

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:51.250
<v Speaker 0>the chamad. You can't you can't chamad with

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:52.289
<v Speaker 2>the chamad. Yeah.

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:53.570
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?

00:18:59.205 --> 00:19:01.764
<v Speaker 2>Hold on. I'm I'm I'm I'm frantically giggling.

00:19:01.764 --> 00:19:02.245
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. We we looked in our interviews

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:14.900
<v Speaker 1>as well for some of our breaks.

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:20.180
<v Speaker 0>We've

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:21.300
<v Speaker 0>seen this on

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.180
<v Speaker 0>clustered with team Red Hat and team Talos.

00:19:27.415 --> 00:19:28.054
<v Speaker 0>This

00:19:29.655 --> 00:19:31.174
<v Speaker 0>is a good break. Think this one.

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:43.370
<v Speaker 0>So you could,

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:46.330
<v Speaker 0>you know, you could use Perl

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:48.810
<v Speaker 0>to do this. There is another way, but

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:50.409
<v Speaker 0>Perl would be one option,

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:53.450
<v Speaker 0>assuming they haven't removed the executable bit from

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:53.850
<v Speaker 0>Perl.

00:19:57.414 --> 00:19:59.655
<v Speaker 1>That can also develop me. And you can

00:19:59.655 --> 00:20:01.975
<v Speaker 0>also Oh, yeah. That's a good one.

00:20:25.934 --> 00:20:27.855
<v Speaker 2>You can run the loader directly and pass

00:20:27.855 --> 00:20:29.934
<v Speaker 2>pass it the command you want to run.

00:20:30.414 --> 00:20:31.615
<v Speaker 1>I think we're on

00:20:32.975 --> 00:20:34.575
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. You could you can use l d

00:20:34.575 --> 00:20:37.695
<v Speaker 0>dot source to also execute

00:20:36.529 --> 00:20:38.450
<v Speaker 0>them on, which is what team Talos said

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:39.729
<v Speaker 0>on the previous episode.

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:42.129
<v Speaker 0>It's a great tech. I love that.

00:20:47.809 --> 00:20:50.529
<v Speaker 0>Alright. You've got a broken control player.

00:20:52.034 --> 00:20:52.994
<v Speaker 1>You

00:20:54.835 --> 00:20:56.995
<v Speaker 1>don't need have Too early for hints. Come

00:20:56.995 --> 00:20:57.394
<v Speaker 1>on.

00:20:59.715 --> 00:21:00.914
<v Speaker 2>Use the hints.

00:21:02.115 --> 00:21:02.674
<v Speaker 2>Oh.

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:09.309
<v Speaker 0>So what was the error message? I I

00:21:09.309 --> 00:21:10.990
<v Speaker 0>feel like you you cleared that screen really,

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:11.869
<v Speaker 0>really quickly.

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:14.669
<v Speaker 1>Sorry. Yeah. I have a habit of that.

00:21:15.549 --> 00:21:17.789
<v Speaker 0>I actually have a ZHL plugin that clears

00:21:17.789 --> 00:21:20.765
<v Speaker 0>the screen after every well, before every command,

00:21:20.925 --> 00:21:23.645
<v Speaker 0>but people get complaining at me when it's

00:21:23.645 --> 00:21:24.445
<v Speaker 0>live streaming.

00:21:25.005 --> 00:21:27.005
<v Speaker 1>So, yeah, we got no containers on on

00:21:27.005 --> 00:21:28.205
<v Speaker 1>control plane.

00:21:30.605 --> 00:21:32.365
<v Speaker 0>Pay attention to the error message.

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:35.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:41.450
<v Speaker 1>That sounds familiar, like, DNS

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:42.649
<v Speaker 1>or data

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:43.929
<v Speaker 1>things.

00:21:49.184 --> 00:21:50.945
<v Speaker 1>Trick into the request and succeeded.

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:08.690
<v Speaker 1>No.

00:22:23.345 --> 00:22:24.624
<v Speaker 0>Well, you

00:22:24.705 --> 00:22:27.184
<v Speaker 0>run a PS, you get for a cube,

00:22:27.184 --> 00:22:28.465
<v Speaker 0>and the only thing you have is a

00:22:28.465 --> 00:22:29.264
<v Speaker 0>cubelet.

00:22:30.865 --> 00:22:31.184
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.640
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That looks pretty broken.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:45.840
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:22:49.524 --> 00:22:50.565
<v Speaker 1>Container d.

00:22:51.044 --> 00:22:51.924
<v Speaker 1>Connect

00:22:51.924 --> 00:22:52.644
<v Speaker 1>from the fuse.

00:23:20.405 --> 00:23:21.605
<v Speaker 0>Focus there.

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.460
<v Speaker 1>Switching off and on again.

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:31.140
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what it was about. Just

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.260
<v Speaker 1>In fact, stop.

00:23:41.505 --> 00:23:43.184
<v Speaker 1>Think it's got something

00:23:43.505 --> 00:23:44.865
<v Speaker 1>more sinister going on.

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:58.370
<v Speaker 0>It's happy.

00:23:58.690 --> 00:23:59.570
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Happy. Alright. Yeah.

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:06.130
<v Speaker 0>Cool. Maybe not. I see stopping Pods, Sandbox,

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:07.090
<v Speaker 0>and teardowns there.

00:24:08.804 --> 00:24:11.364
<v Speaker 1>This is a case that they're running something

00:24:13.365 --> 00:24:14.804
<v Speaker 1>that won't likely

00:24:15.044 --> 00:24:15.844
<v Speaker 1>stop it.

00:24:19.445 --> 00:24:21.845
<v Speaker 0>So we still don't have any Kubernetes component,

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:23.900
<v Speaker 0>but container d looks like it might be

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:24.620
<v Speaker 0>happier.

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.060
<v Speaker 0>Do you still have error messages in the

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:29.100
<v Speaker 0>log?

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.100
<v Speaker 0>That was failing to speak to the container

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:35.500
<v Speaker 0>d. Right?

00:24:36.525 --> 00:24:38.765
<v Speaker 1>No. We're we're getting the control.

00:24:38.765 --> 00:24:39.805
<v Speaker 1>Crash be a control thing.

00:25:07.315 --> 00:25:08.514
<v Speaker 1>Just that keyword.

00:25:13.394 --> 00:25:14.995
<v Speaker 2>Are any of the any other of the

00:25:14.995 --> 00:25:17.875
<v Speaker 2>error messages

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:18.330
<v Speaker 2>ones that we should be looking at right

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:19.210
<v Speaker 2>now? Or are we

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:24.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:26.730
<v Speaker 1>just like an actual file system.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:48.779
<v Speaker 0>Do you see anything there?

00:26:00.425 --> 00:26:01.865
<v Speaker 1>Do we do a hint, guys?

00:26:02.665 --> 00:26:04.585
<v Speaker 1>I think that sounds like a good idea.

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:08.630
<v Speaker 1>I guess we need that.

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:11.510
<v Speaker 1>We will come from the.

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:17.750
<v Speaker 0>So there was that

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:19.110
<v Speaker 0>you're

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:21.625
<v Speaker 0>you're very fast, but it says no log

00:26:21.625 --> 00:26:23.625
<v Speaker 0>left to log. And I don't see a

00:26:23.625 --> 00:26:24.985
<v Speaker 0>capacity warning

00:26:24.985 --> 00:26:28.105
<v Speaker 0>on your I think it was your log.

00:26:28.505 --> 00:26:30.985
<v Speaker 1>I did see something around the file system.

00:26:30.985 --> 00:26:31.705
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah.

00:26:50.405 --> 00:26:51.284
<v Speaker 1>I don't

00:26:51.525 --> 00:26:55.525
<v Speaker 0>I think use maps. Are they alright? They're

00:26:55.525 --> 00:26:56.164
<v Speaker 2>fine.

00:26:57.684 --> 00:26:58.804
<v Speaker 1>The ones.

00:27:01.365 --> 00:27:02.325
<v Speaker 1>You send it to user.

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:05.910
<v Speaker 1>Else can Is that CD running?

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.310
<v Speaker 1>No.

00:27:17.455 --> 00:27:19.855
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes, isn't it? So it would probably be

00:27:19.855 --> 00:27:21.134
<v Speaker 1>a container as well.

00:27:21.615 --> 00:27:23.934
<v Speaker 0>It should be a static manifest. Yeah.

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:30.500
<v Speaker 1>Actually, Kubernetes is one of best.

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.500
<v Speaker 0>I'll check-in the iNotes.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.180
<v Speaker 1>Mhmm. I've seen that one before. Yeah. That's

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:37.460
<v Speaker 0>one of those ones that when the bungee

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:38.659
<v Speaker 0>bungee good.

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:40.500
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.140
<v Speaker 0>I had to recover from a % iNotes

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:43.700
<v Speaker 0>saturation.

00:27:44.475 --> 00:27:45.034
<v Speaker 0>True.

00:27:47.195 --> 00:27:48.634
<v Speaker 1>That's fine now, though.

00:27:49.275 --> 00:27:51.995
<v Speaker 0>It does. That's free. As a I mean,

00:27:51.995 --> 00:27:54.635
<v Speaker 0>right now, my biggest concern is there's no

00:27:54.635 --> 00:27:55.275
<v Speaker 0>NCT.

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:00.570
<v Speaker 0>You're not gonna get a working control plane

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:03.290
<v Speaker 0>without it. Maybe start looking for HTTP logs.

00:28:12.895 --> 00:28:14.655
<v Speaker 0>Actually, one minute ago.

00:28:17.615 --> 00:28:19.215
<v Speaker 1>Can you do a quite detailed logs? Yeah.

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:30.090
<v Speaker 0>Docker warnings? Mhmm.

00:28:30.809 --> 00:28:33.129
<v Speaker 1>Well, I think that is the log entry.

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:35.210
<v Speaker 1>Log level info. I

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:39.450
<v Speaker 0>mean, you can go to bar log containers

00:28:39.934 --> 00:28:42.015
<v Speaker 0>rather than using try control if you want.

00:28:42.015 --> 00:28:43.855
<v Speaker 0>It might allow you to search or

00:28:44.415 --> 00:28:45.535
<v Speaker 0>get a bit more visibility.

00:29:04.905 --> 00:29:05.705
<v Speaker 1>It's really gonna

00:29:08.665 --> 00:29:10.745
<v Speaker 0>Is there nothing in that entity fail?

00:29:16.425 --> 00:29:17.065
<v Speaker 1>No.

00:29:19.305 --> 00:29:19.865
<v Speaker 1>Nice.

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.000
<v Speaker 1>Can also say they cleared the history as

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:22.480
<v Speaker 1>well.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.480
<v Speaker 2>So

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.640
<v Speaker 2>I thought I thought asking to look in

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.919
<v Speaker 2>the history was cheating.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.680
<v Speaker 0>If people forget to clear their history, that's

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:35.120
<v Speaker 0>a shame on them. That's perfectly perfectly illegal.

00:29:36.554 --> 00:29:38.315
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So that SCT log.

00:29:43.115 --> 00:29:45.114
<v Speaker 0>Is that all the Senate? Yeah.

00:29:45.914 --> 00:29:49.430
<v Speaker 2>So, like, something's limiting something's limiting the ability

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:51.510
<v Speaker 2>to print logs to the file. Right? Which

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:54.230
<v Speaker 2>am I right in saying that's what's causing

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:55.269
<v Speaker 2>to error out?

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.030
<v Speaker 0>Well, it's something causing

00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:59.670
<v Speaker 0>or is there some sort of maximum? Because

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:01.350
<v Speaker 0>all the files are also four k, which

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:03.565
<v Speaker 0>seems a bit This is well, this is

00:30:03.565 --> 00:30:05.644
<v Speaker 2>the thing. It's like I can you set

00:30:05.644 --> 00:30:07.644
<v Speaker 2>a a pod log limit?

00:30:07.725 --> 00:30:09.244
<v Speaker 2>The only thing is if

00:30:09.884 --> 00:30:12.605
<v Speaker 2>with with the pods all over, it meets

00:30:12.605 --> 00:30:13.644
<v Speaker 2>the limit, I don't know.

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:22.450
<v Speaker 0>Ah, nice catch.

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:24.529
<v Speaker 2>Where was this?

00:30:24.929 --> 00:30:26.850
<v Speaker 0>Sorry. I was And they could see their

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:29.009
<v Speaker 0>new config. There's some sort of Okay.

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:32.505
<v Speaker 2>Got you. Yeah. Yeah. The four k is

00:30:32.505 --> 00:30:34.025
<v Speaker 1>kind of I mean, you could just remove

00:30:34.025 --> 00:30:35.784
<v Speaker 0>that plugin's link altogether.

00:30:36.105 --> 00:30:37.705
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Yeah. It's a good Or you could

00:30:37.705 --> 00:30:39.544
<v Speaker 0>remove that config. You actually don't need that

00:30:39.544 --> 00:30:40.745
<v Speaker 0>config with the container b.

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:44.340
<v Speaker 0>So nice catch.

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh, dang it.

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:53.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh, we got queues there. Something is coming

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:54.020
<v Speaker 1>up.

00:30:57.025 --> 00:30:58.785
<v Speaker 0>Wow. And it survived for more than eight

00:30:58.785 --> 00:31:00.145
<v Speaker 0>seconds. That's good.

00:31:04.465 --> 00:31:06.945
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't you expect just just coming through a

00:31:06.945 --> 00:31:09.825
<v Speaker 2>container d noobie here, if if the log

00:31:09.825 --> 00:31:11.530
<v Speaker 2>size is set to be really small, would

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:13.370
<v Speaker 2>you not expect the logs to just flush

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:14.809
<v Speaker 2>and then keep going

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:16.970
<v Speaker 2>in that limit in that limit

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:18.090
<v Speaker 2>scenario?

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:20.970
<v Speaker 2>Or am I naive for picking that?

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:23.130
<v Speaker 0>I I don't know. I've never seen that

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:25.770
<v Speaker 0>set in tweet before, so that's the first

00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:27.365
<v Speaker 0>time I've ever seen that. I wouldn't have

00:31:27.365 --> 00:31:29.765
<v Speaker 0>expected the containers to to stop, but I

00:31:29.765 --> 00:31:32.005
<v Speaker 0>guess container d doesn't want them I I

00:31:32.005 --> 00:31:33.605
<v Speaker 0>guess container d just says, hey. You're you're

00:31:33.605 --> 00:31:35.525
<v Speaker 0>too noisy. They shut the down. Yeah.

00:31:36.325 --> 00:31:37.765
<v Speaker 0>I have no idea. It's

00:31:37.765 --> 00:31:39.365
<v Speaker 0>something for someone to go find in the

00:31:39.365 --> 00:31:41.140
<v Speaker 0>docs and share in the comments. Yeah. I

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:42.660
<v Speaker 2>know. Yeah. I just thought it'd be some

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:44.340
<v Speaker 2>something interesting to consider for those that are

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:44.900
<v Speaker 2>watching. So

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:48.900
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So that error getting node error messages

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.300
<v Speaker 0>typically means that Etsy is not quite or

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:53.060
<v Speaker 0>it's not ready yet. Oh, there we go.

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:54.020
<v Speaker 0>I think It wasn't

00:31:55.255 --> 00:31:56.534
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I was

00:31:56.934 --> 00:32:00.054
<v Speaker 1>more worried that actually we haven't started up

00:32:00.855 --> 00:32:01.255
<v Speaker 1>in a

00:32:03.015 --> 00:32:04.375
<v Speaker 0>So this is like a health fair.

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Woo hoo. And you have some pods and

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:11.740
<v Speaker 0>an APIs there. Very nice.

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:14.700
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That break was interesting. I'm gonna have

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:16.140
<v Speaker 0>to look that one up in the doc.

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:17.260
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:19.660
<v Speaker 0>So

00:32:21.245 --> 00:32:23.405
<v Speaker 1>we just updated Docker image. Right?

00:32:25.565 --> 00:32:26.205
<v Speaker 1>In theory.

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:46.130
<v Speaker 0>That's it? No. Oh, no. You don't have

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:47.330
<v Speaker 0>a it's not ruled the pod.

00:32:49.995 --> 00:32:51.035
<v Speaker 1>So I

00:32:51.515 --> 00:32:53.435
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna look on the work window. Just

00:32:53.435 --> 00:32:55.675
<v Speaker 1>just kinda put around on it.

00:32:57.755 --> 00:32:59.275
<v Speaker 2>How are we doing on the timer?

00:33:01.435 --> 00:33:03.275
<v Speaker 0>You've you've got plenty of time.

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:05.169
<v Speaker 3>Okay. You

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:07.969
<v Speaker 0>you've had a bit just under twenty minutes.

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:09.570
<v Speaker 1>Good stuff.

00:33:10.929 --> 00:33:12.690
<v Speaker 1>Hold on. My light keeps going off. Bear

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:13.409
<v Speaker 2>with me.

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:18.130
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. My screen saver keeps coming on because

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:19.090
<v Speaker 0>I'm not doing anything.

00:33:20.025 --> 00:33:21.545
<v Speaker 0>Let me disable that.

00:33:26.105 --> 00:33:28.585
<v Speaker 0>Right. So you modified the deployment manifest. You

00:33:28.585 --> 00:33:30.665
<v Speaker 0>changed the image tag from v one to

00:33:30.665 --> 00:33:32.425
<v Speaker 0>v two, but we don't seem to have

00:33:32.425 --> 00:33:34.265
<v Speaker 0>a new replica set being rolled

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:37.740
<v Speaker 0>no new pod rolling out. Something is not

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:38.700
<v Speaker 0>quite right.

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I think some

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:46.860
<v Speaker 1>control plan being

00:33:47.615 --> 00:33:50.575
<v Speaker 1>not ready as well. It's got me somewhat

00:33:50.575 --> 00:33:51.535
<v Speaker 1>suspicious.

00:33:52.975 --> 00:33:54.735
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. You don't know. Haven't Can we just

00:33:59.935 --> 00:34:01.535
<v Speaker 1>restart the cubelets on the work?

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:05.370
<v Speaker 1>It's not the worker nodes. It's the it's

00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:06.649
<v Speaker 1>the control plane

00:34:06.809 --> 00:34:08.570
<v Speaker 1>that we've just started up.

00:34:11.609 --> 00:34:12.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:34:19.304 --> 00:34:20.825
<v Speaker 1>What in here?

00:34:21.465 --> 00:34:22.185
<v Speaker 1>Think

00:34:22.505 --> 00:34:23.705
<v Speaker 1>it finds.

00:34:24.025 --> 00:34:24.665
<v Speaker 1>Oh,

00:34:26.105 --> 00:34:28.025
<v Speaker 1>if you do cube get events,

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.239
<v Speaker 1>there's a warning for invalid disk.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.239
<v Speaker 3>That might be quite old, actually.

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.319
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That's probably the thing we've already made

00:34:37.319 --> 00:34:37.800
<v Speaker 1>so much.

00:34:40.655 --> 00:34:42.895
<v Speaker 0>Was unable to pull a new image because

00:34:42.895 --> 00:34:45.375
<v Speaker 0>of some capacity warning. It was, like, right,

00:34:45.375 --> 00:34:46.735
<v Speaker 0>or is it something else?

00:34:48.815 --> 00:34:50.655
<v Speaker 0>Because it's not even creating a new replica

00:34:50.655 --> 00:34:52.335
<v Speaker 0>set. So I think the image capacity is

00:34:52.335 --> 00:34:53.454
<v Speaker 0>a problem,

00:34:53.454 --> 00:34:54.655
<v Speaker 0>but I don't think it's the one that's

00:34:54.655 --> 00:34:56.335
<v Speaker 0>stopping the replica set being created.

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:00.560
<v Speaker 0>At least not yet.

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.480
<v Speaker 0>But how would you stop a deployment from

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:05.760
<v Speaker 0>creating a new replica set?

00:35:08.765 --> 00:35:10.045
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. That might be given the

00:35:10.045 --> 00:35:12.205
<v Speaker 1>game away, but the the other team.

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.520
<v Speaker 1>So

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:25.880
<v Speaker 1>the change, what?

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:29.800
<v Speaker 0>Well, can you run a get event on

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.000
<v Speaker 0>the deployment

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:33.240
<v Speaker 0>or describe the deployment to see the event?

00:35:40.865 --> 00:35:43.345
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So we can see is the image

00:35:43.345 --> 00:35:45.825
<v Speaker 0>definitely v two? No. It's v one. Right?

00:35:45.825 --> 00:35:47.185
<v Speaker 0>So your change hasn't

00:35:47.345 --> 00:35:47.985
<v Speaker 0>persisted.

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:54.240
<v Speaker 1>Allocation revision to you, though. Yeah. But go

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:57.600
<v Speaker 0>down there. Yeah. Your image is speed one.

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.400
<v Speaker 1>The image tag?

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:01.599
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's view one.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.360
<v Speaker 1>And then I'll remember that.

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.600
<v Speaker 1>Nope. Not muted. Webhook.

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:29.320
<v Speaker 0>That was my first thought as well, but

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:29.960
<v Speaker 0>I kinda know.

00:36:31.345 --> 00:36:33.105
<v Speaker 1>Just to double check.

00:36:33.585 --> 00:36:34.225
<v Speaker 1>No.

00:36:34.945 --> 00:36:35.505
<v Speaker 1>Maybe

00:36:37.745 --> 00:36:39.505
<v Speaker 0>this is the image capacity.

00:36:39.665 --> 00:36:41.505
<v Speaker 0>Maybe it wasn't actually able to write the

00:36:41.505 --> 00:36:43.985
<v Speaker 0>change to x c d. To x c

00:36:43.985 --> 00:36:44.705
<v Speaker 1>d. Yeah.

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:51.400
<v Speaker 1>Disk space looks good.

00:36:52.359 --> 00:36:53.000
<v Speaker 1>What

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.280
<v Speaker 1>was it? The error message in drive disk

00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:58.839
<v Speaker 1>capacity.

00:37:01.745 --> 00:37:03.665
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look.

00:37:04.145 --> 00:37:05.825
<v Speaker 0>You might wanna take a look at the

00:37:05.825 --> 00:37:07.105
<v Speaker 0>entity manifest,

00:37:07.105 --> 00:37:09.425
<v Speaker 0>see if anything's been changed.

00:37:33.795 --> 00:37:36.515
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look at the schedule config.

00:37:40.595 --> 00:37:42.275
<v Speaker 0>But why are you thinking scheduler?

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:52.070
<v Speaker 1>That's not the scheduler, though, is it? Deployment

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:53.110
<v Speaker 1>is from control manager.

00:38:12.525 --> 00:38:15.039
<v Speaker 0>You were about about quick to jump out

00:38:15.039 --> 00:38:15.840
<v Speaker 0>of that

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:18.160
<v Speaker 0>control or manage manifest, I think.

00:38:28.055 --> 00:38:29.815
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't look healthy, does it?

00:38:33.335 --> 00:38:33.975
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:38:38.055 --> 00:38:39.335
<v Speaker 1>Future resource log.

00:38:54.485 --> 00:38:55.365
<v Speaker 0>I think

00:38:56.885 --> 00:38:58.245
<v Speaker 0>no. I think I don't know if Tom's

00:38:58.245 --> 00:39:00.165
<v Speaker 0>talking to us or not. He's muted.

00:39:00.565 --> 00:39:03.525
<v Speaker 0>No. I was yeah. Someone came in quickly.

00:39:04.565 --> 00:39:05.445
<v Speaker 0>There

00:39:05.445 --> 00:39:07.045
<v Speaker 0>there are two things right there that that

00:39:07.045 --> 00:39:08.565
<v Speaker 0>have me because they're one,

00:39:08.805 --> 00:39:11.420
<v Speaker 0>I think entities are unable to to write

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:12.700
<v Speaker 0>the rates. The fact that we don't see

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:15.180
<v Speaker 0>v two tells me that that

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.500
<v Speaker 0>edit we does as a deployment of this

00:39:18.299 --> 00:39:20.299
<v Speaker 0>just didn't work. And I think entities don't

00:39:20.299 --> 00:39:21.980
<v Speaker 0>know where to block that if it's not

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:22.860
<v Speaker 0>for invitation.

00:39:23.339 --> 00:39:26.555
<v Speaker 0>Also, you dead x exit the API server

00:39:26.714 --> 00:39:29.435
<v Speaker 0>static manifest very, very quickly, and there was

00:39:30.315 --> 00:39:31.435
<v Speaker 0>I I think

00:39:31.595 --> 00:39:31.915
<v Speaker 0>you

00:39:32.395 --> 00:39:33.755
<v Speaker 0>think there was a change in there that

00:39:33.755 --> 00:39:34.234
<v Speaker 0>you missed.

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:38.600
<v Speaker 1>Good.

00:39:52.485 --> 00:39:53.765
<v Speaker 1>Oh, was it the

00:39:55.365 --> 00:39:56.565
<v Speaker 1>controller manager?

00:39:58.165 --> 00:39:58.565
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:40:15.619 --> 00:40:16.420
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

00:40:18.455 --> 00:40:20.535
<v Speaker 0>It disabled the deployment controller.

00:40:21.735 --> 00:40:22.375
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:40:24.935 --> 00:40:26.935
<v Speaker 0>Alright. But I'm still worried about that rate,

00:40:26.935 --> 00:40:27.895
<v Speaker 0>the NCT.

00:40:27.975 --> 00:40:29.415
<v Speaker 0>I mean, you could try adding the I

00:40:29.415 --> 00:40:31.655
<v Speaker 0>don't think the stable deployment controller would block

00:40:31.655 --> 00:40:32.135
<v Speaker 0>that rate.

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.800
<v Speaker 1>I never I never saw anything in the

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:40.040
<v Speaker 1>entity logs to say, like,

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.080
<v Speaker 1>like, this this is the entity Okay. Entity

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:43.800
<v Speaker 1>logs.

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:46.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, I couldn't see anything related to that.

00:40:50.125 --> 00:40:52.924
<v Speaker 1>Still not seeing a replication set rep new

00:40:52.924 --> 00:40:54.045
<v Speaker 1>replica set.

00:40:58.045 --> 00:40:59.645
<v Speaker 0>I guess you could try, yeah, try and

00:40:59.645 --> 00:41:02.140
<v Speaker 0>edit it again. See if the generation does

00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:03.340
<v Speaker 0>that changes.

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:04.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:07.580
<v Speaker 1>No. No.

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:12.540
<v Speaker 1>Damn.

00:41:16.075 --> 00:41:18.075
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So what would stop

00:41:18.555 --> 00:41:20.235
<v Speaker 0>cube control edit from working?

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:31.099
<v Speaker 0>I'm stumped too. I'll give you that. Can

00:41:32.539 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 1>we get it over YAML and use a

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:35.019
<v Speaker 1>cube apply rather than

00:41:35.819 --> 00:41:36.859
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's gonna be any

00:41:36.859 --> 00:41:39.819
<v Speaker 0>difference. Yeah. Cube control edit does hide some

00:41:40.425 --> 00:41:42.665
<v Speaker 0>error messages, and doing a Q control apply

00:41:42.665 --> 00:41:44.505
<v Speaker 0>would definitely bubble those up.

00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:05.330
<v Speaker 0>And the remainder in the chat that there

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:06.050
<v Speaker 0>are hints.

00:42:13.895 --> 00:42:16.615
<v Speaker 2>I think we're slowly creeping towards hint time,

00:42:18.535 --> 00:42:20.055
<v Speaker 1>if you want if you want my opinion.

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:24.690
<v Speaker 0>Let's take a look.

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:30.850
<v Speaker 2>It

00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:34.370
<v Speaker 2>is it possible that someone's messed with sorry.

00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:35.825
<v Speaker 2>I was looking to chat. Is it possible

00:42:35.825 --> 00:42:37.984
<v Speaker 2>that someone's messed with, like, the size of

00:42:38.065 --> 00:42:41.585
<v Speaker 2>of whatever disk that Etsy is writing to?

00:42:41.904 --> 00:42:42.705
<v Speaker 2>Would that

00:42:43.105 --> 00:42:44.785
<v Speaker 2>but I guess it would spare us for

00:42:44.785 --> 00:42:45.505
<v Speaker 2>that if

00:42:46.545 --> 00:42:47.744
<v Speaker 2>it run out of space. Right?

00:42:49.029 --> 00:42:51.109
<v Speaker 0>It would. Yes. But I think this hint

00:42:51.109 --> 00:42:51.990
<v Speaker 0>reveals

00:42:52.309 --> 00:42:53.270
<v Speaker 0>quite a lot.

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:56.710
<v Speaker 2>We were on the hint.

00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:01.430
<v Speaker 0>So is your cube control actually talking

00:43:01.965 --> 00:43:03.165
<v Speaker 0>to the API server?

00:43:32.704 --> 00:43:35.184
<v Speaker 0>So, Watson, you're slash e t c slash

00:43:35.184 --> 00:43:35.984
<v Speaker 0>kubernetes

00:43:35.984 --> 00:43:37.505
<v Speaker 0>slash admin dot com.

00:43:38.305 --> 00:43:40.785
<v Speaker 0>That is the config correct?

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:45.740
<v Speaker 1>I can see the patch through.

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh, hang on.

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:09.780
<v Speaker 0>Oh, 14728.

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.060
<v Speaker 0>Is that what we see in the

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:20.660
<v Speaker 1>I can see 14728141217Port6443.

00:44:22.505 --> 00:44:23.945
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Yeah. It looks okay.

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:42.760
<v Speaker 0>So now you're trying to look for

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.320
<v Speaker 0>IP table rows to reroute traffic?

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:46.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:44:54.875 --> 00:44:56.315
<v Speaker 1>Not seeing anything. No.

00:44:56.635 --> 00:44:57.755
<v Speaker 1>Nothing. No.

00:45:01.035 --> 00:45:03.194
<v Speaker 0>I mean, are you familiar with malady?

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:05.600
<v Speaker 1>Nope.

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:07.600
<v Speaker 2>I am not.

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.880
<v Speaker 0>It is an HTTP

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:11.760
<v Speaker 0>proxy.

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:12.960
<v Speaker 0>So

00:45:24.714 --> 00:45:27.355
<v Speaker 1>Why is that running? It's gotta be load

00:45:27.595 --> 00:45:28.154
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.

00:45:41.049 --> 00:45:42.730
<v Speaker 0>That looks okay to me.

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:47.130
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Good call.

00:45:48.275 --> 00:45:49.715
<v Speaker 0>API server.

00:45:50.915 --> 00:45:51.555
<v Speaker 0>Is

00:45:53.635 --> 00:45:55.795
<v Speaker 1>Is it the right API server?

00:45:55.795 --> 00:45:58.355
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's what I was going

00:45:58.355 --> 00:45:58.595
<v Speaker 0>through.

00:46:02.090 --> 00:46:03.770
<v Speaker 0>It looks it looks good.

00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:06.810
<v Speaker 1>Looks official. Are there any more containers listed

00:46:06.810 --> 00:46:07.850
<v Speaker 0>on that file?

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:16.090
<v Speaker 1>No. No.

00:46:18.145 --> 00:46:19.105
<v Speaker 0>Interesting.

00:46:21.184 --> 00:46:23.025
<v Speaker 0>Joe in the chat suggesting there are more

00:46:23.025 --> 00:46:23.825
<v Speaker 0>deaths. I

00:46:29.825 --> 00:46:31.505
<v Speaker 0>was so sure there was gonna be something

00:46:31.505 --> 00:46:33.080
<v Speaker 0>binding on 6443

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:34.760
<v Speaker 0>that wasn't the API server. Now I now

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:36.040
<v Speaker 0>I feel like I don't know anything.

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:41.320
<v Speaker 1>Have a look have a look at the

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:42.840
<v Speaker 1>queue API server

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:43.560
<v Speaker 1>and

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:45.320
<v Speaker 1>pause for the load.

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:47.744
<v Speaker 1>It's it's only in there.

00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:02.620
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. One container.

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:03.660
<v Speaker 0>Otherwise

00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:28.690
<v Speaker 0>I don't think that's related.

00:47:30.369 --> 00:47:31.970
<v Speaker 1>No. But I can't get logs.

00:47:33.809 --> 00:47:34.210
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

00:47:48.835 --> 00:47:50.115
<v Speaker 0>I feel like

00:47:51.315 --> 00:47:53.315
<v Speaker 0>the patch requests are being dropped.

00:47:55.559 --> 00:47:56.440
<v Speaker 0>Can you run a

00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:00.279
<v Speaker 0>why don't you do a cube control, get

00:48:00.279 --> 00:48:01.319
<v Speaker 0>deployment,

00:48:01.319 --> 00:48:03.400
<v Speaker 0>cluster, and write the file?

00:48:04.839 --> 00:48:06.759
<v Speaker 0>Make the change and then do a cube

00:48:06.759 --> 00:48:09.319
<v Speaker 0>control apply dash f, but with v nine,

00:48:09.435 --> 00:48:10.315
<v Speaker 0>and then

00:48:10.555 --> 00:48:11.755
<v Speaker 0>see if we can see some of the

00:48:11.755 --> 00:48:13.275
<v Speaker 0>noise. And if not, we'll need to just

00:48:13.275 --> 00:48:14.875
<v Speaker 0>jump into some heads, I think.

00:48:15.355 --> 00:48:17.675
<v Speaker 0>We've got about ten minutes left.

00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Oops. Yep.

00:48:40.205 --> 00:48:43.085
<v Speaker 0>Because when you do the cube control apply,

00:48:43.085 --> 00:48:45.085
<v Speaker 0>it won't use the I thought it's like

00:48:45.085 --> 00:48:46.445
<v Speaker 0>it uses the patch bar, but I think

00:48:46.445 --> 00:48:46.925
<v Speaker 0>it gives you

00:48:49.245 --> 00:48:50.285
<v Speaker 0>let's let's see.

00:48:52.650 --> 00:48:53.850
<v Speaker 1>That looks better.

00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:57.930
<v Speaker 1>We used the patch, but it's a little

00:48:57.930 --> 00:48:58.410
<v Speaker 1>bit different.

00:49:08.025 --> 00:49:09.945
<v Speaker 1>Did it change it? Nope.

00:49:13.945 --> 00:49:16.905
<v Speaker 0>Was there anything in that that the output?

00:49:16.905 --> 00:49:18.505
<v Speaker 0>Like, scroll back up. Like, did we miss

00:49:18.505 --> 00:49:18.825
<v Speaker 0>something?

00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:24.390
<v Speaker 0>It says the 200.

00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:25.030
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:49:25.590 --> 00:49:26.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:33.734
<v Speaker 0>Gen oh, wait. That response body still has

00:49:33.734 --> 00:49:34.615
<v Speaker 0>the old

00:49:34.855 --> 00:49:35.974
<v Speaker 0>generation.

00:49:36.615 --> 00:49:38.695
<v Speaker 0>Where's the image source? Yeah. Alright.

00:49:42.134 --> 00:49:43.415
<v Speaker 0>Oh, it's truncated.

00:49:44.295 --> 00:49:44.694
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:52.920
<v Speaker 0>Andrew in the chat is suggesting you run

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:54.760
<v Speaker 0>a get all all namespaces

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:56.440
<v Speaker 0>to see if there's anything wrong in the

00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:57.160
<v Speaker 0>cluster.

00:49:58.680 --> 00:49:59.400
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. You got that.

00:50:09.385 --> 00:50:11.625
<v Speaker 0>Oh, apparently, you were close with the IP

00:50:11.625 --> 00:50:12.105
<v Speaker 0>table.

00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.750
<v Speaker 1>What is it?

00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:55.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna take a hint.

00:51:02.445 --> 00:51:04.765
<v Speaker 0>I think are they suggesting to look at

00:51:04.765 --> 00:51:05.725
<v Speaker 0>NF table?

00:51:08.845 --> 00:51:10.205
<v Speaker 1>No. This is a new one.

00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:14.290
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I think they're

00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:16.850
<v Speaker 0>so they're not using IP tables.

00:51:27.575 --> 00:51:28.295
<v Speaker 0>Ouch.

00:51:31.494 --> 00:51:32.295
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:51:37.494 --> 00:51:39.335
<v Speaker 0>I would just let's just see the next

00:51:39.335 --> 00:51:41.654
<v Speaker 0>tab. I'm really kidding. Let's just go for

00:51:41.654 --> 00:51:42.839
<v Speaker 0>it. Can

00:51:44.279 --> 00:51:46.440
<v Speaker 1>can can you can you literally

00:51:48.839 --> 00:51:51.160
<v Speaker 2>can you type literally NFT?

00:51:56.455 --> 00:51:58.535
<v Speaker 1>There is an NFT command available, but I'm

00:51:58.535 --> 00:51:59.255
<v Speaker 1>not sure what it does.

00:52:12.130 --> 00:52:14.290
<v Speaker 0>I'm not familiar with the NFT command. I

00:52:14.290 --> 00:52:16.690
<v Speaker 0>don't I I have no idea. I I'm

00:52:16.690 --> 00:52:18.450
<v Speaker 2>angry at them for using this just for

00:52:18.450 --> 00:52:19.730
<v Speaker 2>the for the sake of having to say

00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:21.010
<v Speaker 2>NFT repeatedly.

00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:23.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I was thinking that.

00:52:27.665 --> 00:52:29.585
<v Speaker 0>What can you do? NFT less?

00:52:31.025 --> 00:52:32.465
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm trying to find at the

00:52:32.465 --> 00:52:33.505
<v Speaker 0>at the moment.

00:52:34.705 --> 00:52:35.665
<v Speaker 1>It's magic.

00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:52.380
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:52:53.915 --> 00:52:54.795
<v Speaker 0>That looks

00:52:57.115 --> 00:52:57.755
<v Speaker 0>fine.

00:52:59.355 --> 00:52:59.995
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:53:01.595 --> 00:53:02.715
<v Speaker 1>So I was a bit like

00:53:05.595 --> 00:53:06.875
<v Speaker 1>this rule set.

00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:11.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh,

00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:12.780
<v Speaker 1>hey. Hey.

00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:16.460
<v Speaker 0>List rule set.

00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:19.580
<v Speaker 3>Alright. How do change them.

00:53:20.619 --> 00:53:21.660
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.

00:53:24.375 --> 00:53:26.615
<v Speaker 1>I know. I click Google's suggestion. You can

00:53:26.615 --> 00:53:28.695
<v Speaker 0>run NFT delete rule.

00:53:31.895 --> 00:53:32.695
<v Speaker 2>Flush?

00:53:32.935 --> 00:53:35.815
<v Speaker 2>So there's there's NFT flush. Yeah. Try a

00:53:35.815 --> 00:53:36.135
<v Speaker 0>flush.

00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:38.530
<v Speaker 2>But

00:53:38.530 --> 00:53:39.090
<v Speaker 2>then

00:53:40.690 --> 00:53:41.890
<v Speaker 2>Oh. Flush.

00:53:42.210 --> 00:53:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Hang on. How

00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:46.609
<v Speaker 0>about DPKG

00:53:46.609 --> 00:53:48.370
<v Speaker 0>dash p and tables?

00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:50.849
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if that would just remove

00:53:50.849 --> 00:53:51.650
<v Speaker 0>everything or not.

00:53:57.765 --> 00:53:59.525
<v Speaker 1>What was that again? Sorry, David.

00:54:01.125 --> 00:54:02.964
<v Speaker 0>Well, you can run n f t delete

00:54:02.964 --> 00:54:04.005
<v Speaker 0>real iNet

00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:07.510
<v Speaker 0>table IP net.

00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:12.710
<v Speaker 2>You can do n s t delete rule

00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:15.990
<v Speaker 0>or maybe rule rule set. I don't know.

00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:16.710
<v Speaker 0>And then

00:54:18.565 --> 00:54:20.005
<v Speaker 0>table IP net.

00:54:21.205 --> 00:54:21.845
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:54:22.565 --> 00:54:23.685
<v Speaker 1>That sounds right.

00:54:24.245 --> 00:54:26.805
<v Speaker 0>Or try rule instead of rule set. Rule.

00:54:27.125 --> 00:54:27.925
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:54:28.725 --> 00:54:29.445
<v Speaker 0>Great.

00:54:29.765 --> 00:54:31.525
<v Speaker 0>Team crash beer. Can you tell us how

00:54:31.525 --> 00:54:33.445
<v Speaker 0>to delete this

00:54:32.890 --> 00:54:33.930
<v Speaker 2>Try

00:54:33.930 --> 00:54:36.970
<v Speaker 2>try NFT flush rule set. Just Flush. Just

00:54:36.970 --> 00:54:37.530
<v Speaker 2>that.

00:54:41.050 --> 00:54:42.010
<v Speaker 0>Hey.

00:54:42.730 --> 00:54:45.690
<v Speaker 2>That's that's something. At least I did something.

00:54:46.330 --> 00:54:47.210
<v Speaker 1>I've got nothing.

00:54:47.785 --> 00:54:48.505
<v Speaker 1>So

00:54:48.745 --> 00:54:49.305
<v Speaker 1>yeah.

00:54:53.865 --> 00:54:55.945
<v Speaker 0>Configured is good, maybe.

00:55:00.025 --> 00:55:00.425
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:03.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I hate I hate NFTs.

00:55:03.010 --> 00:55:05.410
<v Speaker 2>It's still it's a shock, really, isn't it?

00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:08.690
<v Speaker 0>Oh, they messed with IP tables as well.

00:55:10.609 --> 00:55:11.089
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.

00:55:12.945 --> 00:55:14.785
<v Speaker 1>I think it's saying it's

00:55:14.945 --> 00:55:15.665
<v Speaker 1>blocked.

00:55:20.065 --> 00:55:21.825
<v Speaker 0>Oh, they're saying run

00:55:22.225 --> 00:55:24.305
<v Speaker 0>IPtables.tnet.

00:55:24.945 --> 00:55:27.105
<v Speaker 0>So you have to list the NAT rules.

00:55:31.289 --> 00:55:32.569
<v Speaker 0>You still need list.

00:55:46.395 --> 00:55:47.195
<v Speaker 0>Just

00:55:47.275 --> 00:55:48.474
<v Speaker 0>flush the net,

00:55:48.875 --> 00:55:49.435
<v Speaker 0>Rose?

00:55:53.115 --> 00:55:53.674
<v Speaker 1>There it is.

00:55:55.350 --> 00:55:56.790
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. Redirect

00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:58.390
<v Speaker 0>four eight five three.

00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:35.320
<v Speaker 0>You could just do an IP tables dash

00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:37.560
<v Speaker 0>t net dash capital f and just flush

00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:37.960
<v Speaker 0>them all.

00:56:43.795 --> 00:56:46.035
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I was looking for the number output,

00:56:46.194 --> 00:56:47.395
<v Speaker 1>so I can never remember the

00:56:53.859 --> 00:56:55.460
<v Speaker 1>There's another one there, though.

00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:58.900
<v Speaker 0>You know, we say add dash b two

00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:00.740
<v Speaker 0>and dash a two to the graph, and

00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:01.700
<v Speaker 0>you'll get the extra link.

00:57:08.605 --> 00:57:09.244
<v Speaker 0>No number?

00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:18.860
<v Speaker 1>Pre reroutes.

00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:28.380
<v Speaker 1>How do we do the numbers?

00:57:34.234 --> 00:57:35.995
<v Speaker 1>You're right, though. Is this

00:57:36.395 --> 00:57:38.475
<v Speaker 1>can we just do IP tables flush?

00:57:39.195 --> 00:57:40.795
<v Speaker 0>You'll need to do a dash two there.

00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:45.340
<v Speaker 0>I should get rid of it.

00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:49.980
<v Speaker 1>Because then yeah. Anything like Selum and things

00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:51.740
<v Speaker 1>should put It they'll rewrite them. Yeah.

00:58:03.645 --> 00:58:04.525
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We

00:58:05.165 --> 00:58:06.685
<v Speaker 0>are out of time, but if you want

00:58:06.685 --> 00:58:08.765
<v Speaker 0>a couple of minutes, you I'll I'll give

00:58:08.765 --> 00:58:09.565
<v Speaker 0>it to you.

00:58:09.965 --> 00:58:12.950
<v Speaker 0>But I think dial diving into the RBAC

00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:16.070
<v Speaker 0>may require slightly more time. That's gonna take

00:58:16.070 --> 00:58:16.630
<v Speaker 1>80.

00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:19.750
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's let's look

00:58:20.550 --> 00:58:21.990
<v Speaker 0>at the rest of the hunts, see what

00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.390
<v Speaker 0>we've got.

00:58:36.785 --> 00:58:37.985
<v Speaker 0>Maybe it's okay.

00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:46.170
<v Speaker 0>There's maybe quite a lot still to debug

00:58:46.170 --> 00:58:47.530
<v Speaker 0>here. So I think we'll just leave that

00:58:47.530 --> 00:58:48.090
<v Speaker 0>there.

00:58:52.330 --> 00:58:52.810
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:58:55.964 --> 00:58:57.965
<v Speaker 1>I think we were so close.

00:58:58.845 --> 00:59:01.325
<v Speaker 0>Well Yeah. That's gonna take a long time.

00:59:03.405 --> 00:59:04.765
<v Speaker 0>Well, let's see.

00:59:05.484 --> 00:59:07.325
<v Speaker 0>You wanna tell us what what we missed?

00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:10.600
<v Speaker 0>Really?

00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:13.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. Hi. You did great. You had it

00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:15.080
<v Speaker 4>in the IP tables. It was like five

00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:16.840
<v Speaker 4>minutes into the session and you had IP

00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:19.000
<v Speaker 4>tables running and then you're always missing the

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:19.960
<v Speaker 4>the correct chain.

00:59:21.805 --> 00:59:23.645
<v Speaker 4>We had a a man in the middle

00:59:23.645 --> 00:59:26.205
<v Speaker 4>proxy running who was applying a dry run

00:59:26.205 --> 00:59:28.285
<v Speaker 4>to every cube command you were running.

00:59:28.845 --> 00:59:30.445
<v Speaker 2>Where is the proxy running?

00:59:30.845 --> 00:59:33.005
<v Speaker 0>I thought that at the start on the

00:59:33.005 --> 00:59:35.400
<v Speaker 0>the cube control output actually showed the dry

00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:37.640
<v Speaker 0>run equals all. But Yeah.

00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:39.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. This is the thing. This is why

00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:41.560
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't keep quiet in these scenarios. I

00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:43.240
<v Speaker 2>was gonna say, why is there a dry

00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:46.040
<v Speaker 2>run? But then I just didn't say anything.

00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:47.400
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.

00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:48.680
<v Speaker 2>Bad teamwork.

00:59:49.925 --> 00:59:52.165
<v Speaker 2>No. It's supposed to be You had it

00:59:52.165 --> 00:59:52.965
<v Speaker 4>almost.

00:59:52.965 --> 00:59:55.205
<v Speaker 4>And then we had the Rawk stuff. It

00:59:55.205 --> 00:59:56.484
<v Speaker 4>was just you had to work as a

00:59:56.484 --> 00:59:58.645
<v Speaker 4>different user. You had to use ads

00:59:58.645 --> 00:59:59.205
<v Speaker 4>and

00:59:59.685 --> 01:00:01.205
<v Speaker 4>work as a different group and user.

01:00:01.869 --> 01:00:02.910
<v Speaker 4>And the deployment

01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:05.230
<v Speaker 4>the missing deployment controller

01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:06.510
<v Speaker 4>you fixed already,

01:00:06.910 --> 01:00:08.430
<v Speaker 4>and I think that was it.

01:00:08.830 --> 01:00:10.990
<v Speaker 4>Alright. I got I got I thought that

01:00:10.990 --> 01:00:12.030
<v Speaker 1>deployed the

01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:14.589
<v Speaker 1>what is it? He was taking care of

01:00:14.589 --> 01:00:17.070
<v Speaker 1>you with the, yeah, the controller manager.

01:00:18.825 --> 01:00:20.505
<v Speaker 4>The dry run was a bit

01:00:21.945 --> 01:00:22.585
<v Speaker 4>messy. Yeah.

01:00:23.785 --> 01:00:26.665
<v Speaker 0>That that proxy was mean. Very, very mean.

01:00:26.665 --> 01:00:29.305
<v Speaker 0>Good fun. Alright. You if you had deleted

01:00:29.305 --> 01:00:30.025
<v Speaker 4>the pod,

01:00:30.345 --> 01:00:32.185
<v Speaker 4>the proxy had a problem. So it was

01:00:32.185 --> 01:00:33.385
<v Speaker 4>watching always

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:36.280
<v Speaker 4>that the pod was removed, but then it

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:38.440
<v Speaker 4>was stuck, but we figured you won't delete

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:39.400
<v Speaker 4>any pods.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:43.720
<v Speaker 3>But you did Okay.

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:48.280
<v Speaker 0>Thank you team JetStack. We're gonna move over

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.684
<v Speaker 0>to the other cluster now. So feel free

01:00:50.684 --> 01:00:52.765
<v Speaker 0>to join us in the YouTube chat

01:00:52.845 --> 01:00:54.445
<v Speaker 0>and we will see you

01:00:55.164 --> 01:00:57.724
<v Speaker 0>later, but thank you. All right,

01:00:58.765 --> 01:01:00.125
<v Speaker 0>let's get this faded up.

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:05.480
<v Speaker 0>Alright. User mean,

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:08.120
<v Speaker 0>but a very good very good breaks there.

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:10.360
<v Speaker 0>So you're you're very using malady as a

01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:11.320
<v Speaker 0>proxy. Right?

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:14.715
<v Speaker 4>No. We were referring to this to this

01:01:14.715 --> 01:01:16.955
<v Speaker 4>communication model where you always have the eve

01:01:16.955 --> 01:01:19.115
<v Speaker 4>and Bob talking to another, and Mallory is

01:01:19.115 --> 01:01:21.675
<v Speaker 4>always the one eavesdropping or man in the

01:01:21.675 --> 01:01:22.635
<v Speaker 4>middle style.

01:01:22.795 --> 01:01:24.395
<v Speaker 4>But it was the same. You you you

01:01:24.395 --> 01:01:26.795
<v Speaker 4>have gave a great hint because Mallory was

01:01:26.795 --> 01:01:27.995
<v Speaker 4>intercepting the traffic.

01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:29.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.

01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:33.950
<v Speaker 0>Great. Well, let's see what JetStack have prepared

01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:35.230
<v Speaker 0>for you.

01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:38.510
<v Speaker 0>So because I have obviously got a broken

01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:40.910
<v Speaker 0>teleport configuration, I am kindly gonna ask one

01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:42.350
<v Speaker 0>of you to please share your screen.

01:01:43.235 --> 01:01:46.755
<v Speaker 0>And Yeah. I think I'll oh, I'll have

01:01:46.755 --> 01:01:47.315
<v Speaker 4>to

01:01:48.355 --> 01:01:50.595
<v Speaker 4>you'll have to use Google Chrome for screen

01:01:50.595 --> 01:01:53.235
<v Speaker 4>sharing. So, Joe, you're using Google?

01:01:53.715 --> 01:01:54.515
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. That's right.

01:01:55.599 --> 01:01:57.520
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Could you share your screen? I'm happy

01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:58.880
<v Speaker 0>to do all the typing and share my

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:00.240
<v Speaker 0>screen if you would prefer,

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.640
<v Speaker 0>and I don't mind either way. It's up

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:03.280
<v Speaker 0>to you.

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:05.840
<v Speaker 0>Do you have a preference?

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.920
<v Speaker 3>I can try to share.

01:02:08.845 --> 01:02:09.245
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:24.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. Restless. Has nothing here.

01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:28.589
<v Speaker 0>Next to the hang up button, so be

01:02:28.589 --> 01:02:29.310
<v Speaker 0>careful.

01:02:31.309 --> 01:02:33.150
<v Speaker 3>No. I only mute and hang up.

01:02:37.775 --> 01:02:40.015
<v Speaker 3>That's an option for to share a screen.

01:02:45.855 --> 01:02:46.255
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:50.640
<v Speaker 0>I

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.160
<v Speaker 0>could do the typing,

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:56.080
<v Speaker 0>and we'll work through this together.

01:02:56.319 --> 01:02:58.160
<v Speaker 0>So let me close

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:00.480
<v Speaker 0>the Oh, you give me a second, and

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:03.119
<v Speaker 4>I'll try to get my GitHub login working

01:03:03.119 --> 01:03:04.160
<v Speaker 4>on Chrome.

01:03:11.315 --> 01:03:13.395
<v Speaker 0>And I'll fix all my stuff. Really need

01:03:13.395 --> 01:03:16.435
<v Speaker 0>to Restore

01:03:16.435 --> 01:03:18.990
<v Speaker 0>all the crew files from my old computer.

01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:20.430
<v Speaker 0>There we go. That's better.

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:23.390
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So JetStack control plane.

01:03:37.265 --> 01:03:39.265
<v Speaker 4>Oh, we had prepared such a good script

01:03:39.265 --> 01:03:40.545
<v Speaker 4>for bootstrapping.

01:03:41.265 --> 01:03:41.985
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

01:03:43.025 --> 01:03:44.545
<v Speaker 0>I can run a script for you if

01:03:44.545 --> 01:03:44.865
<v Speaker 0>you want.

01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:48.260
<v Speaker 4>We'll

01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:49.300
<v Speaker 4>do it without.

01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:51.540
<v Speaker 4>Okay. So but maybe you wanna do the

01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:52.740
<v Speaker 4>completion?

01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:55.060
<v Speaker 0>Uh-huh.

01:03:58.515 --> 01:03:59.234
<v Speaker 4>Perfect.

01:04:00.355 --> 01:04:02.115
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you wanna alias

01:04:02.515 --> 01:04:03.795
<v Speaker 4>cube to k.

01:04:08.355 --> 01:04:09.635
<v Speaker 0>Okay. How would you like to test for

01:04:09.635 --> 01:04:11.555
<v Speaker 0>a control plan? What's up? Yeah.

01:04:11.875 --> 01:04:13.234
<v Speaker 4>Let's do it. Get pots.

01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:16.970
<v Speaker 0>No control plan.

01:04:17.370 --> 01:04:18.330
<v Speaker 4>Okay. So

01:04:19.450 --> 01:04:21.610
<v Speaker 4>let's see if are there any containers running?

01:04:21.610 --> 01:04:23.290
<v Speaker 4>Cryo CTL PS.

01:04:24.970 --> 01:04:25.690
<v Speaker 3>And

01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:27.370
<v Speaker 4>they are running.

01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:29.690
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It does look like we have

01:04:31.185 --> 01:04:33.745
<v Speaker 0>controller manager scheduler. We just don't have an

01:04:33.745 --> 01:04:36.705
<v Speaker 0>API server. There's no API server. So maybe

01:04:36.705 --> 01:04:38.545
<v Speaker 4>the static manifests.

01:04:38.545 --> 01:04:39.585
<v Speaker 4>Is there a

01:04:39.825 --> 01:04:40.785
<v Speaker 4>yeah. Perfect.

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:47.200
<v Speaker 4>There is one.

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:53.520
<v Speaker 0>Man, what would you like to see?

01:05:00.185 --> 01:05:01.705
<v Speaker 4>Scroll down a bit.

01:05:03.465 --> 01:05:05.145
<v Speaker 4>I mean, it's interesting. Right?

01:05:05.465 --> 01:05:07.145
<v Speaker 4>The manifest is there,

01:05:07.385 --> 01:05:09.625
<v Speaker 4>but Kubelin is not picking it up.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.040
<v Speaker 3>Maybe

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:14.640
<v Speaker 3>the

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:16.080
<v Speaker 3>Kubelet

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.080
<v Speaker 3>path for manifests

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.040
<v Speaker 3>is not correct.

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:22.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. Check that one. Maybe do a

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:24.080
<v Speaker 4>systemctl

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:26.265
<v Speaker 4>cut kubelet.

01:05:28.984 --> 01:05:29.865
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

01:05:30.105 --> 01:05:30.825
<v Speaker 4>So

01:05:30.905 --> 01:05:34.105
<v Speaker 4>there is the kubelet config is in varlib

01:05:34.105 --> 01:05:35.065
<v Speaker 4>kubelet config.

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:42.360
<v Speaker 4>And then there should be a static port

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:44.840
<v Speaker 4>something. Yeah. Okay. Kubernetes

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.360
<v Speaker 4>manifests.

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.120
<v Speaker 4>Is there a typo? No.

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:50.040
<v Speaker 0>Nope. That looks

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:50.760
<v Speaker 0>good. Okay.

01:05:53.295 --> 01:05:56.015
<v Speaker 4>We wanna check the the Cubelet locks?

01:05:58.415 --> 01:06:00.335
<v Speaker 4>Journal journal control,

01:06:00.415 --> 01:06:01.775
<v Speaker 4>a few yeah.

01:06:02.895 --> 01:06:03.615
<v Speaker 4>Cubelet.

01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:10.020
<v Speaker 0>Well, they can't speak to the API server.

01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:14.900
<v Speaker 3>And we just restart the Kubelet.

01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:17.220
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes

01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:18.339
<v Speaker 3>it helps.

01:06:21.565 --> 01:06:22.285
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

01:06:27.005 --> 01:06:27.805
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

01:06:27.805 --> 01:06:29.805
<v Speaker 4>But every other part is picked up.

01:06:46.734 --> 01:06:48.335
<v Speaker 0>Shall we check the logs for the API

01:06:48.335 --> 01:06:49.055
<v Speaker 0>server?

01:06:50.255 --> 01:06:51.535
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. I

01:06:52.095 --> 01:06:55.055
<v Speaker 3>can see that the manifest for the API

01:06:55.055 --> 01:06:56.575
<v Speaker 3>server is modified.

01:06:58.415 --> 01:07:00.734
<v Speaker 3>So if you run a list command to

01:07:00.734 --> 01:07:01.295
<v Speaker 3>the

01:07:01.809 --> 01:07:04.609
<v Speaker 3>manifest folder or manifest directory,

01:07:04.770 --> 01:07:06.609
<v Speaker 3>I can see a modified date.

01:07:08.049 --> 01:07:10.049
<v Speaker 0>Yep. It does look. It has been modified.

01:07:14.885 --> 01:07:17.045
<v Speaker 4>So this is probably the time where we

01:07:17.045 --> 01:07:20.085
<v Speaker 4>will have our backups from our cluster,

01:07:20.085 --> 01:07:22.645
<v Speaker 4>and now we are diffing the manifest files.

01:07:25.525 --> 01:07:27.525
<v Speaker 0>Well, I mean, let's go through it. Right?

01:07:27.525 --> 01:07:28.964
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Yeah. All the flags.

01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:31.070
<v Speaker 0>Is there anything here

01:07:33.070 --> 01:07:34.430
<v Speaker 0>that worries you?

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:43.070
<v Speaker 4>Is the secure port correct?

01:07:43.475 --> 01:07:44.595
<v Speaker 0>It is not.

01:07:45.235 --> 01:07:46.195
<v Speaker 0>Good catch.

01:07:52.595 --> 01:07:53.715
<v Speaker 3>Well, let's try.

01:07:54.435 --> 01:07:56.195
<v Speaker 0>Well, would that stop it from running?

01:07:56.355 --> 01:07:58.195
<v Speaker 4>No. This wouldn't stop it. Yeah. This is

01:07:58.195 --> 01:07:58.835
<v Speaker 4>not the case.

01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:06.940
<v Speaker 4>So the live, I think it's correct, and

01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:08.540
<v Speaker 4>the ready c is is

01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:10.540
<v Speaker 4>there as well. Yes.

01:08:13.185 --> 01:08:15.505
<v Speaker 4>The ports the ports are not right. Right?

01:08:15.505 --> 01:08:16.225
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.

01:08:18.785 --> 01:08:19.585
<v Speaker 4>Yes.

01:08:22.465 --> 01:08:23.104
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.040
<v Speaker 0>And it's now?

01:08:32.279 --> 01:08:33.560
<v Speaker 4>Let's try it.

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:40.040
<v Speaker 4>That's wow.

01:08:42.795 --> 01:08:43.514
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

01:08:44.395 --> 01:08:46.395
<v Speaker 4>Now the port should be fixed. Right?

01:08:47.194 --> 01:08:48.875
<v Speaker 0>Yep. And I don't think there's anything else

01:08:48.875 --> 01:08:50.875
<v Speaker 0>of particular interest in here. Although I am

01:08:50.875 --> 01:08:52.395
<v Speaker 0>worried about one thing, but I don't wanna

01:08:52.395 --> 01:08:53.115
<v Speaker 0>mention it yet.

01:08:55.330 --> 01:08:56.210
<v Speaker 0>Let's

01:08:56.930 --> 01:08:58.050
<v Speaker 0>write this.

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:00.689
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

01:09:03.090 --> 01:09:04.770
<v Speaker 0>We have an API server.

01:09:05.010 --> 01:09:05.809
<v Speaker 4>So

01:09:07.685 --> 01:09:08.885
<v Speaker 0>And it appears

01:09:09.365 --> 01:09:11.444
<v Speaker 0>to stay. Let's

01:09:11.444 --> 01:09:12.645
<v Speaker 3>check pots.

01:09:13.205 --> 01:09:16.645
<v Speaker 3>Done again. No. The advertised address wasn't right.

01:09:16.645 --> 01:09:17.125
<v Speaker 4>Right?

01:09:17.604 --> 01:09:19.365
<v Speaker 4>It was a different advertised address.

01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:24.260
<v Speaker 4>It's 1065.

01:09:24.819 --> 01:09:26.100
<v Speaker 4>And in the

01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:27.939
<v Speaker 4>admin conf, it was,

01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:29.859
<v Speaker 4>I don't know, something different.

01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:33.380
<v Speaker 3>The annotation, you mean,

01:09:33.859 --> 01:09:36.020
<v Speaker 3>on the upper? So this is the Yeah.

01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:36.260
<v Speaker 4>I see

01:09:37.595 --> 01:09:38.875
<v Speaker 4>This is the yeah.

01:09:46.475 --> 01:09:48.314
<v Speaker 0>28141245.

01:09:48.314 --> 01:09:50.314
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So that's the IPV 4 public address.

01:09:50.670 --> 01:09:52.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. And the other one is the private

01:09:52.350 --> 01:09:53.149
<v Speaker 4>one. Right?

01:09:56.270 --> 01:09:56.910
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

01:09:58.110 --> 01:09:59.230
<v Speaker 0>I think that should be

01:10:01.150 --> 01:10:02.350
<v Speaker 0>I think it should be okay.

01:10:04.795 --> 01:10:06.474
<v Speaker 0>And it is still running.

01:10:10.715 --> 01:10:13.195
<v Speaker 3>Do we have any cron drops? Oh, the

01:10:13.195 --> 01:10:14.554
<v Speaker 0>secure port actually is

01:10:16.715 --> 01:10:19.355
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. The sec the manifest was probably changed

01:10:19.355 --> 01:10:19.994
<v Speaker 4>again. Right?

01:10:20.610 --> 01:10:22.689
<v Speaker 3>Yep. Should please check the current jobs?

01:10:24.130 --> 01:10:25.329
<v Speaker 0>Let's confirm.

01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:29.330
<v Speaker 4>That's

01:10:29.489 --> 01:10:31.170
<v Speaker 4>yeah. Let's 443.

01:10:31.170 --> 01:10:33.730
<v Speaker 4>No. Check yeah. It was probably 8443

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:34.050
<v Speaker 4>again.

01:10:35.475 --> 01:10:38.114
<v Speaker 4>Mhmm. Okay. Check the see Chrome.

01:10:38.435 --> 01:10:40.595
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. This is empty. All the Chrome there

01:10:40.595 --> 01:10:41.875
<v Speaker 3>are multiple Chrome

01:10:42.435 --> 01:10:44.835
<v Speaker 3>directories like ETC, Chrome tab.

01:10:48.835 --> 01:10:50.835
<v Speaker 3>Chrome d. Yeah. And

01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.260
<v Speaker 3>do I cut all?

01:10:57.059 --> 01:10:58.179
<v Speaker 3>That's something.

01:10:58.900 --> 01:10:59.460
<v Speaker 0>There is.

01:11:04.795 --> 01:11:05.835
<v Speaker 3>Remove it.

01:11:09.195 --> 01:11:10.875
<v Speaker 0>Alright. You're fine.

01:11:12.315 --> 01:11:13.035
<v Speaker 0>You're bad.

01:11:16.270 --> 01:11:18.989
<v Speaker 3>Okay. Now now we have to upgrade the

01:11:18.989 --> 01:11:20.189
<v Speaker 3>manifest again.

01:11:27.070 --> 01:11:27.789
<v Speaker 0>Perfect.

01:11:28.670 --> 01:11:29.230
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:11:32.114 --> 01:11:33.715
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty laid back if you don't have

01:11:33.715 --> 01:11:34.834
<v Speaker 4>to type anything.

01:11:34.835 --> 01:11:35.474
<v Speaker 4>Alright.

01:11:39.554 --> 01:11:40.675
<v Speaker 0>It's not restarted.

01:11:41.554 --> 01:11:44.034
<v Speaker 0>Alright. There we go. It's restarting.

01:11:44.195 --> 01:11:44.594
<v Speaker 0>No.

01:11:46.810 --> 01:11:48.810
<v Speaker 4>So the port is not not

01:11:50.090 --> 01:11:52.170
<v Speaker 0>But it's still six four four three, but

01:11:52.170 --> 01:11:52.570
<v Speaker 0>it's not

01:11:53.370 --> 01:11:55.690
<v Speaker 0>No. The kubelet can take a few minutes

01:11:55.690 --> 01:11:57.850
<v Speaker 0>before it does that. So we No. Restart

01:11:57.850 --> 01:11:59.690
<v Speaker 4>the kubelet. Yeah. Yeah. We can encourage that

01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:00.090
<v Speaker 0>along.

01:12:05.375 --> 01:12:06.415
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

01:12:07.535 --> 01:12:09.054
<v Speaker 4>Okay. Get pots.

01:12:11.775 --> 01:12:12.815
<v Speaker 1>Oh, wow.

01:12:13.535 --> 01:12:16.095
<v Speaker 3>But it's terminating. The POSCUS is terminating for

01:12:16.095 --> 01:12:16.495
<v Speaker 3>some reason.

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:21.600
<v Speaker 4>Let's describe it,

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:23.440
<v Speaker 4>the state four

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:34.735
<v Speaker 4>set. It's the stateful set. Is it called

01:12:34.735 --> 01:12:36.094
<v Speaker 4>like that? No. Yeah.

01:12:38.414 --> 01:12:40.655
<v Speaker 4>Is there event oh, no. Events. Okay.

01:12:45.215 --> 01:12:46.335
<v Speaker 4>One desired.

01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:53.670
<v Speaker 4>So this the stateful set looks okay, I

01:12:53.670 --> 01:12:56.790
<v Speaker 4>think. But something is terminating it,

01:12:57.190 --> 01:12:59.590
<v Speaker 4>and something is preventing the clustered app from

01:12:59.590 --> 01:13:02.070
<v Speaker 4>starting, but that's maybe the missing Postgres?

01:13:03.625 --> 01:13:05.945
<v Speaker 0>No. I don't think it it will be.

01:13:05.945 --> 01:13:08.585
<v Speaker 0>Now, typically, in clustered in the past, when

01:13:08.585 --> 01:13:10.985
<v Speaker 0>we've seen things that are stuck and terminating,

01:13:11.304 --> 01:13:12.744
<v Speaker 0>it usually means that

01:13:13.145 --> 01:13:15.465
<v Speaker 0>if hand means our kubelet isn't alive on

01:13:15.465 --> 01:13:16.264
<v Speaker 0>the worker node.

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:23.800
<v Speaker 3>And we run just kubectl get events.

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:26.360
<v Speaker 4>Look. The notes are not ready. Oh. Yeah.

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:27.720
<v Speaker 0>Okay. I don't think we have a kubelet.

01:13:29.855 --> 01:13:31.615
<v Speaker 4>Joe, what do you think? Should we call

01:13:31.615 --> 01:13:33.215
<v Speaker 4>in the the worker notes?

01:13:34.575 --> 01:13:36.015
<v Speaker 4>Or should we fix it on the worker

01:13:36.015 --> 01:13:36.655
<v Speaker 3>notes?

01:13:36.975 --> 01:13:38.895
<v Speaker 3>I guess we should fix. Right?

01:13:39.375 --> 01:13:40.895
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. Try to fix it. Okay.

01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:46.110
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's pop open Yeah. Just back. Worker

01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:49.070
<v Speaker 0>one. I'm assuming if we run a system

01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:49.950
<v Speaker 0>control

01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:50.830
<v Speaker 0>data,

01:13:52.990 --> 01:13:54.990
<v Speaker 0>we're just gonna see the kubectl is not

01:13:54.990 --> 01:13:55.310
<v Speaker 0>running.

01:13:56.565 --> 01:13:58.885
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Okay. So but wait a minute. Is

01:13:58.885 --> 01:14:01.125
<v Speaker 4>it is it is is enabled? Yeah. And

01:14:01.125 --> 01:14:02.565
<v Speaker 4>it's failed. Okay.

01:14:03.365 --> 01:14:04.805
<v Speaker 3>Check log. So Yeah.

01:14:06.245 --> 01:14:06.565
<v Speaker 4>Yep.

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:14.480
<v Speaker 3>Unable to load CA file.

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:17.680
<v Speaker 4>We said JetSec had to mess with the

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:18.800
<v Speaker 4>certificates.

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:22.240
<v Speaker 3>We need a cert manager right now.

01:14:27.185 --> 01:14:29.905
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. Let's confirm, but I think yeah.

01:14:30.705 --> 01:14:31.744
<v Speaker 4>Oh god.

01:14:32.065 --> 01:14:33.505
<v Speaker 3>Is he there?

01:14:34.304 --> 01:14:35.025
<v Speaker 3>Or

01:14:36.510 --> 01:14:39.550
<v Speaker 0>What was it looking for? CA certificate dot

01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:40.429
<v Speaker 0>CRT.

01:14:45.230 --> 01:14:47.230
<v Speaker 3>It is. It is. Then maybe

01:14:47.869 --> 01:14:50.205
<v Speaker 4>yeah. So maybe but maybe it's the the

01:14:50.205 --> 01:14:53.005
<v Speaker 4>system d unit file. Maybe it's blocking access

01:14:53.005 --> 01:14:53.805
<v Speaker 4>to this

01:14:54.605 --> 01:14:55.565
<v Speaker 4>directory.

01:14:56.525 --> 01:14:59.085
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. Could you do a system CTL cut

01:14:59.165 --> 01:15:00.125
<v Speaker 4>Kubelet

01:15:00.125 --> 01:15:00.525
<v Speaker 4>service?

01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:06.199
<v Speaker 0>I think it's easier than that.

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:15.559
<v Speaker 3>It looks okay ish right now.

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:18.280
<v Speaker 3>It's all, or it was the complete file?

01:15:20.995 --> 01:15:23.955
<v Speaker 0>I'll leave that there for ten seconds. Hey.

01:15:24.275 --> 01:15:25.395
<v Speaker 0>Close attention.

01:15:29.715 --> 01:15:31.955
<v Speaker 4>Certs there are certificates.

01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:39.270
<v Speaker 4>There is a missing s.

01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:40.870
<v Speaker 4>Yes.

01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:46.070
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So I'll rename it on the, yeah,

01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.950
<v Speaker 4>on the file system.

01:15:49.515 --> 01:15:50.475
<v Speaker 0>XFL.

01:15:50.475 --> 01:15:51.434
<v Speaker 0>There's

01:15:56.155 --> 01:15:56.955
<v Speaker 0>no way to remove it.

01:16:03.730 --> 01:16:05.810
<v Speaker 3>Like I said, I should also see

01:16:06.210 --> 01:16:08.930
<v Speaker 3>template config. Or is this what the correct

01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:09.330
<v Speaker 3>name

01:16:15.010 --> 01:16:15.650
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

01:16:16.605 --> 01:16:17.725
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

01:16:17.725 --> 01:16:20.125
<v Speaker 4>But fixing one worker, I think is enough.

01:16:21.325 --> 01:16:23.645
<v Speaker 4>And we could cordon the other one, so

01:16:25.965 --> 01:16:27.005
<v Speaker 4>yeah. Thanks.

01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:30.900
<v Speaker 4>Do you need core node? Okay. No. It's

01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:32.099
<v Speaker 4>okay. Perfect.

01:16:32.739 --> 01:16:33.539
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

01:16:34.099 --> 01:16:35.780
<v Speaker 4>So get pots again.

01:16:38.739 --> 01:16:39.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

01:16:40.335 --> 01:16:42.895
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I think they're unfortunate that they're on

01:16:42.895 --> 01:16:44.255
<v Speaker 0>that that Yeah.

01:16:44.655 --> 01:16:46.335
<v Speaker 4>They just deleted.

01:16:48.975 --> 01:16:49.614
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:16:51.614 --> 01:16:53.935
<v Speaker 0>Nothing bad ever came from deleting a Yeah.

01:16:55.380 --> 01:16:57.300
<v Speaker 0>No. I don't want dictation.

01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:02.820
<v Speaker 0>Uh-oh. Stop. Okay.

01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:05.140
<v Speaker 4>Let's describe it.

01:17:17.715 --> 01:17:21.315
<v Speaker 3>Temporal layer in name resolution. Okay. Same messed

01:17:21.315 --> 01:17:22.195
<v Speaker 3>up with DNS.

01:17:24.159 --> 01:17:26.239
<v Speaker 1>Okay. I guess I guess on the router

01:17:26.239 --> 01:17:28.719
<v Speaker 3>node, not on the control plane. Uh-huh.

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:31.040
<v Speaker 0>Of course. Because the error is coming from.

01:17:34.975 --> 01:17:36.175
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. Okay.

01:17:36.335 --> 01:17:39.135
<v Speaker 4>So the host is the DNS on the

01:17:39.135 --> 01:17:40.735
<v Speaker 4>host is not working. Okay.

01:17:41.695 --> 01:17:44.094
<v Speaker 3>Let me check if the system d resolve

01:17:44.094 --> 01:17:44.975
<v Speaker 3>d is running.

01:17:54.929 --> 01:17:55.650
<v Speaker 4>Yes.

01:17:56.449 --> 01:17:58.929
<v Speaker 4>Could you do could you do a resolve

01:17:59.170 --> 01:18:00.050
<v Speaker 4>CTL

01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:00.690
<v Speaker 4>status?

01:18:06.535 --> 01:18:08.614
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Red. Resolve.

01:18:08.775 --> 01:18:09.975
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:18:13.735 --> 01:18:14.935
<v Speaker 3>This

01:18:15.335 --> 01:18:15.895
<v Speaker 3>is

01:18:16.295 --> 01:18:16.695
<v Speaker 3>suspicious.

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:21.599
<v Speaker 0>Those are the Equinix metal

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:26.079
<v Speaker 0>DNS servers. Those those, I believe, are okay.

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:29.280
<v Speaker 3>And we check on the master on the

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:31.280
<v Speaker 3>control plane what's the correct DNS?

01:18:34.135 --> 01:18:36.615
<v Speaker 4>But it was an external d n external

01:18:36.615 --> 01:18:39.655
<v Speaker 4>IP. Right? It's the same. Yeah. The is

01:18:39.655 --> 01:18:42.455
<v Speaker 0>the Equinix method. So these one four seven

01:18:42.455 --> 01:18:45.095
<v Speaker 0>dot seventy five are Equinix method. So those

01:18:45.095 --> 01:18:45.975
<v Speaker 0>those are okay.

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:49.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. Some IP debits.

01:18:58.060 --> 01:19:00.220
<v Speaker 3>Just drop drop to domain.

01:19:01.455 --> 01:19:02.175
<v Speaker 4>Yep.

01:19:02.655 --> 01:19:03.374
<v Speaker 4>Wow.

01:19:04.895 --> 01:19:05.534
<v Speaker 3>And

01:19:05.775 --> 01:19:06.974
<v Speaker 4>If you do the

01:19:07.455 --> 01:19:09.614
<v Speaker 4>dash dash line dash number,

01:19:10.815 --> 01:19:13.054
<v Speaker 4>I think or it was four maybe. But

01:19:13.855 --> 01:19:15.614
<v Speaker 3>Line numbers. Yeah. Yeah.

01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:17.780
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:23.300
<v Speaker 1>What was that? Oh. Oh, I don't remember.

01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:29.940
<v Speaker 3>It's a chain output. Right? Yeah. Yeah.

01:19:31.845 --> 01:19:32.724
<v Speaker 0>It's gone.

01:19:34.485 --> 01:19:36.485
<v Speaker 3>Just to want to confirm, is is is

01:19:36.485 --> 01:19:38.165
<v Speaker 3>there additional drop rule?

01:19:38.565 --> 01:19:40.324
<v Speaker 3>Do we have a drop rule

01:19:41.525 --> 01:19:42.805
<v Speaker 3>on the control plane too?

01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:46.830
<v Speaker 4>Mhmm. But DNS was working on the control

01:19:46.830 --> 01:19:49.950
<v Speaker 4>plane. It was more broken.

01:19:52.110 --> 01:19:54.910
<v Speaker 3>Okay. There's at least another drop row too.

01:19:54.910 --> 01:19:55.630
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

01:19:55.870 --> 01:19:58.830
<v Speaker 4>Okay. So we had this DNS resolution. Right?

01:19:58.830 --> 01:19:59.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. Perfect. Okay.

01:20:04.125 --> 01:20:05.965
<v Speaker 0>Ta da. Running.

01:20:05.965 --> 01:20:06.764
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

01:20:07.725 --> 01:20:09.724
<v Speaker 3>Good. And more is pending.

01:20:10.525 --> 01:20:11.164
<v Speaker 4>So

01:20:11.885 --> 01:20:13.085
<v Speaker 4>describe the pending one.

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:18.959
<v Speaker 4>Okay. Now we went.

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:26.479
<v Speaker 3>Can we support?

01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:29.784
<v Speaker 3>Ah. Okay. But Oh, Yeah. No

01:20:30.025 --> 01:20:30.985
<v Speaker 3>scheduler.

01:20:31.145 --> 01:20:32.264
<v Speaker 3>The scheduling.

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:38.824
<v Speaker 4>Could you edit the deployment? I mean, we

01:20:38.824 --> 01:20:40.185
<v Speaker 4>have to edit it anywhere.

01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:45.399
<v Speaker 0>Yep. What would you like to change?

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:48.599
<v Speaker 4>We go with the v two first.

01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:52.360
<v Speaker 4>Yep. And, Joe, what do you think? Should

01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:53.800
<v Speaker 4>we do the node name?

01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:56.520
<v Speaker 3>We can try the node name Yeah. In

01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:58.934
<v Speaker 3>this in the spec. In the spec?

01:20:59.655 --> 01:21:00.374
<v Speaker 4>No.

01:21:00.695 --> 01:21:03.574
<v Speaker 4>It here? No. No. It's in the pod

01:21:03.574 --> 01:21:04.454
<v Speaker 3>template.

01:21:04.775 --> 01:21:07.335
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's in the Yeah. Yeah. Here.

01:21:08.534 --> 01:21:09.655
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:12.360
<v Speaker 4>Oh, but, David, you have to remember the

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:12.920
<v Speaker 4>name.

01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:15.079
<v Speaker 4>JetStack

01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:16.679
<v Speaker 4>worker one.

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:17.639
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

01:21:21.239 --> 01:21:22.360
<v Speaker 3>Running. Are

01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:23.160
<v Speaker 3>we done?

01:21:25.225 --> 01:21:26.664
<v Speaker 4>Let's, yeah, curl it.

01:21:28.185 --> 01:21:29.785
<v Speaker 0>I can't remember the back. It's been so

01:21:29.785 --> 01:21:30.985
<v Speaker 0>long since I've got a cluster that I

01:21:30.985 --> 01:21:32.184
<v Speaker 0>don't remember the plus.

01:21:33.305 --> 01:21:34.745
<v Speaker 0>Sorry. Doesn't curl.

01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:41.660
<v Speaker 0>Version one.

01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:44.219
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

01:21:45.020 --> 01:21:47.260
<v Speaker 4>Let's see what's happened with the pod. Is

01:21:47.260 --> 01:21:49.739
<v Speaker 4>it version two on the pod,

01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:50.620
<v Speaker 4>the image?

01:21:59.745 --> 01:22:02.305
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. Already present on machine.

01:22:02.385 --> 01:22:03.345
<v Speaker 4>Maybe

01:22:04.225 --> 01:22:05.585
<v Speaker 4>we should Always.

01:22:06.850 --> 01:22:07.489
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.

01:22:16.610 --> 01:22:17.810
<v Speaker 3>It's

01:22:17.810 --> 01:22:18.369
<v Speaker 3>a

01:22:18.770 --> 01:22:19.410
<v Speaker 3>low image.

01:22:21.514 --> 01:22:23.195
<v Speaker 0>See, I can't I can't type. There's too

01:22:23.195 --> 01:22:23.994
<v Speaker 0>much pressure.

01:22:24.955 --> 01:22:26.315
<v Speaker 0>Perfect.

01:22:32.890 --> 01:22:33.770
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:22:34.810 --> 01:22:36.489
<v Speaker 4>This is a working method I could get

01:22:36.489 --> 01:22:38.330
<v Speaker 4>used to, so maybe I'll have to find

01:22:38.330 --> 01:22:41.050
<v Speaker 4>someone typing for me. Okay.

01:22:42.170 --> 01:22:43.530
<v Speaker 0>It's working. Question two.

01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:45.850
<v Speaker 3>But I would like to get into the

01:22:45.850 --> 01:22:46.730
<v Speaker 3>scheduler issue.

01:22:54.224 --> 01:22:56.864
<v Speaker 4>There should be a scheduler conf. Right? Yeah.

01:22:57.824 --> 01:22:59.744
<v Speaker 4>It is Kubernetes scheduler conf.

01:23:00.770 --> 01:23:03.010
<v Speaker 0>That's just authorization configuration.

01:23:03.010 --> 01:23:03.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah.

01:23:04.449 --> 01:23:04.930
<v Speaker 3>There's

01:23:05.650 --> 01:23:07.329
<v Speaker 3>basically, we are doing the same,

01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:09.090
<v Speaker 3>but

01:23:11.170 --> 01:23:13.570
<v Speaker 3>can we get the locks off the scheduler?

01:23:18.915 --> 01:23:20.355
<v Speaker 0>I just assumed that it's gonna be

01:23:24.435 --> 01:23:26.435
<v Speaker 4>I mean, you could remove the node name.

01:23:26.435 --> 01:23:26.595
<v Speaker 4>Right?

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:31.440
<v Speaker 0>We could. Yeah.

01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:33.680
<v Speaker 0>But you want to do it and see

01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:35.920
<v Speaker 1>the logs. Right? So let's Okay. Let's do

01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:36.160
<v Speaker 0>that.

01:23:51.725 --> 01:23:52.205
<v Speaker 1>Actually

01:23:53.324 --> 01:23:55.165
<v Speaker 0>Peter, it was chat saying we should try

01:23:55.165 --> 01:23:56.685
<v Speaker 0>the actual video URL.

01:23:57.930 --> 01:23:58.650
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

01:24:07.530 --> 01:24:08.330
<v Speaker 0>Yes. It does.

01:24:09.945 --> 01:24:11.145
<v Speaker 0>Oh, wow. Beautiful.

01:24:14.905 --> 01:24:16.505
<v Speaker 4>So you have Okay. But have fixed it,

01:24:16.505 --> 01:24:18.185
<v Speaker 0>but we do there is something wrong with

01:24:18.185 --> 01:24:19.145
<v Speaker 0>the scheduler.

01:24:19.145 --> 01:24:21.705
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. You're thinking that the scheduler name is

01:24:21.705 --> 01:24:23.305
<v Speaker 4>probably not the default one?

01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:27.239
<v Speaker 0>You want to remove it?

01:24:27.639 --> 01:24:30.199
<v Speaker 4>Let's remove it and delete the pod. Yeah.

01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:32.440
<v Speaker 3>But if you if

01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:34.519
<v Speaker 3>you remove the default one but

01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:36.840
<v Speaker 3>now it's running too.

01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:38.119
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm. That's it.

01:24:40.595 --> 01:24:42.755
<v Speaker 0>Well, the time you absolutely smashed that.

01:24:43.315 --> 01:24:45.075
<v Speaker 0>I mean, obviously, it's because I was doing

01:24:45.075 --> 01:24:48.034
<v Speaker 0>all the tape and then I'm not Okay.

01:24:50.595 --> 01:24:51.715
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well played.

01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:54.120
<v Speaker 4>Thanks.

01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:55.320
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:57.080
<v Speaker 0>Have a good one. This was cool.

01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:00.680
<v Speaker 4>Involve especially involving the the worker nodes, we

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:02.840
<v Speaker 4>always thought about maybe, should we do something

01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:04.680
<v Speaker 4>with the worker? But then, I mean, we

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:07.000
<v Speaker 4>we already had enough on the control plane.

01:25:08.455 --> 01:25:09.735
<v Speaker 4>But, yeah, nice.

01:25:10.055 --> 01:25:11.175
<v Speaker 4>And

01:25:11.255 --> 01:25:14.375
<v Speaker 4>no real certificate issues. Thanks a lot.

01:25:17.655 --> 01:25:19.415
<v Speaker 0>Oh, well. Welcome back, Pierre.

01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:24.719
<v Speaker 2>Hi. Hey, guys. Well done.

01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:27.680
<v Speaker 1>Let me pop you all back up. There

01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:30.400
<v Speaker 1>you go. Yeah. Good job, both teams. Those

01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:32.240
<v Speaker 0>were those were fun clusters.

01:25:34.255 --> 01:25:36.735
<v Speaker 0>Annoyed that we couldn't use Teleport properly. I'm

01:25:36.735 --> 01:25:38.255
<v Speaker 0>gonna have to work out with that, but

01:25:38.255 --> 01:25:39.454
<v Speaker 0>I will get that fixed with the next

01:25:39.454 --> 01:25:41.775
<v Speaker 0>episode for sure. But I hope you all

01:25:41.775 --> 01:25:44.494
<v Speaker 0>you all had fun. Alright? Perfect.

01:25:44.895 --> 01:25:45.614
<v Speaker 2>It was good.

01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:49.420
<v Speaker 1>Alright. The thing or two for sure.

01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:52.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I was very impressed how methodically you

01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:53.820
<v Speaker 1>guys worked through the problem.

01:25:55.340 --> 01:25:57.580
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That was we were both very, very

01:25:57.580 --> 01:26:00.700
<v Speaker 0>calm through that. I was just like, alright.

01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:01.980
<v Speaker 0>Let's look at this. Let's look at this.

01:26:02.025 --> 01:26:04.425
<v Speaker 0>You yeah. You just Yep. The good thing,

01:26:04.425 --> 01:26:06.344
<v Speaker 4>there was always an error message. And we

01:26:06.344 --> 01:26:08.265
<v Speaker 4>knew that the man in the middle proxy

01:26:08.265 --> 01:26:10.344
<v Speaker 4>we prepared, there was no error message. So

01:26:10.344 --> 01:26:12.185
<v Speaker 4>we thought, ah, this is gonna be hard

01:26:12.185 --> 01:26:15.065
<v Speaker 4>without an error. Yeah. That was very,

01:26:15.065 --> 01:26:18.560
<v Speaker 0>very sneaky. Where was the proxy running? Sorry?

01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:22.560
<v Speaker 4>The proxy was a bit hidden as well.

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:25.040
<v Speaker 4>We hit the pit, and we named it

01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:26.639
<v Speaker 4>system d home d.

01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:30.880
<v Speaker 4>Oh, god. Yeah. But Yeah. It was never

01:26:30.555 --> 01:26:32.555
<v Speaker 4>we never wanted you to find the process

01:26:32.555 --> 01:26:34.155
<v Speaker 4>or kill the process because if you kill

01:26:34.155 --> 01:26:36.235
<v Speaker 4>the process, then the connection to the API

01:26:36.235 --> 01:26:38.395
<v Speaker 4>server wasn't working. You had to remove the

01:26:38.395 --> 01:26:39.515
<v Speaker 4>IP table.

01:26:39.995 --> 01:26:42.395
<v Speaker 0>And your proxy was dropping oh, no. It

01:26:42.395 --> 01:26:43.675
<v Speaker 0>was doing the dry run. Right? You were

01:26:43.675 --> 01:26:45.835
<v Speaker 0>injecting the dry run on film. Yeah. Yeah.

01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:48.960
<v Speaker 0>That is very sneaky.

01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:52.720
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forgive myself for not saying why

01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:55.360
<v Speaker 2>is there dry run-in that API request

01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:57.520
<v Speaker 2>in the first two minutes. I know. I

01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:58.960
<v Speaker 0>never said it either. I've seen it right

01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:00.320
<v Speaker 0>at the start. I just I just ignored

01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:02.275
<v Speaker 0>it because I didn't think it Yeah.

01:27:02.275 --> 01:27:04.195
<v Speaker 1>For anyone watching, it's a top tip is

01:27:04.195 --> 01:27:05.955
<v Speaker 2>why you don't say something because you think

01:27:05.955 --> 01:27:07.875
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna be a stupid thing to say.

01:27:07.955 --> 01:27:10.515
<v Speaker 2>Always say always say it even if it's

01:27:10.515 --> 01:27:11.795
<v Speaker 2>gonna be stupid in your head.

01:27:13.330 --> 01:27:14.050
<v Speaker 3>Mhmm.

01:27:14.449 --> 01:27:17.730
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Yeah. Well, thank you all for joining

01:27:17.730 --> 01:27:18.289
<v Speaker 0>me.

01:27:19.090 --> 01:27:21.570
<v Speaker 0>That was really two good two good two

01:27:21.730 --> 01:27:24.130
<v Speaker 0>very cool questions. So well done both of

01:27:24.130 --> 01:27:26.050
<v Speaker 0>you. We're gonna see David, thanks for the

01:27:26.530 --> 01:27:27.489
<v Speaker 4>for this

01:27:27.815 --> 01:27:29.975
<v Speaker 4>episode. Thanks for preparing everything.

01:27:30.855 --> 01:27:32.455
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I gave you all a broken

01:27:32.455 --> 01:27:34.695
<v Speaker 0>Teleport installations. I don't know why you're thanking

01:27:34.695 --> 01:27:35.495
<v Speaker 0>me, but

01:27:36.615 --> 01:27:38.855
<v Speaker 0>I just love that we get to have,

01:27:38.855 --> 01:27:40.695
<v Speaker 0>you know, clustered at all where we can

01:27:40.935 --> 01:27:43.219
<v Speaker 0>you know, I think that the way that

01:27:43.219 --> 01:27:45.940
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes is still complex. Right? Like, we all

01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:47.540
<v Speaker 0>have to learn the hard way when it

01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:48.820
<v Speaker 0>comes to it, and it's always through trial

01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:50.500
<v Speaker 0>and error and a lot of pain and

01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:52.820
<v Speaker 0>sleepless nights typically that we learn how to

01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:55.140
<v Speaker 0>configure or just, like, why should anyone know

01:27:55.140 --> 01:27:57.460
<v Speaker 0>you can disable the deployment controller or the

01:27:57.255 --> 01:27:59.094
<v Speaker 0>or the pod controller? But all these things

01:27:59.094 --> 01:28:01.014
<v Speaker 0>do exist. And I think cluster is a

01:28:01.014 --> 01:28:02.935
<v Speaker 0>really cool way where we can just take

01:28:02.935 --> 01:28:04.614
<v Speaker 0>that knowledge from all of you and share

01:28:04.614 --> 01:28:06.375
<v Speaker 0>that with people that are watching. So, seriously,
