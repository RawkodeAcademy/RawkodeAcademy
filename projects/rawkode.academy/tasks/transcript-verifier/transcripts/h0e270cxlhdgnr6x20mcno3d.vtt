00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.959
<v Speaker 0>Did you know that the border gateway protocol,

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.080
<v Speaker 0>BGP,

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.600
<v Speaker 0>is the magic incantation

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.480
<v Speaker 0>that you need to deliver services

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.599
<v Speaker 0>at the edge?

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Speaker 0>Well, you don't need to be a wizard

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.305
<v Speaker 0>to understand this today. Let's imagine you want

00:00:15.305 --> 00:00:16.664
<v Speaker 0>some McNuggets.

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:19.145
<v Speaker 0>You know there's at least 30 or maybe

00:00:19.145 --> 00:00:22.105
<v Speaker 0>90 McDonald's within a quarter mile of wherever

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:25.224
<v Speaker 0>you are. But which one is closest?

00:00:25.384 --> 00:00:28.190
<v Speaker 0>Unless you know, you may use Google Maps

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.190
<v Speaker 0>to help you out. It knows where you

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.750
<v Speaker 0>are,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.470
<v Speaker 0>and it knows where all the McDonald's are.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.950
<v Speaker 0>It can give you the quickest route from

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.910
<v Speaker 0>a to b. BGP is the Google Maps

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:39.790
<v Speaker 0>of the Internet.

00:00:40.485 --> 00:00:42.644
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't matter where you are

00:00:42.965 --> 00:00:45.045
<v Speaker 0>or where your customers are.

00:00:45.605 --> 00:00:47.524
<v Speaker 0>With the power of the Internet, they can

00:00:47.524 --> 00:00:50.324
<v Speaker 0>always access your website or your product.

00:00:50.644 --> 00:00:52.885
<v Speaker 0>It may just take them a little bit

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:55.540
<v Speaker 0>longer if they're further away from where your

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.180
<v Speaker 0>servers or your applications are hosted.

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.500
<v Speaker 0>So to minimize that latency,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.020
<v Speaker 0>you start deploying

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.379
<v Speaker 0>to multiple regions or even to edge locations.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.860
<v Speaker 0>But now you've got six or 12 points

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.075
<v Speaker 0>of presence, but you still got a challenge.

00:01:10.075 --> 00:01:11.835
<v Speaker 0>You still got a problem to solve.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:14.715
<v Speaker 0>How do you route your customers wherever they

00:01:14.715 --> 00:01:15.195
<v Speaker 0>are

00:01:15.755 --> 00:01:18.075
<v Speaker 0>to your POP in the right region

00:01:18.314 --> 00:01:19.835
<v Speaker 0>with the closest path?

00:01:20.075 --> 00:01:21.914
<v Speaker 0>Now you can use BGP

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:24.070
<v Speaker 0>to do this. It provides the ability to

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.110
<v Speaker 0>have a single IP address and allow BGP

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.229
<v Speaker 0>to advertise different routes in different regions,

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.229
<v Speaker 0>much in the same way that Google Maps

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.229
<v Speaker 0>will route you from where you are to

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.350
<v Speaker 0>the nearest McDonald's.

00:01:35.875 --> 00:01:37.554
<v Speaker 0>Now to do this, all you need is

00:01:37.554 --> 00:01:39.874
<v Speaker 0>more points of presence, more pops,

00:01:40.115 --> 00:01:42.755
<v Speaker 0>at least ten years of networking excellence,

00:01:43.314 --> 00:01:45.395
<v Speaker 0>enough money to buy some IP v four

00:01:45.395 --> 00:01:48.274
<v Speaker 0>pills, your own autonomous systems, and even more

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:50.670
<v Speaker 0>money to bribe the other autonomous systems to

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.670
<v Speaker 0>peer review. Breaking news. Ngrok's global load balancers

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.390
<v Speaker 1>provide everything you need to deliver low latency

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.830
<v Speaker 1>services around the world with eight POPs including

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 1>Asia, Australia, India, South America,

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.190
<v Speaker 1>and of course, America and Europe.

00:02:06.715 --> 00:02:09.195
<v Speaker 1>Ngrok will handle the routing of requests to

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:10.715
<v Speaker 1>your edge services

00:02:10.715 --> 00:02:11.675
<v Speaker 1>for you.

00:02:11.995 --> 00:02:12.715
<v Speaker 1>Wow.

00:02:12.955 --> 00:02:14.955
<v Speaker 1>You don't even need to geo replicate your

00:02:14.955 --> 00:02:17.835
<v Speaker 1>application to take advantage of lower latency due

00:02:17.835 --> 00:02:21.800
<v Speaker 1>to ngrok's connection and module acceleration capabilities.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Double wow.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.799
<v Speaker 1>To sweeten the deal, if any of your

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.480
<v Speaker 1>edge locations are failing,

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.280
<v Speaker 1>ngrok will route requests for your service to

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.720
<v Speaker 1>the next closest edge.

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.005
<v Speaker 1>You're welcome. Get started with ngrok's global server

00:02:35.005 --> 00:02:38.045
<v Speaker 1>load balancer today and keep your customers happy.

00:02:38.205 --> 00:02:40.525
<v Speaker 1>Link to get started in the description below.

00:02:40.685 --> 00:02:42.285
<v Speaker 1>Now back to the studio.

00:02:42.685 --> 00:02:43.485
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:02:43.485 --> 00:02:45.325
<v Speaker 0>That's enough of the whimsical.

00:02:45.325 --> 00:02:47.325
<v Speaker 0>Let's dive into the fun and get hands

00:02:47.325 --> 00:02:48.125
<v Speaker 0>on keyboard.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.819
<v Speaker 0>Here you will see I have four panes

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.219
<v Speaker 0>open in my terminal, two in The EU,

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:55.500
<v Speaker 0>Two in The US.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.700
<v Speaker 0>This is the simplest Deno application I can

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.820
<v Speaker 0>put together where this one says hello EU

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.420
<v Speaker 0>and on the bottom

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:05.955
<v Speaker 0>it says hello US.

00:03:06.835 --> 00:03:09.155
<v Speaker 0>We can run both of these applications,

00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:13.395
<v Speaker 0>and we could hit them on the public

00:03:13.395 --> 00:03:16.515
<v Speaker 0>IP of each machine itself. However, we want

00:03:16.515 --> 00:03:19.730
<v Speaker 0>to use ngrok and the global load balancer.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.450
<v Speaker 0>For that, I can run ngrok tunnel passing

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.290
<v Speaker 0>on a label I got from the ngrok

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.890
<v Speaker 0>UI like so.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 0>I can do the same in The US.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.250
<v Speaker 0>We can then head over to these tabs

00:03:31.035 --> 00:03:32.635
<v Speaker 0>where I can do a curl from The

00:03:32.635 --> 00:03:34.875
<v Speaker 0>US box, and we get hello US.

00:03:35.035 --> 00:03:37.995
<v Speaker 0>From my local machine, I get hello EU.

00:03:39.755 --> 00:03:41.755
<v Speaker 0>Let's shut down The US tunnel,

00:03:43.995 --> 00:03:45.595
<v Speaker 0>and now we get hello from EU.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.170
<v Speaker 0>It really is that simple. Anyone can undo

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.570
<v Speaker 0>it. Go check out ngrok.com

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:52.050
<v Speaker 0>today.
