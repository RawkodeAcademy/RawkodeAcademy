<v Speaker 0>Hello.

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.880
<v Speaker 0>I am twelve minutes later than I said

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.844
<v Speaker 0>I would be, but I did say I

00:00:12.844 --> 00:00:16.125
<v Speaker 0>would livestream picking the winners from the retweet

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:17.164

<v Speaker 0>So we're gonna get started on that right

<v Speaker 0>now.

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.369
<v Speaker 0>I know I have already drawn the first

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:28.009
<v Speaker 0>winner

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.169
<v Speaker 0>because I had to make sure the software

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.009
<v Speaker 0>works. You'll see I did this

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.050
<v Speaker 0>just around five, six minutes ago.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.489
<v Speaker 0>So our first winner is

00:00:42.815 --> 00:00:44.015
<v Speaker 0>Hello, mister.

00:00:44.495 --> 00:00:46.255
<v Speaker 0>So we are going to draw another nine

00:00:46.255 --> 00:00:46.975
<v Speaker 0>of these.

00:00:47.695 --> 00:00:49.455

<v Speaker 0>did I say it was? T shirt and

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:57.250
<v Speaker 0>a mug? I think it was the T

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.730
<v Speaker 0>shirt and a mug. Alright. So congratulations to

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.769
<v Speaker 0>winner number one.

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:02.530
<v Speaker 0>I should probably

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:04.769
<v Speaker 0>copy these down. Right?

00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:20.365
<v Speaker 0>Is just text editor. Winners.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.980
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.500
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'm so organized.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.380
<v Speaker 0>So when you pick another winner, it takes

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.060
<v Speaker 0>me to some other

00:01:37.575 --> 00:01:38.535
<v Speaker 0>random

00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:41.015
<v Speaker 0>website.

00:01:46.615 --> 00:01:47.735
<v Speaker 0>Hey, Russell.

00:01:48.135 --> 00:01:49.495
<v Speaker 0>Fancy new theme.

00:01:49.895 --> 00:01:52.055
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'm working on updating the brand in

00:01:52.055 --> 00:01:54.750
<v Speaker 0>a little bit. Thanks for noticing.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.030
<v Speaker 0>It's so annoying. I just wanna pick 10

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.750
<v Speaker 0>winners.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.470
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.150
<v Speaker 0>Well, when things don't go to plan, retweet

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.270
<v Speaker 0>picker winner.

00:02:07.365 --> 00:02:09.044
<v Speaker 0>We'll try one of the other ones from

00:02:09.044 --> 00:02:09.845
<v Speaker 0>earlier.

00:02:11.685 --> 00:02:13.365
<v Speaker 0>Hey for that. How's it gone?

00:02:16.165 --> 00:02:17.285
<v Speaker 0>Hey, Luke Shire.

00:02:18.405 --> 00:02:20.405
<v Speaker 0>This is gonna be the most uneventful stream

00:02:20.405 --> 00:02:23.444
<v Speaker 0>ever, of course. I'm only picking winners

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.620
<v Speaker 0>for the competition.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.700
<v Speaker 0>Hey, Nuno. Nice to see you.

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.620
<v Speaker 0>I don't know who won chip because the

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.220
<v Speaker 0>software I was gonna use

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.700
<v Speaker 0>wants me now to

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.620
<v Speaker 0>sign up for something else and pay.

00:02:38.144 --> 00:02:39.825
<v Speaker 0>I can always pick these at random by

00:02:39.825 --> 00:02:41.185
<v Speaker 0>going through the tweets, so we're try not

00:02:41.185 --> 00:02:42.704
<v Speaker 0>to do that. We're just gonna try some

00:02:42.704 --> 00:02:44.385
<v Speaker 0>random software so I can get name more

00:02:44.385 --> 00:02:45.025
<v Speaker 0>names out of this.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.150
<v Speaker 0>License key.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.750
<v Speaker 0>Let's me turn into a live coding stream

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.310
<v Speaker 0>where I write my own them retweet pecker

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.030
<v Speaker 0>runner.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.030
<v Speaker 0>Let's try not to do that.

00:03:05.505 --> 00:03:06.545
<v Speaker 0>Authorize.

00:03:06.625 --> 00:03:08.065
<v Speaker 0>How many of these things am I gonna

00:03:08.065 --> 00:03:09.905
<v Speaker 0>have to authorize? I better remember to remove

00:03:09.905 --> 00:03:10.625
<v Speaker 0>them all.

00:03:11.585 --> 00:03:13.665
<v Speaker 0>Winners from retweet of a tweet.

00:03:16.225 --> 00:03:17.745
<v Speaker 0>Oh, that's the first winner.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.050
<v Speaker 0>You're all funny.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.650
<v Speaker 0>Let's see. My competition tweet now.

00:03:31.025 --> 00:03:32.305
<v Speaker 0>This should be easier.

00:03:32.465 --> 00:03:34.705
<v Speaker 0>No. I should be more prepared. This probably

00:03:34.705 --> 00:03:35.665
<v Speaker 0>is easy.

00:03:35.745 --> 00:03:37.025
<v Speaker 0>I'm just an idiot.

00:03:37.585 --> 00:03:38.465
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:03:38.465 --> 00:03:40.225
<v Speaker 0>Here's the tweet URL.

00:03:41.665 --> 00:03:43.265
<v Speaker 0>Let's drop this in here.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.740
<v Speaker 0>Get retweets for followers.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.620
<v Speaker 0>That's gonna pack a winner.

00:04:05.204 --> 00:04:05.924
<v Speaker 0>I don't know.

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.500
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I think it's doing something.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.019
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully we have another winner.

00:04:25.715 --> 00:04:27.475
<v Speaker 0>Thomas Lab, you're funny. Let me move the

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:29.875
<v Speaker 0>comments up. This will not be the same

00:04:29.875 --> 00:04:31.635
<v Speaker 0>length as a clustered stream.

00:04:32.115 --> 00:04:33.235
<v Speaker 0>Hell no.

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:37.635
<v Speaker 0>Yes. Random in quotes.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.660
<v Speaker 0>Russell don't encourage me to build a tool.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.940
<v Speaker 0>And I don't know if Nuno is suggesting

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.100
<v Speaker 0>the name for this tool, retweetie, but I

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.980
<v Speaker 0>quite like it.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.060
<v Speaker 0>All right, so I think we've got a

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.940
<v Speaker 0>second winner.

00:04:52.075 --> 00:04:54.235
<v Speaker 0>If I copy their username,

00:04:55.595 --> 00:04:57.035
<v Speaker 0>add it to the doc.

00:04:58.075 --> 00:04:59.435
<v Speaker 0>Can I pick another one?

00:04:59.755 --> 00:05:01.514
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I can. There we go. This is

00:05:01.514 --> 00:05:02.155
<v Speaker 0>working.

00:05:02.475 --> 00:05:03.355
<v Speaker 0>I think we're kicking.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.570
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Easy hockey nut. Another winner.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.930
<v Speaker 0>Let me change the font size on this.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.130
<v Speaker 0>We've got three so far.

00:05:27.315 --> 00:05:28.835
<v Speaker 0>What do you mean? No. No. It doesn't

00:05:28.835 --> 00:05:29.795
<v Speaker 0>show the retweet.

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:35.130
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I think I know what you mean.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.770
<v Speaker 0>Just goes to the profile, doesn't it?

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:46.569
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'll do some checking to make sure

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:48.650
<v Speaker 0>the retweets exists just in case.

00:05:51.165 --> 00:05:52.445
<v Speaker 0>I think I was there.

00:05:53.325 --> 00:05:55.165
<v Speaker 0>So we'll just keep picking for now. I'll

00:05:55.165 --> 00:05:57.405
<v Speaker 0>do some due diligence, but hopefully they're all

00:05:57.405 --> 00:05:58.045
<v Speaker 0>legit.

00:06:00.205 --> 00:06:01.725
<v Speaker 0>And that would be a good way though.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.630
<v Speaker 0>Like, you could write a random tweet picker

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.390
<v Speaker 0>just to get yourself

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.870
<v Speaker 0>when competitions and then it doesn't it just

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.030
<v Speaker 0>gives you usernames of your fake accounts rather

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.710
<v Speaker 0>than actually anyone that retweeted.

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 0>That would be funny.

00:06:17.905 --> 00:06:18.705
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:06:18.785 --> 00:06:19.745
<v Speaker 0>We've got

00:06:21.425 --> 00:06:23.425
<v Speaker 0>one, two, three, four, five.

00:06:25.265 --> 00:06:27.905
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Thomas Lavish rate. This is

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:30.479
<v Speaker 0>only grabbing 100.

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:32.639
<v Speaker 0>There actually weren't many more than a hundred.

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:34.400
<v Speaker 0>I think it was a 23

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.880
<v Speaker 0>over that as saying

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.720
<v Speaker 0>this goes random

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.000
<v Speaker 0>names from your followers. I don't think so

00:06:44.284 --> 00:06:45.085
<v Speaker 0>because

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:47.805
<v Speaker 0>two of the accounts don't follow me. I

00:06:47.805 --> 00:06:49.165
<v Speaker 0>think it is using

00:06:50.525 --> 00:06:53.085
<v Speaker 0>this. Oh, it says does it retweets or

00:06:53.085 --> 00:06:54.764
<v Speaker 0>followers, but then it does count.

00:06:55.405 --> 00:06:58.044
<v Speaker 0>We have winners from retweets of a tweet.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.200
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Apparently, I have a 45 retweets.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.720
<v Speaker 0>Am I gonna have to write some software?

00:07:18.955 --> 00:07:19.755
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:07:21.115 --> 00:07:22.155
<v Speaker 0>Getting complicated.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.600
<v Speaker 0>Decisions.

00:07:46.884 --> 00:07:48.485
<v Speaker 0>Do it right at the software,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.720
<v Speaker 0>but then use the software which unbox therapy

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.960
<v Speaker 0>used for a giveaway. What did they use?

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:55.840
<v Speaker 0>Let me know.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.560
<v Speaker 0>Let me know.

00:08:03.095 --> 00:08:05.735
<v Speaker 0>So, I mean, I could continue with this.

00:08:06.215 --> 00:08:08.055
<v Speaker 0>My only concern is just that I don't

00:08:08.055 --> 00:08:09.495
<v Speaker 0>want anyone to be left out. And if

00:08:09.495 --> 00:08:10.935
<v Speaker 0>it's only using the first one hundred,

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.510
<v Speaker 0>We have picked five winners thus far.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.150
<v Speaker 0>Look at that one. Yeah. One, two, three,

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:25.550
<v Speaker 0>four, five.

00:08:30.235 --> 00:08:32.475
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's have a let's spend a couple

00:08:32.475 --> 00:08:33.755
<v Speaker 0>of minutes to see if I can find

00:08:33.755 --> 00:08:36.315
<v Speaker 0>another website that will do this legitly.

00:08:36.315 --> 00:08:37.914
<v Speaker 0>I'll add on more banners.

00:08:38.154 --> 00:08:39.434
<v Speaker 0>And then if I need to, I'll write

00:08:39.434 --> 00:08:40.154
<v Speaker 0>something later.

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:43.380
<v Speaker 0>So let's see. Retweet,

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:44.900
<v Speaker 0>I'll type

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:46.660
<v Speaker 0>picker

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:47.700
<v Speaker 0>winner

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.900
<v Speaker 0>over 100. This is a common search term.

00:08:57.365 --> 00:08:59.285
<v Speaker 0>I'm sure someone's probably got some code on

00:08:59.285 --> 00:09:00.645
<v Speaker 0>Gout for this. Right?

00:09:06.005 --> 00:09:06.565
<v Speaker 0>We draw.

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:18.050
<v Speaker 0>There's a gleam.

00:09:24.504 --> 00:09:26.505
<v Speaker 0>Also, this is an actual thing.

00:09:28.425 --> 00:09:29.384
<v Speaker 0>What's your pricing?

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.740
<v Speaker 0>That reference another one. Right? Which I think

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.900
<v Speaker 0>thank you for that. I really like the

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.060
<v Speaker 0>new banner and profile logo too.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.380
<v Speaker 0>And we had the last branding since January,

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.060
<v Speaker 0>so just trying to keep things a bit

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:51.540
<v Speaker 0>more fresh.

00:09:53.675 --> 00:09:55.755
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So I did actually try to use

00:09:55.755 --> 00:09:56.555
<v Speaker 0>this one

00:09:57.275 --> 00:09:59.995
<v Speaker 0>and it didn't work. At least it made

00:09:59.995 --> 00:10:01.275
<v Speaker 0>me try to pay.

00:10:03.675 --> 00:10:05.915

<v Speaker 0>Hey.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:14.660
<v Speaker 0>What's that?

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:18.900
<v Speaker 0>Twitter, please.

00:10:21.785 --> 00:10:24.024
<v Speaker 0>I have authorized so many of these things.

00:10:24.024 --> 00:10:25.625
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna have to clean this up.

00:10:27.464 --> 00:10:28.505
<v Speaker 0>Sure.

00:10:30.745 --> 00:10:32.105
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:10:32.105 --> 00:10:33.225
<v Speaker 0>Check my email.

00:10:47.235 --> 00:10:49.475
<v Speaker 0>Important testing content. Yeah.

00:10:53.955 --> 00:10:55.235
<v Speaker 0>Contest name.

00:10:58.035 --> 00:10:59.235
<v Speaker 0>Competition

00:10:59.555 --> 00:11:01.395
<v Speaker 0>one. Because I'm sure I'll do more of

00:11:01.395 --> 00:11:01.635
<v Speaker 0>these.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:07.380
<v Speaker 0>For that, I've seen use

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.180
<v Speaker 0>woobox.com.

00:11:19.985 --> 00:11:21.585
<v Speaker 0>Just trying to get me to write something

00:11:21.585 --> 00:11:23.185
<v Speaker 0>here. I think that that's that's a really

00:11:23.185 --> 00:11:25.345
<v Speaker 0>cool idea for another stream

00:11:25.505 --> 00:11:28.625
<v Speaker 0>would be to write something for this because

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:30.690
<v Speaker 0>well, yeah, it would be fun. So I'm

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.090
<v Speaker 0>not gonna do it today right now, but,

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:34.290
<v Speaker 0>yeah, let's do that.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.610
<v Speaker 0>Because it'll give me an give

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:38.850
<v Speaker 0>me an opportunity to expand experiment with some

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.370
<v Speaker 0>new languages that we've able to play with

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:42.610
<v Speaker 0>anyway. SIG is one that I really wanna

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:43.810
<v Speaker 0>write something in, so this could be a

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:44.610
<v Speaker 0>cool idea for that.

00:11:45.385 --> 00:11:47.385
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's load our entries.

00:11:48.745 --> 00:11:50.904
<v Speaker 0>How many winners are they gonna be? So

00:11:50.904 --> 00:11:51.865
<v Speaker 0>I said 10,

00:11:52.584 --> 00:11:53.945
<v Speaker 0>and then I did see if I go

00:11:53.945 --> 00:11:55.545
<v Speaker 0>over a hundred retweets, it would be another

00:11:55.545 --> 00:11:57.785
<v Speaker 0>10. So there's gonna be 20 winners in

00:11:57.785 --> 00:11:59.464
<v Speaker 0>total, but I'm only gonna do 10 today,

00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:02.149
<v Speaker 0>and then we'll do another 10

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:04.709
<v Speaker 0>on Thursday or Friday. I'm thinking of doing

00:12:04.709 --> 00:12:07.750
<v Speaker 0>it maybe just before custard on Thursday.

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.389
<v Speaker 0>So, yes, there will be 20 winners in

00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:11.829
<v Speaker 0>total, but 10 today.

00:12:13.925 --> 00:12:15.845
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Load the entries.

00:12:16.245 --> 00:12:16.964
<v Speaker 0>I understand.

00:12:18.964 --> 00:12:21.285
<v Speaker 0>Once per contest. Yes. Well, this contest is

00:12:21.285 --> 00:12:22.565
<v Speaker 0>now over, so just

00:12:23.524 --> 00:12:25.045
<v Speaker 0>load. Hold me to load.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.640
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.000
<v Speaker 0>How do I

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.040
<v Speaker 0>draw?

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.760
<v Speaker 0>Is that what this button is? Not create,

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.440
<v Speaker 0>import, make a draw.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.120
<v Speaker 0>Competition one.

00:12:47.255 --> 00:12:48.214
<v Speaker 0>That's in.

00:12:54.695 --> 00:12:56.055
<v Speaker 0>Do all 23.

00:12:56.295 --> 00:12:58.135
<v Speaker 0>But I wanna get two streams out of

00:12:58.135 --> 00:12:58.375
<v Speaker 0>it.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.000
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.920
<v Speaker 0>Depends how long it takes.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.160
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Okay. We'll do them all. Oh, I

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:06.880
<v Speaker 0>can't.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.840
<v Speaker 0>I can do 10 because of this the

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.600
<v Speaker 0>free plan that allows me to do 10.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.865
<v Speaker 0>So we've already drawn five. So I can

00:13:13.865 --> 00:13:16.345
<v Speaker 0>do 10 now. And then we'll do five

00:13:16.345 --> 00:13:18.105
<v Speaker 0>during clustered. How about that?

00:13:23.464 --> 00:13:25.065
<v Speaker 0>Pop is excluded from winning.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.430
<v Speaker 0>You will not be allowed a t shirt.

00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:30.470
<v Speaker 0>Anchor is telling me to follow my plan.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.790
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I I think spun up with this

00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:34.070
<v Speaker 0>will be fun,

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:36.709
<v Speaker 0>but I know people wanna win prizes.

00:13:38.325 --> 00:13:39.925
<v Speaker 0>We'll we'll do the 10 that the software

00:13:39.925 --> 00:13:41.925
<v Speaker 0>allows me to do then. That's 15. We'll

00:13:41.925 --> 00:13:43.445
<v Speaker 0>do five during clustered.

00:13:44.325 --> 00:13:45.605
<v Speaker 0>That gives me a better time to try

00:13:45.605 --> 00:13:48.005
<v Speaker 0>and write something to make this fun too.

00:13:48.084 --> 00:13:50.245
<v Speaker 0>And there's gonna be more giveaways, so please

00:13:50.245 --> 00:13:52.660
<v Speaker 0>don't stress. Gonna be loads of opportunities to

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:54.740
<v Speaker 0>win t shirts. There'll be at least a

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:56.820
<v Speaker 0>couple of giveaway every week. So just, you

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.900

<v Speaker 0>Closing date.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:03.460
<v Speaker 0>Now

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:05.779
<v Speaker 0>the user must have a retweet publication.

00:14:07.595 --> 00:14:08.714
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

00:14:09.435 --> 00:14:11.355
<v Speaker 0>User must follow the no. You don't need

00:14:11.355 --> 00:14:12.875
<v Speaker 0>to follow me. If you retweeted, you can

00:14:12.875 --> 00:14:13.834
<v Speaker 0>you can win.

00:14:15.194 --> 00:14:17.274
<v Speaker 0>Russell's telling me just as if I'm right.

00:14:17.274 --> 00:14:19.435
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's do it. Let's stick

00:14:19.435 --> 00:14:20.394
<v Speaker 0>with the original plan.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.680
<v Speaker 0>Remind your checks allows you to take control

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.880
<v Speaker 0>of it or just before you decide on

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.440
<v Speaker 0>the winners after successfully passing our automatic checks.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.440
<v Speaker 0>I

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.904
<v Speaker 0>don't need to check anything.

00:14:35.985 --> 00:14:38.704
<v Speaker 0>If you reach, we see the when yes.

00:14:38.704 --> 00:14:40.545
<v Speaker 0>I don't want bots to win.

00:14:45.745 --> 00:14:46.945
<v Speaker 0>According to what?

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.820
<v Speaker 0>Sure. It seems like I don't have access

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.980
<v Speaker 0>to this feature. Right? Okay. But no.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.060
<v Speaker 0>That's it. Save.

00:15:08.275 --> 00:15:10.435
<v Speaker 0>The previous four were not legit due to

00:15:10.435 --> 00:15:12.035
<v Speaker 0>unequal probability.

00:15:17.955 --> 00:15:18.675
<v Speaker 0>True.

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:23.030
<v Speaker 0>Very true.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.190
<v Speaker 0>This got complicated quick this got complicated quickly.

00:15:40.145 --> 00:15:41.505
<v Speaker 0>They still retweeted the

00:15:43.105 --> 00:15:44.305
<v Speaker 0>yes. The odds

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:47.200
<v Speaker 0>were slightly skewed with the hundred retweets.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.800
<v Speaker 0>There was a 23

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.560
<v Speaker 0>retweets according to this.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.920
<v Speaker 0>The probability

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.240
<v Speaker 0>is effective, but I'm gonna go with it.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.560
<v Speaker 0>This is a learning. I'm now learning loads

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.855
<v Speaker 0>about giving Twitter giveaways now, so we're just

00:16:00.855 --> 00:16:02.135
<v Speaker 0>gonna have to deal with it for this

00:16:02.135 --> 00:16:04.695
<v Speaker 0>one and take it from there. Okay. Let's

00:16:04.695 --> 00:16:05.255
<v Speaker 0>draw.

00:16:05.575 --> 00:16:06.215
<v Speaker 0>So

00:16:07.975 --> 00:16:10.135
<v Speaker 0>the the test draw or final draw? The

00:16:10.135 --> 00:16:12.295
<v Speaker 0>test draw just be Ragen, have you your

00:16:12.295 --> 00:16:13.495
<v Speaker 0>name came up, but you weren't in the

00:16:13.495 --> 00:16:14.535
<v Speaker 0>final draw? That'd be funny.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.440
<v Speaker 0>Just give it to the people watching me

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.400
<v Speaker 0>live right there.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.560
<v Speaker 0>It's a great idea.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.480
<v Speaker 0>Let's see what happens. I understand I can

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.665
<v Speaker 0>only do this one final draw per contest

00:16:30.665 --> 00:16:32.265
<v Speaker 0>even if it's a test.

00:16:34.185 --> 00:16:37.385
<v Speaker 0>Yes. I will rate code for more runners.

00:16:39.704 --> 00:16:40.505
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

00:16:40.505 --> 00:16:42.505
<v Speaker 0>It does count quoted tweets

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.540
<v Speaker 0>because it's Twitter.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.860
<v Speaker 0>Is that a terrible assumption?

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.540
<v Speaker 0>Or it doesn't count quoted tweets because there

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:00.335
<v Speaker 0>were 22 quoted tweets and a 24

00:17:00.335 --> 00:17:01.935
<v Speaker 0>manual retweets.

00:17:02.175 --> 00:17:03.695
<v Speaker 0>How can I come and this is only

00:17:03.695 --> 00:17:04.895
<v Speaker 0>showing me a 23

00:17:04.895 --> 00:17:05.934
<v Speaker 0>retweets?

00:17:08.015 --> 00:17:10.255
<v Speaker 0>So, really, all this software is shit.

00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:13.270
<v Speaker 0>Well, Russell, you win. I am gonna have

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:15.510
<v Speaker 0>to write something. What I'm gonna do, I'm

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:17.510
<v Speaker 0>gonna honor the first five draws. I'm gonna

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:19.590
<v Speaker 0>honor the fives of this picks. We will

00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:21.830
<v Speaker 0>draw another 10 with software that I write,

00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:23.190
<v Speaker 0>hopefully, today or tomorrow.

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:25.430
<v Speaker 0>We'll give some OEM custard, and it says

00:17:25.454 --> 00:17:26.494
<v Speaker 0>and as I said

00:17:27.934 --> 00:17:28.575
<v Speaker 0>earlier,

00:17:28.735 --> 00:17:30.174
<v Speaker 0>I'm just gonna keep giving the stuff away

00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:31.294
<v Speaker 0>anyway. So

00:17:32.255 --> 00:17:33.774
<v Speaker 0>if you don't want today, you will want

00:17:33.774 --> 00:17:34.734
<v Speaker 0>better version.

00:17:37.455 --> 00:17:38.255
<v Speaker 0>Let's just do it.

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:47.630
<v Speaker 0>There are 13 people watching over there.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:52.670
<v Speaker 0>Not just on YouTube. I am streaming to

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:53.230
<v Speaker 0>Twitter too.

00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:56.624
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:17:58.145 --> 00:18:01.504
<v Speaker 0>Coop Daly can't win. That's an organization.

00:18:03.904 --> 00:18:04.784
<v Speaker 0>Oh, well.

00:18:06.385 --> 00:18:08.385
<v Speaker 0>Let's copy

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:08.669
<v Speaker 0>this.

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:17.789
<v Speaker 0>At least I've got the names there even

00:18:17.789 --> 00:18:19.630
<v Speaker 0>if there is a big annoying graphic.

00:18:26.715 --> 00:18:27.915
<v Speaker 0>Now

00:18:30.795 --> 00:18:31.995
<v Speaker 0>we have our winners.

00:18:33.195 --> 00:18:35.195
<v Speaker 0>I don't think anyone is on the stream

00:18:35.195 --> 00:18:35.675
<v Speaker 0>right now.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:37.789
<v Speaker 0>I'm sorry about that.

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:42.510
<v Speaker 0>That's a good call, Russell. Tell you what.

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:45.230
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Cube Daily can't win as an organization.

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:47.230
<v Speaker 0>I thought they did retweet, so really I

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:47.870
<v Speaker 0>should find that.

00:18:53.555 --> 00:18:54.835
<v Speaker 0>I get in here.

00:18:58.195 --> 00:19:01.075
<v Speaker 0>For Dan, post a link to your retweet

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.200
<v Speaker 0>in a chat or your Twitter username.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.720
<v Speaker 0>I'll get you a t shirt,

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.280
<v Speaker 0>and then we'll draw more names when we

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.400
<v Speaker 0>have some software.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.560
<v Speaker 0>If you didn't win,

00:19:15.424 --> 00:19:17.345
<v Speaker 0>don't worry. Like I said, there is gonna

00:19:17.345 --> 00:19:18.945
<v Speaker 0>be a couple of t shirts every week

00:19:18.945 --> 00:19:21.424
<v Speaker 0>and mugs given away. So, you know,

00:19:21.905 --> 00:19:23.345
<v Speaker 0>watch the streams.

00:19:23.985 --> 00:19:25.825
<v Speaker 0>Curious man. Thank you for that.

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:33.070
<v Speaker 0>You will you

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:35.149
<v Speaker 0>will get one too.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:38.750
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I'm gonna call it there. This was

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:39.950
<v Speaker 0>an absolute

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:41.070
<v Speaker 0>disaster.

00:19:46.675 --> 00:19:49.875
<v Speaker 0>Bill Mulligan one. I am sure Bill will

00:19:50.115 --> 00:19:51.635
<v Speaker 0>allow me to redraw

00:19:52.195 --> 00:19:52.915
<v Speaker 0>his

00:19:54.675 --> 00:19:55.075
<v Speaker 0>So

00:19:56.115 --> 00:19:56.595
<v Speaker 0>yeah.

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.510
<v Speaker 0>Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. You're getting a code

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:06.230
<v Speaker 0>to stream.

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.630
<v Speaker 0>So it seems I mean, I'm gonna do

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:10.550
<v Speaker 0>a quick search on GitHub. There someone has

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:11.510
<v Speaker 0>to have written this already.

00:20:12.565 --> 00:20:13.684
<v Speaker 0>This is just

00:20:14.085 --> 00:20:15.684
<v Speaker 0>this this should be so easy.

00:20:15.925 --> 00:20:17.685
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I know the Twitter API

00:20:17.685 --> 00:20:19.685
<v Speaker 0>gets a bad rap because there are so

00:20:19.685 --> 00:20:21.525
<v Speaker 0>many constraints on it, being able to pull

00:20:21.525 --> 00:20:23.205
<v Speaker 0>out retweets, pick pick

00:20:23.445 --> 00:20:24.485
<v Speaker 0>some at random

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.130
<v Speaker 0>Should be easier than this. So, yeah, we're

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:28.570
<v Speaker 0>gonna have some fun. And maybe we'll do

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:30.490
<v Speaker 0>this cloud native and over engineer the heck

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.970
<v Speaker 0>out of it. Half as a microservice that,

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:33.610
<v Speaker 0>you know,

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:35.930
<v Speaker 0>fills out retweets, puts them on to an

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:38.170
<v Speaker 0>event queue and blah blah blah. Maybe maybe

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:39.450
<v Speaker 0>we can have some fun.

00:20:40.345 --> 00:20:41.705
<v Speaker 0>Like I said, if you don't want today,

00:20:41.705 --> 00:20:43.625
<v Speaker 0>more coming soon. Thank you for watching this

00:20:43.625 --> 00:20:46.664
<v Speaker 0>completely random car crash of a stream.

00:20:47.945 --> 00:20:49.784
<v Speaker 0>But it's always fun to chat, and the

00:20:49.784 --> 00:20:52.105
<v Speaker 0>comments were great. They've been my day. So

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:56.060
<v Speaker 0>have a awesome day. There's no stream today

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.820
<v Speaker 0>on the Rawkode Academy, but we do have

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.220
<v Speaker 0>a team version of Clustered tomorrow. So we

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.260
<v Speaker 0>will see you then and I will be

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.019
<v Speaker 0>giving away more t shirts tomorrow.

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:04.059
<v Speaker 0>Anyway,

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.220
<v Speaker 0>you're all wonderful. Have a great day.
