00:01:43.755 --> 00:01:44.635
<v Speaker 0>Hello,

00:01:44.635 --> 00:01:47.195
<v Speaker 0>and welcome back to the Rawkode Academy.

00:01:47.435 --> 00:01:49.354
<v Speaker 0>Today is an episode of Rawkode Live, a

00:01:49.354 --> 00:01:50.795
<v Speaker 0>show where we take a look at open

00:01:50.795 --> 00:01:53.110
<v Speaker 0>source projects that are joined by contributors and

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.990
<v Speaker 0>maintainers,

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.670
<v Speaker 0>and people that work for the companies that

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.430
<v Speaker 0>power the open source to show you lots

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.110
<v Speaker 0>of cool and interesting things.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.270
<v Speaker 0>And today, we are doing a follow-up to

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.350
<v Speaker 0>the Teleport course where we're taking a look

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.750
<v Speaker 0>to see what is new in Teleport 10.

00:02:06.375 --> 00:02:08.135
<v Speaker 0>How they manage to ship so many releases

00:02:08.135 --> 00:02:10.615
<v Speaker 0>so frequently, I'm not entirely sure, but we're

00:02:10.615 --> 00:02:12.775
<v Speaker 0>gonna cover all of the goodness that has

00:02:12.775 --> 00:02:14.135
<v Speaker 0>came out just this week.

00:02:14.535 --> 00:02:16.055
<v Speaker 0>And I'm

00:02:16.055 --> 00:02:18.615
<v Speaker 0>going to be joined by a friendly face

00:02:18.615 --> 00:02:21.170
<v Speaker 0>we've seen before, Ben Abbott. Hey, man. How's

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.810
<v Speaker 0>it going?

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Good. Thanks for having me, David. Always a

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.770
<v Speaker 0>pleasure. Happy to have you here. For anyone

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.850
<v Speaker 0>who hasn't seen our previous streams together, can

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.209
<v Speaker 0>you give us a little bit of an

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.490
<v Speaker 0>introduction into who is Ben?

00:02:32.145 --> 00:02:34.785
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Hi. I'm Ben Arendt. I'm a developer

00:02:34.785 --> 00:02:36.865
<v Speaker 1>relations manager at Teleport.

00:02:37.345 --> 00:02:40.385
<v Speaker 1>And, actually, I've been at Teleport three years.

00:02:40.465 --> 00:02:42.385
<v Speaker 1>So I think I've seen it just from

00:02:42.385 --> 00:02:44.785
<v Speaker 1>three to ten. And so in a similar

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.490
<v Speaker 1>trajectory. We've actually got more mature in our

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.690
<v Speaker 1>deployment cycle. And so we only

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.050
<v Speaker 1>we now launch new versions every three months.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.850
<v Speaker 1>So it keeps David up to date. And

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm really excited to sort of go over

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.785
<v Speaker 1>Teleport 10 and some of changes that we

00:03:01.785 --> 00:03:03.705
<v Speaker 1>have in this release, which

00:03:04.025 --> 00:03:06.745
<v Speaker 1>we always say each release is our biggest

00:03:06.745 --> 00:03:08.825
<v Speaker 1>release ever and just keeps on getting bigger

00:03:08.825 --> 00:03:09.545
<v Speaker 1>and bigger.

00:03:09.945 --> 00:03:12.345
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. When I started my Teleport course, I'm

00:03:12.345 --> 00:03:14.745
<v Speaker 0>pretty sure we're Teleport five or six, and

00:03:14.745 --> 00:03:16.940
<v Speaker 0>now we're already on to 10. Like, there's

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 0>so many cool new features coming out all

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.740
<v Speaker 0>the time. So it's really nice that we

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.500
<v Speaker 0>get to sit down together and just kinda

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.940
<v Speaker 0>share these with people as well.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:26.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And I think,

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.140
<v Speaker 1>you know, just like a meta side point,

00:03:31.045 --> 00:03:31.685
<v Speaker 1>like,

00:03:32.084 --> 00:03:33.525
<v Speaker 1>as we've become more mature, we have, a

00:03:33.525 --> 00:03:36.405
<v Speaker 1>good upgrading page, but always important to keep

00:03:36.405 --> 00:03:38.805
<v Speaker 1>your software updated with latest patches. And we

00:03:38.805 --> 00:03:41.445
<v Speaker 1>do do security patches on older ones,

00:03:41.685 --> 00:03:44.805
<v Speaker 1>and we have sort of specific documentation around

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.000
<v Speaker 1>how to upgrade between nine and ten and,

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.480
<v Speaker 1>like, end of life cycle. So I think

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.120
<v Speaker 1>you are still fine running Teleport seven in

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.160
<v Speaker 1>production because

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.560
<v Speaker 1>more mature organizations,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.160
<v Speaker 1>you know, it takes time to roll out

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.840
<v Speaker 1>the latest ones. But I'm excited to a

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.635
<v Speaker 1>deep dive into Teleport 10 and all of

00:04:01.635 --> 00:04:03.315
<v Speaker 1>the interesting new additions that we have.

00:04:03.875 --> 00:04:05.475
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'm I'm sitting here going through my

00:04:05.475 --> 00:04:06.675
<v Speaker 0>head trying to work out whether I call

00:04:06.675 --> 00:04:07.795
<v Speaker 0>it the fact that you said do do

00:04:07.795 --> 00:04:09.075
<v Speaker 0>or not, but I I'm gonna leave it

00:04:09.075 --> 00:04:10.675
<v Speaker 0>at just that. So

00:04:12.115 --> 00:04:14.275
<v Speaker 0>you're not even laughing. That that was funny.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:15.730
<v Speaker 1>I

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.890
<v Speaker 1>actually didn't get it. Think it's accent.

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:19.890
<v Speaker 0>Scottish.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.130
<v Speaker 0>Scottish jokes already.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.770
<v Speaker 0>Five

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.450
<v Speaker 0>minutes in. Alright. It's all good.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.945
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So Teleport is continually shipping. I think

00:04:29.945 --> 00:04:31.705
<v Speaker 0>it's important to call it. Yeah. Like, they're

00:04:31.705 --> 00:04:34.025
<v Speaker 0>moving at c month velocity of releases, but,

00:04:34.025 --> 00:04:35.785
<v Speaker 0>you know, for most organ or for certain

00:04:35.785 --> 00:04:38.105
<v Speaker 0>enterprise sized organizations, you may not be moving

00:04:38.105 --> 00:04:40.105
<v Speaker 0>at the exact same pace as Teleport, but,

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.580
<v Speaker 0>you know, there's a lot of I'm assuming

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.500
<v Speaker 0>all of your releases are covered for a

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.220
<v Speaker 0>certain

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.420
<v Speaker 0>amount of time. Like, people on Teleport seven,

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.100
<v Speaker 0>as you said, are still supported. They're still

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.420
<v Speaker 0>getting security patches and so forth. So that's

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:53.775
<v Speaker 0>really cool. Maybe

00:04:54.414 --> 00:04:55.215
<v Speaker 0>we

00:04:55.215 --> 00:04:58.255
<v Speaker 0>should start with a bit of a summary

00:04:58.255 --> 00:05:00.815
<v Speaker 0>then of what Teleport 10

00:05:00.815 --> 00:05:03.055
<v Speaker 0>brings to the table. You said it's the

00:05:03.294 --> 00:05:05.055
<v Speaker 0>your biggest release yet. What

00:05:05.375 --> 00:05:06.895
<v Speaker 0>what what have we got on Teleport 10

00:05:06.895 --> 00:05:07.134
<v Speaker 0>then?

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So I think our sort of

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.070
<v Speaker 1>landmark feature for Teleport 10 is passwordless access

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.150
<v Speaker 1>as a

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:17.590
<v Speaker 1>sort of

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.270
<v Speaker 1>new like, it is an authentication method for

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.205
<v Speaker 1>Teleport, you know, get into the UI and

00:05:23.205 --> 00:05:25.205
<v Speaker 1>the CLI. But it also, I think, goes

00:05:25.205 --> 00:05:26.245
<v Speaker 1>beyond just

00:05:26.805 --> 00:05:29.764
<v Speaker 1>a new fancy authentication method, and it's really

00:05:29.764 --> 00:05:33.445
<v Speaker 1>our push to try to remove passwords from

00:05:33.445 --> 00:05:34.005
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.550
<v Speaker 1>And when we talk about passwords at Teleport,

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.030
<v Speaker 1>we're mainly talking about

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:43.950
<v Speaker 1>things that

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.590
<v Speaker 1>like, one, like, they may be passwords, but

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.830
<v Speaker 1>they're also, like, long lived secrets. And so

00:05:49.065 --> 00:05:50.825
<v Speaker 1>let's say when you set up SSH as

00:05:50.825 --> 00:05:52.505
<v Speaker 1>an example, the first thing you do is

00:05:52.505 --> 00:05:54.985
<v Speaker 1>you, like, turn off password based authentication,

00:05:55.145 --> 00:05:57.545
<v Speaker 1>and you add public private key authentication.

00:05:58.425 --> 00:06:01.785
<v Speaker 1>But the private key is also a secret,

00:06:01.785 --> 00:06:03.710
<v Speaker 1>which is almost kinda like a password. And

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.870
<v Speaker 1>so it's also open to attacks of,

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:07.950
<v Speaker 1>like, exfiltration.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.910
<v Speaker 1>It's also relatively long lived. It could be,

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.030
<v Speaker 1>like, hard to cycle.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.430
<v Speaker 1>And so, you know, Teleport solved that problem

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.710
<v Speaker 1>initially by just

00:06:16.175 --> 00:06:17.455
<v Speaker 1>creating a

00:06:17.695 --> 00:06:18.335
<v Speaker 1>certificate

00:06:19.455 --> 00:06:20.095
<v Speaker 1>CA.

00:06:21.135 --> 00:06:22.415
<v Speaker 1>Yes. Not certificate authority

00:06:23.295 --> 00:06:24.095
<v Speaker 1>for

00:06:24.735 --> 00:06:27.535
<v Speaker 1>your, like, SSH certs, which you can do

00:06:27.535 --> 00:06:28.815
<v Speaker 1>with open SSH.

00:06:28.975 --> 00:06:31.920
<v Speaker 1>But open if you manage your own certificate

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.720
<v Speaker 1>authority,

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.560
<v Speaker 1>it can be difficult to do the data

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.520
<v Speaker 1>operations such as the rotation, the management,

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.000
<v Speaker 1>if you want to back it by a

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.920
<v Speaker 1>HSM or other device.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.840
<v Speaker 1>All of that is sort of on you

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.280
<v Speaker 1>to manage and maintain.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.160
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.764
<v Speaker 1>And as we've sort of strengthened the certificate

00:06:49.764 --> 00:06:52.085
<v Speaker 1>authority, we've also looked to strengthen,

00:06:53.444 --> 00:06:55.284
<v Speaker 1>you know, and remove the password from the

00:06:55.284 --> 00:06:56.085
<v Speaker 1>end user.

00:06:56.564 --> 00:06:59.125
<v Speaker 1>And so the passwordless access,

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.320
<v Speaker 1>well, obviously, has no password. It also has

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.680
<v Speaker 1>no username

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:05.880
<v Speaker 1>as well.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.920
<v Speaker 1>And both the user it's username less and

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.640
<v Speaker 1>password less. So the experience

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.880
<v Speaker 1>for an end developer is

00:07:14.175 --> 00:07:18.415
<v Speaker 1>during the registration process, you register your device,

00:07:18.735 --> 00:07:20.015
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a

00:07:20.415 --> 00:07:23.455
<v Speaker 1>touch ID with Mac, it could be a

00:07:23.455 --> 00:07:25.855
<v Speaker 1>like a YubiKey, which I have here,

00:07:26.095 --> 00:07:27.215
<v Speaker 1>or it could be Windows Hello.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:31.010
<v Speaker 1>And all of these passwordless devices

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:32.130
<v Speaker 1>combine

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.050
<v Speaker 1>some form of, like, biometrics. So you have,

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.890
<v Speaker 1>like, Touch ID on Mac, but also the

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:38.690
<v Speaker 1>secure

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.650
<v Speaker 1>Encave on Mac or TPM

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:42.530
<v Speaker 1>on

00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:43.715
<v Speaker 1>Windows.

00:07:44.115 --> 00:07:46.115
<v Speaker 1>And it's that combination of

00:07:47.794 --> 00:07:50.754
<v Speaker 1>that passwordless access, which is sort of also

00:07:50.754 --> 00:07:52.675
<v Speaker 1>kinda, like, hidden from you,

00:07:53.474 --> 00:07:55.955
<v Speaker 1>supports this sort of new flow

00:07:56.275 --> 00:07:57.875
<v Speaker 1>of Yeah. Access infrastructure.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.270
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. You're you're right. We're in a very

00:08:01.629 --> 00:08:04.349
<v Speaker 0>gray age of personal computing where we do

00:08:04.349 --> 00:08:06.030
<v Speaker 0>have the secure enclave on our Mac, and

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.110
<v Speaker 0>we have TPMs, we've got YubiKeys, and all

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.270
<v Speaker 0>these other things that try to improve our

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.345
<v Speaker 0>security. And it's nice that we're kind of

00:08:12.345 --> 00:08:14.264
<v Speaker 0>seeing Teleport go on a on a journey.

00:08:14.264 --> 00:08:16.505
<v Speaker 0>Was it Teleport nine? You brought out machine

00:08:16.505 --> 00:08:18.345
<v Speaker 0>ID and the ability to kinda improve that

00:08:18.345 --> 00:08:20.025
<v Speaker 0>machine to machine communication,

00:08:20.345 --> 00:08:22.264
<v Speaker 0>and now you're removing the passwords from the

00:08:22.264 --> 00:08:23.465
<v Speaker 0>human element of it as well,

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.880
<v Speaker 0>which is cool. Is it I I have

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.000
<v Speaker 0>I might be

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.720
<v Speaker 0>very naive here. Is this using web auth

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.360
<v Speaker 0>end? Is that what powers the passwordless approach

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.320
<v Speaker 0>for Teleport?

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:37.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's you know, we added

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.799
<v Speaker 1>web auth end in,

00:08:39.315 --> 00:08:42.115
<v Speaker 1>I think, Teleport nine, and we moved off

00:08:42.115 --> 00:08:42.995
<v Speaker 1>U2F.

00:08:42.995 --> 00:08:45.795
<v Speaker 1>And actually, we joined the FIDO Alliance,

00:08:45.875 --> 00:08:48.755
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of a industry body for

00:08:49.075 --> 00:08:50.435
<v Speaker 1>generally, we were moving,

00:08:50.915 --> 00:08:52.515
<v Speaker 1>like, moving to passwordless.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:56.730
<v Speaker 1>And

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:58.890
<v Speaker 1>I forget we have, like, a blog post

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:00.890
<v Speaker 1>coming on all the technical stages that

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.770
<v Speaker 1>differ between, like, web app then. And, actually,

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:05.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking of working one too because

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.330
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the work has been done

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.490
<v Speaker 1>focused on clients and browsers,

00:09:11.185 --> 00:09:14.305
<v Speaker 1>but not necessarily that much on developer tooling.

00:09:15.024 --> 00:09:15.665
<v Speaker 1>And,

00:09:16.704 --> 00:09:20.065
<v Speaker 1>you know, we let's to support Touch ID

00:09:20.785 --> 00:09:23.105
<v Speaker 1>in the Mac in the terminal requires us

00:09:23.105 --> 00:09:25.185
<v Speaker 1>to use certain changes in our build. And

00:09:25.185 --> 00:09:27.290
<v Speaker 1>so, actually, if you use touch ID on

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:29.930
<v Speaker 1>Mac, you see if you're using if you

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:31.690
<v Speaker 1>have, like, the touch bar, you actually, like,

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:32.250
<v Speaker 1>see

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:35.690
<v Speaker 1>the Teleport icon because it's also to make

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:36.730
<v Speaker 1>it work on Mac, it has to be,

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:38.410
<v Speaker 1>like, specially notarized for it to work. So

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:39.850
<v Speaker 1>we've done a whole bunch of work behind

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:42.335
<v Speaker 1>the scenes. But for the end user experience,

00:09:42.335 --> 00:09:43.695
<v Speaker 1>you just, like, tap the thing, and it

00:09:43.695 --> 00:09:45.535
<v Speaker 1>just sort works out of the box. Very

00:09:45.535 --> 00:09:48.175
<v Speaker 0>cool. Now I'm sure you're not prepared for

00:09:48.175 --> 00:09:49.375
<v Speaker 0>this question, but I feel the urge to

00:09:49.375 --> 00:09:50.335
<v Speaker 0>ask it anyway.

00:09:50.735 --> 00:09:52.815
<v Speaker 0>So will it work with my Apple Watch?

00:09:52.895 --> 00:09:54.735
<v Speaker 0>Because I can, like, fiddle my privileges with

00:09:54.735 --> 00:09:56.735
<v Speaker 0>my Apple Watch, and I'm wondering if that

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.780
<v Speaker 0>prompt is gonna come to it, and I

00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.060
<v Speaker 0>could log in to my machines with my

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.820
<v Speaker 0>watch. That would make me very happy then.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.140
<v Speaker 1>We were chatting about this actually, like, the

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.260
<v Speaker 1>day after the release,

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.900
<v Speaker 1>and I think it should work. I Alan,

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.300
<v Speaker 1>who did the development on it, has, a

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.695
<v Speaker 1>dev build. Yeah.

00:10:10.855 --> 00:10:13.175
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have an Apple Watch. So

00:10:13.654 --> 00:10:16.214
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited to try it. I mean, I've

00:10:16.214 --> 00:10:19.095
<v Speaker 1>tried actually have like a Logitech webcam here.

00:10:19.095 --> 00:10:19.575
<v Speaker 1>Well,

00:10:20.214 --> 00:10:22.454
<v Speaker 0>you had one. No. I had one. This

00:10:22.454 --> 00:10:23.014
<v Speaker 1>one.

00:10:23.334 --> 00:10:25.894
<v Speaker 1>And what's kind of interesting with

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.940
<v Speaker 1>the webcam is like the password, the, like,

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:30.820
<v Speaker 1>the biometrics

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.140
<v Speaker 1>in it isn't on the camera. It's actually

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.899
<v Speaker 1>in the infrared sensor, which is why you

00:10:34.899 --> 00:10:36.020
<v Speaker 1>need an extra camera.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:37.779
<v Speaker 0>Ah, okay.

00:10:38.525 --> 00:10:40.925
<v Speaker 1>So it's not just like your face. I

00:10:40.925 --> 00:10:42.605
<v Speaker 1>think it has like a IR array that

00:10:42.605 --> 00:10:44.845
<v Speaker 1>measures sort of depth and other details to

00:10:44.845 --> 00:10:46.525
<v Speaker 1>make the biometrics more secure.

00:10:47.885 --> 00:10:49.405
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you like, Windows Hello

00:10:49.405 --> 00:10:51.565
<v Speaker 1>is actually pretty awesome if you own the

00:10:51.565 --> 00:10:52.285
<v Speaker 1>Windows ecosystem.

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:55.670
<v Speaker 0>I'm afraid Lennox and Mac is is is

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.910
<v Speaker 0>all I use, really. I do think what

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:59.430
<v Speaker 0>they've done with Windows 11 is quite cool,

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:00.870
<v Speaker 0>and I keep trying I I keep meaning

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.470
<v Speaker 0>to install it on an old machine and

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:04.950
<v Speaker 0>and play with WSL two more, but it's

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:06.710
<v Speaker 0>just time. I just haven't had the time.

00:11:07.635 --> 00:11:10.115
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I've not tried it, but with the

00:11:10.115 --> 00:11:10.915
<v Speaker 1>announcement,

00:11:10.915 --> 00:11:13.235
<v Speaker 1>someone said Windows Hello did work with Windows

00:11:13.235 --> 00:11:16.115
<v Speaker 1>subsystem of Linux as well. And so support

00:11:16.115 --> 00:11:17.715
<v Speaker 1>is pretty broad. Yeah.

00:11:18.835 --> 00:11:20.435
<v Speaker 1>And I think before we dive too deep,

00:11:20.435 --> 00:11:20.675
<v Speaker 1>you know,

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:22.860
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that sort of fixes

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.300
<v Speaker 1>is there's a sort of whole range of

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.740
<v Speaker 1>attacks that sort of go away.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.899
<v Speaker 1>There's no longer any cookie to take. You're

00:11:29.899 --> 00:11:30.940
<v Speaker 1>not open to phishing.

00:11:33.755 --> 00:11:36.075
<v Speaker 1>You you know, it just removes, like, password

00:11:36.075 --> 00:11:37.915
<v Speaker 1>reuse and all these other sort of problems.

00:11:38.315 --> 00:11:38.875
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:11:39.275 --> 00:11:41.435
<v Speaker 0>I think we're both fan and Surrounding Technologies

00:11:41.435 --> 00:11:42.875
<v Speaker 0>and the work of the FIDO Alliance is

00:11:42.875 --> 00:11:45.115
<v Speaker 0>is is awesome because, you know, I I

00:11:45.115 --> 00:11:47.675
<v Speaker 0>can you know, my in laws, my parents,

00:11:47.675 --> 00:11:49.970
<v Speaker 0>my wife, my friends, none of them use

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:52.769
<v Speaker 0>password managers. They just use the same password

00:11:52.769 --> 00:11:54.610
<v Speaker 0>everywhere. It's very common. At least, maybe I

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.529
<v Speaker 0>I don't know. It it feels like in

00:11:56.529 --> 00:11:57.649
<v Speaker 0>my life and the people I know, it's

00:11:57.649 --> 00:11:59.250
<v Speaker 0>very common where they just have these crappy

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:01.570
<v Speaker 0>passwords. And but they can all use the

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:04.130
<v Speaker 0>fingerprint scanner or the biometric face scanner for

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:06.665
<v Speaker 0>Apple Wallet and Google Pay and stuff. So,

00:12:06.665 --> 00:12:09.225
<v Speaker 0>like, the more that we push these secure

00:12:09.225 --> 00:12:11.385
<v Speaker 0>biometric devices to be the way that we

00:12:11.385 --> 00:12:13.705
<v Speaker 0>identify with web services and other services. I

00:12:13.705 --> 00:12:16.505
<v Speaker 0>think this is really, really important for securing

00:12:16.505 --> 00:12:17.930
<v Speaker 0>all of this stuff. So

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:22.490
<v Speaker 1>the Fighter Alliance or Google,

00:12:23.209 --> 00:12:24.010
<v Speaker 1>Microsoft,

00:12:24.649 --> 00:12:26.890
<v Speaker 1>and Apple came with pass keys,

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:30.010
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of another variant on passwordless,

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:32.315
<v Speaker 1>which you'll probably be seeing more of. But

00:12:32.315 --> 00:12:34.235
<v Speaker 1>passkeys are sort of interesting because a lot

00:12:34.235 --> 00:12:36.875
<v Speaker 1>of the key it's good for your, let's

00:12:36.875 --> 00:12:38.635
<v Speaker 1>say, your parents, but a lot of the

00:12:38.635 --> 00:12:40.795
<v Speaker 1>key material also goes into, like, a central

00:12:40.795 --> 00:12:43.995
<v Speaker 1>Apple server. And so you can use passkeys

00:12:43.995 --> 00:12:44.395
<v Speaker 1>across

00:12:45.639 --> 00:12:48.040
<v Speaker 1>operating systems and across browsers,

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.880
<v Speaker 1>which has kind of been a slow transition.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:50.920
<v Speaker 1>But

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.880
<v Speaker 1>for sort of infrastructure companies, you may not

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.240
<v Speaker 1>necessarily want your, like, IDP to be one

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.825
<v Speaker 1>of the big three, let's say.

00:12:59.145 --> 00:13:00.505
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's kind of where having,

00:13:00.505 --> 00:13:03.225
<v Speaker 1>like, YubiKeys, for example, are a great

00:13:04.345 --> 00:13:06.265
<v Speaker 1>solution for it. Yeah.

00:13:06.505 --> 00:13:08.825
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We do have a question in the

00:13:08.825 --> 00:13:10.905
<v Speaker 0>chat from Kartik.

00:13:11.385 --> 00:13:13.260
<v Speaker 0>And I think I'll probably be able to

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.779
<v Speaker 0>get the answer to this, but they're asking

00:13:14.779 --> 00:13:17.100
<v Speaker 0>how do I upgrade to Teleport 10?

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.899
<v Speaker 0>Now I'm hoping that they've just added the

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:20.860
<v Speaker 0>app repository,

00:13:21.019 --> 00:13:22.940
<v Speaker 0>and they can just run an app upgrade.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.580
<v Speaker 0>Right? Is that the the easiest way?

00:13:26.375 --> 00:13:29.255
<v Speaker 1>Yes. We have a full upgrade procedure, so

00:13:29.255 --> 00:13:30.855
<v Speaker 1>we do recommend backing up,

00:13:32.615 --> 00:13:34.855
<v Speaker 1>you know, backing up your auth server, any

00:13:34.855 --> 00:13:36.375
<v Speaker 1>other logs just as a

00:13:36.855 --> 00:13:37.654
<v Speaker 1>standard practice.

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:40.990
<v Speaker 1>You know, if you have a fresh cluster,

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:42.430
<v Speaker 1>if you just do a standard app, you'll

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:44.590
<v Speaker 1>just get Teleport 10 out of the box.

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:47.070
<v Speaker 1>And actually, we have versioned it now. So

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:51.165
<v Speaker 1>you can go online on nine or 10,

00:13:51.165 --> 00:13:52.525
<v Speaker 1>and you can pick your streams to automatically

00:13:52.525 --> 00:13:54.365
<v Speaker 1>upgrade those versions because it was Sure. It

00:13:54.365 --> 00:13:56.285
<v Speaker 1>used to previously pick the previous one. So

00:13:56.285 --> 00:13:59.405
<v Speaker 1>it's another nice sort of developer experience.

00:14:01.005 --> 00:14:02.765
<v Speaker 1>But, yeah, to check out documentation, we have

00:14:02.765 --> 00:14:04.525
<v Speaker 1>docs on sort of how to upgrade it.

00:14:04.525 --> 00:14:07.050
<v Speaker 1>But, generally, it's pretty much drop and

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:09.530
<v Speaker 1>go. You should be fine.

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:12.170
<v Speaker 1>Alright. There is, like, if you change like,

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:13.610
<v Speaker 1>if you look at our release notes, we

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:14.090
<v Speaker 1>have

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:16.490
<v Speaker 1>probably some depreciated things. Like, if you're using

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:19.210
<v Speaker 1>a u two f, that's depreciated intent. But

00:14:18.755 --> 00:14:20.995
<v Speaker 1>these are mainly, like, edge cases that you

00:14:20.995 --> 00:14:22.595
<v Speaker 1>will unlikely to encounter.

00:14:23.955 --> 00:14:26.035
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So we still got more stuff to

00:14:26.035 --> 00:14:27.875
<v Speaker 0>talk about this new Intelliport 10. Before we

00:14:27.875 --> 00:14:29.235
<v Speaker 0>do that, we'll just handle a couple of

00:14:29.235 --> 00:14:29.875
<v Speaker 0>the hellos.

00:14:30.195 --> 00:14:31.555
<v Speaker 0>Thanks for joining us.

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:36.250
<v Speaker 0>Rawkode is here too, and Eddie is interested

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:39.530
<v Speaker 0>in Apple Watches everywhere. So awesome. Hey. Eddie's

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:40.730
<v Speaker 0>trying to do my job for me now.

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:42.250
<v Speaker 0>He's like, hey. Everyone should follow-up this video.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:44.410
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. You totally should. Please I know. I

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:45.690
<v Speaker 1>mean, I think I'm going to get Eddie

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:47.130
<v Speaker 1>in the future, so I think we'll get

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:49.265
<v Speaker 1>the Apple Watch build for Eddie. And,

00:14:50.704 --> 00:14:52.545
<v Speaker 1>actually, I was trying on my iPad too,

00:14:52.545 --> 00:14:54.065
<v Speaker 1>but I wasn't able to register my face

00:14:54.065 --> 00:14:56.145
<v Speaker 1>ID, but that should technically work as well.

00:14:56.945 --> 00:14:59.024
<v Speaker 0>Sweet. Well, lots of things to experiment with

00:14:59.024 --> 00:14:59.985
<v Speaker 0>there. Now

00:15:00.225 --> 00:15:02.120
<v Speaker 0>there's more things in this release, and I

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.760
<v Speaker 0>do have the watch new IntelliPortem blog here.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.120
<v Speaker 0>So maybe we could scroll through this, and

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.400
<v Speaker 0>you can give us a bit of a

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.160
<v Speaker 0>an introduction to the other stuff that's listed

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.040
<v Speaker 0>here. So we've covered password list. I don't

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.160
<v Speaker 0>know if there is anything else you wanna

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.840
<v Speaker 0>add or we'll skip right past this, but

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.165
<v Speaker 0>there's also a nice little video there where

00:15:17.165 --> 00:15:18.605
<v Speaker 0>people could check that out too.

00:15:19.885 --> 00:15:21.565
<v Speaker 0>The next thing on the list, and I'll

00:15:21.565 --> 00:15:23.325
<v Speaker 0>make this a little bit bigger for people,

00:15:23.325 --> 00:15:26.365
<v Speaker 0>is enhanced access control. You wanna give us

00:15:26.365 --> 00:15:27.805
<v Speaker 0>a little bit of information on this?

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.000
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you still there?

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.320
<v Speaker 0>I'm on my own.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:39.840
<v Speaker 0>Ben, don't leave me, Ben.

00:15:46.465 --> 00:15:48.145
<v Speaker 0>We'll get Ben just a moment. I hope

00:15:48.145 --> 00:15:49.105
<v Speaker 0>he comes back.

00:15:53.185 --> 00:15:55.265
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, while we wait for Ben, we

00:15:55.265 --> 00:15:57.665
<v Speaker 0>have an active Discord server. If you want

00:15:57.665 --> 00:16:00.620
<v Speaker 0>to come and chat technology with over 1,200

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.900
<v Speaker 0>people, you can join a Academy Discord. It's

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.300
<v Speaker 0>available at Rawkode.chat.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.940
<v Speaker 0>We have channels on Kubernetes,

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:13.660
<v Speaker 0>Cloud Native, Teleport, Pulumi, GetOp, Continuous Delivery, Rust,

00:16:14.214 --> 00:16:16.455
<v Speaker 0>Contrail, one of my open source projects.

00:16:16.615 --> 00:16:18.615
<v Speaker 0>We're just a group of people that just

00:16:18.615 --> 00:16:21.095
<v Speaker 0>love to sit and talk about technology. So

00:16:21.095 --> 00:16:23.575
<v Speaker 0>feel free to pop into the Rawkode Academy

00:16:23.575 --> 00:16:25.575
<v Speaker 0>Discord at Rawkode.chat.

00:16:25.975 --> 00:16:28.055
<v Speaker 0>And as Eddie said in the comments, remember

00:16:28.055 --> 00:16:29.095
<v Speaker 0>to sum up the video.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:31.270
<v Speaker 0>We're hoping that Ben will be back in

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.110
<v Speaker 0>just a minute because he was gonna drive

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:36.070
<v Speaker 0>the demo. However, if we need to, I

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:37.670
<v Speaker 0>will make up my own demo. I do

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:38.230
<v Speaker 0>have

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:42.230
<v Speaker 0>a single load Teleport cluster ready and waiting

00:16:42.435 --> 00:16:43.795
<v Speaker 0>for me to try and work out how

00:16:43.795 --> 00:16:46.355
<v Speaker 0>to enable password authentication with my Apple Watch.

00:16:46.595 --> 00:16:47.075
<v Speaker 0>So

00:16:51.154 --> 00:16:52.675
<v Speaker 0>can't you leave? I can't believe he left

00:16:52.675 --> 00:16:53.154
<v Speaker 0>me, Ben.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.220
<v Speaker 0>He's not coming back, is he?

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:57.820
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.699
<v Speaker 0>So let's see what is enhanced access control.

00:17:00.699 --> 00:17:03.579
<v Speaker 0>Well, apparently, this is resource access request and

00:17:03.579 --> 00:17:04.460
<v Speaker 0>preview.

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:07.260
<v Speaker 0>This is just in time access request to

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.115
<v Speaker 0>allow any developer to request access to a

00:17:10.115 --> 00:17:12.034
<v Speaker 0>resource or role depending on the need. Oh,

00:17:12.034 --> 00:17:14.514
<v Speaker 0>nice. So this is something that I think

00:17:14.514 --> 00:17:16.355
<v Speaker 0>was maybe available previously

00:17:16.355 --> 00:17:17.474
<v Speaker 0>in Teleport.

00:17:17.474 --> 00:17:19.154
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure if it's just been modified

00:17:19.154 --> 00:17:21.635
<v Speaker 0>in some way, but when you give a

00:17:21.635 --> 00:17:24.220
<v Speaker 0>user a certain amount of scope or access

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:26.700
<v Speaker 0>to your cluster, there may be occasions where

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.860
<v Speaker 0>maybe you don't get them production access and

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.380
<v Speaker 0>they have to be able to elevate their

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:31.179
<v Speaker 0>privileges.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.020
<v Speaker 0>And there was a really cool system in

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.340
<v Speaker 0>Teleport where you can request access to the

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.535
<v Speaker 0>elevated privileges and someone else has to approve

00:17:37.535 --> 00:17:38.975
<v Speaker 0>it or two people have to approve it,

00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:40.495
<v Speaker 0>and then you get this window.

00:17:41.135 --> 00:17:43.375
<v Speaker 0>I think it's configurable thirty minutes to one

00:17:43.375 --> 00:17:45.775
<v Speaker 0>hour where you have the production access.

00:17:46.095 --> 00:17:46.655
<v Speaker 0>So

00:17:48.175 --> 00:17:49.615
<v Speaker 0>not sure what the change is here.

00:17:50.929 --> 00:17:52.850
<v Speaker 0>And it is enterprise only, which is a

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:54.610
<v Speaker 0>shame. It's a very cool feature.

00:17:56.049 --> 00:17:58.610
<v Speaker 0>Oh, wait. Another enterprise only feature. IP based

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:01.010
<v Speaker 0>restrictions and certificates. I guess I can understand

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:03.490
<v Speaker 0>the urge there. You wanna make sure that

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:06.255
<v Speaker 0>only certain IP addresses have access to Teleport

00:18:06.255 --> 00:18:08.335
<v Speaker 0>cluster because it protects all the stuff.

00:18:08.975 --> 00:18:09.695
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

00:18:10.495 --> 00:18:12.975
<v Speaker 0>Well, that's a feature. I was very excited

00:18:12.975 --> 00:18:14.335
<v Speaker 0>when I read about this in the blog

00:18:14.335 --> 00:18:16.895
<v Speaker 0>post and it's on Teleport community, which is

00:18:16.895 --> 00:18:17.695
<v Speaker 0>awesome.

00:18:18.335 --> 00:18:20.575
<v Speaker 0>But this is automatic Linux user provisioning.

00:18:21.539 --> 00:18:23.459
<v Speaker 0>So this creates

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.820
<v Speaker 0>a local Linux user for your Teleport user,

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:28.739
<v Speaker 0>which wasn't

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.740
<v Speaker 0>a thing. This was actually a really common

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.059
<v Speaker 0>cause of frustration for me personally as that

00:18:33.059 --> 00:18:35.139
<v Speaker 0>I was always like, when I was creating

00:18:35.139 --> 00:18:36.935
<v Speaker 0>users or setting up users, I would always

00:18:36.935 --> 00:18:38.934
<v Speaker 0>do, like, the t t control,

00:18:39.015 --> 00:18:40.134
<v Speaker 0>Teleport control,

00:18:40.295 --> 00:18:43.655
<v Speaker 0>users add roles, and I'd give myself admin

00:18:43.655 --> 00:18:45.095
<v Speaker 0>when that was a thing, but now other

00:18:45.095 --> 00:18:46.695
<v Speaker 0>or editor and access.

00:18:47.015 --> 00:18:49.015
<v Speaker 0>But I'd always forget the dash dash logins

00:18:49.015 --> 00:18:50.840
<v Speaker 0>to actually get some access to the users

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.080
<v Speaker 0>within the machine and that removes

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:54.600
<v Speaker 0>that problem,

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.520
<v Speaker 0>which is very, very cool. So I'm looking

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.679
<v Speaker 0>forward to being able to play with that.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.680
<v Speaker 0>We've got extended scope

00:19:02.925 --> 00:19:05.405
<v Speaker 0>for features of machine ID.

00:19:05.485 --> 00:19:07.565
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Okay. So machine ID for Kubernetes. This

00:19:07.565 --> 00:19:09.325
<v Speaker 0>is awesome. We covered machine ID on our

00:19:09.325 --> 00:19:10.765
<v Speaker 0>Teleport nine video.

00:19:11.005 --> 00:19:13.405
<v Speaker 0>So machine ID allows us to give shortlist

00:19:13.405 --> 00:19:15.965
<v Speaker 0>certificates to machine to machine communication based systems.

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:18.789
<v Speaker 0>The the example here is is Ansible.

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:21.669
<v Speaker 0>For me, Kubernetes was always the ideal target.

00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:23.190
<v Speaker 0>So it's nice to see that we've got

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:24.470
<v Speaker 0>application

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:26.309
<v Speaker 0>access preview there too.

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:29.110
<v Speaker 0>We got machine ID rotation,

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:30.995
<v Speaker 0>and I hope that Ben comes back and

00:19:30.995 --> 00:19:32.914
<v Speaker 0>he can describe some of this stuff because

00:19:32.914 --> 00:19:35.474
<v Speaker 0>I am absolutely winging it.

00:19:35.955 --> 00:19:37.794
<v Speaker 0>So the list that there's lots in this

00:19:37.794 --> 00:19:40.274
<v Speaker 0>blog, and if Ben isn't here in the

00:19:40.274 --> 00:19:41.794
<v Speaker 0>next one minute

00:19:42.195 --> 00:19:44.990
<v Speaker 0>oh, he just showed up. I was just

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:46.429
<v Speaker 0>about to call you out, Ben.

00:19:47.149 --> 00:19:48.109
<v Speaker 0>I'm back.

00:19:48.429 --> 00:19:50.029
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'm not sure what happened. I was

00:19:50.029 --> 00:19:52.589
<v Speaker 0>just running through the release blog, then

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:54.830
<v Speaker 0>reading the titles and pretending I knew what

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.909
<v Speaker 0>half the features were, but I wasn't entirely

00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.309
<v Speaker 0>sure.

00:19:58.024 --> 00:19:58.664
<v Speaker 0>So

00:19:58.904 --> 00:20:00.904
<v Speaker 0>I'm very glad you're Power outage.

00:20:01.465 --> 00:20:04.585
<v Speaker 0>Power outage. Well, that could be forgiven. I'm

00:20:04.585 --> 00:20:05.945
<v Speaker 0>glad you're Yeah. And I

00:20:06.345 --> 00:20:08.664
<v Speaker 1>I'm over provisioned with Internet, and so I

00:20:08.664 --> 00:20:09.784
<v Speaker 1>had to turn on my second

00:20:10.505 --> 00:20:12.264
<v Speaker 1>I had to, like, manually fail over to

00:20:12.264 --> 00:20:13.304
<v Speaker 1>my second ISP.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:16.620
<v Speaker 1>So I'm back in action.

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.500
<v Speaker 0>Well, I'm very glad that you're back.

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.620
<v Speaker 0>So I was just basically saying that we

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.380
<v Speaker 0>kinda covered passwordless,

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.460
<v Speaker 0>I think we've given everyone a good idea

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.300
<v Speaker 0>of that. I figured maybe you'd be happy

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.575
<v Speaker 0>and excited to just give us a short

00:20:30.575 --> 00:20:32.415
<v Speaker 0>description on the other major features on this

00:20:32.415 --> 00:20:34.095
<v Speaker 0>release blog, and then maybe we can get

00:20:34.095 --> 00:20:35.535
<v Speaker 0>hands on and take a look at some

00:20:35.535 --> 00:20:37.215
<v Speaker 0>of these features on your cluster. That sound

00:20:37.215 --> 00:20:37.695
<v Speaker 0>good?

00:20:39.935 --> 00:20:42.175
<v Speaker 0>Can you still hear me? Yeah. So I

00:20:42.175 --> 00:20:42.735
<v Speaker 1>think

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.680
<v Speaker 1>yep. Can hear Can you hear me? I

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.160
<v Speaker 0>can. There's just a small amount of latency,

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.320
<v Speaker 0>I guess, on your your new ISP, but

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:52.600
<v Speaker 0>I'll I'll deal with it. It's all good,

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:53.000
<v Speaker 0>man.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.600
<v Speaker 1>Yes. Comcast. This is why it's one.

00:21:01.515 --> 00:21:04.715
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So, you wanna just text them or

00:21:04.715 --> 00:21:05.995
<v Speaker 0>do you want me to run through them

00:21:05.995 --> 00:21:07.115
<v Speaker 0>and you can say a few words. What

00:21:07.115 --> 00:21:07.595
<v Speaker 0>would you prefer?

00:21:11.539 --> 00:21:13.619
<v Speaker 1>I think I would just talk about three

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.700
<v Speaker 1>main ones. Go for it.

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:20.179
<v Speaker 1>And I think the three other ones beyond

00:21:20.179 --> 00:21:21.220
<v Speaker 1>passwordless

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.299
<v Speaker 1>is our resource access requests.

00:21:24.065 --> 00:21:27.105
<v Speaker 1>And this really lets teams implement the privilege

00:21:27.105 --> 00:21:27.345
<v Speaker 1>of

00:21:28.465 --> 00:21:30.144
<v Speaker 1>the principle of least privilege

00:21:30.305 --> 00:21:33.265
<v Speaker 1>by creating an inventory of hosts that they

00:21:33.265 --> 00:21:34.225
<v Speaker 1>need to get access to.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.240
<v Speaker 1>And that sends a request to their team

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.360
<v Speaker 1>in sort of chat ops. We have a

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.320
<v Speaker 1>Slack integration,

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.200
<v Speaker 1>and they can sort of approve it.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.320
<v Speaker 1>And that's sort a really powerful feature for

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.320
<v Speaker 1>sort of larger teams, especially if you have

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.000
<v Speaker 1>a very large inventory of hosts and you

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:50.400
<v Speaker 1>wanna

00:21:50.835 --> 00:21:53.075
<v Speaker 1>give access to a few. This sort of

00:21:53.075 --> 00:21:55.235
<v Speaker 1>upgrades it from our previous release, which has

00:21:55.235 --> 00:21:57.154
<v Speaker 1>just role based access requests.

00:21:57.315 --> 00:21:59.075
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes within a let's say, role of,

00:21:59.075 --> 00:22:01.234
<v Speaker 1>like, DevOps, you might only need to access,

00:22:01.315 --> 00:22:03.235
<v Speaker 1>two hosts, and so this lets you do

00:22:03.235 --> 00:22:03.395
<v Speaker 1>that.

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:08.789
<v Speaker 1>The second one is automatic user provisioning.

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:11.509
<v Speaker 1>This is sort of a small addition,

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:12.789
<v Speaker 1>but it's super

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:14.389
<v Speaker 1>powerful.

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:15.590
<v Speaker 1>It lets you

00:22:16.555 --> 00:22:18.235
<v Speaker 1>sort of, you know, create the user, create

00:22:18.235 --> 00:22:21.115
<v Speaker 1>sudoers. So instead of having one,

00:22:21.755 --> 00:22:23.915
<v Speaker 1>like, easy to user, you can just, you

00:22:23.915 --> 00:22:24.794
<v Speaker 1>know, use

00:22:25.115 --> 00:22:25.914
<v Speaker 1>your

00:22:26.395 --> 00:22:28.395
<v Speaker 1>login from your sort of IDP

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:29.620
<v Speaker 1>automatically,

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:31.460
<v Speaker 1>and so it just makes setup and configuration

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.940
<v Speaker 1>much easier and gives you more control on

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.340
<v Speaker 1>who can have sudo privileges without having to

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.419
<v Speaker 1>set up the PAM stack yourself.

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:41.380
<v Speaker 1>And the third one is sort of our

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:43.059
<v Speaker 1>machine ID for Kubernetes.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:45.914
<v Speaker 1>I think this would probably interest you.

00:22:46.555 --> 00:22:49.515
<v Speaker 1>This lets you get short lived KubeConfigs

00:22:49.515 --> 00:22:51.034
<v Speaker 1>using machine ID.

00:22:51.355 --> 00:22:53.115
<v Speaker 1>And so if you would want to

00:22:53.915 --> 00:22:56.235
<v Speaker 1>have an automated tool run like a

00:22:56.809 --> 00:22:59.370
<v Speaker 1>security scanner in your Kubernetes cluster and you

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:00.730
<v Speaker 1>would give it a KubeConfig,

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:02.169
<v Speaker 1>this would be an example in which you

00:23:02.169 --> 00:23:04.249
<v Speaker 1>could issue those KubeConfigs

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:08.010
<v Speaker 1>without having to worry about, you know, rotation,

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:10.809
<v Speaker 1>connection, and auditing also built into it.

00:23:12.275 --> 00:23:14.915
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Yeah. Though, actually, two of those features

00:23:14.915 --> 00:23:16.755
<v Speaker 0>were the ones I was kinda saying I

00:23:16.755 --> 00:23:18.915
<v Speaker 0>was most excited about when you were offline.

00:23:18.915 --> 00:23:21.155
<v Speaker 0>The automatic Linux user provision, I think, just

00:23:21.155 --> 00:23:22.515
<v Speaker 0>I used to make the mistake of setting

00:23:22.515 --> 00:23:23.715
<v Speaker 0>up my users all the time and forgetting

00:23:23.715 --> 00:23:25.395
<v Speaker 0>to provide the logins, and that would just,

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:27.490
<v Speaker 0>like, break my experience. So I have to

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:28.450
<v Speaker 0>go and edit that.

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:30.770
<v Speaker 0>And, of course, machine ID for Kubernetes is

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:32.450
<v Speaker 0>definitely right up my street. I'm looking forward

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:33.650
<v Speaker 0>to be able to kick the tires on

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:35.410
<v Speaker 0>that a little bit more. But, yeah, very

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:36.210
<v Speaker 0>cool features here.

00:23:39.205 --> 00:23:41.284
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Should we shall I show you some?

00:23:41.284 --> 00:23:43.205
<v Speaker 0>I would love that. Let's do it.

00:23:44.404 --> 00:23:47.044
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it. So I share my screen.

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:55.179
<v Speaker 0>Alright. You're good.

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:57.259
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So

00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:59.020
<v Speaker 1>let me go to this login. You can

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:00.619
<v Speaker 1>actually change this login. So

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:02.299
<v Speaker 1>people

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.020
<v Speaker 1>this is the new addition to Teleport 10.

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:06.779
<v Speaker 1>So this is like the password less login.

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:07.900
<v Speaker 1>And so let me

00:24:09.115 --> 00:24:10.554
<v Speaker 1>log in.

00:24:11.195 --> 00:24:13.275
<v Speaker 1>And it's sort of a similar prompt. Actually,

00:24:13.275 --> 00:24:14.475
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can see their prompt

00:24:14.475 --> 00:24:15.195
<v Speaker 1>because

00:24:15.275 --> 00:24:17.595
<v Speaker 1>of the way in which the screen sharing

00:24:17.595 --> 00:24:18.794
<v Speaker 1>works, but I have a pop up that

00:24:18.794 --> 00:24:21.274
<v Speaker 1>says, like, pick your identity.

00:24:21.434 --> 00:24:23.595
<v Speaker 1>So I'm pick up USB key.

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:29.219
<v Speaker 1>Hold on. Actually,

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:31.779
<v Speaker 1>you know what? I have the other I

00:24:31.779 --> 00:24:32.899
<v Speaker 1>d wrench this one.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:36.340
<v Speaker 1>Let me get my I don't really need

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.259
<v Speaker 1>show you, but my other USB keys. You

00:24:38.259 --> 00:24:39.379
<v Speaker 1>basically tapped your key.

00:24:39.955 --> 00:24:41.315
<v Speaker 1>I should get my other one because this

00:24:41.315 --> 00:24:43.155
<v Speaker 1>is like the hallmark feature. One sec.

00:24:47.955 --> 00:24:48.755
<v Speaker 0>That's funny.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.279
<v Speaker 1>Now

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.440
<v Speaker 1>this is an interesting side problem with passwordless.

00:25:01.559 --> 00:25:04.840
<v Speaker 1>That generally is advised to have two YubiKeys

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.519
<v Speaker 1>or you can register multiple devices.

00:25:06.904 --> 00:25:09.705
<v Speaker 1>You can register Touch ID and the YubiKey.

00:25:09.945 --> 00:25:11.784
<v Speaker 1>And so let's say if I go to

00:25:11.784 --> 00:25:13.144
<v Speaker 1>work and I forget my YubiKey, I can

00:25:13.144 --> 00:25:15.224
<v Speaker 1>still log in with Touch ID with passwordless.

00:25:15.544 --> 00:25:17.625
<v Speaker 1>And then you can also add multiple YubiKeys.

00:25:17.625 --> 00:25:18.664
<v Speaker 1>So you can always have one as a

00:25:18.664 --> 00:25:20.184
<v Speaker 1>backup as well, which I probably recommend.

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:25.410
<v Speaker 1>If you move fully to this one. And

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:26.129
<v Speaker 1>so

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:27.250
<v Speaker 1>we

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:30.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can see it, but

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:32.370
<v Speaker 1>it's asking me for which account to log

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:33.169
<v Speaker 1>in as.

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:36.290
<v Speaker 1>Nice. And then I'm logged in. And so

00:25:36.505 --> 00:25:36.905
<v Speaker 1>no

00:25:37.865 --> 00:25:39.304
<v Speaker 1>there's actually a window that you if you

00:25:39.304 --> 00:25:41.784
<v Speaker 1>have you can log register multiple users to

00:25:41.784 --> 00:25:42.345
<v Speaker 1>one

00:25:42.985 --> 00:25:43.945
<v Speaker 1>YubiKey.

00:25:44.825 --> 00:25:46.905
<v Speaker 1>And so I have a Teleport admin and

00:25:46.905 --> 00:25:48.505
<v Speaker 1>my other user. This is Mike, which is

00:25:48.505 --> 00:25:49.784
<v Speaker 1>one of my demo users.

00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:52.389
<v Speaker 1>And so you sort of change between them.

00:25:52.389 --> 00:25:53.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's sort of by which I said

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:56.149
<v Speaker 1>it's user lameness. When you register them, they

00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:57.269
<v Speaker 1>get registered to,

00:25:57.909 --> 00:26:01.110
<v Speaker 1>let's say, the the resident key in YubiKey,

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:03.590
<v Speaker 1>and that's how it is both passwordless and

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:04.149
<v Speaker 1>usernameless.

00:26:06.894 --> 00:26:09.294
<v Speaker 1>And so that's question I've logged yeah. Yeah.

00:26:09.294 --> 00:26:11.135
<v Speaker 0>Oh, our latency just got much better. You

00:26:11.135 --> 00:26:14.014
<v Speaker 0>actually responded, like, immediately. That's awesome. Cool. Go

00:26:14.014 --> 00:26:14.815
<v Speaker 0>Comcast.

00:26:14.894 --> 00:26:15.534
<v Speaker 0>So

00:26:16.255 --> 00:26:18.320
<v Speaker 0>if I've got like, I I like to

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:19.520
<v Speaker 0>set up GitHub

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:20.320
<v Speaker 0>authentication

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.000
<v Speaker 0>with my Teleport cluster so that I can

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.840
<v Speaker 0>log in with that. Can I still add

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.799
<v Speaker 0>those extra web off end keys,

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.120
<v Speaker 0>touch ID, etcetera to that account, or is

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.560
<v Speaker 0>it just completely separate account?

00:26:31.515 --> 00:26:33.515
<v Speaker 1>For the first version in preview, it's a

00:26:33.515 --> 00:26:34.475
<v Speaker 1>separate account,

00:26:34.715 --> 00:26:37.515
<v Speaker 1>but we're working on solutions to work with,

00:26:37.755 --> 00:26:40.315
<v Speaker 1>like, your IDP for passwordless

00:26:40.315 --> 00:26:41.915
<v Speaker 1>to sort of combine the user.

00:26:42.235 --> 00:26:43.275
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Nice. Cool.

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:45.890
<v Speaker 1>And then this is sort of just an

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:47.170
<v Speaker 1>example of when which I have, you know,

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:49.490
<v Speaker 1>like, Touch ID, YubiKey, and Windows Hello, like,

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:51.170
<v Speaker 1>all registered as different devices as sort of

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:52.210
<v Speaker 0>as my backup.

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:54.610
<v Speaker 0>Nice. I like that.

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:57.890
<v Speaker 1>And, you know, the registration flow is kind

00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:59.330
<v Speaker 1>of the same for adding new users.

00:27:01.465 --> 00:27:03.304
<v Speaker 1>And then the user get like, depending upon

00:27:03.304 --> 00:27:04.745
<v Speaker 1>how you configure it, the user gets to

00:27:04.745 --> 00:27:06.104
<v Speaker 1>pick how they want to

00:27:06.585 --> 00:27:09.625
<v Speaker 1>enroll their password list option. So that's kind

00:27:09.625 --> 00:27:12.025
<v Speaker 1>of the flow for onboarding people. You send

00:27:12.025 --> 00:27:13.625
<v Speaker 1>people links and they register, and

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:17.269
<v Speaker 1>they're onboarding on password list.

00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:21.029
<v Speaker 1>So let's go to the next thing we're

00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.989
<v Speaker 1>talking about was

00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:25.989
<v Speaker 1>actually gonna log out of Mike

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:29.110
<v Speaker 1>and log back in as with GitHub.

00:27:29.794 --> 00:27:31.794
<v Speaker 1>Because when you might have seen this too.

00:27:31.794 --> 00:27:33.155
<v Speaker 1>So when you log in as GitHub, it

00:27:33.155 --> 00:27:35.155
<v Speaker 1>sort of brings in your, like, GitHub username,

00:27:35.155 --> 00:27:37.475
<v Speaker 1>which is, the internal user. Mhmm. You can

00:27:37.475 --> 00:27:39.315
<v Speaker 1>configure this. It could be, like, an email

00:27:39.315 --> 00:27:42.275
<v Speaker 1>address or something from your central, like, IDP

00:27:42.275 --> 00:27:43.635
<v Speaker 1>if you have Okta.

00:27:46.559 --> 00:27:49.440
<v Speaker 1>Without or so with automatic user creation, if

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.960
<v Speaker 1>I just log in as Ben Arant,

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.039
<v Speaker 1>it creates this user for me.

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.200
<v Speaker 1>Because normally that Right?

00:27:57.865 --> 00:27:59.865
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Yeah. Normally, it would fail, and then

00:27:59.865 --> 00:28:01.385
<v Speaker 1>you'd like, oh, it's like you don't have

00:28:01.385 --> 00:28:02.504
<v Speaker 1>access to this host.

00:28:02.985 --> 00:28:04.424
<v Speaker 1>And so sort of now it just works

00:28:04.424 --> 00:28:06.265
<v Speaker 1>sort of seamlessly out of the box. Yeah.

00:28:06.265 --> 00:28:07.705
<v Speaker 0>That's a great feature. It's like one of

00:28:07.705 --> 00:28:10.025
<v Speaker 0>those really strong quality of life improvements that

00:28:10.025 --> 00:28:11.705
<v Speaker 0>I think everyone's gonna be celebrating.

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:15.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. Definitely because it kinda trips people

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:16.730
<v Speaker 1>up to start off with.

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:18.650
<v Speaker 1>So that was the second one on my

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:19.770
<v Speaker 1>hot list.

00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:22.090
<v Speaker 1>I think the third one is access

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:23.290
<v Speaker 1>request feature.

00:28:26.135 --> 00:28:28.375
<v Speaker 1>And okay. Let me log out of me

00:28:28.534 --> 00:28:29.414
<v Speaker 1>my user.

00:28:30.135 --> 00:28:31.575
<v Speaker 1>Let me log in as Alice.

00:28:36.534 --> 00:28:38.695
<v Speaker 1>And Alice, when she logs in,

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:41.270
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing here. So there's no servers,

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:43.429
<v Speaker 1>no applications, no clusters.

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:47.350
<v Speaker 1>But she has the ability to view

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:50.310
<v Speaker 1>the inventory of hosts that are available to

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:52.855
<v Speaker 1>her to find within a role. So let's

00:28:52.855 --> 00:28:54.455
<v Speaker 1>say she needs to debug

00:28:54.455 --> 00:28:56.615
<v Speaker 1>a few of these sort of worker nodes

00:28:56.615 --> 00:28:58.774
<v Speaker 1>and the Kubernetes cluster.

00:28:59.575 --> 00:29:01.335
<v Speaker 1>The sort of just in time access requests

00:29:01.335 --> 00:29:03.095
<v Speaker 1>let her build a inventory

00:29:03.414 --> 00:29:05.815
<v Speaker 1>of just the devices and nodes that she

00:29:05.815 --> 00:29:06.615
<v Speaker 1>needs access to.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:08.640
<v Speaker 1>And so

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:10.800
<v Speaker 1>on

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:11.840
<v Speaker 1>debug,

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.720
<v Speaker 1>you can also request reviewers, but I'm just

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:15.920
<v Speaker 1>gonna request this.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.400
<v Speaker 1>This goes out to a request.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.560
<v Speaker 1>My other user would sort of accept it.

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.160
<v Speaker 1>You assume this role, and then you can

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.185
<v Speaker 1>sort of just go about your day of

00:29:24.185 --> 00:29:25.705
<v Speaker 1>just using Teleport normally.

00:29:26.105 --> 00:29:28.745
<v Speaker 1>But, you know, we've really scoped down

00:29:29.065 --> 00:29:30.985
<v Speaker 1>all of we've given people the ability to

00:29:30.985 --> 00:29:32.424
<v Speaker 1>see inventory of resources,

00:29:32.905 --> 00:29:35.145
<v Speaker 1>but also greatly scoped down the sort of

00:29:35.145 --> 00:29:36.745
<v Speaker 1>access. And so this is a sort of

00:29:36.745 --> 00:29:38.730
<v Speaker 1>a nice sort of check.

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:40.490
<v Speaker 1>You know, it can help with compliance, but

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:41.610
<v Speaker 1>also help with just

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:45.210
<v Speaker 1>not giving access to all of your infrastructure

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:46.490
<v Speaker 1>at one time. So it can be, like,

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:48.250
<v Speaker 1>a nice compliance and also a good security

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:48.809
<v Speaker 1>feature.

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:51.610
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I love that feature. That's very cool.

00:29:52.835 --> 00:29:55.075
<v Speaker 0>I I I didn't really understand when I

00:29:55.075 --> 00:29:57.155
<v Speaker 0>was when you were offline, I was kinda

00:29:57.155 --> 00:29:59.395
<v Speaker 0>trying to understand the enhanced

00:30:00.195 --> 00:30:02.355
<v Speaker 0>role resource thing. And I didn't really pick

00:30:02.355 --> 00:30:04.650
<v Speaker 0>up on it, although Russell did in the

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:06.810
<v Speaker 0>chat. But being able to individually pack those

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:09.530
<v Speaker 0>resources instead of applying an entire role with,

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:11.450
<v Speaker 0>like, the node selector and the Kubernetes selector

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:14.090
<v Speaker 0>and stuff is a very, very cool feature.

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:16.250
<v Speaker 1>There's another cool

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:19.370
<v Speaker 1>addition to the if you

00:30:20.155 --> 00:30:22.555
<v Speaker 1>if you know the host you wanna access,

00:30:22.555 --> 00:30:24.315
<v Speaker 1>so let's say, I would like

00:30:24.715 --> 00:30:26.475
<v Speaker 1>SSH into one of these nodes and you

00:30:26.475 --> 00:30:28.635
<v Speaker 1>don't have access to it, in the command

00:30:28.635 --> 00:30:30.315
<v Speaker 1>line, it can also create the request for

00:30:30.315 --> 00:30:32.235
<v Speaker 1>you. And so you can have this whole

00:30:32.235 --> 00:30:34.635
<v Speaker 1>experience and flow without using the terminal,

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:38.820
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of a very powerful, like,

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:39.460
<v Speaker 1>addition.

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:41.059
<v Speaker 1>Yep. You know, you don't have to come

00:30:41.059 --> 00:30:42.179
<v Speaker 1>into Teleport. You can just do it on

00:30:42.179 --> 00:30:43.779
<v Speaker 1>the CLI. And all these features, you know,

00:30:43.779 --> 00:30:45.460
<v Speaker 1>must be available on the CLI.

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:46.259
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:48.500
<v Speaker 0>We have a question from Russell on the

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:49.700
<v Speaker 0>chat if you're happy to pick that one

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.835
<v Speaker 0>up while we log in. I'm assuming you're

00:30:51.835 --> 00:30:53.595
<v Speaker 0>gonna log in and approve Alice, so I'll

00:30:53.595 --> 00:30:55.755
<v Speaker 0>read the questions just now. But Russell is

00:30:55.755 --> 00:30:58.715
<v Speaker 0>asking if there's a way to drop a

00:30:58.715 --> 00:31:01.195
<v Speaker 0>session with machine ID. So assuming we give

00:31:01.195 --> 00:31:01.675
<v Speaker 0>access

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:05.130
<v Speaker 0>to give a KubeConfig to somebody, but we

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:07.290
<v Speaker 0>then want to revoke that sooner than the

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:08.810
<v Speaker 0>expiration. Is that possible?

00:31:15.785 --> 00:31:18.265
<v Speaker 1>So you can so the answer to this

00:31:18.265 --> 00:31:20.345
<v Speaker 1>question, I believe, I might have to double

00:31:20.345 --> 00:31:21.385
<v Speaker 1>check on this. The

00:31:21.865 --> 00:31:24.424
<v Speaker 1>best practice is to really limit

00:31:24.985 --> 00:31:27.570
<v Speaker 1>your time. So you can have machine ID,

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:28.930
<v Speaker 1>I think, go down to, like, the minute

00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:30.370
<v Speaker 1>or maybe, like, five minutes.

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:32.769
<v Speaker 1>And then you can lock it.

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:35.490
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea is you'll always issue

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:37.250
<v Speaker 1>these certificates every five minutes,

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:39.570
<v Speaker 1>but then we have, like, t guddle box

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:39.970
<v Speaker 1>lock.

00:31:40.985 --> 00:31:43.225
<v Speaker 1>And then that will lock it from issuing

00:31:43.225 --> 00:31:44.585
<v Speaker 1>any new certs.

00:31:44.585 --> 00:31:46.025
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're worried about that sort

00:31:46.025 --> 00:31:48.905
<v Speaker 1>of window of attack, I would just reduce

00:31:48.905 --> 00:31:50.665
<v Speaker 1>the time in which you issue it from,

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.280
<v Speaker 1>like, Teleport.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.040
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That makes sense. That makes sense.

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:59.799
<v Speaker 1>Think we have looked into revocation of certificates,

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.160
<v Speaker 1>but I think it

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.400
<v Speaker 1>is a sort of a complicated problem. So

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.040
<v Speaker 1>we advise people just give certificates a really

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.880
<v Speaker 1>short life and then use the ability to

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:09.695
<v Speaker 1>lock it if you think a certificate has

00:32:09.695 --> 00:32:10.575
<v Speaker 1>been compromised.

00:32:12.335 --> 00:32:14.495
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking of sort of that realm of

00:32:14.495 --> 00:32:15.615
<v Speaker 1>certificates

00:32:16.095 --> 00:32:17.455
<v Speaker 1>being compromised.

00:32:17.615 --> 00:32:19.054
<v Speaker 1>We've added in

00:32:21.455 --> 00:32:22.335
<v Speaker 1>IP

00:32:22.815 --> 00:32:24.255
<v Speaker 1>based I forgot

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:26.790
<v Speaker 1>the official name of the feature. Let me

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:27.669
<v Speaker 1>look on the roles.

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:31.269
<v Speaker 1>Pin source IP into roles.

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:34.630
<v Speaker 1>And this means when someone uses TSH to

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:35.990
<v Speaker 1>get their certificates,

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:38.390
<v Speaker 1>it bakes in the source IP that requested

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:38.950
<v Speaker 1>it. So

00:32:40.005 --> 00:32:41.365
<v Speaker 1>this is actually an interesting use case. I

00:32:41.365 --> 00:32:43.044
<v Speaker 1>just changed, like, ISPs.

00:32:43.045 --> 00:32:44.485
<v Speaker 1>So I probably have a different IP address

00:32:44.485 --> 00:32:45.044
<v Speaker 1>now.

00:32:45.765 --> 00:32:48.085
<v Speaker 1>And so my first if I was to

00:32:48.085 --> 00:32:50.164
<v Speaker 1>use the command line and issue the certificates,

00:32:51.845 --> 00:32:53.845
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't work because my IP had changed.

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:55.350
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to log in again to get

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:58.070
<v Speaker 1>a certificate to match. Right. Right. Gotcha. Yeah.

00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:59.830
<v Speaker 0>That that makes a lot of sense. Like,

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:00.309
<v Speaker 0>that

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:02.150
<v Speaker 0>I think that removes a whole bunch of

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:03.830
<v Speaker 0>attack vectors. Right? Because this one was the

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:05.990
<v Speaker 0>source IP that made the initial request. So

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:08.230
<v Speaker 0>if that changes, it's not something bad is

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:10.895
<v Speaker 0>happening or potentially something bad is happening.

00:33:11.455 --> 00:33:12.095
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:33:12.415 --> 00:33:14.815
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. ISP's gone down. So

00:33:15.295 --> 00:33:16.735
<v Speaker 1>it's like a nice little,

00:33:16.895 --> 00:33:18.414
<v Speaker 1>you know, security feature.

00:33:19.775 --> 00:33:20.175
<v Speaker 1>Cool.

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.480
<v Speaker 0>Are you going to approve

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.399
<v Speaker 0>Alice? Is that what we are?

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.480
<v Speaker 1>I can approve Alice. I mean, the approval

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.119
<v Speaker 1>flow

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.360
<v Speaker 1>is sort of nice and we, you know,

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.480
<v Speaker 1>you can have the reason

00:33:33.845 --> 00:33:35.205
<v Speaker 1>for approving.

00:33:35.285 --> 00:33:38.085
<v Speaker 1>You can have messages regarding and

00:33:38.965 --> 00:33:41.125
<v Speaker 1>then Alice will be able to sort of

00:33:41.125 --> 00:33:42.164
<v Speaker 1>go about her

00:33:42.965 --> 00:33:44.565
<v Speaker 1>her standard flow like you assumed.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to necessarily share that since

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.440
<v Speaker 1>it's already, you know, kinda like standard

00:33:51.559 --> 00:33:53.239
<v Speaker 1>standard Teleport flow.

00:33:54.919 --> 00:33:58.120
<v Speaker 0>Russell likes the IP pending. Nice feature. Yeah.

00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.480
<v Speaker 0>I think we're all agreed on that one.

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.039
<v Speaker 0>It's pretty good.

00:34:00.855 --> 00:34:03.415
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That's another one within our sort of

00:34:03.415 --> 00:34:04.294
<v Speaker 1>what's new.

00:34:04.775 --> 00:34:07.015
<v Speaker 1>I think that we we have more information

00:34:07.015 --> 00:34:09.175
<v Speaker 1>here about the time bound. And I think

00:34:09.175 --> 00:34:11.415
<v Speaker 1>this is actually an enterprise only feature

00:34:12.935 --> 00:34:13.335
<v Speaker 1>since,

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:15.679
<v Speaker 1>you know, if you have your home lab,

00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:17.520
<v Speaker 1>it's not you're unlikely to have a nation

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:19.280
<v Speaker 1>stake trying to get your certificates.

00:34:21.599 --> 00:34:23.040
<v Speaker 0>Cool. Let me see what else we have

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.400
<v Speaker 1>in here. And then I think, you know,

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.800
<v Speaker 1>we've added a range of new databases

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:28.239
<v Speaker 1>as well.

00:34:29.675 --> 00:34:31.835
<v Speaker 1>Snowflake being a pretty interesting one.

00:34:32.875 --> 00:34:34.315
<v Speaker 1>I think Snowflake's

00:34:35.114 --> 00:34:35.994
<v Speaker 1>interesting

00:34:35.994 --> 00:34:37.035
<v Speaker 1>because,

00:34:37.675 --> 00:34:38.315
<v Speaker 1>you know, it's

00:34:38.875 --> 00:34:40.715
<v Speaker 1>our other protocols have gone deep. So we

00:34:40.715 --> 00:34:42.235
<v Speaker 1>have to go, like, deep MySQL,

00:34:42.395 --> 00:34:43.514
<v Speaker 1>deep Postgres.

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:47.030
<v Speaker 1>But, like, modern database is just over,

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:49.750
<v Speaker 1>like, TCP, like, HTTP.

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:51.510
<v Speaker 1>And

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:53.910
<v Speaker 1>it's a sort of the same flow. You

00:34:53.910 --> 00:34:55.830
<v Speaker 1>can access your Snowflake cluster,

00:34:57.675 --> 00:34:58.955
<v Speaker 1>And all of this is done on the

00:34:58.955 --> 00:35:02.395
<v Speaker 1>command line, so you use just Snow SQL

00:35:02.395 --> 00:35:04.715
<v Speaker 1>as well as you stand as you would

00:35:04.715 --> 00:35:05.595
<v Speaker 1>normally.

00:35:05.835 --> 00:35:07.275
<v Speaker 1>And we also have additions

00:35:08.075 --> 00:35:08.635
<v Speaker 1>to

00:35:09.355 --> 00:35:12.660
<v Speaker 1>use, like, graphical tools for sort of Postgres

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:15.780
<v Speaker 1>and MySQL as well. So you can issue

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:17.060
<v Speaker 1>it to teams who don't wanna who aren't

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:18.820
<v Speaker 1>that familiar with sort of the command line

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:19.380
<v Speaker 1>tools.

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:21.060
<v Speaker 0>Very cool.

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.620
<v Speaker 0>There was quite a few new databases listed

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:25.994
<v Speaker 0>on that log there. Right? I've seen Elasticsearch

00:35:25.994 --> 00:35:27.755
<v Speaker 0>and Elasticsearch

00:35:27.755 --> 00:35:30.395
<v Speaker 1>is coming. These are gonna be in 10/02.

00:35:30.395 --> 00:35:31.355
<v Speaker 1>This mem

00:35:32.075 --> 00:35:33.755
<v Speaker 1>these ones, I mean, I kinda think they're

00:35:33.755 --> 00:35:35.035
<v Speaker 1>the same. Like, they're both

00:35:35.275 --> 00:35:37.435
<v Speaker 1>Amazon's Redis compatibility

00:35:37.435 --> 00:35:40.370
<v Speaker 1>additions, like MemoryDB and ElasticCache for Redis. So

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:42.690
<v Speaker 1>just providing more AWS cover.

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:45.330
<v Speaker 1>And then, like, I guess, Cassandra is

00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:48.130
<v Speaker 1>coming in 10/03. And so, you know, we're

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:49.810
<v Speaker 1>just always adding more databases.

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:51.650
<v Speaker 1>So if you, you know, have one that

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:53.330
<v Speaker 1>you're sort of interested in, definitely

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:55.170
<v Speaker 1>search our GitHub issues

00:35:55.555 --> 00:35:57.395
<v Speaker 1>if there's a ticket for it. Or if

00:35:57.395 --> 00:35:59.715
<v Speaker 1>not, you know, create an issue.

00:36:00.435 --> 00:36:01.075
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:36:02.755 --> 00:36:04.435
<v Speaker 1>Most of these ones are also quite easy.

00:36:04.435 --> 00:36:06.195
<v Speaker 1>Like, once we had our Redis integration, it's

00:36:06.195 --> 00:36:08.515
<v Speaker 1>easy to add MemoryDB because it's just speaks

00:36:08.515 --> 00:36:11.875
<v Speaker 1>Redis, but there's just a few nuances of

00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:12.050
<v Speaker 1>how they have

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:14.130
<v Speaker 1>set up their authentication.

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:16.690
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So how many databases does Teleport support

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:17.330
<v Speaker 0>now?

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:19.330
<v Speaker 0>I imagine that's quite a large number.

00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:25.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the official number, but the

00:36:24.174 --> 00:36:27.455
<v Speaker 1>documentation page for databases is growing. And

00:36:29.454 --> 00:36:30.895
<v Speaker 1>it also,

00:36:31.295 --> 00:36:33.855
<v Speaker 1>you know, we've kind of, like, deep on

00:36:36.095 --> 00:36:38.895
<v Speaker 1>the different cloud vendors. So, like, AWS,

00:36:38.974 --> 00:36:39.615
<v Speaker 1>RDS,

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:41.030
<v Speaker 1>GCP,

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:42.630
<v Speaker 1>like SQL, MySQL.

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:45.830
<v Speaker 1>Active Directory SQL,

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:48.550
<v Speaker 1>we added in audit logging as an addition,

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:53.030
<v Speaker 1>which wasn't previously available for Microsoft SQL.

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:55.590
<v Speaker 1>And, actually, we're writing, a blog post. I

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:57.535
<v Speaker 1>guess it could be difficult for some people

00:36:57.535 --> 00:36:59.855
<v Speaker 1>to access Microsoft SQL on Linux as well.

00:36:59.855 --> 00:37:00.975
<v Speaker 1>So, also,

00:37:01.695 --> 00:37:02.975
<v Speaker 1>if you do have to use it and

00:37:02.975 --> 00:37:05.055
<v Speaker 1>you're Linux native, you know, it's sort of

00:37:05.055 --> 00:37:07.375
<v Speaker 1>a nice tool for accessing Microsoft SQL.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.080
<v Speaker 1>And then Cockroach, she has another one that

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.720
<v Speaker 1>we added. So you're just always adding and

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:14.440
<v Speaker 1>expanding.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.920
<v Speaker 1>And we also try to so we have,

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.600
<v Speaker 1>like, self hosted MongoDB,

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.200
<v Speaker 1>but also MongoDB Atlas.

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:23.515
<v Speaker 1>And so we support sort of DBAs as

00:37:23.515 --> 00:37:25.915
<v Speaker 1>a service as well as self self hosted

00:37:25.915 --> 00:37:26.715
<v Speaker 1>databases.

00:37:27.035 --> 00:37:28.315
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. MongoDB

00:37:28.315 --> 00:37:32.475
<v Speaker 0>Atlas released serverless databases earlier this year. And,

00:37:32.475 --> 00:37:34.315
<v Speaker 0>like, the free tier is actually

00:37:34.475 --> 00:37:36.715
<v Speaker 0>really interesting. I started using it for a

00:37:36.715 --> 00:37:38.390
<v Speaker 0>few things. And gotta say it's it's just

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:40.230
<v Speaker 0>a pleasant experience. And I I actually didn't

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:41.750
<v Speaker 0>know I could throw Teleport in front of

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:43.990
<v Speaker 0>that. So I'm even happier now that I

00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:44.550
<v Speaker 0>can.

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:49.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. The setup and configuration is also

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:51.750
<v Speaker 1>pretty simple because, you know, they run your

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:52.150
<v Speaker 1>database.

00:37:52.745 --> 00:37:54.505
<v Speaker 1>Often, the process

00:37:54.905 --> 00:37:55.705
<v Speaker 1>is

00:37:56.905 --> 00:37:58.825
<v Speaker 1>exporting a sort of x five zero nine

00:37:58.825 --> 00:37:59.625
<v Speaker 1>certificates,

00:38:00.745 --> 00:38:03.065
<v Speaker 1>adding it into your, like, MongoDB Atlas cluster

00:38:03.065 --> 00:38:04.425
<v Speaker 1>and registering the user.

00:38:04.665 --> 00:38:06.585
<v Speaker 1>And that's pretty much it. So it's pretty

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:08.480
<v Speaker 1>if you already have a cluster set up,

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:11.600
<v Speaker 1>the configuration and setup is relatively simple. You

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:13.280
<v Speaker 1>know, you have the self managed x five

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.040
<v Speaker 1>zero nine, and you create the user that

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.080
<v Speaker 1>has the certificates,

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:19.680
<v Speaker 1>and that's pretty much it. So it's

00:38:20.355 --> 00:38:21.875
<v Speaker 1>if you have a class three already, it's

00:38:21.875 --> 00:38:23.555
<v Speaker 1>a pretty nice and smooth experience.

00:38:23.955 --> 00:38:25.715
<v Speaker 0>Alright. That's tomorrow's mission then.

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:33.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. They'll keep going down. So in the

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:35.490
<v Speaker 1>desktop access, this one is gonna be really

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:38.049
<v Speaker 1>exciting. This one's in ten two, but I've

00:38:38.049 --> 00:38:39.330
<v Speaker 1>seen a preview of it.

00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:43.890
<v Speaker 1>It you know, we added we've added Windows

00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:44.849
<v Speaker 1>desktops,

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:46.849
<v Speaker 1>but this lets you

00:38:47.625 --> 00:38:50.505
<v Speaker 1>share local files over the browser.

00:38:52.185 --> 00:38:53.865
<v Speaker 1>And so you could have directories

00:38:53.865 --> 00:38:54.505
<v Speaker 1>and

00:38:54.825 --> 00:38:56.825
<v Speaker 1>we added clipboard support.

00:38:57.305 --> 00:38:57.945
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully, this

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:02.440
<v Speaker 1>works. So it's already, like, natively sort of

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.359
<v Speaker 1>passwordless. But if you wanted to sort drag

00:39:04.359 --> 00:39:06.039
<v Speaker 1>files into here from my Mac operating system,

00:39:06.039 --> 00:39:06.599
<v Speaker 1>it's

00:39:07.079 --> 00:39:08.520
<v Speaker 1>a pain. And

00:39:10.279 --> 00:39:11.400
<v Speaker 1>this

00:39:11.895 --> 00:39:14.055
<v Speaker 1>directory sharing is sort of a cool addition.

00:39:14.055 --> 00:39:16.935
<v Speaker 1>It uses a sharing API over, like, TDP,

00:39:16.935 --> 00:39:18.615
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of our RDP protocol.

00:39:20.295 --> 00:39:21.415
<v Speaker 1>It's super

00:39:21.895 --> 00:39:23.815
<v Speaker 1>interesting sort of solution to the problem, but

00:39:23.815 --> 00:39:24.855
<v Speaker 1>it's also all in the browser.

00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:28.220
<v Speaker 1>And I've not seen much else that's sort

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:30.300
<v Speaker 1>of similar in the browser without, like, having

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:31.740
<v Speaker 1>a native client. So

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:33.980
<v Speaker 1>the guys have done a great job on

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:34.540
<v Speaker 1>this.

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:36.619
<v Speaker 0>I can just drag a file from my

00:39:36.619 --> 00:39:38.994
<v Speaker 0>Mac onto a Windows machine via the browser.

00:39:38.994 --> 00:39:39.955
<v Speaker 0>That's pretty cool.

00:39:42.355 --> 00:39:42.915
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:39:43.235 --> 00:39:44.595
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Pretty cool. And then when it's trying

00:39:44.595 --> 00:39:47.315
<v Speaker 1>to simplify setup, you know, desktop

00:39:48.035 --> 00:39:50.195
<v Speaker 1>support is may you know, people managing their

00:39:50.195 --> 00:39:52.950
<v Speaker 1>own, like, self managed ID currently. So mainly

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:55.510
<v Speaker 1>large organizations who are worried about security, so

00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:57.590
<v Speaker 1>we make configuration a little easier.

00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:59.270
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:02.230
<v Speaker 1>And then I think also this is sort

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:03.670
<v Speaker 1>of in ten one, like,

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:05.030
<v Speaker 1>just generic

00:40:06.595 --> 00:40:09.475
<v Speaker 1>application support for sort of WebSocket connections

00:40:09.635 --> 00:40:11.955
<v Speaker 1>and different protocols. So just sort of expanding

00:40:11.955 --> 00:40:13.635
<v Speaker 1>application access as well.

00:40:15.155 --> 00:40:17.315
<v Speaker 0>So this brings support for m p p

00:40:17.315 --> 00:40:17.395
<v Speaker 0>p.

00:40:20.589 --> 00:40:21.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yep.

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:24.349
<v Speaker 0>Thanks. I like that. And so this was

00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:26.750
<v Speaker 1>first read through, like, a open issue. And

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:28.910
<v Speaker 1>so this is sort of, I guess, showing,

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:31.070
<v Speaker 1>like, Teleport sort of open core, open source

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:32.910
<v Speaker 1>sort of nature. So, you know, if there's

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:34.750
<v Speaker 1>a certain feature that you wanna get, you

00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:35.150
<v Speaker 1>know, like,

00:40:35.895 --> 00:40:37.735
<v Speaker 1>this is from February, so we've worked on

00:40:37.735 --> 00:40:39.255
<v Speaker 1>this, like, relatively quicker, which sort of shows

00:40:39.255 --> 00:40:41.815
<v Speaker 1>the philosophy of the team is always ramping

00:40:41.815 --> 00:40:42.295
<v Speaker 1>up.

00:40:44.535 --> 00:40:45.735
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I like that.

00:40:47.815 --> 00:40:50.215
<v Speaker 1>And there's other so the proxy peering is

00:40:50.215 --> 00:40:50.695
<v Speaker 1>just

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:53.110
<v Speaker 1>makes your cluster come, like, faster.

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:54.790
<v Speaker 1>And then I think this is we've sort

00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:56.310
<v Speaker 1>of interesting for you

00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:58.230
<v Speaker 1>is our Kubernetes

00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:01.270
<v Speaker 1>operator and moving away from persistent volumes.

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:03.590
<v Speaker 1>There's some other

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:05.590
<v Speaker 0>So what's the operator

00:41:06.025 --> 00:41:08.265
<v Speaker 0>thing? Sorry. What what what's it bringing here?

00:41:09.465 --> 00:41:10.905
<v Speaker 1>Let me get you the docs for the

00:41:10.905 --> 00:41:11.785
<v Speaker 1>operator.

00:41:17.625 --> 00:41:17.945
<v Speaker 1>Me.

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I don't have the docs for the

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:24.200
<v Speaker 1>operator.

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.400
<v Speaker 1>The operator

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:28.280
<v Speaker 1>does let you configure Teleport

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.960
<v Speaker 1>in a more streamlined way

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:31.000
<v Speaker 1>Nice.

00:41:31.455 --> 00:41:34.495
<v Speaker 1>With for creating users and using TCuddle

00:41:36.015 --> 00:41:38.095
<v Speaker 1>and sort of extending it without having to

00:41:38.095 --> 00:41:40.575
<v Speaker 1>sort of customize YAML as much or modify

00:41:40.575 --> 00:41:41.535
<v Speaker 1>our home charts.

00:41:41.695 --> 00:41:44.495
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Trying to pass properties and configuration into

00:41:44.495 --> 00:41:47.110
<v Speaker 0>the home chart has proven cumbersome time and

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:49.510
<v Speaker 0>time again. So relying more on custom resources

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:50.950
<v Speaker 0>and being able to apply them to the

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:53.270
<v Speaker 0>cluster. Yeah. Again, something else I'm gonna have

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:54.630
<v Speaker 0>to start kicking the tires on. I think

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:56.710
<v Speaker 0>that's gonna simplify my own infrastructure a good

00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:58.470
<v Speaker 0>fair bit. So that's nice to see.

00:41:59.154 --> 00:42:00.595
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I think it would definitely help you

00:42:00.595 --> 00:42:02.195
<v Speaker 1>a lot with clustered.

00:42:02.355 --> 00:42:04.195
<v Speaker 1>And I think this would be ten one.

00:42:04.434 --> 00:42:06.194
<v Speaker 1>So soon you'll be able to try this

00:42:06.194 --> 00:42:06.675
<v Speaker 1>out.

00:42:08.434 --> 00:42:12.194
<v Speaker 0>Nice. And removal of the persistent volume. So

00:42:12.194 --> 00:42:13.154
<v Speaker 0>where's all the state live?

00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:18.620
<v Speaker 1>That is a good question. And

00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:23.580
<v Speaker 1>let me find the issue because I I

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:24.700
<v Speaker 1>knew you'd ask me that question.

00:42:26.585 --> 00:42:27.305
<v Speaker 1>And

00:42:28.825 --> 00:42:31.385
<v Speaker 1>like everything that we do and along with

00:42:31.385 --> 00:42:33.465
<v Speaker 1>kind of being open call for GitHub,

00:42:33.625 --> 00:42:35.625
<v Speaker 1>we have sort of RFDs.

00:42:36.105 --> 00:42:37.865
<v Speaker 0>Ah. We sort of discuss like how we're

00:42:37.865 --> 00:42:39.465
<v Speaker 1>implementing our features.

00:42:39.944 --> 00:42:40.425
<v Speaker 1>And so,

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:43.440
<v Speaker 1>you know, it sort of describes the problem

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:45.200
<v Speaker 1>and sort of, like, tokens and the problems

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.320
<v Speaker 1>that we've run into

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.520
<v Speaker 1>and sort of how we've gone about building

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:52.880
<v Speaker 1>it. So we're just using Kubernetes native secrets.

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.175
<v Speaker 0>Very cool. Yeah. So if anyone's sort of

00:42:55.175 --> 00:42:56.615
<v Speaker 1>really interested in it, this sort of goes

00:42:56.615 --> 00:42:58.375
<v Speaker 1>through, like, our thought process, like, what it

00:42:58.375 --> 00:42:58.935
<v Speaker 1>changes,

00:42:59.735 --> 00:43:01.735
<v Speaker 1>how it works. We sort of flowcharts, and

00:43:01.735 --> 00:43:02.935
<v Speaker 1>as you can see, it's always

00:43:05.175 --> 00:43:07.095
<v Speaker 1>other edge cases, like dealing with, like, CA

00:43:07.095 --> 00:43:07.895
<v Speaker 1>rotations,

00:43:07.895 --> 00:43:09.710
<v Speaker 1>you have to take into account and sort

00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:11.550
<v Speaker 1>of other limitations of it.

00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Sort of upgrade procedures, change to a helm

00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:15.150
<v Speaker 1>charts.

00:43:16.589 --> 00:43:17.869
<v Speaker 1>So this is also a great resource if

00:43:17.869 --> 00:43:19.309
<v Speaker 1>you wanna get a head start on the

00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:20.190
<v Speaker 1>on the feature.

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:22.670
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'll share that link in the description

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:24.430
<v Speaker 0>below once we finish for today.

00:43:28.234 --> 00:43:30.155
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's it. You know, we're

00:43:30.155 --> 00:43:32.075
<v Speaker 1>working on making upgrades easier. You know, lots

00:43:32.075 --> 00:43:33.435
<v Speaker 1>of people talked about upgrades.

00:43:33.994 --> 00:43:35.994
<v Speaker 1>I think we're gonna first start with nodes

00:43:36.315 --> 00:43:38.155
<v Speaker 1>and less sort of a notification procedure to

00:43:38.155 --> 00:43:39.434
<v Speaker 1>know which nodes is sort of out of

00:43:39.434 --> 00:43:40.075
<v Speaker 1>date and

00:43:40.569 --> 00:43:43.690
<v Speaker 1>then probably move to a more automatic upgrading

00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:44.570
<v Speaker 1>of clusters

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:46.330
<v Speaker 1>for people.

00:43:46.809 --> 00:43:47.450
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm.

00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:51.210
<v Speaker 0>Alright. But I think that is,

00:43:51.369 --> 00:43:52.955
<v Speaker 1>you know, that is it. Just a small

00:43:52.955 --> 00:43:54.475
<v Speaker 1>release. Just those 1,200

00:43:54.475 --> 00:43:56.875
<v Speaker 0>features. That's that's all that is. That's fine.

00:43:57.275 --> 00:43:59.515
<v Speaker 1>And other bug fixes. So in our, like,

00:43:59.515 --> 00:44:01.515
<v Speaker 1>Teleport 10, we've sort of given people more

00:44:01.515 --> 00:44:03.915
<v Speaker 1>preview to ones that are coming in different

00:44:04.075 --> 00:44:05.435
<v Speaker 1>minor releases.

00:44:06.475 --> 00:44:08.940
<v Speaker 1>But I think we're gonna be releasing ten

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:10.540
<v Speaker 1>one in a couple of weeks.

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:12.860
<v Speaker 1>And so that would also mean that we'll

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:15.340
<v Speaker 1>upgrade Teleport Cloud instances as well.

00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:18.620
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:20.860
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, those are some pretty cool features.

00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:22.875
<v Speaker 0>I hope people are excited by that. If

00:44:22.875 --> 00:44:24.635
<v Speaker 0>you have any questions for Ben, now is

00:44:24.635 --> 00:44:25.915
<v Speaker 0>a good time to drop them into the

00:44:25.915 --> 00:44:27.835
<v Speaker 0>chat as we'll be finishing shortly.

00:44:28.075 --> 00:44:29.835
<v Speaker 0>I see we have one from Russell. And

00:44:29.835 --> 00:44:31.995
<v Speaker 0>before we tackle that, I'm gonna pop us

00:44:31.995 --> 00:44:33.115
<v Speaker 0>back over

00:44:33.515 --> 00:44:35.035
<v Speaker 0>the big facey mode. There we go.

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:38.660
<v Speaker 0>So Russell is asking if

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:40.820
<v Speaker 0>any of the databases

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:42.820
<v Speaker 0>support session recording.

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:45.780
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:48.900
<v Speaker 0>Or sorry. It says do all databases support

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:50.660
<v Speaker 0>session recording, or is it dependent on the

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:51.675
<v Speaker 0>database thing?

00:44:53.035 --> 00:44:54.875
<v Speaker 1>All of them support

00:44:54.875 --> 00:44:56.075
<v Speaker 1>audit logging,

00:44:56.315 --> 00:44:58.395
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily session recording

00:44:58.635 --> 00:45:01.115
<v Speaker 1>due to the nature of them. And, actually,

00:45:01.115 --> 00:45:02.475
<v Speaker 1>if you look at our audit logs,

00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:05.290
<v Speaker 1>what's sort of interesting is because it's sort

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:07.450
<v Speaker 1>of such a low level of the protocol,

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:09.369
<v Speaker 1>when you run, like, a get tables, it

00:45:09.369 --> 00:45:11.610
<v Speaker 1>sort of shows you what's the raw input

00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:13.210
<v Speaker 1>interpreted to the database.

00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:14.570
<v Speaker 1>And

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:18.405
<v Speaker 1>because you can make, like, multiple requests to

00:45:18.405 --> 00:45:20.085
<v Speaker 1>the database at one time, that's sort of

00:45:20.085 --> 00:45:21.445
<v Speaker 1>in our order log, but it doesn't sort

00:45:21.445 --> 00:45:23.765
<v Speaker 1>of play back in the session recording mode.

00:45:24.005 --> 00:45:25.605
<v Speaker 1>If you did want to get

00:45:25.845 --> 00:45:27.685
<v Speaker 1>session recording for what people are to your

00:45:27.685 --> 00:45:28.485
<v Speaker 1>databases,

00:45:28.645 --> 00:45:30.645
<v Speaker 1>probably what I recommend would be

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:34.540
<v Speaker 1>create a Teleport server and then use that

00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:35.660
<v Speaker 1>Teleport server

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:38.460
<v Speaker 1>with sort of MySQL or SQL tools. Then

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:40.380
<v Speaker 1>you can see both what are people doing

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:41.020
<v Speaker 1>with

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:43.100
<v Speaker 1>the their sort of, like, SQL commands.

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:44.935
<v Speaker 1>You can play that back, but you also

00:45:44.935 --> 00:45:46.454
<v Speaker 1>get the full audit log of what's happening

00:45:46.454 --> 00:45:47.735
<v Speaker 1>on the host itself.

00:45:49.015 --> 00:45:50.135
<v Speaker 1>I think that's sort of similar to what

00:45:50.135 --> 00:45:52.135
<v Speaker 1>you do at cluster, isn't it? You have

00:45:52.135 --> 00:45:53.975
<v Speaker 1>one VM that people share their

00:45:54.615 --> 00:45:55.655
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes session.

00:45:59.069 --> 00:46:00.109
<v Speaker 0>We

00:46:00.109 --> 00:46:00.750
<v Speaker 0>have

00:46:02.029 --> 00:46:03.869
<v Speaker 0>three bare metal machines

00:46:03.869 --> 00:46:06.589
<v Speaker 0>and we use Teleport SSH amongst them all

00:46:06.589 --> 00:46:08.509
<v Speaker 0>and people join the active sessions so we

00:46:08.509 --> 00:46:09.069
<v Speaker 0>can all type.

00:46:09.645 --> 00:46:11.565
<v Speaker 0>Yes. Kind of And then you get a

00:46:11.565 --> 00:46:13.085
<v Speaker 1>cube config and then, like, share that kind

00:46:13.085 --> 00:46:15.085
<v Speaker 1>of cube config in that in that way

00:46:15.085 --> 00:46:15.805
<v Speaker 1>regard.

00:46:16.365 --> 00:46:18.125
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. The cube config is available on the

00:46:18.125 --> 00:46:19.965
<v Speaker 0>control plane node and we just export an

00:46:19.965 --> 00:46:21.565
<v Speaker 0>environment variable so we can all share that.

00:46:21.565 --> 00:46:21.645
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:46:23.289 --> 00:46:25.770
<v Speaker 0>Not very sophisticated. We we should leverage more

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:27.609
<v Speaker 0>Teleport features there and hook it in to

00:46:27.609 --> 00:46:29.690
<v Speaker 0>the cluster. But by the challenge with cluster

00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:31.849
<v Speaker 0>is that people break the clusters, so we

00:46:31.849 --> 00:46:33.450
<v Speaker 0>can't Teleport

00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:35.130
<v Speaker 0>has to stay away from it, really. Right?

00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:37.645
<v Speaker 0>Otherwise, we lose access. Yeah. So we keep

00:46:37.645 --> 00:46:39.405
<v Speaker 0>Teleport in a nice little box. The golden

00:46:39.405 --> 00:46:41.565
<v Speaker 0>rule is do not break Teleport.

00:46:41.805 --> 00:46:43.805
<v Speaker 0>Break everything else, so I I I probably

00:46:43.805 --> 00:46:45.964
<v Speaker 0>can't push more of the tell the Kubernetes

00:46:45.964 --> 00:46:48.204
<v Speaker 0>features because of that reason. Would be nice,

00:46:48.204 --> 00:46:48.285
<v Speaker 0>though.

00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:54.230
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So Russell said, sorry. I used the

00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:57.030
<v Speaker 0>wrong terminology. I meant audit events. So, yes,

00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:59.110
<v Speaker 0>that is supported. Oh, yeah. Everything has audit

00:46:59.110 --> 00:46:59.830
<v Speaker 1>events.

00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:02.790
<v Speaker 1>And

00:47:03.655 --> 00:47:05.335
<v Speaker 1>the only one that didn't have it recently

00:47:05.335 --> 00:47:07.495
<v Speaker 1>was the Microsoft SQL Server, but we added

00:47:07.495 --> 00:47:08.375
<v Speaker 1>that in 10.

00:47:09.255 --> 00:47:11.495
<v Speaker 0>There we go. Another feature in 10 that

00:47:11.495 --> 00:47:13.495
<v Speaker 0>we didn't cover. Lots of them. So

00:47:15.175 --> 00:47:18.135
<v Speaker 0>alright. It looks like there's any more questions.

00:47:18.135 --> 00:47:20.040
<v Speaker 0>Russell says thank you. I'll say thank you

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.720
<v Speaker 0>to Ben. It's always a pleasure to have

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:22.600
<v Speaker 0>you join us.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.240
<v Speaker 0>Lots of things to say here with Teleport

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:25.880
<v Speaker 0>ten.

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:28.120
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna have to upgrade my infrastructure now

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:28.760
<v Speaker 0>as well.

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:31.160
<v Speaker 0>And as the new features drop, we'll be

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:33.400
<v Speaker 0>sure to get more content on Teleport on

00:47:32.895 --> 00:47:34.735
<v Speaker 0>the channel, and I'm sure we'll be back

00:47:34.735 --> 00:47:37.135
<v Speaker 0>in three months for Teleport 11. So any

00:47:37.135 --> 00:47:38.575
<v Speaker 0>last words, Ben, before I let you get

00:47:38.575 --> 00:47:40.255
<v Speaker 0>back to your to your day?

00:47:42.015 --> 00:47:44.255
<v Speaker 1>Nope. That's it. Thanks for joining everyone. If

00:47:44.255 --> 00:47:45.535
<v Speaker 1>you have any questions, you know, you can

00:47:45.535 --> 00:47:47.055
<v Speaker 1>join our community Slack channel.

00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:52.470
<v Speaker 1>But I'm pretty sure most of you guys

00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:54.309
<v Speaker 1>are already there, and I'm happy to answer

00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:55.510
<v Speaker 1>any questions that come up.

00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:58.069
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Thanks a lot. Have a good day,
