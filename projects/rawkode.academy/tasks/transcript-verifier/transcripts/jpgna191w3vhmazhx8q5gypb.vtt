00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.430
<v Speaker 0>Hello and welcome to today's episode of Clustered

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.030
<v Speaker 0>on Rawkode live.

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.950
<v Speaker 0>Wow. Today is the first version of Clustered

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.375
<v Speaker 0>Teams and I'm very excited to have a

00:02:16.375 --> 00:02:18.455
<v Speaker 0>team from container solutions and a team from

00:02:18.455 --> 00:02:19.815
<v Speaker 0>Civo Cloud here

00:02:19.974 --> 00:02:22.855
<v Speaker 0>to fix some rather broken clusters broken by

00:02:22.855 --> 00:02:23.735
<v Speaker 0>each team.

00:02:24.295 --> 00:02:26.055
<v Speaker 0>Now before we begin on that, there's just

00:02:26.055 --> 00:02:27.335
<v Speaker 0>a little bit of housekeeping.

00:02:27.495 --> 00:02:28.055
<v Speaker 0>First,

00:02:28.375 --> 00:02:30.375
<v Speaker 0>if you're not subscribed to the YouTube channel,

00:02:30.375 --> 00:02:32.750
<v Speaker 0>please do so now. This is gonna get

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.470
<v Speaker 0>you alerts and notifications for all new episodes

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.190
<v Speaker 0>as we explore the cloud native landscape

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.990
<v Speaker 0>together.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:40.350
<v Speaker 0>Also,

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.750
<v Speaker 0>Teleport joined us last week as a sponsor

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.245
<v Speaker 0>of Clustard and I was just the easiest

00:02:45.245 --> 00:02:46.765
<v Speaker 0>decision I've ever had to make when it

00:02:46.765 --> 00:02:48.525
<v Speaker 0>came to this show. Teleport has been the

00:02:48.525 --> 00:02:51.085
<v Speaker 0>software we've used ever since the second episode

00:02:51.165 --> 00:02:53.725
<v Speaker 0>and makes debugging and fixing and pairing on

00:02:53.725 --> 00:02:54.925
<v Speaker 0>broken clusters

00:02:55.405 --> 00:02:57.565
<v Speaker 0>well, as easy as it can be, but

00:02:57.565 --> 00:02:59.870
<v Speaker 0>you know, still painful. Right? It's Kubernetes.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 0>So thank you Teleport. It's been a pleasure

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.590
<v Speaker 0>working with you and I'm excited to bring

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.950
<v Speaker 0>Teleport to more people.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.630
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.590
<v Speaker 0>Housekeeping done. We're gonna start by fixing some

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.710
<v Speaker 0>broken clusters and we've got a great lineup

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 0>today.

00:03:14.805 --> 00:03:16.005
<v Speaker 0>Popping over here,

00:03:16.565 --> 00:03:18.885
<v Speaker 0>I am joined by team container solutions.

00:03:18.885 --> 00:03:20.885
<v Speaker 0>Hello all. How are you today?

00:03:21.845 --> 00:03:22.805
<v Speaker 1>Hello. Hey.

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:27.525
<v Speaker 2>Panicky at all. Not panicky at all. No.

00:03:27.525 --> 00:03:29.525
<v Speaker 0>No. I I have no idea how today's

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.860
<v Speaker 0>gonna go. Like, I'm so excited I'm so

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.659
<v Speaker 0>excited for teams edition, but also logistically, I'm

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:36.580
<v Speaker 0>like, this is gonna be interesting. I'm really

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.819
<v Speaker 0>hoping that as three colleagues, you're all just

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.820
<v Speaker 0>gonna be pairing together

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.739
<v Speaker 0>perfectly and harmoniously. Right?

00:03:44.305 --> 00:03:45.425
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

00:03:45.985 --> 00:03:48.065
<v Speaker 0>Yes. I think we should start by pointing

00:03:48.065 --> 00:03:50.145
<v Speaker 1>out, although we work together, we we're not

00:03:50.145 --> 00:03:51.665
<v Speaker 1>on the same team, we don't answer as

00:03:51.665 --> 00:03:52.225
<v Speaker 1>well.

00:03:53.985 --> 00:03:55.425
<v Speaker 1>I met I met Adrian today for the

00:03:55.425 --> 00:03:55.825
<v Speaker 1>first time.

00:03:58.219 --> 00:03:58.860
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.819
<v Speaker 0>Well, why don't oh, apparently I'm a bit

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.659
<v Speaker 0>crackling. Alright. I'll fix my big Kai. Thanks.

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.819
<v Speaker 0>Can you all do me a favor starting

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.780
<v Speaker 0>with Charlotte, Ricardo, then Adrian just say hello,

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.700
<v Speaker 0>tell us who you are and we'll get

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.819
<v Speaker 0>started on today's cluster.

00:04:13.055 --> 00:04:15.775
<v Speaker 2>Of course. Hi, everyone. I'm Charlotte. I'm an

00:04:15.775 --> 00:04:18.015
<v Speaker 2>engineering manager at Container Solutions.

00:04:18.095 --> 00:04:20.334
<v Speaker 2>Still do some technical things every now and

00:04:20.334 --> 00:04:22.575
<v Speaker 2>then, so we'll see how this goes today.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.630
<v Speaker 0>Ricardo?

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh, sorry.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.190
<v Speaker 1>Hi.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.510
<v Speaker 1>I was looking at Adrian's.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.389
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. My name is Ricardo. I'm a I'm

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.030
<v Speaker 1>a cloud native engineer at continuous solutions. I've

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.615
<v Speaker 1>been playing around with Kubernetes for the over

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:42.655
<v Speaker 1>a year. I'm having a lot of fun

00:04:42.655 --> 00:04:43.215
<v Speaker 1>there.

00:04:44.014 --> 00:04:45.535
<v Speaker 1>I'm based in Portugal.

00:04:48.255 --> 00:04:49.855
<v Speaker 1>Hi. I'm Adrian.

00:04:49.935 --> 00:04:52.255
<v Speaker 1>I should have my surname because I don't

00:04:52.255 --> 00:04:53.854
<v Speaker 1>know why you can't call me as Adrian.

00:04:53.854 --> 00:04:54.495
<v Speaker 1>But, anyway

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.960
<v Speaker 1>yeah, I'm chief scientist at Container Solutions, but

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.960
<v Speaker 1>I really look after our labs projects. So

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.360
<v Speaker 1>it's like all our open source projects at

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.640
<v Speaker 1>Container Solutions.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.800
<v Speaker 1>So whilst I do do a fair bit

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.800
<v Speaker 1>of Kubernetes, it's on the development side, and

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.865
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really used to maintaining clusters. I've

00:05:09.865 --> 00:05:12.265
<v Speaker 1>done notice I'm getting my excuses in fast.

00:05:14.425 --> 00:05:16.345
<v Speaker 0>Nothing wrong with getting an odd excuse in

00:05:16.345 --> 00:05:18.105
<v Speaker 0>early. All part of the game.

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:21.625
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So here are the rules.

00:05:21.865 --> 00:05:23.065
<v Speaker 0>You have

00:05:23.225 --> 00:05:24.025
<v Speaker 0>forty minutes

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.990
<v Speaker 0>to work on the SQL cloud cluster.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.430
<v Speaker 0>Your mission is to upgrade the cluster deployment

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.110
<v Speaker 0>from the v one image to the v

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.910
<v Speaker 0>two image,

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.390
<v Speaker 0>be able to access the application,

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:36.830
<v Speaker 0>see the quotes,

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.270
<v Speaker 0>and the video.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.390
<v Speaker 0>Simple.

00:05:40.335 --> 00:05:42.495
<v Speaker 0>I have I also caveat this. I have

00:05:42.495 --> 00:05:44.415
<v Speaker 0>no idea what either team has done to

00:05:44.415 --> 00:05:46.175
<v Speaker 1>their clusters. I will be of no help

00:05:46.175 --> 00:05:48.735
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever to you. I am here purely for

00:05:48.735 --> 00:05:49.855
<v Speaker 0>moral support.

00:05:50.495 --> 00:05:53.295
<v Speaker 0>Now, I'm gonna pop up our screen share

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.880
<v Speaker 0>like so. This

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.160
<v Speaker 0>is teleport. I will open the first session

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.560
<v Speaker 0>on the control plane node for you. If

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.400
<v Speaker 0>you can all join

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.360
<v Speaker 0>and just give me an echo hello to

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.720
<v Speaker 0>let me know that you're yet let you

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.360

<v Speaker 0>me know that you're there and if you

00:06:11.235 --> 00:06:12.835
<v Speaker 0>wanna nominate one of you to start with

00:06:12.835 --> 00:06:14.675
<v Speaker 0>a typing that might work best.

00:06:15.074 --> 00:06:16.595
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure. We'll see.

00:06:18.275 --> 00:06:20.195
<v Speaker 0>And I'm just gonna spend today's session looking

00:06:20.195 --> 00:06:21.715
<v Speaker 0>at the chat. Alright.

00:06:23.555 --> 00:06:24.835
<v Speaker 0>We got an echo hi. So at least

00:06:24.835 --> 00:06:27.634
<v Speaker 0>one of you and

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.900
<v Speaker 0>two. Alright.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.740
<v Speaker 0>Who quotes their echoes? Come on.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.

00:06:41.315 --> 00:06:43.715
<v Speaker 0>Alright. It looks like we have three guests

00:06:43.715 --> 00:06:45.075
<v Speaker 0>all in this session.

00:06:45.715 --> 00:06:46.515
<v Speaker 2>Disappointed

00:06:46.515 --> 00:06:48.515
<v Speaker 2>with the lack of all caps from you

00:06:48.515 --> 00:06:50.195
<v Speaker 2>guys but this is okay.

00:06:51.795 --> 00:06:53.795
<v Speaker 0>Alright. This best not to start fighting just

00:06:53.795 --> 00:06:55.635
<v Speaker 0>yet. He's gotta work together as a team

00:06:55.635 --> 00:06:58.150
<v Speaker 0>to fix this. Alright. You'll need to set

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.710
<v Speaker 0>up your cube config and any aliases that

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.150
<v Speaker 0>you need and then if you want to

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.550
<v Speaker 0>do the honors and check for a API

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.470
<v Speaker 0>server, it's usually a pretty good place to

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:06.949
<v Speaker 0>start.

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:09.915
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. You be an existing. If you want

00:07:09.915 --> 00:07:11.275
<v Speaker 0>me to set up the cube config, I'd

00:07:11.275 --> 00:07:12.155
<v Speaker 0>be happy to do that. If you want

00:07:12.155 --> 00:07:13.835
<v Speaker 0>to it yourself, please feel free.

00:07:17.995 --> 00:07:19.995
<v Speaker 1>Ticket Charlotte says you type in. Right?

00:07:20.475 --> 00:07:22.660
<v Speaker 2>Yes. Is that alright? Am I so slow?

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.340
<v Speaker 1>Works for me. There's a feature request for

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.660
<v Speaker 0>teleport, actually. We need colored cursors so we

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:30.340
<v Speaker 0>know who's typing. Certificates.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:30.740
<v Speaker 2>Why?

00:07:34.865 --> 00:07:36.865
<v Speaker 1>Current time is after

00:07:36.944 --> 00:07:38.145
<v Speaker 1>last year.

00:07:40.065 --> 00:07:41.825
<v Speaker 1>So certificates expired.

00:07:43.745 --> 00:07:44.385
<v Speaker 1>Classic.

00:07:44.705 --> 00:07:45.985
<v Speaker 1>Oh, it's a date. No. Hang on. Oh,

00:07:45.985 --> 00:07:47.425
<v Speaker 1>jeez. Check the current date. It's a date

00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:47.985
<v Speaker 1>in the past.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.260
<v Speaker 2>Oh, current time today.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.540
<v Speaker 2>That's fine. Current time's after. Oh, yeah. Okay.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.300
<v Speaker 1>So that's when the certificate expired, is it

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.180
<v Speaker 1>2020?

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.380
<v Speaker 2>Who wants to go to renew certificates?

00:08:10.785 --> 00:08:12.945
<v Speaker 1>For all the searches, under manifest?

00:08:13.825 --> 00:08:14.865
<v Speaker 1>API server.

00:08:16.729 --> 00:08:17.050
<v Speaker 1>There.

00:08:28.665 --> 00:08:29.545
<v Speaker 3>Why

00:08:35.385 --> 00:08:37.544
<v Speaker 2>So what's because that number does oh.

00:08:38.745 --> 00:08:39.385
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:08:39.705 --> 00:08:41.225
<v Speaker 1>I was just gonna say what cert does

00:08:41.225 --> 00:08:44.500
<v Speaker 1>the kubelet use? The API server or something.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.420
<v Speaker 1>Is that API server cert? I mean, I

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.100
<v Speaker 1>know it's in the kubelet config.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.540
<v Speaker 2>Don't know.

00:08:54.579 --> 00:08:56.899
<v Speaker 1>The 2019 is what I mean about here.

00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:59.975
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'm loving the timestamps on those files.

00:09:06.855 --> 00:09:08.935
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I can scroll in here. Yes.

00:09:11.495 --> 00:09:13.440
<v Speaker 0>You can each scroll independently.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.360
<v Speaker 0>If there's something you want me to show

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.560
<v Speaker 0>to the audience, let me know and I'll

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.840
<v Speaker 0>do my best to scroll on my side

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.040
<v Speaker 0>so they can keep up.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh, cool. Okay. Okay.

00:09:28.765 --> 00:09:30.525
<v Speaker 2>I mean, these ones. Right?

00:09:33.565 --> 00:09:35.165
<v Speaker 2>Is one of you looking at part of

00:09:35.165 --> 00:09:35.885
<v Speaker 2>your new certificate?

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:38.860
<v Speaker 0>I thought we just set the date two

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.300
<v Speaker 1>years in the past and see what happens.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.140
<v Speaker 0>We had a comment from that in the

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.140
<v Speaker 0>chat. Diego is suggesting just change the date

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.020
<v Speaker 0>on the machine.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:46.620
<v Speaker 0>There

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.940
<v Speaker 0>are rules to clustered and messing with the

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.740
<v Speaker 0>dates will break all certificates and couldn't teleport.

00:09:51.825 --> 00:09:53.985
<v Speaker 0>So we'd probably lose access to the machine,

00:09:53.985 --> 00:09:55.425
<v Speaker 0>but I do not recommend it. That's good

00:09:55.425 --> 00:09:56.305
<v Speaker 2>to know. But

00:09:56.785 --> 00:09:58.145
<v Speaker 1>then we're done. We just go home.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I have no idea to rotate the

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.680
<v Speaker 1>certificate to be perfectly honest.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.600
<v Speaker 1>So So you can use QPDM to renew

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.320
<v Speaker 0>search. You don't need to learn open SSL

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.520
<v Speaker 0>commands or anything like that.

00:10:19.675 --> 00:10:20.795
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:10:20.795 --> 00:10:22.154
<v Speaker 0>There is actually PDM. So I see I

00:10:22.154 --> 00:10:24.074
<v Speaker 0>see you're onto it now. I can't see

00:10:24.074 --> 00:10:25.514
<v Speaker 2>the bottom of the screen.

00:10:25.995 --> 00:10:26.475
<v Speaker 2>You

00:10:27.194 --> 00:10:28.795
<v Speaker 1>can't see it. Can't scroll for some reason.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.900
<v Speaker 0>If you can't scroll, if you just like

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.220
<v Speaker 0>resize your window a tiny little millimeter, it

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.340
<v Speaker 0>seems to fix it.

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:36.540
<v Speaker 0>It's a

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.060
<v Speaker 0>it's just a wee frustrating. But like if

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:40.940
<v Speaker 0>you just like

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.265
<v Speaker 0>drag the corner of your browser window and

00:10:43.265 --> 00:10:44.305
<v Speaker 0>make it a little bigger and then a

00:10:44.305 --> 00:10:46.465
<v Speaker 0>little smaller, it try it fixes the scroll.

00:10:46.865 --> 00:10:48.465
<v Speaker 0>It's like a sync event that happens when

00:10:48.465 --> 00:10:50.465
<v Speaker 0>people join. I'm not really sure what what

00:10:51.105 --> 00:10:52.145
<v Speaker 1>the problem is.

00:10:53.185 --> 00:10:53.985
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:10:54.065 --> 00:10:54.705
<v Speaker 1>What's that?

00:10:55.769 --> 00:10:58.170
<v Speaker 0>The CVO team are vocal in the chat

00:10:58.170 --> 00:10:59.529
<v Speaker 0>and they say they're here if you want

00:10:59.529 --> 00:11:00.330
<v Speaker 0>hints.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:06.330
<v Speaker 1>No. We'll try and fix this first. That's

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.010
<v Speaker 0>gonna be the stone snippet when I publish

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:09.930
<v Speaker 0>this after you you feel measurably Adrian.

00:11:10.385 --> 00:11:12.465
<v Speaker 0>We'll be fine. Sorry.

00:11:13.985 --> 00:11:16.545
<v Speaker 0>That's harsh. That's harsh for me. Okay.

00:11:19.985 --> 00:11:20.945
<v Speaker 1>They're all involved.

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Up next, it's Jason.

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:29.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:31.350
<v Speaker 1>I

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.510
<v Speaker 0>guess we're pointing out. Doesn't matter what the

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:37.350
<v Speaker 0>project does. It's not just shell. Does that

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.070
<v Speaker 0>sorry. Let me go.

00:11:40.805 --> 00:11:42.085
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:11:44.565 --> 00:11:45.205
<v Speaker 1>We

00:11:46.165 --> 00:11:48.325
<v Speaker 1>can't we can't even do that because we

00:11:48.325 --> 00:11:49.045
<v Speaker 1>can't talk to the

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:55.170
<v Speaker 2>Good. I need to need to start with

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:56.450
<v Speaker 2>the API server.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:58.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:02.530
<v Speaker 1>No. Yeah. I think there's no dash.

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:05.010
<v Speaker 2>Isn't there renew everything that's expired?

00:12:07.695 --> 00:12:10.335
<v Speaker 1>Is it dash dash l? Oh, yeah.

00:12:11.935 --> 00:12:13.775
<v Speaker 0>I'm doing my best on ace. It's just

00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:14.895
<v Speaker 1>the all there.

00:12:16.335 --> 00:12:17.855
<v Speaker 1>And there's no Did you try to renew

00:12:17.855 --> 00:12:19.295
<v Speaker 1>all before? Didn't like it.

00:12:19.935 --> 00:12:23.020
<v Speaker 2>I tried this with minus minus, but. No.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:25.900
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay. And let's restart.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.780
<v Speaker 1>Restart everything now though. System c t l.

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:31.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh, those are the pods. Right? Oh, if

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.220
<v Speaker 2>I restart the cube load on this one,

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.100
<v Speaker 2>it should restart everything.

00:12:38.115 --> 00:12:38.835
<v Speaker 0>So these are

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:56.690
<v Speaker 0>It's looking healthy.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:58.210
<v Speaker 0>Good.

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Hey. Think Okay.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:03.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:13:04.475 --> 00:13:07.275
<v Speaker 1>Looks good. I hate whoever does start breaking,

00:13:07.275 --> 00:13:09.915
<v Speaker 2>by the way. No offense to see what

00:13:09.915 --> 00:13:11.835
<v Speaker 0>he can has been broken, so I'm gonna

00:13:11.835 --> 00:13:13.595
<v Speaker 1>be completely useless again.

00:13:15.595 --> 00:13:16.475
<v Speaker 2>Alright.

00:13:16.715 --> 00:13:18.635
<v Speaker 1>Although maybe it could just be affected by

00:13:18.635 --> 00:13:19.195
<v Speaker 1>the

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:23.170
<v Speaker 1>So some configuration error in Cilium.

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:25.810
<v Speaker 0>That's your first ten minutes down. You've got

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:27.090
<v Speaker 0>thirty five left.

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.010
<v Speaker 0>I'm sure that's all they did. I'm sure,

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:34.290
<v Speaker 0>Sivo, were really nice to you.

00:13:36.805 --> 00:13:37.685
<v Speaker 2>I hope.

00:13:39.205 --> 00:13:41.445
<v Speaker 1>This node shell. What's that node shell completed?

00:13:41.445 --> 00:13:42.485
<v Speaker 1>That looked weird.

00:13:45.365 --> 00:13:47.845
<v Speaker 1>That worries me. This node shell completed the

00:13:47.845 --> 00:13:48.805
<v Speaker 1>job thing.

00:13:49.605 --> 00:13:50.565
<v Speaker 1>Must keep the system.

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Hube API server isn't running. Oh, no. This

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:02.910
<v Speaker 1>isn't ready.

00:14:05.055 --> 00:14:07.295
<v Speaker 0>There's a lot of restarts we've got there.

00:14:07.855 --> 00:14:08.575
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:14:09.214 --> 00:14:11.135
<v Speaker 2>Are you seeing a different screen for me?

00:14:11.695 --> 00:14:13.774
<v Speaker 2>Me? Because mine says cube based, so we're

00:14:13.774 --> 00:14:14.415
<v Speaker 2>fine.

00:14:14.895 --> 00:14:17.214
<v Speaker 0>It looks fine over here too. Mine mine

00:14:17.214 --> 00:14:17.935
<v Speaker 1>is fine as well.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:23.150
<v Speaker 0>Adrian's working with one of his own clusters,

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.950
<v Speaker 0>I think, here.

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:28.110
<v Speaker 1>That's called up. Okay.

00:14:35.795 --> 00:14:37.475
<v Speaker 2>Just gonna look and see them for now.

00:14:37.475 --> 00:14:39.555
<v Speaker 1>It says restart once because it worked when

00:14:39.555 --> 00:14:41.635
<v Speaker 1>restarted. That's all it is. I was looking

00:14:41.635 --> 00:14:42.675
<v Speaker 1>at the old one.

00:14:45.235 --> 00:14:46.115
<v Speaker 1>Oh,

00:14:47.155 --> 00:14:49.235
<v Speaker 2>you're scrolling in your own version? Okay.

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:03.529
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. It still works.

00:15:13.985 --> 00:15:16.385
<v Speaker 0>So what are you thinking right now? Any

00:15:16.385 --> 00:15:17.105
<v Speaker 0>ideas?

00:15:17.425 --> 00:15:20.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking we cannot connect to the Cyllium

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:23.590
<v Speaker 2>agent on the worker, which makes sense because

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:25.750
<v Speaker 2>the worker isn't running.

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:28.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting a lot of helpful info from

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:30.310
<v Speaker 2>the pod itself.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:31.990
<v Speaker 1>I thought you're gonna say for me.

00:15:34.645 --> 00:15:36.325
<v Speaker 2>Which would be accurate if I tell you

00:15:36.325 --> 00:15:37.765
<v Speaker 1>anything about Cilium.

00:15:43.285 --> 00:15:44.965
<v Speaker 1>I mean, can we I think you already

00:15:45.045 --> 00:15:46.485
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So it looks like the Cilium crash

00:15:46.485 --> 00:15:48.520
<v Speaker 0>that back off is on worker x c

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.040
<v Speaker 0>x. Would you like me to open a

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.400
<v Speaker 0>session on that machine?

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.520
<v Speaker 2>Yes. But give me a second first.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.160
<v Speaker 0>Of course. So I'll check if it's in

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:57.960
<v Speaker 2>the logs.

00:15:58.839 --> 00:16:00.680
<v Speaker 2>Where? I lost my screen.

00:16:02.705 --> 00:16:04.225
<v Speaker 2>Okay. I'm back.

00:16:08.865 --> 00:16:10.145
<v Speaker 2>Difficulty isn't oh.

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.730
<v Speaker 0>I do love the delete all approach. That's

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:19.730
<v Speaker 0>one of my favorite techniques on this show.

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:22.850
<v Speaker 1>You've been criticized about several times I believe.

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:25.330
<v Speaker 0>I know. Because that's how I also usually

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:28.050
<v Speaker 0>upgrade applications and people keep giving me grief.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:29.810
<v Speaker 2>To be fair in this case, the only

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:31.385
<v Speaker 2>ones I wouldn't have had to restart are

00:16:31.385 --> 00:16:34.425
<v Speaker 2>the Hubble ones and they probably don't break

00:16:34.425 --> 00:16:35.145
<v Speaker 2>anything.

00:16:38.345 --> 00:16:40.905
<v Speaker 0>Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

00:16:43.545 --> 00:16:44.265
<v Speaker 1>What yeah.

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:50.830
<v Speaker 1>Must be sticking that.

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:56.190
<v Speaker 1>That's the API server

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:58.270
<v Speaker 1>IP. Correct?

00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:59.710
<v Speaker 0>That's

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:00.589
<v Speaker 0>not looking healthy.

00:17:05.474 --> 00:17:07.315
<v Speaker 0>Yep. I lead the star approach.

00:17:07.315 --> 00:17:08.755
<v Speaker 0>The delete hammer of doom.

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.900
<v Speaker 0>So what does it mean if you've got

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.300
<v Speaker 0>deployments, replica sets and no pods?

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:29.020
<v Speaker 2>So usually, I'd say that's something with a

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:29.900
<v Speaker 2>scheduler,

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:31.260
<v Speaker 2>but since

00:17:32.275 --> 00:17:33.875
<v Speaker 2>oh, right. I checked for the pod and

00:17:33.875 --> 00:17:35.075
<v Speaker 2>not the record. Oh, because it's

00:17:37.075 --> 00:17:38.595
<v Speaker 2>let's check here.

00:17:40.195 --> 00:17:41.795
<v Speaker 1>What was that? Is that the screen port?

00:17:41.795 --> 00:17:42.595
<v Speaker 1>No. It's for the record. Yeah.

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:53.350
<v Speaker 1>Replicas two current, two desired, zero running, zero

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.990
<v Speaker 1>waiting.

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:56.870
<v Speaker 2>Desired as a two.

00:18:01.315 --> 00:18:01.955
<v Speaker 4>So

00:18:07.395 --> 00:18:08.914
<v Speaker 0>you mentioned scheduler.

00:18:08.914 --> 00:18:10.674
<v Speaker 0>What was your thought process there?

00:18:11.635 --> 00:18:14.170
<v Speaker 2>Usually, when a pod doesn't show up, it

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:16.570
<v Speaker 2>doesn't show up at all, like, isn't that

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:18.250
<v Speaker 2>means it isn't scheduled. Right?

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Can you Shall we check the configurations there

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:22.650
<v Speaker 1>and see? You

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:24.330
<v Speaker 1>could do cry CTL and see the pods

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:25.370
<v Speaker 1>are running there, but it needs to be

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:26.090
<v Speaker 0>in the work or no.

00:18:28.585 --> 00:18:29.784
<v Speaker 2>Give second.

00:18:29.865 --> 00:18:30.505
<v Speaker 2>These

00:18:31.305 --> 00:18:32.825
<v Speaker 2>ones were worrying for you. Right?

00:18:35.385 --> 00:18:37.065
<v Speaker 0>And maybe we wouldn't delete any more pods

00:18:37.065 --> 00:18:37.945
<v Speaker 0>for a bit.

00:18:39.625 --> 00:18:40.665
<v Speaker 2>It's really not those.

00:18:42.559 --> 00:18:44.640
<v Speaker 1>Feel like he's walked into a bear trap

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.200
<v Speaker 1>there.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.080
<v Speaker 0>So I'll give you some

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.040
<v Speaker 0>info. Like if it was the scheduler, the

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.480
<v Speaker 0>pod would be created.

00:18:52.559 --> 00:18:54.000
<v Speaker 0>It would just wouldn't be assigned to a

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.360
<v Speaker 0>node yet. It wouldn't be able to be

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:55.760
<v Speaker 0>created.

00:18:56.284 --> 00:18:56.605
<v Speaker 0>I

00:18:57.245 --> 00:18:58.845
<v Speaker 0>but I don't see anything there. I don't

00:18:58.845 --> 00:19:00.924
<v Speaker 0>see anything to resemble a pod.

00:19:02.684 --> 00:19:04.445
<v Speaker 2>Nobody could just schedule and you'll know it

00:19:04.445 --> 00:19:05.724
<v Speaker 2>doesn't even stuff there.

00:19:07.085 --> 00:19:07.645
<v Speaker 2>Sure.

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:11.030
<v Speaker 0>Some great taps from Waleed in the chat

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:12.310
<v Speaker 0>if you want me to pop one on

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:13.030
<v Speaker 0>the screen.

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:17.429
<v Speaker 1>You. Network policy.

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:19.910
<v Speaker 0>Alright. The replica set is not creating, then

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:22.309
<v Speaker 0>check the controllers and the API server.

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:23.910
<v Speaker 1>No controllers.

00:19:27.365 --> 00:19:29.685
<v Speaker 1>Look at the API resources as well.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.140
<v Speaker 2>They're not there. That might be Yeah. There's

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.580
<v Speaker 0>no controller manager.

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:19:53.045 --> 00:19:55.365
<v Speaker 0>Really suggest that Siebel have invented a new

00:19:55.365 --> 00:19:57.445
<v Speaker 0>technology, invisible pods.

00:19:58.725 --> 00:20:01.205
<v Speaker 1>This isn't particularly useful, unfortunately.

00:20:03.205 --> 00:20:05.285
<v Speaker 0>Siebel do build some pretty cool stuff, but

00:20:05.285 --> 00:20:06.565
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure if that's on their road

00:20:06.565 --> 00:20:06.805
<v Speaker 0>map.

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.200
<v Speaker 2>Where did the

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.560
<v Speaker 2>static pod logs go? That was bar log

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:12.720
<v Speaker 2>containers.

00:20:21.895 --> 00:20:23.575
<v Speaker 1>What is this node shell stuff? Have a

00:20:23.575 --> 00:20:25.975
<v Speaker 1>look at that. Is that something normal?

00:20:26.615 --> 00:20:27.335
<v Speaker 1>No.

00:20:27.735 --> 00:20:28.455
<v Speaker 1>No.

00:20:30.695 --> 00:20:31.895
<v Speaker 1>What's in the log?

00:20:32.055 --> 00:20:33.415
<v Speaker 2>There's no logs in there.

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:35.940
<v Speaker 1>That's rubbish.

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:36.899
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:41.860
<v Speaker 1>Can we run system CTL as well? Maybe

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:44.500
<v Speaker 1>there's something Still looking at the schedule logs

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:45.220
<v Speaker 2>for a second.

00:20:52.065 --> 00:20:53.425
<v Speaker 2>It looks fine, though.

00:20:55.105 --> 00:20:57.745
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it? Just your system system CTL status

00:20:57.745 --> 00:20:58.145
<v Speaker 1>as well.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:02.760
<v Speaker 2>That's on

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:04.520
<v Speaker 2>yeah. That's on here.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. One for sure.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.720
<v Speaker 2>Do the do those have services, the scheduler?

00:21:12.674 --> 00:21:13.554
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.

00:21:14.434 --> 00:21:15.154
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:21:17.875 --> 00:21:20.515
<v Speaker 0>So have confirmed that node shell is nothing

00:21:20.515 --> 00:21:22.275
<v Speaker 0>to be worried about. It's just part of

00:21:22.275 --> 00:21:23.955
<v Speaker 0>k nine s, which I think they were

00:21:23.955 --> 00:21:25.075
<v Speaker 0>using for playing around.

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:28.530
<v Speaker 2>Okay. Line 38

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:30.850
<v Speaker 1>in Oh, look. Could not process mine. There

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:32.370
<v Speaker 1>you go. I think you found it.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:36.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Okay. So there's something wrong and there

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:37.090
<v Speaker 1>was Kubernetes

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:38.290
<v Speaker 1>manifest.

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:38.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:21:40.095 --> 00:21:41.934
<v Speaker 0>A shame there's no GitHub code pilot for

00:21:41.934 --> 00:21:42.735
<v Speaker 0>Vim. Yeah.

00:21:43.615 --> 00:21:45.615
<v Speaker 1>Did you hit Vim there? Because the first

00:21:45.695 --> 00:21:47.855
<v Speaker 1>the place where it started might have been

00:21:49.295 --> 00:21:51.375
<v Speaker 0>That's that's that's always a good giveaway I

00:21:51.375 --> 00:21:51.934
<v Speaker 0>found.

00:21:52.815 --> 00:21:54.175
<v Speaker 2>Oh, yeah. Because that's a pub.

00:21:57.799 --> 00:21:59.880
<v Speaker 0>What's the Vim command to show spaces and

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:00.600
<v Speaker 0>tabs?

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.960
<v Speaker 2>Something? I don't remember. Was just curious if

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:06.440
<v Speaker 0>anyone knew.

00:22:09.815 --> 00:22:11.015
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.

00:22:18.615 --> 00:22:20.135
<v Speaker 1>Can can you see the whole of that

00:22:20.135 --> 00:22:21.815
<v Speaker 1>on your screen? If

00:22:22.535 --> 00:22:24.215
<v Speaker 2>I scroll to the right, you can't?

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.039
<v Speaker 1>Oh, maybe I can. Don't know. So

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.600
<v Speaker 0>with journal control, there's arguments to the it

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.360
<v Speaker 0>wraps it properly. If you need to do

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.799
<v Speaker 0>it again, I'll I'll throw one out at

00:22:34.799 --> 00:22:35.040
<v Speaker 0>you.

00:22:38.764 --> 00:22:39.884
<v Speaker 2>At mission control

00:22:40.284 --> 00:22:42.125
<v Speaker 1>Sorry. Yeah. Was is there a mission controller

00:22:42.125 --> 00:22:43.965
<v Speaker 1>running? Let's just kill any of the mission

00:22:43.965 --> 00:22:44.764
<v Speaker 1>controllers.

00:22:46.605 --> 00:22:48.445
<v Speaker 1>Burn them in hell. I'm gonna get a

00:22:48.445 --> 00:22:50.445
<v Speaker 0>t shirt that says it's always with mission

00:22:50.445 --> 00:22:51.245
<v Speaker 0>controllers

00:22:51.245 --> 00:22:52.684
<v Speaker 0>except when there's finalizers.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:59.390
<v Speaker 2>Mission controllers are added here somewhere. Right? API

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:00.190
<v Speaker 2>server?

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:04.750
<v Speaker 0>Depends what type of admission controller.

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:07.195
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It run you know, when that is

00:23:07.195 --> 00:23:09.354
<v Speaker 1>API resources or just gets

00:23:10.075 --> 00:23:11.354
<v Speaker 1>admission controls.

00:23:11.355 --> 00:23:13.434
<v Speaker 0>I gotta agree with Nolan. This putting tabs

00:23:13.434 --> 00:23:14.715
<v Speaker 0>in YAML is evil.

00:23:17.034 --> 00:23:17.995
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Actually,

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.279
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna. Sorry.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:21.720
<v Speaker 2>No.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.239
<v Speaker 1>No.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.555
<v Speaker 1>No. No. That's It's a great tip to

00:23:31.555 --> 00:23:33.315
<v Speaker 0>cat dash t apparently.

00:23:33.315 --> 00:23:34.995
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming shows tabs.

00:23:35.155 --> 00:23:37.635
<v Speaker 0>Didn't know that. Oh, really? Yeah. Cool. Oh,

00:23:37.635 --> 00:23:38.275
<v Speaker 2>nice.

00:23:40.755 --> 00:23:42.835
<v Speaker 2>Okay. So

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:51.929
<v Speaker 2>Webhooks.

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:54.330
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember. Who's googling?

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:57.450
<v Speaker 1>We can just do kubectl

00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:00.375
<v Speaker 1>get under Webhooks now. Yes. You can do

00:24:00.375 --> 00:24:01.895
<v Speaker 0>a Kube control get, and there are two

00:24:01.895 --> 00:24:04.375
<v Speaker 0>types of admission controller. There's validating

00:24:04.615 --> 00:24:05.655
<v Speaker 0>web configuration

00:24:05.655 --> 00:24:09.335
<v Speaker 0>and mutating. Yeah. Yeah. So Kube CKL get

00:24:09.335 --> 00:24:11.335
<v Speaker 1>and validate the mission. Yeah.

00:24:12.295 --> 00:24:14.295
<v Speaker 1>I suspect there's gonna be mutating, but anyway.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:18.480
<v Speaker 1>It Permission was a validating wrapper configurations.

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:21.920
<v Speaker 2>And unpacked.

00:24:29.045 --> 00:24:30.325
<v Speaker 0>And mutating.

00:24:30.325 --> 00:24:33.205
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. You can also run kubectl API dash

00:24:33.205 --> 00:24:35.125
<v Speaker 0>resources to get a list of. Yeah.

00:24:36.005 --> 00:24:37.044
<v Speaker 0>Oh, look at that.

00:24:39.685 --> 00:24:41.685
<v Speaker 1>Describe it, I suppose, or that or kill

00:24:41.685 --> 00:24:41.925
<v Speaker 1>it.

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:45.650
<v Speaker 2>I would have failed it if the describe

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:47.650
<v Speaker 2>works. You know, I don't know. Deleting pods

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:49.730
<v Speaker 0>got you in trouble earlier. So, you know.

00:24:55.025 --> 00:24:55.744
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:24:56.465 --> 00:24:58.865
<v Speaker 1>Daily policy fail. So it's not gonna yeah.

00:24:58.865 --> 00:25:00.225
<v Speaker 1>So that's not gonna let you start new

00:25:00.225 --> 00:25:01.585
<v Speaker 1>pods. So that was

00:25:02.145 --> 00:25:04.225
<v Speaker 1>that's probably what's So the So the starting.

00:25:04.225 --> 00:25:06.145
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So that would make sense. Right? The

00:25:06.145 --> 00:25:07.505
<v Speaker 1>the pods didn't come up, and it's because

00:25:07.505 --> 00:25:09.309
<v Speaker 1>that was stopping it.

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:13.630
<v Speaker 0>All of these faults or things the civil

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:16.269
<v Speaker 0>team have done or had customers done to

00:25:16.269 --> 00:25:18.669
<v Speaker 0>themselves. That's good to know. Real world situation.

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:19.709
<v Speaker 1>Themselves.

00:25:20.269 --> 00:25:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Like, it was all your fault, customers.

00:25:27.715 --> 00:25:29.154
<v Speaker 1>Did we get rid of the machine tool

00:25:29.154 --> 00:25:30.195
<v Speaker 2>or what's that one?

00:25:31.154 --> 00:25:33.235
<v Speaker 0>Yes. That was deleted. I deleted it. Yeah.

00:25:33.235 --> 00:25:35.235
<v Speaker 2>It's

00:25:35.235 --> 00:25:36.914
<v Speaker 0>always funny when those things come back, though.

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:44.250
<v Speaker 2>Nope. I guess. Yeah. Yeah. I got any

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:45.530
<v Speaker 1>pods starting up?

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:47.130
<v Speaker 1>No.

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:49.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh, if you're looking to see your news,

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:50.730
<v Speaker 1>there's pods coming up.

00:25:52.774 --> 00:25:53.254
<v Speaker 2>Cilium

00:25:53.654 --> 00:25:54.294
<v Speaker 2>Oops.

00:25:58.774 --> 00:25:59.575
<v Speaker 1>Pending.

00:25:59.575 --> 00:25:59.815
<v Speaker 1>So

00:26:01.335 --> 00:26:02.054
<v Speaker 2>Nice.

00:26:02.534 --> 00:26:03.174
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:26:05.095 --> 00:26:06.615
<v Speaker 1>Who's got the show in the background?

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:09.220
<v Speaker 2>Mommy.

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:11.059
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I think it might be on my

00:26:11.059 --> 00:26:11.700
<v Speaker 1>side.

00:26:13.059 --> 00:26:15.220
<v Speaker 1>Sorry about that. It's all good.

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:21.460
<v Speaker 1>You're in Portugal, so can't even make a

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:22.100
<v Speaker 1>football joke.

00:26:24.075 --> 00:26:25.355
<v Speaker 1>That'll be too easy.

00:26:31.755 --> 00:26:33.915
<v Speaker 2>Fifteen minutes ago, I was still there. Okay.

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:38.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh, it's kind of funny when I scroll.

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:42.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:43.739
<v Speaker 2>not quite sure.

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:47.660
<v Speaker 0>Well, at least you've got pods that are

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:48.460
<v Speaker 0>just pending there.

00:26:51.044 --> 00:26:53.525
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. This failed to fetch token doesn't sound

00:26:53.525 --> 00:26:54.484
<v Speaker 1>great, is it?

00:26:55.845 --> 00:26:58.005
<v Speaker 1>That's thirty minutes ago. That was thirty minutes

00:26:58.005 --> 00:26:59.445
<v Speaker 2>ago. Think that was still a certificate.

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:07.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Can we

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:12.909
<v Speaker 1>can you describe the replica set or the

00:27:12.909 --> 00:27:14.029
<v Speaker 1>pod? Can we

00:27:14.509 --> 00:27:17.309
<v Speaker 1>did it give us a

00:27:16.115 --> 00:27:17.715
<v Speaker 1>indication why it was pending?

00:27:18.355 --> 00:27:19.955
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. If you just scrape the pods, you'll

00:27:19.955 --> 00:27:22.355
<v Speaker 2>get the event on. Because it's still

00:27:26.115 --> 00:27:27.795
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's still mentioning the certificates.

00:27:28.519 --> 00:27:30.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Because they're not assigned to any node

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:30.759
<v Speaker 2>yet.

00:27:36.039 --> 00:27:37.960
<v Speaker 1>But if we describe the replica set, will

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.799
<v Speaker 1>not tell us what's If you describe the

00:27:39.799 --> 00:27:41.399
<v Speaker 0>pod, it will tell you what it's waiting

00:27:41.399 --> 00:27:41.639
<v Speaker 0>for.

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:58.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean, events are usually at the bottom.

00:27:58.150 --> 00:27:58.790
<v Speaker 2>Right? So that should

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:07.590
<v Speaker 0>There's a

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:09.990
<v Speaker 0>Charlotte's first guess was right.

00:28:11.525 --> 00:28:14.244
<v Speaker 0>No. No. There's none. Scheduler? Indeed.

00:28:19.605 --> 00:28:20.325
<v Speaker 2>So

00:28:20.725 --> 00:28:23.525
<v Speaker 1>We fixed the static manifest. What do you

00:28:23.525 --> 00:28:23.924
<v Speaker 1>call them?

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:28.150
<v Speaker 2>We fixed the controller manager.

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:30.630
<v Speaker 2>We did not fix the scheduler

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:33.110
<v Speaker 2>if that is broken. There's two. Maybe I

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:34.310
<v Speaker 2>looked at the wrong one. Why don't we

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:35.670
<v Speaker 1>just do now the star shell and see

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:36.630
<v Speaker 1>what the edit is?

00:28:40.845 --> 00:28:43.725
<v Speaker 1>I'll do a find dash dash anything.

00:28:45.565 --> 00:28:47.405
<v Speaker 1>Find slash. What are you looking for?

00:28:50.179 --> 00:28:52.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm just one of the edited other commands,

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:55.139
<v Speaker 1>other stuff in the it's the Kubernetes.

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:01.539
<v Speaker 0>So Adrian thinks to modify the static manifest

00:29:01.539 --> 00:29:02.500
<v Speaker 0>for the scheduler.

00:29:08.365 --> 00:29:10.765
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You're doing LS dash AL.

00:29:11.485 --> 00:29:12.525
<v Speaker 1>They might have changed the

00:29:17.645 --> 00:29:18.365
<v Speaker 2>Oh,

00:29:19.805 --> 00:29:20.045
<v Speaker 2>nice.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.620
<v Speaker 0>K. What's the problem there?

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:25.540
<v Speaker 2>Is.

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:27.140
<v Speaker 2>Yamal. Yamal.

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:30.660
<v Speaker 0>Sneaky.

00:29:41.054 --> 00:29:43.615
<v Speaker 1>We're doing ALS. ALS just to see those.

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:51.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh, so very long.

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:52.130
<v Speaker 2>Mhmm.

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:58.370
<v Speaker 0>You have fifteen minutes left.

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:01.970
<v Speaker 0>No pressure.

00:30:02.905 --> 00:30:04.024
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.

00:30:04.345 --> 00:30:05.304
<v Speaker 2>Oh, fine.

00:30:07.625 --> 00:30:08.905
<v Speaker 2>But that's Is it fair to tell you?

00:30:08.905 --> 00:30:11.145
<v Speaker 0>These are these are finding finding problems and

00:30:11.145 --> 00:30:12.585
<v Speaker 0>fixing them. I'm impressed.

00:30:14.105 --> 00:30:15.465
<v Speaker 1>So what's currently broken?

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.320
<v Speaker 2>It's still the pending pod

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:22.120
<v Speaker 2>because the scheduler is still not there.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.720
<v Speaker 1>We still have no scheduler. Where?

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.120
<v Speaker 2>I think it might be coming up.

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:29.960
<v Speaker 1>So I was hoping.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.440
<v Speaker 2>But some of them are running.

00:30:35.365 --> 00:30:37.445
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. The schedule is running, but the

00:30:37.445 --> 00:30:38.325
<v Speaker 1>pending is still there.

00:30:48.419 --> 00:30:50.499
<v Speaker 2>Hubbell's down, but do we care?

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:52.739
<v Speaker 1>I don't.

00:30:54.659 --> 00:30:55.460
<v Speaker 0>Hubbell.

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:56.179
<v Speaker 0>Come on.

00:30:59.220 --> 00:30:59.860
<v Speaker 1>What happens?

00:31:01.555 --> 00:31:03.795
<v Speaker 2>Paint. There we go. One node just oh,

00:31:03.795 --> 00:31:04.915
<v Speaker 1>I hate things.

00:31:05.795 --> 00:31:06.755
<v Speaker 2>What was that?

00:31:08.195 --> 00:31:10.195
<v Speaker 2>Paint and then minus. Right?

00:31:10.835 --> 00:31:13.395
<v Speaker 1>There's Maintenance through. There you go.

00:31:13.715 --> 00:31:16.035
<v Speaker 1>No scoreboard buttons. Maintenance through

00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:17.429
<v Speaker 1>taint.

00:31:18.309 --> 00:31:20.629
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. How did I do that?

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:22.149
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:23.429
<v Speaker 1>No idea.

00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:25.909
<v Speaker 2>And note

00:31:28.625 --> 00:31:30.225
<v Speaker 0>You can do a 10 And then the

00:31:30.225 --> 00:31:32.865
<v Speaker 2>minus at the end. And then the yeah.

00:31:32.865 --> 00:31:33.985
<v Speaker 0>With the minus.

00:31:35.665 --> 00:31:37.505
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. That's a bit weird syntax, isn't

00:31:37.505 --> 00:31:37.985
<v Speaker 1>it?

00:31:39.105 --> 00:31:41.265
<v Speaker 0>They love the minus syntax in Kubernetes.

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:47.100
<v Speaker 0>It just means that it's dash.

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.220
<v Speaker 2>This one? Yeah. That should work.

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:55.180
<v Speaker 0>Dash dash all. Sorry.

00:31:56.625 --> 00:31:58.865
<v Speaker 2>Alright. Back to Kubernetes. I'm not using word

00:31:58.865 --> 00:32:01.184
<v Speaker 2>certificate. The cube admin thing anymore. Okay.

00:32:02.305 --> 00:32:04.145
<v Speaker 1>Well, that's that's impressive.

00:32:05.025 --> 00:32:05.664
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:32:07.105 --> 00:32:09.905
<v Speaker 0>Oh, look at that. Alright. Something's actually running.

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:14.630
<v Speaker 2>So do we how do we see?

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:17.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You wanna check it now?

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:21.110
<v Speaker 2>Yes. Yeah. What's the but that that should

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:23.430
<v Speaker 2>be public. Right? Because we have the There's

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:25.350
<v Speaker 0>a node port on it, 30,000.

00:32:26.284 --> 00:32:28.445
<v Speaker 2>Yes. But I can't see the external IPs

00:32:28.445 --> 00:32:30.605
<v Speaker 2>from on here. That's alright. I can fill

00:32:30.605 --> 00:32:32.044
<v Speaker 0>it up here or you can just curl

00:32:32.044 --> 00:32:34.124
<v Speaker 0>it from the machine, whatever you prefer.

00:32:35.085 --> 00:32:37.085
<v Speaker 1>You know, you don't sound particularly confident that

00:32:37.085 --> 00:32:37.645
<v Speaker 1>this is working.

00:32:40.159 --> 00:32:42.320
<v Speaker 0>It's working. There you go. You got version

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.200
<v Speaker 0>one running.

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.279
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to tell which oh, yeah. Version

00:32:45.279 --> 00:32:45.840
<v Speaker 2>one.

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:47.519
<v Speaker 1>Oh, okay.

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.080
<v Speaker 1>No. Don't update it. Can should we check

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.679
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:53.200
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.014
<v Speaker 1>I want to see the web page. That's

00:32:57.014 --> 00:32:58.375
<v Speaker 1>all I mean. Oh, I put it up.

00:32:58.375 --> 00:32:59.014
<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

00:32:59.414 --> 00:33:01.734
<v Speaker 2>Mean We did cam thing. That was good.

00:33:01.894 --> 00:33:02.614
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:33:03.495 --> 00:33:05.335
<v Speaker 0>Back up again. Letters me looking at my

00:33:05.335 --> 00:33:06.934
<v Speaker 0>watch saying you're running out of time.

00:33:07.815 --> 00:33:09.174
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. I see it. No pressure.

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:13.690
<v Speaker 1>I didn't I didn't do what you said.

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:15.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the other thing to the

00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:15.850
<v Speaker 1>side.

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:22.730
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's probably just pulling the image unless

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:24.490
<v Speaker 0>they've left any more sneaky breaks on there

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:24.890
<v Speaker 0>for you.

00:33:31.345 --> 00:33:33.345
<v Speaker 1>It's pulled. You could do dash w, you

00:33:33.345 --> 00:33:33.825
<v Speaker 1>know.

00:33:37.345 --> 00:33:38.224
<v Speaker 2>It is running.

00:33:38.465 --> 00:33:40.385
<v Speaker 2>Could. But it this is better for my

00:33:40.385 --> 00:33:42.385
<v Speaker 2>anxiety to just constantly do the same thing

00:33:42.385 --> 00:33:43.265
<v Speaker 2>over and over again.

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:45.770
<v Speaker 0>You

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:48.730
<v Speaker 0>got the dance. You refreshed. Oh, really? Is

00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:50.330
<v Speaker 2>that v two? Yep.

<v Speaker 0>team Sivo, if you wanna start making your

00:34:12.735 --> 00:34:14.849
<v Speaker 0>way to the link, team consider solutions.

00:34:14.849 --> 00:34:17.010
<v Speaker 0>Thank you very much. Well done. You smashed

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:18.929
<v Speaker 0>that and you still had

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:21.650
<v Speaker 0>nine minutes left for further debugging. Sorry

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:25.170
<v Speaker 0>Charlotte. You smashed it. Adrian and Ricardo. Thanks

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:26.289
<v Speaker 0>for joining us.

00:34:30.185 --> 00:34:32.425

<v Speaker 1>Thanks. Bye bye.

00:34:39.545 --> 00:34:42.185
<v Speaker 0>Alright. You're stuck with me while we wait

00:34:42.185 --> 00:34:44.849
<v Speaker 0>for the civil cloud team to join us.

00:34:44.849 --> 00:34:46.690
<v Speaker 0>And I'll just take this opportunity to say

00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:48.850
<v Speaker 0>thank you to Teleport again for sponsoring.

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:50.609
<v Speaker 0>It's a pleasure to have them on board.

00:34:50.609 --> 00:34:52.929
<v Speaker 0>We use this tool every single week on

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:55.089
<v Speaker 0>clustered and it is just a fantastic tool.

00:34:55.585 --> 00:34:57.665
<v Speaker 0>If you have a Kubernetes cluster, you should

00:34:57.665 --> 00:34:59.425
<v Speaker 0>deploy it. Check it out. It's great on

00:34:59.425 --> 00:35:00.465
<v Speaker 0>bare metal too.

00:35:02.385 --> 00:35:04.545
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's hope the latency is not too

00:35:04.545 --> 00:35:06.705
<v Speaker 0>bad and civo are gonna start piling in

00:35:06.705 --> 00:35:09.665
<v Speaker 0>any moment now. Oh, we do. Perfect.

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:12.750
<v Speaker 0>We got

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:15.710
<v Speaker 0>the Nash. Hey, mate. How's it going? Oh,

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:17.470
<v Speaker 0>it's I am too. Thank you.

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:19.150
<v Speaker 0>Awesome timing.

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:23.145
<v Speaker 0>Let's get your names on the screen. So

00:35:23.145 --> 00:35:24.985
<v Speaker 0>we're just waiting for David to join us

00:35:24.985 --> 00:35:27.065
<v Speaker 0>as well and then we'll get started with

00:35:27.065 --> 00:35:28.265
<v Speaker 0>the next cluster.

00:35:29.225 --> 00:35:31.065
<v Speaker 0>How is how is that watching that?

00:35:32.425 --> 00:35:33.545
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. It was

00:35:34.025 --> 00:35:35.225
<v Speaker 3>They did really

00:35:35.225 --> 00:35:35.865
<v Speaker 3>really well.

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:38.320
<v Speaker 0>Did they They

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:41.280
<v Speaker 0>did. I gotta say and there were some

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:41.840
<v Speaker 0>really

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.760
<v Speaker 0>really fun see as soon as I seen

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.160
<v Speaker 0>the search I was like, ah, that's because

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:48.815
<v Speaker 0>those are so painful to fix. So that

00:35:48.815 --> 00:35:50.335
<v Speaker 0>was cruel that you went for that but

00:35:50.335 --> 00:35:51.055
<v Speaker 0>some

00:35:51.214 --> 00:35:52.894
<v Speaker 0>nice ones, the YAML I got I love

00:35:52.894 --> 00:35:54.575
<v Speaker 0>the double a on the YAML as well.

00:35:54.575 --> 00:35:55.214
<v Speaker 0>I

00:35:55.535 --> 00:35:57.535
<v Speaker 0>didn't even notice it as well. Like I

00:35:57.535 --> 00:35:59.214
<v Speaker 0>just thought it looked fine to me so

00:35:59.214 --> 00:36:00.734
<v Speaker 0>very sneaky.

00:36:01.855 --> 00:36:02.255
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:06.610
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully, you all got registered with a teleport

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:08.450
<v Speaker 0>for the container solutions. So I will pop

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:10.210
<v Speaker 0>open a session in just a moment, but

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:12.290
<v Speaker 0>first, if we could just get some introductions

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:14.290
<v Speaker 0>from y'all, please feel free to share a

00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:15.730
<v Speaker 0>little bit about you and what you do

00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:17.250
<v Speaker 0>and then we'll get started on our next

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:17.650
<v Speaker 0>cluster.

00:36:20.365 --> 00:36:21.805
<v Speaker 0>Dinesh, we'll start with you and then we'll

00:36:21.805 --> 00:36:22.685
<v Speaker 0>we'll move around.

00:36:28.684 --> 00:36:29.964
<v Speaker 0>Do you want to introduce yourself?

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:31.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh, sure.

00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:35.150
<v Speaker 3>This is going well.

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:37.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. So Dinesh, director

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:40.350
<v Speaker 3>of innovation at Civo. I've been working with

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:41.870
<v Speaker 3>Kubernetes for years and years and years.

00:36:42.765 --> 00:36:45.085
<v Speaker 3>And, yeah, it was nerve racking watching that.

00:36:45.085 --> 00:36:45.885
<v Speaker 3>Well done.

00:36:47.484 --> 00:36:49.885
<v Speaker 3>Our brains if David's in our brains, our

00:36:49.885 --> 00:36:51.484
<v Speaker 3>excuses are coming out now, but we've been

00:36:51.484 --> 00:36:53.645
<v Speaker 3>on a p one since midday today.

00:36:54.204 --> 00:36:55.990
<v Speaker 3>So we we actually got it fixed. I

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:57.430
<v Speaker 3>was on one of the default calls ten

00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:59.990
<v Speaker 3>minutes before this started. We're

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:02.070
<v Speaker 3>we're leaving it all to say I'm here.

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:03.750
<v Speaker 0>No. You're not allowed to practice before a

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:05.350
<v Speaker 0>cluster. Come on. That's too much.

00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:07.990
<v Speaker 0>Especially in production scenarios.

00:37:08.445 --> 00:37:09.885
<v Speaker 0>No. I'm glad you got that fixed, and

00:37:09.885 --> 00:37:11.085

<v Speaker 5>what has container solutions

00:37:36.605 --> 00:37:37.645
<v Speaker 5>have for us.

<v Speaker 4>for Civo.

00:37:45.645 --> 00:37:47.645
<v Speaker 4>The only American part of the engineering team

00:37:47.645 --> 00:37:50.090
<v Speaker 4>over here. I don't have the pleasure of

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:51.610
<v Speaker 4>being in the same country as these guys,

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:52.890
<v Speaker 4>but we get a lot done.

00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:56.890
<v Speaker 4>Just like to say, good job, Container Solutions.

00:37:56.890 --> 00:37:59.050
<v Speaker 4>We tried to come up with some ridiculous

00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:02.025
<v Speaker 4>stuff. We came up pretty well on that.

00:38:02.984 --> 00:38:05.785
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Thank you all for joining me. Let's

00:38:05.785 --> 00:38:07.944
<v Speaker 0>get this party started. I don't know if

00:38:07.944 --> 00:38:08.825
<v Speaker 0>I can call it a party, but I'm

00:38:08.825 --> 00:38:09.865
<v Speaker 0>gonna call it a party.

00:38:10.345 --> 00:38:13.385
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I have here our teleport instance from

00:38:13.385 --> 00:38:15.944
<v Speaker 0>container solutions. I am clicking connect

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:19.070
<v Speaker 0>on the control plane node. Please use the

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:21.550
<v Speaker 0>activity menu on the left. Find the active

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:23.070
<v Speaker 0>session and join and if you can type

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:25.150
<v Speaker 0>echo hello, make sure you're all in there

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:26.750
<v Speaker 0>and then we'll get this underway.

00:38:29.835 --> 00:38:32.155
<v Speaker 0>Call it cursors teleport. That's what we need.

00:38:32.155 --> 00:38:33.355
<v Speaker 0>Please make it happen.

00:38:35.994 --> 00:38:38.395
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I think we got everybody there. Awesome.

00:38:38.795 --> 00:38:41.755
<v Speaker 0>Okay. I think as customary on custard, you'll

00:38:41.755 --> 00:38:43.675
<v Speaker 0>wanna set up your cube config and check

00:38:43.675 --> 00:38:45.420
<v Speaker 0>if you have a control plane. Let you

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:47.020
<v Speaker 0>just take it away from here. Good luck.

00:38:49.579 --> 00:38:51.420
<v Speaker 0>Have to decide who's gonna type first.

00:38:55.819 --> 00:38:57.339
<v Speaker 0>Who have we got typing on there?

00:39:00.835 --> 00:39:02.275
<v Speaker 4>I guess me. Gonna

00:39:04.035 --> 00:39:06.435
<v Speaker 3>do a x export of cube config.

00:39:07.875 --> 00:39:09.234
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. You wanna do that?

00:39:10.595 --> 00:39:11.315
<v Speaker 3>I'm driving.

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.520
<v Speaker 4>I typed slow.

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:21.640
<v Speaker 0>Hey, Mark. Welcome to the party. Oh,

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:24.200
<v Speaker 3>it's content.

00:39:29.005 --> 00:39:31.805
<v Speaker 0>Someone from the container solutions team has said

00:39:31.805 --> 00:39:34.045
<v Speaker 0>there are some hints and slash root have

00:39:34.045 --> 00:39:34.925
<v Speaker 0>required.

00:39:35.645 --> 00:39:37.645
<v Speaker 0>You will need those hints. Know it.

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:46.520
<v Speaker 3>Things seem like they're running, which is interesting.

00:39:47.319 --> 00:39:49.240
<v Speaker 0>Job done. Well done. You fixed it.

00:39:50.119 --> 00:39:51.000
<v Speaker 3>I

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:53.960
<v Speaker 4>doubt that highly.

00:39:58.115 --> 00:40:00.035
<v Speaker 3>Well, there's a deployment that's not running.

00:40:26.665 --> 00:40:28.185
<v Speaker 0>Looks alright to me.

00:40:33.944 --> 00:40:36.105
<v Speaker 0>Hey, Jeremy. Welcome to Clustered.

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:44.369
<v Speaker 0>Comment from Kubernetes community days UK that someone

00:40:44.369 --> 00:40:45.810
<v Speaker 0>forget to break the cluster.

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:50.770
<v Speaker 0>Clusters can be deceiving. Even when they're working,

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:52.130
<v Speaker 0>they're probably fucked anyway.

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:55.890
<v Speaker 3>Air mounting pod filters of sandbox.

00:40:58.265 --> 00:40:58.984
<v Speaker 0>Uh-oh.

00:41:02.825 --> 00:41:03.785
<v Speaker 3>On the

00:41:04.424 --> 00:41:05.865
<v Speaker 3>control plane

00:41:07.065 --> 00:41:08.184
<v Speaker 3>and the scheduler,

00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:11.350
<v Speaker 3>What time was that?

00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:14.790
<v Speaker 3>A while ago.

00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:16.790
<v Speaker 3>It did say that the scheduler was running,

00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:17.510
<v Speaker 3>didn't it?

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:19.110
<v Speaker 2>Mhmm.

00:41:23.435 --> 00:41:24.715
<v Speaker 3>Four hours ago.

00:41:24.955 --> 00:41:26.155
<v Speaker 3>That's worrying.

00:41:35.195 --> 00:41:36.475
<v Speaker 3>Copy.

00:41:36.635 --> 00:41:37.275
<v Speaker 3>Paste.

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:43.730
<v Speaker 3>Failed to list nodes.

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:47.090
<v Speaker 3>Connection refused.

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:50.770
<v Speaker 4>Check IP tables real quick.

00:41:54.485 --> 00:41:56.165
<v Speaker 0>Kai is asking is it just a flash

00:41:56.165 --> 00:41:58.405
<v Speaker 0>wind? Oh, it's looking a bit different now.

00:42:01.205 --> 00:42:02.725
<v Speaker 1>We'll see. Alright.

00:42:03.925 --> 00:42:06.725
<v Speaker 3>Unless what's the default policy, it's fine.

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.880
<v Speaker 0>Do you think anyone's ever enjoyed working with

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:14.920
<v Speaker 0>IP tables?

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:20.360
<v Speaker 3>No. Hang on. 6444.

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:21.880
<v Speaker 3>That's not 6443,

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:25.065
<v Speaker 3>is it? And

00:42:29.305 --> 00:42:30.825
<v Speaker 3>that one's been changed.

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:50.849
<v Speaker 0>Interesting.

00:42:55.825 --> 00:42:59.105
<v Speaker 3>Is it in the config scheduler config?

00:42:59.585 --> 00:43:01.425
<v Speaker 3>Or is this just been properly messed with?

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:08.820
<v Speaker 0>My head is spinning with ideas here. Yep.

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:10.100
<v Speaker 4>There you go. There it is. Yep.

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:11.460
<v Speaker 3>There it is.

00:43:18.434 --> 00:43:20.515
<v Speaker 4>See, they're getting back at us for YAML.

00:43:32.609 --> 00:43:34.050
<v Speaker 3>Should get restarted.

00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:37.410
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. They could be able to detect the

00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:39.410
<v Speaker 0>change. It may just take thirty seconds to

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:40.690
<v Speaker 0>a minute for that to

00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:42.690
<v Speaker 0>to respond it.

00:43:43.404 --> 00:43:45.164
<v Speaker 3>Oh, wait. No. It won't. Because we've changed

00:43:45.164 --> 00:43:48.045
<v Speaker 3>the scheduler config, not the manifest itself.

00:43:48.684 --> 00:43:49.484
<v Speaker 0>Uh-huh.

00:43:49.964 --> 00:43:52.125
<v Speaker 3>So let's just touch that, and that should

00:43:52.125 --> 00:43:53.085
<v Speaker 3>sort that out.

00:43:58.540 --> 00:43:59.660
<v Speaker 3>Should sort that out.

00:44:09.775 --> 00:44:11.615
<v Speaker 0>I hope that wasn't someone's pager.

00:44:12.175 --> 00:44:12.735
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:44:14.895 --> 00:44:15.935
<v Speaker 4>Spam runs.

00:44:21.375 --> 00:44:22.495
<v Speaker 3>Do we delete it?

00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:24.950
<v Speaker 0>Well, you could run a p s a

00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:26.390
<v Speaker 0>u x and see how long the process

00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:27.430
<v Speaker 0>has been running.

00:44:31.109 --> 00:44:33.190
<v Speaker 0>Or a f x. Nice touch.

00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:39.045
<v Speaker 0>You can always touch the p s flags.

00:44:42.085 --> 00:44:43.445
<v Speaker 3>Keep sketchy that.

00:44:49.285 --> 00:44:50.485
<v Speaker 0>One forty six.

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:54.420
<v Speaker 3>Oh, that just done it.

00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:57.220
<v Speaker 3>No.

00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:00.820
<v Speaker 4>Take away and kick the pod.

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:02.020
<v Speaker 3>Delete.

00:45:03.425 --> 00:45:05.505
<v Speaker 0>Nothing ever bad happened from deleting a pod.

00:45:05.505 --> 00:45:06.865
<v Speaker 0>I'm just saying. Yeah.

00:45:11.665 --> 00:45:14.625
<v Speaker 3>That's still not done it. Let's delete it.

00:45:14.625 --> 00:45:17.710
<v Speaker 0>Khalid is asking who's wedding. The audience is

00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:20.430
<v Speaker 0>winning as we're all absorbing knowledge today.

00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:25.150
<v Speaker 4>Here we go.

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:27.630
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That looks better.

00:45:30.355 --> 00:45:31.875
<v Speaker 0>I mean, does look better till you did

00:45:31.875 --> 00:45:32.435
<v Speaker 3>that.

00:45:33.475 --> 00:45:34.195
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:47.570
<v Speaker 3>Can we reschedule that?

00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:53.330
<v Speaker 3>That does look like it should have been

00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:53.650
<v Speaker 3>changed.

00:46:02.095 --> 00:46:02.815
<v Speaker 3>Oh,

00:46:03.455 --> 00:46:05.135
<v Speaker 3>I know. Copy paste.

00:46:05.375 --> 00:46:06.175
<v Speaker 3>I'm assuming that

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:13.859
<v Speaker 3>So why would that not be picking up

00:46:13.859 --> 00:46:14.420
<v Speaker 3>the

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:16.500
<v Speaker 3>right config file?

00:46:20.099 --> 00:46:22.180
<v Speaker 4>Do wanna just restart the cube with maybe?

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:25.220
<v Speaker 3>Oh, shit. These all been spelled right.

00:46:30.465 --> 00:46:31.905
<v Speaker 0>Is that you checking for Unicode?

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:44.840
<v Speaker 3>That looks right.

00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:48.200
<v Speaker 0>Looks okay.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:49.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

00:46:51.575 --> 00:46:53.095
<v Speaker 0>What's happening right now is we have a

00:46:53.095 --> 00:46:55.895
<v Speaker 0>scheduler running. You're looking at the manifest. It's

00:46:55.895 --> 00:46:57.335
<v Speaker 0>using scheduler.conf,

00:46:57.335 --> 00:46:58.775
<v Speaker 0>which you've just modified,

00:46:59.815 --> 00:47:01.575
<v Speaker 0>and it still appears to be broken.

00:47:02.055 --> 00:47:02.695
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

00:47:03.095 --> 00:47:04.215
<v Speaker 3>It's using

00:47:04.375 --> 00:47:07.670
<v Speaker 3>proper image. So it's not that that's been

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:09.270
<v Speaker 3>messed with or has it?

00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:14.630
<v Speaker 3>Is a

00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:18.630
<v Speaker 0>Is your scheduler.com

00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:21.365
<v Speaker 0>definitely still 6443?

00:47:24.885 --> 00:47:25.525
<v Speaker 3>Yep.

00:47:27.045 --> 00:47:29.285
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. The logs from the pod

00:47:29.605 --> 00:47:30.965
<v Speaker 3>are 6444.

00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:36.270
<v Speaker 0>Interesting.

00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:40.830
<v Speaker 4>Is there a service config

00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:43.710
<v Speaker 4>file in, etcetera, Kubernetes

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:45.710
<v Speaker 4>for the scheduler itself?

00:47:48.025 --> 00:47:50.345
<v Speaker 3>Sorry. I gotta what did we say?

00:47:50.665 --> 00:47:53.145
<v Speaker 3>You wanna drive? At yeah. Looking at etcetera

00:47:53.145 --> 00:47:54.185
<v Speaker 4>Kubernetes,

00:47:54.185 --> 00:47:55.065
<v Speaker 4>so we can

00:47:56.985 --> 00:47:58.185
<v Speaker 4>look here.

00:47:59.705 --> 00:48:01.145
<v Speaker 4>There might be another.

00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:06.490
<v Speaker 1>So we have that one

00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:11.130
<v Speaker 1>and

00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:13.850
<v Speaker 4>Cubelet one.

00:48:23.795 --> 00:48:25.475
<v Speaker 4>That was my idea. So

00:48:27.234 --> 00:48:29.155
<v Speaker 4>just check them once again.

00:48:36.570 --> 00:48:37.610
<v Speaker 3>What's in there?

00:48:50.235 --> 00:48:52.155
<v Speaker 3>Probably looks like install time.

00:48:52.955 --> 00:48:55.755
<v Speaker 0>You definitely restarted the scheduler. Right? That that

00:48:55.755 --> 00:48:56.955
<v Speaker 0>that restarted.

00:48:58.395 --> 00:49:00.395
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely a new one as of three

00:49:00.395 --> 00:49:01.035
<v Speaker 3>minutes ago.

00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:06.410
<v Speaker 4>Should we restart the cubelet?

00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:08.970
<v Speaker 0>Maybe we should burn down the note.

00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:15.530
<v Speaker 3>Oh, it's getting hard.

00:49:18.745 --> 00:49:19.785
<v Speaker 3>I'll get them.

00:49:23.865 --> 00:49:24.905
<v Speaker 3>Copy paste.

00:49:25.785 --> 00:49:28.505
<v Speaker 3>That's another thing for teleport. Copy paste on

00:49:28.505 --> 00:49:29.385
<v Speaker 3>on highlight.

00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:37.530
<v Speaker 0>I was gonna ask if you just want

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:38.650
<v Speaker 0>a hint, but I don't even know if

00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:41.609
<v Speaker 0>that's wrong. But I've I've

00:49:41.609 --> 00:49:42.570
<v Speaker 0>got an idea.

00:49:43.609 --> 00:49:44.570
<v Speaker 3>What's the idea?

00:49:45.615 --> 00:49:47.615
<v Speaker 0>Right now you're working on the assumption that

00:49:47.615 --> 00:49:50.095
<v Speaker 0>the static manifest live in that directory.

00:49:50.975 --> 00:49:51.775
<v Speaker 3>That is true.

00:50:05.090 --> 00:50:06.130
<v Speaker 3>So

00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:07.970
<v Speaker 3>this is a cube admin cluster, isn't it?

00:50:14.805 --> 00:50:17.045
<v Speaker 0>It is a Kubernetes cluster.

00:50:19.525 --> 00:50:21.605
<v Speaker 3>ETC Kubernetes

00:50:21.605 --> 00:50:23.045
<v Speaker 3>manifests.

00:50:23.685 --> 00:50:24.565
<v Speaker 0>Damn.

00:50:26.245 --> 00:50:27.365
<v Speaker 3>Which is where we were.

00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:31.910
<v Speaker 3>So the other thing I'm thinking is that

00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:33.030
<v Speaker 3>it uses

00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:37.190
<v Speaker 3>host path volume mount. So

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:39.510
<v Speaker 3>unless there is the

00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:41.190
<v Speaker 3>scheduler dot yaml

00:50:41.445 --> 00:50:43.845
<v Speaker 3>somewhere else on the find file system.

00:50:58.100 --> 00:50:59.380
<v Speaker 0>It's

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:00.420
<v Speaker 0>a tricky one.

00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:01.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. Is.

00:51:16.805 --> 00:51:18.565
<v Speaker 3>This is

00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:32.609
<v Speaker 0>Ricardo has dropped a hint in the chat

00:51:32.609 --> 00:51:34.290
<v Speaker 0>for us, but he says a small edit

00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:36.130
<v Speaker 0>in scheduler dot YAML may have been better

00:51:36.130 --> 00:51:36.849
<v Speaker 0>than a touch.

00:51:39.585 --> 00:51:40.385
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

00:51:45.425 --> 00:51:47.825
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure if c is Charlotte or

00:51:47.825 --> 00:51:49.505
<v Speaker 0>not or maybe Adrian with a third account,

00:51:49.505 --> 00:51:51.745
<v Speaker 0>who knows? But saying don't overthink it.

00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:55.900
<v Speaker 0>I think that was aimed at me, so

00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:57.980
<v Speaker 0>I'm just gonna shut up. Oh, yeah. Thanks,

00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:00.140
<v Speaker 0>pop. The key is do the opposite of

00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:01.660
<v Speaker 0>what I say. Alright.

00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:06.380
<v Speaker 4>That's

00:52:07.914 --> 00:52:08.635
<v Speaker 4>That

00:52:18.234 --> 00:52:19.115
<v Speaker 3>was it.

00:52:19.835 --> 00:52:20.714
<v Speaker 3>Thank you very much.

00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:26.150
<v Speaker 3>We just we we've done it. It just

00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:29.510
<v Speaker 3>didn't decide to do its thing. Alright.

00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:32.390
<v Speaker 3>So we've still not got that up and

00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:33.110
<v Speaker 3>running.

00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:36.150
<v Speaker 3>Nodes are still ready.

00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:54.430
<v Speaker 0>Welcome, Sam. Thank you for joining the academy.

00:53:09.625 --> 00:53:11.865
<v Speaker 0>So now you're looking at the replica set

00:53:11.865 --> 00:53:13.385
<v Speaker 0>and trying to work out why we we

00:53:13.385 --> 00:53:15.385
<v Speaker 0>have no pods. Right? Why it's, yeah, why

00:53:15.385 --> 00:53:17.225
<v Speaker 3>it's not being scheduled at all.

00:53:18.265 --> 00:53:19.305
<v Speaker 4>Exceeding quota.

00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:22.980
<v Speaker 3>Can you spell that?

00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:26.660
<v Speaker 3>So those are set on

00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:29.220
<v Speaker 3>the namespace, aren't they?

00:53:37.435 --> 00:53:39.195
<v Speaker 4>The limits

00:53:39.355 --> 00:53:39.675
<v Speaker 4>are

00:53:43.995 --> 00:53:44.475
<v Speaker 3>Are they

00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:52.930
<v Speaker 0>What was more challenging? This or your p

00:53:52.930 --> 00:53:53.490
<v Speaker 0>one?

00:53:55.250 --> 00:53:57.090
<v Speaker 3>Well, we still are not entirely sure why

00:53:57.090 --> 00:53:57.970
<v Speaker 3>the p one happened.

00:54:04.744 --> 00:54:06.265
<v Speaker 3>I mean, we're back up and running, which

00:54:06.265 --> 00:54:08.585
<v Speaker 3>was the key thing, but the root cause

00:54:08.585 --> 00:54:09.865
<v Speaker 3>is still unknown.

00:54:11.865 --> 00:54:13.065
<v Speaker 3>Use limits.

00:54:13.145 --> 00:54:15.065
<v Speaker 3>So where do the limits get set?

00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:17.720
<v Speaker 3>Is it get resources,

00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:18.840
<v Speaker 3>was it? Or

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.119
<v Speaker 3>how do you get all of the types

00:54:20.119 --> 00:54:21.080
<v Speaker 3>in Kubernetes?

00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:24.200
<v Speaker 0>It's kubectl get dash resources.

00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:29.400
<v Speaker 0>Sorry. API resources. Forgive me.

00:54:31.125 --> 00:54:33.285
<v Speaker 0>No get. Just API dash resources.

00:54:33.765 --> 00:54:34.565
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.

00:54:39.205 --> 00:54:40.325
<v Speaker 3>Network policies.

00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:49.320
<v Speaker 3>What ranges?

00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:54.360
<v Speaker 3>Oh, gone.

00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:58.415
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. You you can do get limit ranges

00:54:58.415 --> 00:55:00.655
<v Speaker 0>or or quotas. Yeah. You just basically got

00:55:00.655 --> 00:55:01.135
<v Speaker 0>it.

00:55:02.815 --> 00:55:04.975
<v Speaker 3>I see we can just either edit that

00:55:04.975 --> 00:55:05.935
<v Speaker 3>resource quota.

00:55:06.175 --> 00:55:08.815
<v Speaker 3>Right? Edit, delete, and you get, and I'll

00:55:08.815 --> 00:55:09.775
<v Speaker 0>pick your poison.

00:55:10.175 --> 00:55:12.095
<v Speaker 3>I think edit it. Give it

00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:13.890
<v Speaker 3>Load.

00:55:17.650 --> 00:55:18.850
<v Speaker 0>50 m.

00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:22.450
<v Speaker 0>Does anyone really understand the m's on CPU

00:55:22.450 --> 00:55:23.250
<v Speaker 0>cores?

00:55:23.650 --> 00:55:24.290
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:27.250
<v Speaker 4>No. It's really CPU. Is that self explanatory?

00:55:28.635 --> 00:55:31.435
<v Speaker 0>So 500 ms would be 500 milli cores.

00:55:31.435 --> 00:55:33.595
<v Speaker 0>Right? So half of one CPU. Half of

00:55:33.595 --> 00:55:34.555
<v Speaker 3>one. Yeah.

00:55:36.555 --> 00:55:38.155
<v Speaker 0>What's wrong with 0.5?

00:55:38.395 --> 00:55:39.115
<v Speaker 0>Come on.

00:55:39.595 --> 00:55:40.475
<v Speaker 3>YAML.

00:55:40.475 --> 00:55:41.515
<v Speaker 0>YAML. Damn.

00:55:45.809 --> 00:55:48.210
<v Speaker 0>Yes, Adrian. It is cube control and I

00:55:48.210 --> 00:55:49.650
<v Speaker 0>will hear the end of it now. Thank

00:55:49.650 --> 00:55:50.210
<v Speaker 0>you.

00:55:52.529 --> 00:55:54.289
<v Speaker 3>That's the status. You don't need to edit

00:55:54.289 --> 00:55:55.809
<v Speaker 3>that. So I think once the spec is

00:55:55.809 --> 00:55:57.569
<v Speaker 3>done, you can just save it.

00:56:02.695 --> 00:56:04.535
<v Speaker 0>And that was edited while you were editing

00:56:04.535 --> 00:56:05.495
<v Speaker 0>it. So

00:56:07.655 --> 00:56:08.695
<v Speaker 0>unless you're maybe okay.

00:56:11.790 --> 00:56:14.350
<v Speaker 3>Get pods. Is that been scheduled now?

00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:17.310
<v Speaker 3>No.

00:56:36.849 --> 00:56:39.410
<v Speaker 3>Just wanna describe that new replica set one

00:56:39.410 --> 00:56:40.210
<v Speaker 3>five

00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:41.089
<v Speaker 3>f

00:56:41.089 --> 00:56:41.730
<v Speaker 3>d b.

00:56:54.434 --> 00:56:56.915
<v Speaker 3>It's still there. Should we edit the pod

00:56:56.915 --> 00:56:58.595
<v Speaker 3>and delete the limits

00:56:59.635 --> 00:57:00.275
<v Speaker 3>the request?

00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:06.550
<v Speaker 0>Thanks, group daily.

00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:10.390
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I would just delete that resource

00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:11.830
<v Speaker 0>quota. I don't I don't think it's doing

00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:13.590
<v Speaker 0>you any favors. That's that's my advice. Yeah.

00:57:23.195 --> 00:57:25.595
<v Speaker 3>It's all changing your mindset from being destructive

00:57:25.595 --> 00:57:27.435
<v Speaker 3>with things to being like, we just need

00:57:27.435 --> 00:57:30.235
<v Speaker 3>to massage it into working because you don't

00:57:30.235 --> 00:57:33.080
<v Speaker 3>wanna cascade into more and more errors. But

00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:36.440
<v Speaker 0>As someone who has personally cascaded himself into

00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:39.240
<v Speaker 0>many subsequent errors on clustered, I will still

00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:40.520
<v Speaker 0>defend deleting things.

00:57:47.515 --> 00:57:49.675
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. The chats are green. Delete the quota.

00:57:49.675 --> 00:57:50.555
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

00:57:51.755 --> 00:57:53.035
<v Speaker 3>How's the quota actually gone?

00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:04.830
<v Speaker 3>This is still nine minutes ago.

00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:06.110
<v Speaker 0>Maybe.

00:58:07.870 --> 00:58:08.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. Has the

00:58:09.310 --> 00:58:10.670
<v Speaker 3>has the quota definitely gone?

00:58:14.025 --> 00:58:15.465
<v Speaker 0>I love it when you delete a resource

00:58:15.465 --> 00:58:16.505
<v Speaker 0>that comes back.

00:58:16.665 --> 00:58:17.945
<v Speaker 3>I

00:58:18.585 --> 00:58:20.185
<v Speaker 0>think you're good. Delete

00:58:21.385 --> 00:58:24.105
<v Speaker 3>the replica set and that should force it

00:58:24.105 --> 00:58:24.825
<v Speaker 3>to be rescheduled.

<v Speaker 3>Just delete r s dash all

<v Speaker 3>double dash all.

<v Speaker 0>User twenty minutes in, twenty to go.

00:58:41.085 --> 00:58:42.845
<v Speaker 0>Twenty five. I can't count. There we go.

00:58:42.845 --> 00:58:43.325
<v Speaker 1>Hey.

<v Speaker 0>Wish I had some.

00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:03.829
<v Speaker 0>Pop, I will not stop talking, although I

00:59:03.829 --> 00:59:05.589
<v Speaker 0>do agree that Dinesh has a very soothing

00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:05.910
<v Speaker 0>voice.

00:59:08.964 --> 00:59:11.125
<v Speaker 3>Put that on the community chat as well.

00:59:11.125 --> 00:59:11.605
<v Speaker 3>I

00:59:12.484 --> 00:59:14.725
<v Speaker 3>feel bad about talking all the time.

00:59:15.685 --> 00:59:17.605
<v Speaker 3>And we check that, David.

00:59:18.405 --> 00:59:20.005
<v Speaker 0>What would you like to check? Sorry, Sayam.

00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:22.430
<v Speaker 5>This looks like

00:59:23.549 --> 00:59:25.310
<v Speaker 5>we have changed to v two. Right?

00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:27.470
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:59:28.030 --> 00:59:30.349
<v Speaker 0>You can curl localhost on 30,000 if you

00:59:30.349 --> 00:59:31.710
<v Speaker 0>want or I can pop it open in

00:59:31.710 --> 00:59:32.349
<v Speaker 0>a new tab.

00:59:34.175 --> 00:59:35.695
<v Speaker 5>Yeah. I want to see the fancy

00:59:35.935 --> 00:59:37.535
<v Speaker 0>You wanna you wanna see the dance. That's

00:59:37.535 --> 00:59:39.135
<v Speaker 0>it. Right? Yep. Yep.

00:59:41.055 --> 00:59:43.455
<v Speaker 0>Local host. That's

00:59:43.455 --> 00:59:45.455
<v Speaker 0>not gonna work. I can't do local host.

00:59:45.455 --> 00:59:45.535
<v Speaker 0>But

00:59:50.690 --> 00:59:52.530
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

00:59:54.450 --> 00:59:56.610
<v Speaker 0>look at that. They have swapped out the

00:59:56.610 --> 00:59:57.490
<v Speaker 0>something.

00:59:58.370 --> 00:59:59.090
<v Speaker 0>That

00:59:59.250 --> 01:00:00.530
<v Speaker 0>is not my custard.

01:00:04.484 --> 01:00:05.605
<v Speaker 3>So I know in the

01:00:06.565 --> 01:00:08.645
<v Speaker 3>I know in Docker world, yeah, I can

01:00:08.645 --> 01:00:09.605
<v Speaker 3>do that with

01:00:09.685 --> 01:00:10.885
<v Speaker 3>CryoControl.

01:00:12.885 --> 01:00:13.445
<v Speaker 3>Images.

01:00:17.290 --> 01:00:18.250
<v Speaker 0>Sneaky,

01:00:18.330 --> 01:00:19.450
<v Speaker 0>Mary. Mhmm.

01:00:23.850 --> 01:00:25.450
<v Speaker 0>So I'll give you a hint just because

01:00:25.450 --> 01:00:27.450
<v Speaker 0>it's not always easy. We're gonna need to

01:00:27.450 --> 01:00:29.690
<v Speaker 0>set the runtime endpoint on cry control.

01:00:30.785 --> 01:00:33.665
<v Speaker 0>So dash dash runtime dash endpoint equals or

01:00:33.665 --> 01:00:35.985
<v Speaker 0>do want me to type it? Yes, please.

01:00:37.185 --> 01:00:39.185
<v Speaker 0>So it's bar run

01:00:39.185 --> 01:00:41.825
<v Speaker 0>container d container d dot stock.

01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:48.940
<v Speaker 0>What did I get wrong?

01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:53.900
<v Speaker 0>Here's me sounding all confident as well. Runtime

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.180
<v Speaker 0>endpoint. Maybe

01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:55.900
<v Speaker 3>Do

01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:57.435
<v Speaker 3>you need a do you need a Unix

01:00:57.435 --> 01:00:58.555
<v Speaker 3>in front of that

01:00:58.955 --> 01:01:00.475
<v Speaker 3>to say it's a socket?

01:01:01.035 --> 01:01:01.355
<v Speaker 0>Or

01:01:02.555 --> 01:01:03.835
<v Speaker 0>I'm just gonna try.

01:01:04.235 --> 01:01:05.515
<v Speaker 0>There we go. I just had to come

01:01:05.515 --> 01:01:06.395
<v Speaker 0>before the command.

01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:14.820
<v Speaker 0>Adrian seems surprised that the the image showed.

01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:16.500
<v Speaker 0>Well played.

01:01:25.605 --> 01:01:27.285
<v Speaker 4>We might need to check on the MacBook

01:01:27.285 --> 01:01:27.845
<v Speaker 4>now.

01:01:29.444 --> 01:01:31.125
<v Speaker 3>Your Noise Gate is

01:01:31.525 --> 01:01:32.484
<v Speaker 3>pulled you out.

01:01:33.365 --> 01:01:35.045
<v Speaker 4>No. Noise Gate, MacBook today.

01:01:37.769 --> 01:01:39.130
<v Speaker 4>The

01:01:39.690 --> 01:01:41.930
<v Speaker 4>we wanna check that on the work that

01:01:41.930 --> 01:01:42.490
<v Speaker 3>happened.

01:01:44.009 --> 01:01:46.250
<v Speaker 3>I got none of that. Did anyone else?

01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:48.730
<v Speaker 0>I think David suggested checking

01:01:49.115 --> 01:01:51.275
<v Speaker 0>cryo control on the worker node where it's

01:01:51.275 --> 01:01:51.994
<v Speaker 0>scheduled.

01:01:52.555 --> 01:01:53.595
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

01:01:54.714 --> 01:01:56.714
<v Speaker 0>So if you tell me where it's scheduled,

01:01:56.714 --> 01:01:58.075
<v Speaker 0>I'll open a new tab.

01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:06.090
<v Speaker 0>You'll need to set up cluster too. Yeah.

01:02:06.090 --> 01:02:07.690
<v Speaker 0>There's cluster of all the names.

01:02:12.970 --> 01:02:16.890
<v Speaker 3>That is on S 9 R 6 L.

01:02:22.695 --> 01:02:23.975
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:02:23.975 --> 01:02:25.815
<v Speaker 0>There you go. You have a session opened

01:02:25.815 --> 01:02:26.775
<v Speaker 0>on that machine.

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:35.540
<v Speaker 3>Can I open that as a tab or

01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:36.900
<v Speaker 3>does it need to be a

01:02:37.299 --> 01:02:39.299
<v Speaker 3>like, kinda close this and No? No. You

01:02:39.299 --> 01:02:40.500
<v Speaker 0>can just open a new tab. If you

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:41.619
<v Speaker 0>just go back to your first tab, you

01:02:41.619 --> 01:02:42.980
<v Speaker 0>should be able to join the active session.

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:44.819
<v Speaker 0>It'll pop open in a new tab for

01:02:44.819 --> 01:02:44.980
<v Speaker 0>you.

01:02:48.425 --> 01:02:49.305
<v Speaker 0>I hope.

01:02:50.585 --> 01:02:52.025
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm not opening up a new

01:02:52.025 --> 01:02:53.705
<v Speaker 3>one. Let me close these and see if

01:02:53.705 --> 01:02:54.825
<v Speaker 1>I can put it.

01:02:55.145 --> 01:02:56.265
<v Speaker 3>I'll leave that session.

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:09.440
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I have you all on this on

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.320
<v Speaker 0>this node.

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:12.880
<v Speaker 3>Is

01:03:15.599 --> 01:03:17.359
<v Speaker 3>that me? That is you. Yep.

01:03:21.505 --> 01:03:23.025
<v Speaker 0>Yep. Sam's there.

01:03:25.505 --> 01:03:27.025
<v Speaker 0>Must be getting late for you, Sam.

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:31.520
<v Speaker 5>Yep. It's eleven.

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:32.720
<v Speaker 0>Thank

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:34.640
<v Speaker 0>you for staying with us. I appreciate it.

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:39.440
<v Speaker 0>Alright. What are we doing on this working

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.200
<v Speaker 0>note then? I have that in my pace

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:41.600
<v Speaker 4>buffer.

01:03:46.035 --> 01:03:47.955
<v Speaker 3>Do we just wanna delete it?

01:03:49.155 --> 01:03:49.955
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

01:03:50.755 --> 01:03:52.675
<v Speaker 3>And make sure it gets pulled again?

01:03:59.510 --> 01:04:00.950
<v Speaker 3>If you're driving, David, do wanna

01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:07.670
<v Speaker 3>yeah. Look. There's a 457

01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:10.150
<v Speaker 3>meg one there. That looks

01:04:10.275 --> 01:04:10.755
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

01:04:15.234 --> 01:04:17.395
<v Speaker 0>I love the image ID across v one,

01:04:17.395 --> 01:04:19.315
<v Speaker 0>v two, and latest there.

01:04:22.755 --> 01:04:23.315
<v Speaker 3>Just

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.240
<v Speaker 3>Is there a delete on this one or

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:32.120
<v Speaker 3>is it just list?

01:04:38.135 --> 01:04:40.215
<v Speaker 0>I am not entirely sure if you can

01:04:40.215 --> 01:04:41.655
<v Speaker 0>delete an image with

01:04:41.815 --> 01:04:42.535
<v Speaker 0>with cry control.

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:54.560
<v Speaker 0>Hey. Come on, chat. How'd you delete an

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:56.720
<v Speaker 0>image on container d? Delete anything?

01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:57.920
<v Speaker 3>Request.

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.720
<v Speaker 0>RMI. That would be a good chat.

01:05:10.495 --> 01:05:12.335
<v Speaker 0>Has someone got the YouTube page open on

01:05:12.335 --> 01:05:13.055
<v Speaker 0>the side?

01:05:17.775 --> 01:05:19.775
<v Speaker 3>One or more image ID.

01:05:23.970 --> 01:05:25.970
<v Speaker 0>Noel has said you can use CTR to

01:05:25.970 --> 01:05:28.850
<v Speaker 0>remove images. So check out the CTR command.

01:05:28.850 --> 01:05:29.890
<v Speaker 0>Or

01:05:30.210 --> 01:05:32.850
<v Speaker 0>Charlotte is suggesting cry control RMI will work

01:05:32.850 --> 01:05:33.410
<v Speaker 0>too. So

01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:36.455
<v Speaker 3>Yep. I think it worked. Right? Someone got

01:05:36.455 --> 01:05:39.255
<v Speaker 0>the YouTube page open on the side. I

01:05:39.255 --> 01:05:38.215
<v Speaker 3>think someone does have the YouTube side.

01:05:42.695 --> 01:05:43.975
<v Speaker 3>Someone's YouTube is

01:05:44.615 --> 01:05:45.335
<v Speaker 3>actually.

01:05:46.055 --> 01:05:47.415
<v Speaker 0>I hope it's not me.

01:05:48.215 --> 01:05:49.735
<v Speaker 5>Any other we want to do?

01:05:50.970 --> 01:05:53.930
<v Speaker 3>The all of the clustered ones. Delete them

01:05:53.930 --> 01:05:54.410
<v Speaker 3>all.

01:05:54.730 --> 01:05:56.650
<v Speaker 0>There's a matching tip from Seth in the

01:05:56.650 --> 01:05:58.490
<v Speaker 0>chat. You could always change the image pill

01:05:58.490 --> 01:05:59.930
<v Speaker 0>policy to always.

01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:01.450
<v Speaker 0>It's a good shifter.

01:06:02.170 --> 01:06:02.570
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

01:06:08.684 --> 01:06:10.765
<v Speaker 0>Delete it. Delete it. Delete it.

01:06:11.244 --> 01:06:13.244
<v Speaker 3>Still an LS again? Because I wonder if

01:06:13.244 --> 01:06:15.164
<v Speaker 3>it will keep it around if it's actually

01:06:15.164 --> 01:06:16.285
<v Speaker 3>running a pod,

01:06:18.285 --> 01:06:20.125
<v Speaker 3>which it doesn't look like it has.

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.799
<v Speaker 3>Right. So I guess if we go back

01:06:22.799 --> 01:06:25.200
<v Speaker 3>to the the master, the controller

01:06:25.279 --> 01:06:26.000
<v Speaker 3>thing.

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:29.359
<v Speaker 0>Indeed. That tab is front and center again

01:06:29.359 --> 01:06:30.000
<v Speaker 0>there.

01:06:31.039 --> 01:06:32.720
<v Speaker 3>And if I drive

01:06:41.245 --> 01:06:43.725
<v Speaker 3>which node did we it was s 9

01:06:43.725 --> 01:06:45.325
<v Speaker 3>that was known good, wasn't it?

01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:48.500
<v Speaker 0>It was S9. Correct.

01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:51.220
<v Speaker 3>Let's make sure it doesn't go over there.

01:07:01.895 --> 01:07:02.615
<v Speaker 3>Copy.

01:07:02.935 --> 01:07:03.735
<v Speaker 3>Paste.

01:07:08.615 --> 01:07:10.375
<v Speaker 0>Delete of the part to cut it to

01:07:10.375 --> 01:07:11.335
<v Speaker 0>be recreated.

01:07:12.295 --> 01:07:13.655
<v Speaker 0>I guess you want me to check the

01:07:13.655 --> 01:07:13.975
<v Speaker 0>image?

01:07:15.830 --> 01:07:16.630
<v Speaker 3>Oh,

01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:19.350
<v Speaker 3>that's still not work. I

01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:21.990
<v Speaker 0>saw you were making a bit of a

01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:23.430
<v Speaker 0>whale of assumption there.

01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:26.630
<v Speaker 5>Did you call on the right

01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:29.030
<v Speaker 5>worker node? Because I think it was on

01:07:29.030 --> 01:07:29.670
<v Speaker 5>s nine.

01:07:30.905 --> 01:07:32.585
<v Speaker 3>Yep. So I called them to the other

01:07:32.585 --> 01:07:34.825
<v Speaker 3>one. So you're making the assumption that the

01:07:34.825 --> 01:07:37.465
<v Speaker 0>break here was Adrian had pre pulled an

01:07:37.465 --> 01:07:40.905
<v Speaker 0>image pre pulled a broken image. Right? It

01:07:40.905 --> 01:07:43.145
<v Speaker 3>was. So the other thing it could be,

01:07:43.145 --> 01:07:44.425
<v Speaker 3>if we go back to the node, is

01:07:44.425 --> 01:07:46.960
<v Speaker 3>check the dodgy hosts entries.

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.680
<v Speaker 5>Yeah. There is a new image actually on

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:51.040
<v Speaker 5>the worker again,

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:52.240
<v Speaker 5>which is

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:54.160
<v Speaker 5>different one, I think.

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:56.480
<v Speaker 4>Nothing

01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:57.600
<v Speaker 4>on the host entries.

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:13.040
<v Speaker 3>So, yeah, it was either the the assumption

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:14.320
<v Speaker 3>was either that it was pre called or

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:16.720
<v Speaker 3>built on the node. I think I know

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:18.640
<v Speaker 0>what it is, but I think it gives

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:19.679
<v Speaker 0>you a better time.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:23.760
<v Speaker 3>I just do an images l s again.

01:08:35.395 --> 01:08:37.395
<v Speaker 3>Check check for images to see what's been

01:08:37.395 --> 01:08:38.034
<v Speaker 3>pulled.

01:08:38.755 --> 01:08:40.835
<v Speaker 0>I think someone's been abducted by aliens.

01:08:51.710 --> 01:08:52.510
<v Speaker 5>Images.

01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:53.790
<v Speaker 3>Images. Yeah.

01:09:02.245 --> 01:09:03.764
<v Speaker 3>That seven b

01:09:04.005 --> 01:09:05.925
<v Speaker 3>seven c b looks

01:09:06.085 --> 01:09:08.725
<v Speaker 3>remarkably similar from my memory for hashes that

01:09:08.725 --> 01:09:10.965
<v Speaker 3>I've seen briefly passing by on our screen.

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:14.279
<v Speaker 3>That looks like it's So maybe we just

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:16.840
<v Speaker 0>yeah. I would agree with that. Yep.

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:17.880
<v Speaker 2>So

01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:23.560
<v Speaker 3>all we've done is change v one to

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:27.055
<v Speaker 3>v two. It's pulled the right image in

01:09:27.055 --> 01:09:27.774
<v Speaker 3>theory.

01:09:29.135 --> 01:09:31.375
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing pointing it to a different

01:09:31.854 --> 01:09:34.255
<v Speaker 3>container unless there is a cry control

01:09:34.655 --> 01:09:36.654
<v Speaker 3>sort of proxy that you can do.

01:09:37.135 --> 01:09:39.135
<v Speaker 3>Sort of like the docker proxy. Is that

01:09:39.135 --> 01:09:40.095
<v Speaker 3>a thing with cry control?

01:09:40.979 --> 01:09:41.699
<v Speaker 3>So

01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:44.500
<v Speaker 0>I guess, I mean, I I

01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:46.500
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming I know what it is and

01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:48.739
<v Speaker 0>I don't wanna give it away, but there

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:51.540
<v Speaker 0>is a container d command that will dump

01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:52.180
<v Speaker 0>its config.

01:09:54.545 --> 01:09:55.265
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

01:09:55.585 --> 01:09:57.265
<v Speaker 3>Should we get that dumped on the

01:09:59.265 --> 01:10:01.344
<v Speaker 3>on the on the worker node?

01:10:03.265 --> 01:10:04.465
<v Speaker 3>Inspect.

01:10:05.105 --> 01:10:06.065
<v Speaker 3>Oh, no.

01:10:07.185 --> 01:10:08.705
<v Speaker 3>Inspect the

01:10:10.570 --> 01:10:12.489
<v Speaker 3>invite. No. Config.

01:10:22.534 --> 01:10:23.494
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. So

01:10:28.455 --> 01:10:30.295
<v Speaker 0>it's not on cry control. It's on the

01:10:30.295 --> 01:10:32.375
<v Speaker 0>actual container disk daemon binary.

01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:38.550
<v Speaker 0>So if you just type container d help

01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:39.670
<v Speaker 0>on its own.

01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:42.230
<v Speaker 0>Or you can look in the config.com, that

01:10:42.230 --> 01:10:43.350
<v Speaker 0>will reveal some of it. Yeah.

01:10:51.055 --> 01:10:53.295
<v Speaker 3>There is a honk.trowel.io

01:10:53.295 --> 01:10:54.335
<v Speaker 3>that looks

01:10:54.655 --> 01:10:56.335
<v Speaker 3>remarkably suspicious.

01:10:58.495 --> 01:10:59.135
<v Speaker 0>Good catch.

01:11:00.699 --> 01:11:02.860
<v Speaker 0>So container d has this feature,

01:11:03.179 --> 01:11:04.539
<v Speaker 0>which I don't think I have.

01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:06.939
<v Speaker 0>It allows you to

01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:09.340
<v Speaker 0>redirect container

01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:11.739
<v Speaker 0>rip up registries to other registries.

01:11:16.275 --> 01:11:18.034
<v Speaker 3>Guess, Simon, you're you're driving. Do you wanna

01:11:18.034 --> 01:11:19.314
<v Speaker 3>remove that?

01:11:20.594 --> 01:11:22.835
<v Speaker 0>You could also done container d config dash

01:11:22.835 --> 01:11:24.275
<v Speaker 0>dump, I think, as the command.

01:11:25.969 --> 01:11:27.409
<v Speaker 3>I have to say, I've still not played

01:11:27.409 --> 01:11:30.850
<v Speaker 3>around with Creo container d and if the

01:11:30.850 --> 01:11:32.610
<v Speaker 3>releases of Kubernetes,

01:11:32.690 --> 01:11:35.010
<v Speaker 3>where they're depreciating and getting closer and closer,

01:11:35.010 --> 01:11:36.530
<v Speaker 3>we really need to start to sign up.

01:11:36.530 --> 01:11:39.729
<v Speaker 3>You can you can cut call the

01:11:39.730 --> 01:11:40.130
<v Speaker 4>first

01:11:42.574 --> 01:11:45.135
<v Speaker 3>three level render two end Should we do

01:11:45.135 --> 01:11:47.215
<v Speaker 3>the container d dump one or we delete

01:11:47.215 --> 01:11:49.534
<v Speaker 3>from here? No. Just delete that line

01:11:51.135 --> 01:11:52.175
<v Speaker 3>and the line above it.

01:11:55.530 --> 01:11:57.210
<v Speaker 3>And that should be fine. You probably have

01:11:57.210 --> 01:11:58.729
<v Speaker 3>to delete the image again.

01:12:01.210 --> 01:12:02.489
<v Speaker 0>Nice break, Adrian.

01:12:02.889 --> 01:12:03.610
<v Speaker 0>I like that.

01:12:08.765 --> 01:12:10.605
<v Speaker 3>It was RMI, wasn't it?

01:12:11.005 --> 01:12:13.165
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. You know, you run just run it

01:12:13.165 --> 01:12:15.325
<v Speaker 3>from from your history because it's the same

01:12:15.325 --> 01:12:15.805
<v Speaker 3>ID.

01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:31.240
<v Speaker 3>Alright. And then if you get back to

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:32.920
<v Speaker 3>the master and oh, sorry. The control plane

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:34.200
<v Speaker 3>and delete the

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:35.560
<v Speaker 3>delete the bot again.

01:12:41.955 --> 01:12:43.075
<v Speaker 0>There you go.

01:12:57.690 --> 01:12:59.370
<v Speaker 0>I never wait for that to delete.

01:13:04.844 --> 01:13:06.684
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's gone. It should have gone it.

01:13:07.244 --> 01:13:08.925
<v Speaker 3>What it's doing is it's waiting for the

01:13:08.925 --> 01:13:11.164
<v Speaker 3>next pod to start up and become running.

01:13:11.164 --> 01:13:13.565
<v Speaker 3>So the theory being that once it's deleted

01:13:13.565 --> 01:13:15.244
<v Speaker 3>and it starts up, you're like, everything's fine

01:13:15.244 --> 01:13:17.405
<v Speaker 3>and you can carry on, but everyone's too

01:13:17.405 --> 01:13:17.885
<v Speaker 3>impatient.

01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:21.580
<v Speaker 0>So I'm still getting

01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:26.620
<v Speaker 3>Does container d need to be restarted or

01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:29.020
<v Speaker 3>anything? Is that a thing? Yeah. You'll probably

01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:30.540
<v Speaker 0>will have to restart container d.

01:13:32.445 --> 01:13:33.485
<v Speaker 4>I got that.

01:13:39.085 --> 01:13:40.525
<v Speaker 0>Would be particularly

01:13:40.525 --> 01:13:44.045
<v Speaker 0>evil if they had found

01:13:44.045 --> 01:13:46.285
<v Speaker 0>another way to have that image delivered.

01:13:47.350 --> 01:13:49.350
<v Speaker 3>Do wanna delete the image again, David, while

01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:50.150
<v Speaker 3>you're on that?

01:13:51.190 --> 01:13:53.430
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That will have been pulled again.

01:13:53.670 --> 01:13:54.550
<v Speaker 3>It will have been.

01:13:59.795 --> 01:14:00.835
<v Speaker 0>It looks like

01:14:01.395 --> 01:14:03.475
<v Speaker 0>yeah. Delete it. You should be good.

01:14:09.235 --> 01:14:11.395
<v Speaker 0>Adrian says it's on both workers, but they

01:14:11.395 --> 01:14:13.475
<v Speaker 0>have cardened the other worker, so we should

01:14:13.475 --> 01:14:13.955
<v Speaker 0>be alright.

01:14:17.050 --> 01:14:19.130
<v Speaker 3>Taking a little bit longer to come down.

01:14:20.490 --> 01:14:22.810
<v Speaker 3>Or is it not even coming down? No.

01:14:22.810 --> 01:14:24.010
<v Speaker 0>It will be coming down. It's just a

01:14:24.010 --> 01:14:26.170
<v Speaker 0>500 mega image I'm afraid. There we go.

01:14:29.335 --> 01:14:30.295
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

01:14:31.975 --> 01:14:34.215
<v Speaker 3>Failed to connect the database. Oh, you got

01:14:34.215 --> 01:14:34.855
<v Speaker 0>more.

01:14:35.575 --> 01:14:37.495
<v Speaker 0>Damn your container solutions.

01:14:39.095 --> 01:14:41.095
<v Speaker 0>You got the angry man. So you have

01:14:41.095 --> 01:14:42.775
<v Speaker 0>one more problem that looks like the fix.

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:46.480
<v Speaker 3>What pod is that? Postgres? Oh, sorry. What

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:48.559
<v Speaker 3>node is the Postgres pod running on?

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:53.119
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:57.120
<v Speaker 4>Whoever was driving can drive now.

01:15:06.815 --> 01:15:09.055
<v Speaker 3>No one's driving. Everyone's gonna be hands off.

01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:13.700
<v Speaker 0>So at least you've got a Postgres pod.

01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:16.099
<v Speaker 0>Right? That's that's a good start.

01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:19.219
<v Speaker 4>So that's on our other

01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:22.980
<v Speaker 4>worker as well. Suggest we delete it, and

01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:24.900
<v Speaker 3>it'll get rescheduled back on the right one.

01:15:25.335 --> 01:15:27.175
<v Speaker 3>And then if there's anything messed around with

01:15:27.175 --> 01:15:29.735
<v Speaker 3>IP tables, but Yeah. You didn't do MTD

01:15:29.735 --> 01:15:33.415
<v Speaker 4>around this, did you? That'd be terrible. Unless

01:15:35.175 --> 01:15:37.255
<v Speaker 3>Brooke's been messed around with as well, but

01:15:37.255 --> 01:15:37.655
<v Speaker 3>it looked

01:15:38.375 --> 01:15:39.735
<v Speaker 3>looks like Postgres is running.

01:15:40.510 --> 01:15:43.949
<v Speaker 0>Hey. I took Rawkode of the equation when

01:15:43.949 --> 01:15:46.349
<v Speaker 0>I built this application that uses a

01:15:46.989 --> 01:15:49.469
<v Speaker 0>and and a container and no PVC, so

01:15:49.469 --> 01:15:50.510
<v Speaker 0>you should be good.

01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:51.949
<v Speaker 4>Alright. I deleted that.

01:15:54.855 --> 01:15:56.774
<v Speaker 3>Just get wide again.

01:15:59.014 --> 01:16:01.254
<v Speaker 4>I'm just making sure that this is

01:16:02.135 --> 01:16:04.294
<v Speaker 0>Nice one, Seth. Container solutions,

01:16:04.295 --> 01:16:05.894
<v Speaker 0>more like container problems.

01:16:06.454 --> 01:16:06.695
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.

01:16:07.410 --> 01:16:08.610
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to come up with a

01:16:08.610 --> 01:16:10.369
<v Speaker 4>funny pun, but none of them were nice.

01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:14.050
<v Speaker 0>Do we have any endpoints on our postgres

01:16:14.050 --> 01:16:14.929
<v Speaker 0>service?

01:16:16.130 --> 01:16:19.810
<v Speaker 3>It's running now on the same node.

01:16:25.355 --> 01:16:27.035
<v Speaker 3>So let's check the service. It's the next

01:16:27.035 --> 01:16:27.595
<v Speaker 3>thing.

01:16:29.995 --> 01:16:32.555
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I would describe the service. Let's check

01:16:32.555 --> 01:16:33.195
<v Speaker 0>for endpoints.

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:50.960
<v Speaker 4>Even if I could spell, we'll be doing

01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:51.440
<v Speaker 4>good here.

01:16:52.985 --> 01:16:53.705
<v Speaker 4>Alright.

01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:13.620
<v Speaker 3>There is an endpoint on it. Does that

01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:14.420
<v Speaker 3>match the pod?

01:17:21.585 --> 01:17:24.625
<v Speaker 3>IP matches. Yeah. How about the ports?

01:17:28.385 --> 01:17:30.385
<v Speaker 0>Portal sign 5432.

01:17:31.345 --> 01:17:33.345
<v Speaker 3>Is it fine on the port, though?

01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:40.860
<v Speaker 0>Alright. He's got a few more minutes left

01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:43.020
<v Speaker 0>to think of this last problem.

01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:45.180
<v Speaker 3>If it's the last one.

01:17:49.335 --> 01:17:51.094
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. Ports are right.

01:17:52.215 --> 01:17:53.494
<v Speaker 5>Ports are right.

01:17:55.335 --> 01:17:57.975
<v Speaker 3>I have not so I've got connection timed

01:17:57.975 --> 01:17:59.895
<v Speaker 3>out. Is core DNS running?

01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:10.070
<v Speaker 3>Is

01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:14.550
<v Speaker 3>and hasn't been messed with well, can you

01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:16.389
<v Speaker 3>check the config map for core DNS?

01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:18.469
<v Speaker 0>It's not DNS.

01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:20.870
<v Speaker 0>Container solutions have confirmed that It's not DNS.

01:18:23.405 --> 01:18:25.005
<v Speaker 3>Oh, so they're not be able to connect.

01:18:25.005 --> 01:18:26.205
<v Speaker 3>Can we get a

01:18:26.765 --> 01:18:29.565
<v Speaker 3>shell on the clustered application?

01:18:29.725 --> 01:18:31.405
<v Speaker 0>Suggested if you look in the hints in

01:18:31.405 --> 01:18:33.165
<v Speaker 0>the root directory, hint three

01:18:33.645 --> 01:18:34.525
<v Speaker 0>for this problem.

01:18:37.989 --> 01:18:40.309
<v Speaker 0>I think it's slash route. And

01:18:43.429 --> 01:18:45.270
<v Speaker 0>then Charlotte's in there with a hint even

01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:47.190
<v Speaker 0>in the chat. What prevents traffic?

01:18:47.429 --> 01:18:49.190
<v Speaker 0>That's a pretty big hint, I think.

01:18:51.574 --> 01:18:54.055
<v Speaker 3>Well, it's gotta be potentially IP tables or

01:18:54.055 --> 01:18:55.414
<v Speaker 3>policy.

01:18:55.415 --> 01:18:57.655
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. Network policy. Yeah. I think you're right

01:18:57.655 --> 01:18:59.255
<v Speaker 0>to that. I think a network policy.

01:19:00.614 --> 01:19:02.535
<v Speaker 3>Don't look. Don't look. Check network policy.

01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:14.350
<v Speaker 3>We've had we've had a hint over the

01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:15.389
<v Speaker 3>chat, so

01:19:15.870 --> 01:19:17.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it'll be the same one. I

01:19:17.470 --> 01:19:18.270
<v Speaker 3>hope it's the same one.

01:19:19.455 --> 01:19:22.015
<v Speaker 3>There go. Just delete it. You sure you

01:19:22.015 --> 01:19:23.215
<v Speaker 0>don't want to edit it?

01:19:24.335 --> 01:19:25.775
<v Speaker 3>No. That one seems mean, and I probably

01:19:25.775 --> 01:19:26.495
<v Speaker 3>learned my lesson.

01:19:37.570 --> 01:19:40.210
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So that is a network policy. I

01:19:40.210 --> 01:19:41.810
<v Speaker 0>should be able to just refresh this pretty

01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:42.449
<v Speaker 0>quickly.

01:19:42.850 --> 01:19:43.810
<v Speaker 0>We have the dance.

01:19:48.905 --> 01:19:50.344
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Great job.

01:19:51.465 --> 01:19:53.304
<v Speaker 0>Lots of great problems across

01:19:53.465 --> 01:19:56.345
<v Speaker 0>both clusters there. I'm trying great fixing from

01:19:56.345 --> 01:19:57.545
<v Speaker 0>both teams as well.

01:19:57.865 --> 01:19:59.945
<v Speaker 0>And we're on time both clusters fixed. What

01:19:59.945 --> 01:20:02.105
<v Speaker 0>what more can we ask for? That was

01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:02.300
<v Speaker 0>awesome.

01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:05.660
<v Speaker 0>All right, great job Sivo. Thank you for

01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:07.580
<v Speaker 0>joining me. It was a pleasure. I hope

01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:08.940
<v Speaker 0>you had fun with that too.

01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:10.060
<v Speaker 0>Absolutely.

01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:11.500
<v Speaker 0>All right. Awesome.

01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:12.780
<v Speaker 0>Great. All right.

01:20:14.665 --> 01:20:16.985
<v Speaker 0>I'll say thank you to container solutions. Thank

01:20:16.985 --> 01:20:19.145
<v Speaker 0>you to Civo. Thank you to Teleport for

01:20:21.385 --> 01:20:24.025
<v Speaker 0>that tuned in and watched. We are looking

01:20:24.185 --> 01:20:26.345
<v Speaker 0>for more teams to join us on cluster.

01:20:26.345 --> 01:20:28.185
<v Speaker 0>So if your team works with Kubernetes and

01:20:28.185 --> 01:20:29.465

<v Speaker 0>To both the teams, thank you again.

01:20:38.730 --> 01:20:40.570
<v Speaker 0>I'll leave it there. Thank you. That was

01:20:40.570 --> 01:20:42.250
<v Speaker 0>absolutely awesome. I couldn't be happier with the

01:20:42.250 --> 01:20:43.850
<v Speaker 0>first episode of cluster teams. I hope you

01:20:43.850 --> 01:20:45.130
<v Speaker 0>enjoyed it too, and I'll see you all

01:20:45.130 --> 01:20:46.465

<v Speaker 3>See you all. Bye.
