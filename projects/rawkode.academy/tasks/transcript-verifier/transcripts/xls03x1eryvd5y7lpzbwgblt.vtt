00:02:23.415 --> 00:02:26.615
<v Speaker 0>Hello and welcome to today's episode.

00:02:26.935 --> 00:02:28.695
<v Speaker 0>Today, we are going to be taking a

00:02:28.695 --> 00:02:31.815
<v Speaker 0>look at Grafana, a dashboard and tool for

00:02:31.815 --> 00:02:34.215
<v Speaker 0>building out really cool dashboards with metrics and

00:02:34.215 --> 00:02:36.375
<v Speaker 0>understanding how your systems are operating.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.970
<v Speaker 0>That's a terrible description, but it'll get better

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.250
<v Speaker 0>soon, I promise.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.209
<v Speaker 0>Before we start, I wanna thank my employer,

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.010
<v Speaker 0>Equinix Medal. They provide the time for me

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.650
<v Speaker 0>to actually produce the show and you know,

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.970
<v Speaker 0>produce hopefully content that you all find

00:02:51.705 --> 00:02:53.305
<v Speaker 0>useful and help you learn.

00:02:54.025 --> 00:02:55.785
<v Speaker 0>We are giving away now

00:02:55.945 --> 00:02:56.985

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.480
<v Speaker 0>Now, I'm gonna invite on my wonderful guest,

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.799
<v Speaker 0>Marcus Olson, a developer advocate from Grafana Labs.

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.120
<v Speaker 0>Hey Marcus, how are you? Hey, I'm great.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.925
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for having me. Awesome. I'm very excited.

00:03:21.925 --> 00:03:23.765
<v Speaker 0>I'm a big fan of Grafana. I'm hoping

00:03:23.765 --> 00:03:25.205
<v Speaker 0>we can we can do some cool stuff

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:27.125
<v Speaker 0>today. Yeah. Hope so too.

00:03:28.084 --> 00:03:29.765
<v Speaker 0>You like to just take a couple of

00:03:29.765 --> 00:03:31.685
<v Speaker 0>minutes and tell people about your role at

00:03:31.685 --> 00:03:34.405
<v Speaker 0>Grafana Labs and even you know, what Grafana

00:03:34.405 --> 00:03:34.644
<v Speaker 0>is?

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, sure.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.060
<v Speaker 1>So I am a developer advocate at Grafana

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.700
<v Speaker 1>Labs,

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.780
<v Speaker 1>which is the company behind the open source

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.300
<v Speaker 1>project Grafana.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.260
<v Speaker 1>And if you've never heard about Grafana before,

00:03:50.265 --> 00:03:51.865
<v Speaker 1>it helps to think of it as a

00:03:51.865 --> 00:03:52.905
<v Speaker 1>visualization

00:03:52.905 --> 00:03:55.385
<v Speaker 1>tool for systems monitoring.

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:57.864
<v Speaker 1>That's really just a tip of the iceberg

00:03:57.864 --> 00:03:59.944
<v Speaker 1>though, but it kinda gets you going.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.760
<v Speaker 1>So my role at Grafana Labs is to

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.040
<v Speaker 1>help users

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.880
<v Speaker 1>get going, but also

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.320
<v Speaker 1>up their game and

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.000
<v Speaker 1>help them take advantage of everything that is

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Grafana.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.600
<v Speaker 1>And

00:04:17.544 --> 00:04:19.144
<v Speaker 1>lately I've been also

00:04:20.185 --> 00:04:22.585
<v Speaker 1>focusing a lot on plugin development. So if

00:04:22.585 --> 00:04:25.705
<v Speaker 1>you're curious how to extend

00:04:25.705 --> 00:04:26.824
<v Speaker 1>Grafana

00:04:26.824 --> 00:04:29.784
<v Speaker 1>to your I don't know, integrate with your

00:04:29.784 --> 00:04:32.905
<v Speaker 1>special database or you wanna offer a new

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:33.300
<v Speaker 1>type of visualization,

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.580
<v Speaker 1>that's usually

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.979
<v Speaker 1>me who's who you're gonna talk to.

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:38.740
<v Speaker 1>So

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:40.500
<v Speaker 1>more about Grafana.

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:42.020
<v Speaker 1>I

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.139
<v Speaker 1>so imagine that you know, you have this

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:46.580
<v Speaker 1>application that you've built

00:04:47.095 --> 00:04:50.455
<v Speaker 1>and you're really proud of it, but how

00:04:50.455 --> 00:04:52.135
<v Speaker 1>do you know it actually works? How do

00:04:52.135 --> 00:04:53.575
<v Speaker 1>you know that it actually does the thing

00:04:53.575 --> 00:04:54.935
<v Speaker 1>that you promised it to do?

00:04:55.335 --> 00:04:58.375
<v Speaker 1>So that's really where Grafana comes in, where

00:04:58.375 --> 00:04:59.495
<v Speaker 1>Grafana

00:04:59.495 --> 00:05:01.335
<v Speaker 1>brings in metrics,

00:05:01.335 --> 00:05:01.735
<v Speaker 1>information,

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.600
<v Speaker 1>statistics about that application

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.760
<v Speaker 1>and then visualizes it, typically in graphs

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.320
<v Speaker 1>over time. So you can see for example,

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.600
<v Speaker 1>how is my application using resources

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.120
<v Speaker 1>over the course of a day?

00:05:18.365 --> 00:05:19.005
<v Speaker 1>My

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:20.445
<v Speaker 1>application

00:05:21.645 --> 00:05:22.765
<v Speaker 1>running on its,

00:05:23.085 --> 00:05:23.565
<v Speaker 1>know,

00:05:25.005 --> 00:05:27.645
<v Speaker 1>using too many resources during 8PM

00:05:27.645 --> 00:05:29.005
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.

00:05:29.725 --> 00:05:32.169
<v Speaker 1>But you know, that being said, we also

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:33.849
<v Speaker 1>see a lot of people using it for

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:35.930
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of crazy stuff.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.169
<v Speaker 1>I know there's a community

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:41.530
<v Speaker 1>of beekeepers that are using Grafana to a

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.129
<v Speaker 1>monitor their beehives,

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:45.535
<v Speaker 1>which is really cool. I have a colleague

00:05:45.535 --> 00:05:47.055
<v Speaker 1>who just set up her

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:50.815
<v Speaker 1>She's she's growing avocados

00:05:50.815 --> 00:05:53.615
<v Speaker 1>and she just set up her her monitoring

00:05:53.615 --> 00:05:56.095
<v Speaker 1>solution for just making sure that they have

00:05:56.095 --> 00:05:58.240
<v Speaker 1>what they need, they're growing

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.800
<v Speaker 1>like they should. So it's very

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.760
<v Speaker 1>commonly used for systems monitoring,

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.800
<v Speaker 1>but we're seeing

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:08.240
<v Speaker 1>just tons of different use cases for it.

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:12.080
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Yeah, I don't think there's probably anyone

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.825
<v Speaker 0>in the technology,

00:06:13.825 --> 00:06:15.905
<v Speaker 0>at least in a sys admin operator SRE

00:06:15.905 --> 00:06:17.745
<v Speaker 0>rule who's not familiar with Grafana.

00:06:17.825 --> 00:06:19.745
<v Speaker 0>But to hear that it's actually now spread

00:06:19.745 --> 00:06:21.745
<v Speaker 0>now to all these other domains for beekeeping

00:06:21.745 --> 00:06:22.865
<v Speaker 0>and avocados.

00:06:22.865 --> 00:06:25.025
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I I guess as long

00:06:25.025 --> 00:06:27.020
<v Speaker 0>as you've got time series data and everything

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.620
<v Speaker 0>that you track over time, Grafana is a

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.860
<v Speaker 0>natural fit to to dashboard and visualize it

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:31.419
<v Speaker 0>and and

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.380
<v Speaker 0>yeah. That makes total sense to me. Yeah.

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:37.580
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So we got a couple of hellos.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.900
<v Speaker 0>So let's go through that. John McCabe,

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.435
<v Speaker 0>pleasure to have you back. Hello again.

00:06:42.594 --> 00:06:43.395
<v Speaker 0>Demo,

00:06:43.395 --> 00:06:46.594
<v Speaker 0>yo to you too. And Carlos, hey buddy,

00:06:46.594 --> 00:06:47.475
<v Speaker 0>how's it going?

00:06:48.435 --> 00:06:49.395
<v Speaker 1>Hey everyone.

00:06:49.715 --> 00:06:50.354
<v Speaker 0>So

00:06:51.155 --> 00:06:52.195
<v Speaker 0>let's see.

00:06:52.675 --> 00:06:55.860
<v Speaker 0>Let's cover the what have I prepared upfront,

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.860
<v Speaker 0>which hopefully is as little as possible.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.180
<v Speaker 0>So if I go to to to

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.140
<v Speaker 0>I have not installed Grafana. So we're starting

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.820
<v Speaker 0>from the we're starting from scratch as far

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.420
<v Speaker 0>as all the Grafana stuff goes. But I

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.420
<v Speaker 0>have prepared a little bit of infrastructure on

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.035
<v Speaker 0>Equinix metal, so that we can have some

00:07:13.035 --> 00:07:14.875
<v Speaker 0>metrics to actually work with today. I don't

00:07:14.875 --> 00:07:16.475
<v Speaker 0>wanna be doing metric collection in real time

00:07:16.475 --> 00:07:18.315
<v Speaker 0>and setting up, because it's not what we're

00:07:18.315 --> 00:07:19.915
<v Speaker 0>as important for today's session.

00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:22.395
<v Speaker 0>So I spun up a three bare metal

00:07:22.395 --> 00:07:23.115
<v Speaker 0>machines.

00:07:23.435 --> 00:07:23.995
<v Speaker 0>They

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.130
<v Speaker 0>all have a Prometheus

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.690
<v Speaker 0>node exporter running and they all have telegraph

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.050
<v Speaker 0>running. They're collecting very similar metrics, host, desk,

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:33.850
<v Speaker 0>network,

00:07:34.169 --> 00:07:37.130
<v Speaker 0>CPU memory, all the basic Linux stuff.

00:07:37.915 --> 00:07:40.155
<v Speaker 0>I also have on one node an influx

00:07:40.155 --> 00:07:42.715
<v Speaker 0>DB two running and a Prometheus running.

00:07:43.035 --> 00:07:45.354
<v Speaker 0>The reason I've kind of duplicated my effort

00:07:45.354 --> 00:07:47.755
<v Speaker 0>here is that one of the selling points

00:07:47.755 --> 00:07:49.275
<v Speaker 0>of Grafana is that it works with any

00:07:49.275 --> 00:07:51.860
<v Speaker 0>data source. So we were gonna take a

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.300
<v Speaker 0>look at setting up and talk to be,

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.580
<v Speaker 0>we'll take a look at Prometheus, we'll build

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.500
<v Speaker 0>some dashboards, we'll import some dashboards.

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.539
<v Speaker 0>And it'll all just go amazingly well and

00:07:59.539 --> 00:08:02.020
<v Speaker 0>nothing will break. Right, Mark? Absolutely

00:08:02.419 --> 00:08:03.220
<v Speaker 0>nothing.

00:08:03.699 --> 00:08:07.265
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Okay. So I've also prepared here the

00:08:07.265 --> 00:08:09.425
<v Speaker 0>download page for Grafana. So if anyone is

00:08:09.425 --> 00:08:11.265
<v Speaker 0>curious, you can follow along. But this is

00:08:11.265 --> 00:08:13.905
<v Speaker 0>just grafana.com/grafana/download.

00:08:14.465 --> 00:08:16.545
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming the most recent version is this

00:08:16.545 --> 00:08:18.945
<v Speaker 0>one here from the 10/28/1973

00:08:18.945 --> 00:08:19.185
<v Speaker 0>o.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:21.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Which is today.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh, so it is.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:26.550
<v Speaker 1>So congratulations.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:28.470
<v Speaker 1>You get to try out 7.3.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.110
<v Speaker 0>I mean, that sounds kinda dangerous, but I

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.150
<v Speaker 0>love it. So we're gonna do that.

00:08:33.605 --> 00:08:36.884
<v Speaker 0>So we should get a terminal on the

00:08:36.884 --> 00:08:38.884
<v Speaker 0>first machine. So we're only gonna one run

00:08:38.884 --> 00:08:41.125
<v Speaker 0>one Grafana. I'll run that on the same

00:08:41.125 --> 00:08:43.605
<v Speaker 0>node as Prometheus and m fox d b.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.720
<v Speaker 0>So step one,

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.480
<v Speaker 0>get on my machine.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.920
<v Speaker 0>And this is a bintu.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:54.920
<v Speaker 0>That

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.000
<v Speaker 0>means I

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.280
<v Speaker 0>can just run

00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:58.920
<v Speaker 0>this.

00:09:00.515 --> 00:09:02.355
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Yeah. Sure work.

00:09:04.355 --> 00:09:06.195
<v Speaker 0>Things always start off so easy just to

00:09:06.195 --> 00:09:07.555
<v Speaker 0>kinda lure you into a false sense of

00:09:07.555 --> 00:09:09.395
<v Speaker 0>security and then it all goes downhill.

00:09:09.715 --> 00:09:11.315
<v Speaker 0>That's what I find every time I write

00:09:11.315 --> 00:09:12.995
<v Speaker 0>code. Like, I think I've got this. This

00:09:12.995 --> 00:09:14.435
<v Speaker 0>is easy. And then

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's always the details they get you.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.160
<v Speaker 0>Oh, Grafana server. Okay.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.240
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.360
<v Speaker 0>There you go.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.360
<v Speaker 0>So by default,

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:27.840
<v Speaker 0>what

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.515
<v Speaker 0>port is my Grafana gonna run on?

00:09:31.835 --> 00:09:34.075
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna be port 3,000.

00:09:34.315 --> 00:09:37.115
<v Speaker 0>Three thousand. You should yeah. You should be

00:09:37.115 --> 00:09:39.355
<v Speaker 1>able to access it from there. Oh, that's

00:09:39.355 --> 00:09:41.275
<v Speaker 0>my Prometheus. At least we know that works.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.420
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I really should have checked everything again.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.100
<v Speaker 0>So I didn't set up any credentials.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:48.820
<v Speaker 0>What

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.100
<v Speaker 0>do I do here, Mark? Sure. So the

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.860
<v Speaker 1>first time you open up Grafana,

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.740
<v Speaker 1>you'll you'll be given a default

00:09:58.355 --> 00:09:59.155
<v Speaker 1>admin

00:09:59.155 --> 00:10:01.235
<v Speaker 1>account which is admin,

00:10:01.395 --> 00:10:04.035
<v Speaker 1>a d m I n for both username

00:10:04.035 --> 00:10:05.075
<v Speaker 1>and password.

00:10:05.955 --> 00:10:08.675
<v Speaker 1>We'll have to change that right away. So

00:10:08.675 --> 00:10:10.195
<v Speaker 1>there is Well,

00:10:10.435 --> 00:10:12.290
<v Speaker 1>I think that you have Yeah. So if

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:14.370
<v Speaker 1>you're just Yeah. The responsible thing to do

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.130
<v Speaker 1>is just to change it right away.

00:10:20.449 --> 00:10:22.370
<v Speaker 0>I had to change my name and strategy

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:23.810
<v Speaker 0>there for my fake password

00:10:24.625 --> 00:10:26.065
<v Speaker 0>Perfect. I obviously typed it in front of

00:10:26.065 --> 00:10:28.065
<v Speaker 0>everybody. Rawkode one two three. That is my

00:10:28.065 --> 00:10:30.385
<v Speaker 0>Google password too. Good luck everyone. Awesome.

00:10:32.785 --> 00:10:35.745
<v Speaker 1>Well, so yeah. I mean, once you logged

00:10:35.745 --> 00:10:36.225
<v Speaker 1>in,

00:10:36.705 --> 00:10:38.385
<v Speaker 1>first thing you'll see is the the home

00:10:38.385 --> 00:10:40.900
<v Speaker 1>dashboard as we call it, which is a

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:41.860
<v Speaker 1>dashboard

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.180
<v Speaker 1>just like the ones that you will create,

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.340
<v Speaker 1>but it's a little bit more specific. So

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.100
<v Speaker 1>it kinda helps you get going,

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.260
<v Speaker 1>where to start, where to go next.

00:10:51.645 --> 00:10:52.525
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.

00:10:53.085 --> 00:10:55.645
<v Speaker 0>So we're not gonna follow this tutorial.

00:10:55.965 --> 00:10:57.885
<v Speaker 0>I mean, we're we're just gonna dive straight

00:10:57.885 --> 00:10:59.565
<v Speaker 0>on another data source. Right? We're feeling pretty

00:10:59.565 --> 00:11:00.205
<v Speaker 0>confident.

00:11:00.445 --> 00:11:02.765
<v Speaker 1>I think so. Let's let's go.

00:11:03.245 --> 00:11:05.940
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So we can see that Grafana supports

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:06.820
<v Speaker 0>Prometheus,

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:07.620
<v Speaker 0>Grafana,

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:08.900
<v Speaker 0>OpenTDSDB,

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.340
<v Speaker 0>OpenTDSDB,

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.460
<v Speaker 0>and FluxDB,

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.060
<v Speaker 0>and then oh, that there's loads here. I'm

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.220
<v Speaker 0>not gonna list all of I mean, what

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.060
<v Speaker 1>what I actually think is really cool about

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.055
<v Speaker 1>Grafana is that it's it's, you know, it

00:11:19.055 --> 00:11:21.135
<v Speaker 1>started with basically

00:11:21.135 --> 00:11:22.895
<v Speaker 1>just being a visualization

00:11:22.895 --> 00:11:24.175
<v Speaker 1>tool for graphite,

00:11:24.335 --> 00:11:26.335
<v Speaker 1>but it's grown to support so many other

00:11:26.335 --> 00:11:30.095
<v Speaker 1>data sources. And by now it's it's not

00:11:30.335 --> 00:11:32.870
<v Speaker 1>that so when I said that, like seeing

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:34.790
<v Speaker 1>it as a visualization towards just the tip

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:36.870
<v Speaker 1>of the iceberg, I really mean it. It's

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:39.670
<v Speaker 1>like, right now it's a platform where you

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:42.630
<v Speaker 1>you you can connect all different type of

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:43.510
<v Speaker 1>databases.

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:46.394
<v Speaker 1>Grafana doesn't actually store anything itself. So all

00:11:46.394 --> 00:11:48.555
<v Speaker 1>the data is outside Grafana,

00:11:48.555 --> 00:11:51.435
<v Speaker 1>you control it. And if your database is

00:11:51.435 --> 00:11:53.834
<v Speaker 1>not supported, you can build a plugin to

00:11:53.834 --> 00:11:56.394
<v Speaker 1>make it appear in Grafana as well. So

00:11:56.394 --> 00:11:57.995
<v Speaker 1>this is just the ones that are built

00:11:57.995 --> 00:12:00.555
<v Speaker 1>in but yeah, you can write your own

00:12:00.555 --> 00:12:01.035
<v Speaker 1>integration.

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:03.330
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Okay.

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:04.290
<v Speaker 0>So

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:07.650
<v Speaker 0>let's just start with Prometheus. This is the

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:09.410
<v Speaker 0>first one on the list. I'm assuming that's

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:12.290
<v Speaker 0>because most people are running Prometheus.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:14.050
<v Speaker 0>Like is there any rhyme or reason to

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.125
<v Speaker 0>why Prometheus is is first? Yeah. So so

00:12:17.125 --> 00:12:18.964
<v Speaker 1>so we are

00:12:19.365 --> 00:12:22.005
<v Speaker 1>seeing a lot of users using Prometheus

00:12:22.005 --> 00:12:24.805
<v Speaker 1>and Influx and Grafite, OpenTSDB.

00:12:24.805 --> 00:12:26.805
<v Speaker 1>So they they are definitely

00:12:26.885 --> 00:12:28.165
<v Speaker 1>the most popular ones.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.620
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty much it.

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.460
<v Speaker 1>We don't favor any

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.660
<v Speaker 1>database over another but we are seeing a

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.660
<v Speaker 1>lot of people using Prometheus for sure.

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:40.420
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.140
<v Speaker 0>Let me just make sure I still got

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:44.340
<v Speaker 0>this IP address.

00:12:45.255 --> 00:12:46.775
<v Speaker 0>So my Prometheus

00:12:47.015 --> 00:12:48.215
<v Speaker 0>should be available

00:12:49.735 --> 00:12:52.455
<v Speaker 0>on port 9090.

00:12:53.175 --> 00:12:54.375
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's right.

00:12:55.175 --> 00:12:57.495
<v Speaker 0>And we've got access

00:12:57.495 --> 00:12:58.375
<v Speaker 0>server

00:12:58.455 --> 00:12:59.495
<v Speaker 0>or browser.

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:03.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So this is actually something that tend

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:05.770
<v Speaker 1>to trip some people up that

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.930
<v Speaker 1>the access mode is really how Grafana accesses,

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:13.610
<v Speaker 1>know, your your server, in this case Prometheus.

00:13:13.905 --> 00:13:15.425
<v Speaker 1>So Grafana

00:13:15.425 --> 00:13:17.505
<v Speaker 1>is a server component and a front end

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:18.225
<v Speaker 1>component.

00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:20.705
<v Speaker 1>So you can decide whether you want to

00:13:20.705 --> 00:13:21.665
<v Speaker 1>access your

00:13:22.225 --> 00:13:24.545
<v Speaker 1>data source through the browser or through the

00:13:24.545 --> 00:13:24.865
<v Speaker 1>server.

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:27.910
<v Speaker 1>So typically,

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:30.870
<v Speaker 1>yeah, you would pick server because of security

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:33.670
<v Speaker 1>reasons for example, you might not want your

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:36.630
<v Speaker 1>users to authenticate through the browser for example.

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:39.670
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So I'm assuming if I set any

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.575
<v Speaker 0>sort of authentication here and set browser, does

00:13:42.575 --> 00:13:44.895
<v Speaker 0>the browser become aware of that authentication?

00:13:45.135 --> 00:13:46.575
<v Speaker 0>So going for the server is just a

00:13:46.575 --> 00:13:48.015
<v Speaker 0>safer way of doing that?

00:13:48.575 --> 00:13:49.375
<v Speaker 1>So

00:13:50.255 --> 00:13:53.295
<v Speaker 1>you could still use server and basic auth.

00:13:53.295 --> 00:13:54.495
<v Speaker 1>So

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.120
<v Speaker 1>that would mean that the server,

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.000
<v Speaker 1>the request originates from the server but you

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.680
<v Speaker 1>still need to authenticate

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.520
<v Speaker 1>to the endpoints

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.320
<v Speaker 1>that you're you're getting the metrics from.

00:14:06.215 --> 00:14:07.495
<v Speaker 0>Okay. No problem.

00:14:08.135 --> 00:14:10.295
<v Speaker 0>So I haven't configured any

00:14:10.695 --> 00:14:13.175
<v Speaker 0>TLS, anything like that or CAs. This is

00:14:13.175 --> 00:14:15.415
<v Speaker 0>a a pretty wild setup that I did

00:14:15.415 --> 00:14:17.655
<v Speaker 0>very quickly. So I'm assuming I can just

00:14:17.655 --> 00:14:19.175
<v Speaker 0>have save and test here and we can

00:14:19.175 --> 00:14:19.735
<v Speaker 0>just

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.980
<v Speaker 0>we get a green little banner there. So

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.300
<v Speaker 0>I'm pretty comfortable. I love it. Yeah. Good.

00:14:25.579 --> 00:14:27.180
<v Speaker 0>And I'm just gonna add the influx one

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.940
<v Speaker 0>while I'm here too. So

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.260
<v Speaker 0>oh, okay. I can pick between influx q

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:34.620
<v Speaker 0>l and flux. Well, I'm gonna go with

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.100
<v Speaker 0>flux.

00:14:36.575 --> 00:14:37.855
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That's that's

00:14:38.575 --> 00:14:41.214
<v Speaker 1>that's in beta right now. So we'll see

00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:42.175
<v Speaker 1>how that goes.

00:14:47.535 --> 00:14:48.654
<v Speaker 0>Token, token, token.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.430
<v Speaker 0>Good question.

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.150
<v Speaker 0>I would just pop over here for thirty

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:56.070
<v Speaker 0>seconds and

00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:00.550
<v Speaker 0>grab my token and a nice secure friendly.

00:15:04.324 --> 00:15:06.964
<v Speaker 0>And I even remembered the influx password.

00:15:07.285 --> 00:15:09.845
<v Speaker 0>Generally, that's the thing I forget. Okay. Mhmm.

00:15:11.605 --> 00:15:12.324
<v Speaker 0>So

00:15:13.045 --> 00:15:13.444
<v Speaker 0>copy.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:18.379
<v Speaker 0>Perfect. I'm pretty sure the bucket was Rawkode

00:15:18.379 --> 00:15:19.740
<v Speaker 0>as well. So if I hit save and

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.980
<v Speaker 0>test, we get green. Wonderful.

00:15:22.939 --> 00:15:25.339
<v Speaker 0>Cool. That means I haven't broken anything since

00:15:25.339 --> 00:15:26.779
<v Speaker 0>I set it all up, which I'm happy

00:15:26.779 --> 00:15:26.939
<v Speaker 0>with.

00:15:27.915 --> 00:15:28.955
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So

00:15:29.515 --> 00:15:31.115
<v Speaker 0>we have two data sources.

00:15:32.635 --> 00:15:34.955
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I I guess now what I

00:15:34.955 --> 00:15:36.875
<v Speaker 0>wanna do is is start creating some of

00:15:36.875 --> 00:15:38.395
<v Speaker 0>these metrics that I've been writing into these

00:15:38.395 --> 00:15:40.475
<v Speaker 0>TSTPs for the last couple of hours.

00:15:41.355 --> 00:15:42.715
<v Speaker 0>What's step on there?

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:45.310
<v Speaker 1>I think yeah. The the the first step

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:47.230
<v Speaker 1>is to check out the explorer.

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:49.870
<v Speaker 1>So in earlier versions of Grafana,

00:15:50.029 --> 00:15:52.590
<v Speaker 1>you would go straight to create a dashboard.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:55.790
<v Speaker 1>But it does involve a little bit of

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.195
<v Speaker 1>setting up. So if you're just want to

00:15:58.195 --> 00:15:59.235
<v Speaker 1>explore,

00:15:59.235 --> 00:16:01.875
<v Speaker 1>play around with the data, look what's there,

00:16:02.115 --> 00:16:03.875
<v Speaker 1>I think explore is a great

00:16:04.595 --> 00:16:05.395
<v Speaker 1>first step.

00:16:06.995 --> 00:16:08.115
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, so

00:16:08.355 --> 00:16:10.195
<v Speaker 1>at the top you can select

00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:12.195
<v Speaker 1>which one of the data sources you wanna

00:16:12.195 --> 00:16:12.515
<v Speaker 1>query.

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:14.090
<v Speaker 1>And

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:16.730
<v Speaker 1>you get a little cheat sheet

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:18.330
<v Speaker 1>as to what you can

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:19.610
<v Speaker 1>query.

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:21.529
<v Speaker 1>I think you can click on them to

00:16:21.529 --> 00:16:22.250
<v Speaker 1>auto

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:24.090
<v Speaker 1>complete them but

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:25.690
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:26.490
<v Speaker 0>So

00:16:26.735 --> 00:16:27.695
<v Speaker 0>we'll

00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:29.775
<v Speaker 0>with Prometheus because there's no one fox d

00:16:29.775 --> 00:16:31.055
<v Speaker 0>b cheat sheet and that means I'm gonna

00:16:31.055 --> 00:16:32.575
<v Speaker 0>have to remember stuff. Which

00:16:32.975 --> 00:16:34.975
<v Speaker 0>I'm which I'm happy to I I will

00:16:34.975 --> 00:16:37.775
<v Speaker 0>remember of course. But we'll start with Prometheus.

00:16:38.255 --> 00:16:40.655
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Sure. And see. So if I click

00:16:40.655 --> 00:16:43.360
<v Speaker 0>on metrics here. So it's actually gonna list

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.280
<v Speaker 0>all of the metrics names that we have

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.640
<v Speaker 0>available. Yeah.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.560
<v Speaker 1>You don't actually have to. Okay.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:53.440
<v Speaker 0>So

00:16:54.014 --> 00:16:55.695
<v Speaker 0>let's start with

00:16:56.255 --> 00:16:58.095
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You can check out Node maybe.

00:16:58.894 --> 00:17:00.575
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You you you get a lot of

00:17:00.575 --> 00:17:02.334
<v Speaker 1>metrics from the Node exporter.

00:17:02.575 --> 00:17:04.335
<v Speaker 1>Just pick your favorite one.

00:17:05.375 --> 00:17:06.415
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That's a good one.

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:09.410
<v Speaker 1>I Yeah.

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:11.410
<v Speaker 1>So it looks like it's running.

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:14.609
<v Speaker 1>You see the little progress up there? Yeah.

00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:15.250
<v Speaker 1>There

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:16.530
<v Speaker 1>you go.

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:22.530
<v Speaker 0>Now that says showing only 20 time series

00:17:22.155 --> 00:17:24.715
<v Speaker 0>show. Okay. So that takes quite a while

00:17:24.715 --> 00:17:26.554
<v Speaker 0>there because there's

00:17:27.994 --> 00:17:29.995
<v Speaker 0>sorry. I'm not I'm not really sure. Why

00:17:29.995 --> 00:17:31.755
<v Speaker 0>does that take a little while? What does

00:17:31.755 --> 00:17:33.595
<v Speaker 0>eleven fifty two mean here? That's a lot

00:17:33.595 --> 00:17:36.475
<v Speaker 1>of time series you got there. And the

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:39.070
<v Speaker 1>most likely scenario is that you have

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:42.350
<v Speaker 1>a lot of labels that are very

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:44.030
<v Speaker 1>that are varying a lot.

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:45.549
<v Speaker 1>I'm

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:48.190
<v Speaker 1>trying to see what kind of labels you

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:48.830
<v Speaker 1>have.

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:51.390
<v Speaker 0>See if I can zoom in on this

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:51.950
<v Speaker 0>a little bit.

00:17:55.845 --> 00:17:57.125
<v Speaker 0>Computer says no.

00:17:58.645 --> 00:18:00.005
<v Speaker 0>Why won't you zoom?

00:18:00.645 --> 00:18:02.645
<v Speaker 0>Let's try it from this photo here.

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:07.210
<v Speaker 1>So what you could do,

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:09.690
<v Speaker 1>it could be that you have a

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, you could have a lot of

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:15.929
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:17.770
<v Speaker 1>So

00:18:17.255 --> 00:18:19.255
<v Speaker 1>for every value

00:18:19.255 --> 00:18:20.295
<v Speaker 1>of a label

00:18:20.455 --> 00:18:21.255
<v Speaker 1>here,

00:18:21.335 --> 00:18:23.495
<v Speaker 1>you get another time series.

00:18:23.815 --> 00:18:26.535
<v Speaker 1>So even though it looks like we've only

00:18:26.615 --> 00:18:27.415
<v Speaker 1>queried

00:18:27.415 --> 00:18:29.815
<v Speaker 1>one single time series in node CPU seconds

00:18:29.815 --> 00:18:32.799
<v Speaker 1>total, that is actually gonna return a bunch

00:18:32.799 --> 00:18:33.919
<v Speaker 1>of time series

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.040
<v Speaker 1>for every value, you know, every permutation of

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.239
<v Speaker 1>the the labels

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.080
<v Speaker 1>that you have down there.

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:40.960
<v Speaker 1>So

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:42.720
<v Speaker 1>we might

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.960
<v Speaker 1>if you know, maybe we can limit the

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.625
<v Speaker 1>instance. I'm not sure how many instances you're

00:18:47.625 --> 00:18:49.144
<v Speaker 1>getting the metrics from.

00:18:49.705 --> 00:18:52.024
<v Speaker 1>We can also limit the mode.

00:18:52.505 --> 00:18:55.385
<v Speaker 1>So maybe maybe we want to see

00:18:55.385 --> 00:18:56.985
<v Speaker 1>how much CPU

00:18:56.985 --> 00:18:59.945
<v Speaker 1>we're currently using maybe. So let's

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:02.029
<v Speaker 1>I think you can

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:04.110
<v Speaker 1>select

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:06.429
<v Speaker 1>the idle mode and just

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:10.190
<v Speaker 0>Well, my tab there was giving up on

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:10.750
<v Speaker 0>life.

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:12.110
<v Speaker 1>Uh-huh. Alright.

00:19:12.675 --> 00:19:13.395
<v Speaker 0>I

00:19:14.035 --> 00:19:16.435
<v Speaker 0>may even pop this open and Chrome if

00:19:16.435 --> 00:19:18.115
<v Speaker 0>that happens again. But let's see what happens

00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:20.995
<v Speaker 0>now. Yeah. Alright. So Sure. Let's pick something

00:19:20.995 --> 00:19:23.555
<v Speaker 0>that's maybe not as verbose to start with.

00:19:23.555 --> 00:19:24.195
<v Speaker 0>Let's try

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.080
<v Speaker 0>up. Right? That should just be a single.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.919
<v Speaker 0>There we go. Yeah. Nice and fast. There

00:19:28.919 --> 00:19:29.639
<v Speaker 1>you go.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.479
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So the up is a great,

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.720
<v Speaker 1>you know, good time series to just check

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.320
<v Speaker 1>that everything is working.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.880
<v Speaker 1>You can alert on it, you know.

00:19:41.185 --> 00:19:42.865
<v Speaker 1>So it's a good good start.

00:19:43.185 --> 00:19:45.585
<v Speaker 1>Looks like it's working though. Yeah. And each

00:19:45.585 --> 00:19:47.505
<v Speaker 0>one of these is just my

00:19:48.785 --> 00:19:51.345
<v Speaker 0>each copy of the node exporter, I guess.

00:19:52.385 --> 00:19:53.345
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I think so.

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:55.610
<v Speaker 0>Let's see why I've got four here. So

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:58.090
<v Speaker 0>I think Prometheus scraping itself plus I've got

00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:00.010
<v Speaker 0>a node export machine and then three. Yeah.

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:01.129
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Cool. Yeah.

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:06.169
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's try taking a look at

00:20:09.035 --> 00:20:10.875
<v Speaker 0>I don't know what APT is.

00:20:11.915 --> 00:20:12.955
<v Speaker 1>Could

00:20:12.955 --> 00:20:15.275
<v Speaker 1>it be Aptitude from Ubuntu?

00:20:15.275 --> 00:20:17.195
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. I don't know. Maybe it's

00:20:17.195 --> 00:20:19.115
<v Speaker 0>actually Maybe the node exporter does some apps.

00:20:19.115 --> 00:20:21.309
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Maybe. I'm not sure. Oh yeah. Upgrades

00:20:21.309 --> 00:20:23.789
<v Speaker 0>pending. There we go. Oh, that's cool. I

00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:24.669
<v Speaker 1>didn't know that.

00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:27.070
<v Speaker 0>Oh, well, we'll learn together.

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:30.109
<v Speaker 0>So this is okay. So it's just yeah.

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:32.190
<v Speaker 0>It's obviously checking the app cache behind the

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:34.830
<v Speaker 0>scenes pulling down the updates. Yeah. Alright. How

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:35.629
<v Speaker 0>do we

00:20:37.365 --> 00:20:39.765
<v Speaker 0>try and so when we were looking at

00:20:39.765 --> 00:20:40.405
<v Speaker 0>the

00:20:41.765 --> 00:20:43.685
<v Speaker 0>those node metrics and maybe I'll just pick

00:20:43.685 --> 00:20:45.045
<v Speaker 0>another one and hopefully we get a bit

00:20:45.045 --> 00:20:48.085
<v Speaker 0>luckier with a number. Let's try this guy

00:20:48.085 --> 00:20:49.205
<v Speaker 0>on now.

00:20:50.429 --> 00:20:52.909
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. See this look at that. A blurb.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:55.950
<v Speaker 0>Although this isn't a counter, which is what

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:58.029
<v Speaker 0>I was gonna say. Because it Grafana gave

00:20:58.029 --> 00:20:59.389
<v Speaker 0>me a hint. It was like, hey, this

00:20:59.389 --> 00:21:01.789
<v Speaker 0>is a counter type. You probably you don't

00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:03.389
<v Speaker 0>want to view this raw. You actually want

00:21:03.389 --> 00:21:06.134
<v Speaker 0>to calculate some sort of aggregation over time.

00:21:06.135 --> 00:21:08.054
<v Speaker 0>So So

00:21:09.414 --> 00:21:10.455
<v Speaker 1>Let's try.

00:21:11.655 --> 00:21:12.855
<v Speaker 1>Not a counter.

00:21:16.294 --> 00:21:18.375
<v Speaker 0>Maybe I'll risk it just to CPU again.

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:21.309
<v Speaker 0>Although, I think base total should be a

00:21:21.309 --> 00:21:22.509
<v Speaker 0>counter to be fair.

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:26.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That that's a heavy one.

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:30.429
<v Speaker 1>I mean, we could try to limit the

00:21:30.429 --> 00:21:32.269
<v Speaker 1>number of time series, but

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.030
<v Speaker 1>yeah, that's a good question.

00:21:35.205 --> 00:21:37.124
<v Speaker 0>So yeah, it gave me this here.

00:21:37.605 --> 00:21:40.325
<v Speaker 0>So it says metric node CPU seconds total

00:21:40.325 --> 00:21:42.565
<v Speaker 0>as a counter. So I'm assuming it's understanding

00:21:42.565 --> 00:21:44.644
<v Speaker 0>what Prometheus is returning over the API and

00:21:44.644 --> 00:21:45.765
<v Speaker 0>then trying to give me a little bit

00:21:45.765 --> 00:21:47.845
<v Speaker 0>of hints about how I should actually visualize

00:21:47.845 --> 00:21:49.365
<v Speaker 0>this. So if I run a rate over

00:21:49.365 --> 00:21:49.924
<v Speaker 0>five minutes.

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:52.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.700
<v Speaker 1>You what you could also do is just

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:57.340
<v Speaker 1>to limit for like one machine or something.

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:58.940
<v Speaker 1>If you just wanna make it a little

00:21:58.940 --> 00:21:59.980
<v Speaker 1>more responsive,

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:00.540
<v Speaker 1>Heather.

00:22:05.165 --> 00:22:08.045
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let let's do that then. So let's

00:22:08.045 --> 00:22:09.485
<v Speaker 0>see if I remember how to do this.

00:22:09.485 --> 00:22:11.405
<v Speaker 0>If I grab the IP address, I can

00:22:11.405 --> 00:22:11.965
<v Speaker 0>come in here.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:18.619
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. There we go. Exactly.

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:20.220
<v Speaker 1>And And

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:21.980
<v Speaker 1>instance. Instance

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:23.980
<v Speaker 0>equals.

00:22:25.179 --> 00:22:27.659
<v Speaker 0>Oh, it's actually giving me complete. Nice.

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:28.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:22:31.235 --> 00:22:33.475
<v Speaker 0>So I can just hit run. Yeah. See

00:22:33.475 --> 00:22:34.195
<v Speaker 1>if that

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:43.009
<v Speaker 0>It's still quite chunky.

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:44.690
<v Speaker 1>That is curious.

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:46.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I wonder why you're

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:50.690
<v Speaker 1>a lot of time series. So Oh, how

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:53.250
<v Speaker 1>many CPUs do you have? Yeah. It looks

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:55.090
<v Speaker 1>like you have 10 CPUs on

00:22:55.485 --> 00:22:57.485
<v Speaker 1>every

00:22:58.605 --> 00:23:00.524
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That's gonna multiply

00:23:00.845 --> 00:23:03.725
<v Speaker 1>the time series, but I think it's fine.

00:23:04.605 --> 00:23:05.804
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Well,

00:23:06.045 --> 00:23:08.210
<v Speaker 0>we've added the Prometheus data source. We've done

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:09.810
<v Speaker 0>a little bit of querying on the Prometheus

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:11.730
<v Speaker 0>side. Let's jump over to the influx DB

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:14.530
<v Speaker 0>side and then let's take and then I

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:17.090
<v Speaker 0>think from conversations that we've had is that

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:20.290
<v Speaker 0>there's some dashboards that are available online open

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:22.415
<v Speaker 0>source that would actually allow us to create

00:23:22.415 --> 00:23:24.655
<v Speaker 0>a quick step or monitoring of these machines.

00:23:24.655 --> 00:23:25.615
<v Speaker 0>So we can take a look at that

00:23:25.615 --> 00:23:26.095
<v Speaker 0>too.

00:23:26.815 --> 00:23:28.975
<v Speaker 0>And I'm gonna close this tab because it

00:23:28.975 --> 00:23:29.615
<v Speaker 0>just

00:23:29.775 --> 00:23:31.855
<v Speaker 0>the minute I do that query, it breaks.

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:34.750
<v Speaker 0>And I think it's just my setup. I

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:36.030
<v Speaker 0>don't think it's anything

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:38.110
<v Speaker 0>Grafana related.

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:40.750
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So let's take a look. This is

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:42.670
<v Speaker 0>the influx DB query thing. So this is

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:44.750
<v Speaker 0>the new beta stuff that you you said

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:46.510
<v Speaker 0>is is pretty new. So this is working

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:48.515
<v Speaker 0>with influx DB two and their new query

00:23:48.515 --> 00:23:50.115
<v Speaker 0>language flux.

00:23:50.595 --> 00:23:54.355
<v Speaker 0>Now let's see if I remember how to

00:23:54.355 --> 00:23:55.235
<v Speaker 0>do the thing.

00:23:58.115 --> 00:23:58.595
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:23:59.155 --> 00:24:00.674
<v Speaker 0>Forget if I could zoom this in.

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:03.370
<v Speaker 0>Oh, there we go.

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:05.210
<v Speaker 0>I may have to zoom it back out

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:07.610
<v Speaker 0>when I'm done. But so the flux syntax,

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:09.049
<v Speaker 0>I can see from bucket

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:12.330
<v Speaker 0>range

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:13.770
<v Speaker 0>start

00:24:14.505 --> 00:24:16.745
<v Speaker 0>one day ago. In fact, let's just do

00:24:16.745 --> 00:24:17.465
<v Speaker 0>one hour

00:24:18.025 --> 00:24:19.705
<v Speaker 0>and then filter.

00:24:22.425 --> 00:24:23.945
<v Speaker 0>I I could just do that. Right? And

00:24:23.945 --> 00:24:25.225
<v Speaker 0>that will return all the metrics.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.040
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.680
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had the chance to play with

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.640
<v Speaker 1>flux yet. So I'm in your hands right

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.720
<v Speaker 1>now. That's alright. I've

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.080
<v Speaker 0>got at least 5% confidence in my ability.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:41.480
<v Speaker 1>Good enough.

00:24:44.865 --> 00:24:45.825
<v Speaker 0>Did it run?

00:24:47.025 --> 00:24:49.105
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It did. Okay. So I can see

00:24:49.105 --> 00:24:50.384
<v Speaker 0>we've got CPU.

00:24:52.945 --> 00:24:53.345
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.960
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It did. Okay. So let's just filter

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.519
<v Speaker 0>this on that same metric filter

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.120
<v Speaker 0>function

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.240
<v Speaker 0>row

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.000
<v Speaker 0>row dot

00:25:09.955 --> 00:25:10.834
<v Speaker 0>CPU

00:25:12.914 --> 00:25:13.954
<v Speaker 0>usage

00:25:13.955 --> 00:25:14.994
<v Speaker 0>guest.

00:25:17.154 --> 00:25:17.874
<v Speaker 0>Fine.

00:25:18.595 --> 00:25:21.154
<v Speaker 0>Let's just let's see what happens. Alright.

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:22.729
<v Speaker 0>Run.

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:28.969
<v Speaker 0>Have I broke it?

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:32.010
<v Speaker 1>Looks like it ran.

00:25:34.345 --> 00:25:36.265
<v Speaker 0>So I'm a little bit confused by this

00:25:36.265 --> 00:25:38.184
<v Speaker 0>graph here. This is showing

00:25:40.184 --> 00:25:42.585
<v Speaker 0>I mean, it's not my filter here. Right?

00:25:42.585 --> 00:25:44.184
<v Speaker 0>So I said filter only show me this

00:25:44.184 --> 00:25:46.505
<v Speaker 0>measurement where CPU usage gets nice, but I

00:25:46.505 --> 00:25:48.105
<v Speaker 0>can still see the bolt d b one

00:25:48.105 --> 00:25:48.345
<v Speaker 0>here.

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:50.990
<v Speaker 0>I mean, how is there any way for

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:52.269
<v Speaker 0>me to debug this?

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:55.070
<v Speaker 1>If you try first try to run the

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.950
<v Speaker 1>query again. Maybe

00:26:03.684 --> 00:26:05.445
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Doesn't okay.

00:26:06.085 --> 00:26:08.164
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.

00:26:08.245 --> 00:26:10.725
<v Speaker 1>You can try the query inspector

00:26:11.045 --> 00:26:13.525
<v Speaker 1>that that you can if you look under

00:26:13.525 --> 00:26:14.725
<v Speaker 1>the query field

00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:18.450
<v Speaker 1>to the right,

00:26:19.169 --> 00:26:19.889
<v Speaker 1>you go.

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:23.809
<v Speaker 1>If you check the core inspector, I think

00:26:23.809 --> 00:26:25.729
<v Speaker 1>you can see what the actual

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:28.450
<v Speaker 1>yeah, that's what you're getting back.

00:26:29.245 --> 00:26:32.365
<v Speaker 1>You can also check what your request was

00:26:32.365 --> 00:26:33.244
<v Speaker 1>if you're

00:26:34.605 --> 00:26:36.845
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I'm gonna cheat. If you're unsure.

00:26:37.804 --> 00:26:40.284
<v Speaker 0>Let's pop over here. I'm gonna just copy

00:26:40.284 --> 00:26:41.885
<v Speaker 0>a query so that it's not

00:26:42.649 --> 00:26:45.210
<v Speaker 0>I don't need to remember anything. So let's

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:46.089
<v Speaker 0>hit go.

00:26:54.009 --> 00:26:56.409
<v Speaker 0>Maybe I'm maybe I'm monitoring too much. Alright.

00:26:56.615 --> 00:26:58.775
<v Speaker 0>Go away. So let's run this again. There

00:26:58.775 --> 00:27:00.775
<v Speaker 0>we go. Now I just need to fix

00:27:00.775 --> 00:27:02.934
<v Speaker 0>this because these variables won't exist.

00:27:03.335 --> 00:27:05.015
<v Speaker 0>Stop as an important.

00:27:06.775 --> 00:27:08.615
<v Speaker 0>Let's see if that works.

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.740
<v Speaker 0>So if I just pop open this response,

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:17.580
<v Speaker 0>got a data frame.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:21.100
<v Speaker 0>I have no idea what that means. Yeah.

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.980
<v Speaker 1>That that's not very helpful, admit. That's yeah.

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:24.540
<v Speaker 1>That's

00:27:24.965 --> 00:27:27.605
<v Speaker 1>that's the action the the the encoded data

00:27:27.605 --> 00:27:29.445
<v Speaker 1>frame. That's not gonna help be helpful for

00:27:29.445 --> 00:27:30.485
<v Speaker 1>you right now.

00:27:31.285 --> 00:27:32.645
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. If you close that

00:27:32.805 --> 00:27:35.445
<v Speaker 1>okay. It didn't seem to get any time

00:27:35.445 --> 00:27:36.165
<v Speaker 1>series from that.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.119
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's forget that then.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.559
<v Speaker 0>Wait. We just forget the index speedy stuff

00:27:42.559 --> 00:27:43.600
<v Speaker 0>never happened because of

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.080
<v Speaker 0>okay. So

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.919
<v Speaker 0>Grafana has this ability to explore metrics. We

00:27:49.919 --> 00:27:51.735
<v Speaker 0>kinda got that working. Mhmm.

00:27:52.375 --> 00:27:54.055
<v Speaker 0>Probably it would have helped if I understood

00:27:54.055 --> 00:27:55.415
<v Speaker 0>the data model a little bit more about

00:27:55.415 --> 00:27:57.095
<v Speaker 0>what I'm I'm throwing into this thing, but

00:27:57.095 --> 00:27:58.695
<v Speaker 0>we're just making up as we go along.

00:27:58.855 --> 00:28:00.535
<v Speaker 1>Mhmm. Now the explore

00:28:00.535 --> 00:28:02.855
<v Speaker 0>visual the explore thing here. Right? That's really

00:28:02.855 --> 00:28:04.670
<v Speaker 0>good for kind of ad hoc. Like, I

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:07.230
<v Speaker 0>don't really know what I wanna understand yet.

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:09.549
<v Speaker 0>Right? Like, would you say that the default

00:28:09.549 --> 00:28:12.110
<v Speaker 0>application of Grafana would be that, you know,

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:13.870
<v Speaker 0>you go to dashboard. So you you pre

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:15.710
<v Speaker 0>built so you understand the systems a little

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:17.524
<v Speaker 0>bit better. That makes sense?

00:28:18.005 --> 00:28:21.365
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, for sure. If you're not really sure

00:28:21.365 --> 00:28:23.765
<v Speaker 1>yet what you wanna monitor, I would say

00:28:23.765 --> 00:28:24.965
<v Speaker 1>explore is great.

00:28:25.605 --> 00:28:26.485
<v Speaker 1>Dashboards

00:28:26.485 --> 00:28:28.644
<v Speaker 1>is kinda, you know, curated

00:28:29.445 --> 00:28:32.190
<v Speaker 1>insights. You know, you you you figure out

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:35.150
<v Speaker 1>what you want and then you curate

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:37.630
<v Speaker 1>a dashboard with the information that you actually

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:40.110
<v Speaker 1>want to see in in a like a

00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:41.790
<v Speaker 1>at a glance

00:28:42.715 --> 00:28:43.594
<v Speaker 1>view.

00:28:43.914 --> 00:28:45.995
<v Speaker 1>So yeah, I think the next step is

00:28:45.995 --> 00:28:49.274
<v Speaker 1>to go in and create a dashboard possibly.

00:28:51.514 --> 00:28:52.315
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:28:52.315 --> 00:28:53.914
<v Speaker 0>So let's see.

00:28:54.235 --> 00:28:56.154
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You can go to the plus in

00:28:56.154 --> 00:28:57.514
<v Speaker 1>the side menu, that works too.

00:28:58.540 --> 00:28:59.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:05.260
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So dashboard has something called panel. I

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:06.620
<v Speaker 0>click add panel.

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:08.059
<v Speaker 0>And

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:08.940
<v Speaker 0>this

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:11.260
<v Speaker 0>okay. So I can just build up my

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:12.700
<v Speaker 0>query the same way I did on the

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:15.185
<v Speaker 0>explorer view. Right? Yes. Yes. So if I

00:29:15.185 --> 00:29:17.185
<v Speaker 0>wanna track the app upgrades I've been pending

00:29:17.185 --> 00:29:18.065
<v Speaker 0>over time

00:29:18.305 --> 00:29:20.705
<v Speaker 0>Yep. Then we can see that graph pretty

00:29:20.705 --> 00:29:21.825
<v Speaker 0>quickly there.

00:29:22.545 --> 00:29:23.345
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:29:23.985 --> 00:29:26.225
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So it yeah. It's basically the same

00:29:26.225 --> 00:29:27.905
<v Speaker 1>as you had in explorer.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.200
<v Speaker 1>So you can you can take that into

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.320
<v Speaker 1>I I think at some point, if not

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.120
<v Speaker 1>already,

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.040
<v Speaker 1>we we should have a feature to go

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.600
<v Speaker 1>from explore and then just create it in

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.035
<v Speaker 1>the dashboard as well. I know that you

00:29:42.035 --> 00:29:44.275
<v Speaker 1>can go from the panel to explore mode,

00:29:44.275 --> 00:29:46.515
<v Speaker 1>but I think that we're working on getting

00:29:46.515 --> 00:29:47.235
<v Speaker 1>the

00:29:47.475 --> 00:29:48.914
<v Speaker 1>two ways as well.

00:29:50.275 --> 00:29:52.115
<v Speaker 0>Okay, that makes sense. So

00:29:52.434 --> 00:29:54.275
<v Speaker 0>how much control do I have over this

00:29:54.275 --> 00:29:55.154
<v Speaker 0>visualization?

00:29:55.155 --> 00:29:57.450
<v Speaker 0>Can I tweak this? Can I change What

00:29:57.530 --> 00:29:58.970
<v Speaker 0>are my options? Yeah, sure.

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:00.729
<v Speaker 1>So we

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:03.289
<v Speaker 1>basically have three parts to what we're seeing

00:30:03.289 --> 00:30:05.210
<v Speaker 1>right now. Right now we're in the edit

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:06.570
<v Speaker 1>mode of a panel.

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:07.450
<v Speaker 1>And

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:11.130
<v Speaker 1>I guess the simplest way of explaining is

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:13.135
<v Speaker 1>that a panel is really a query and

00:30:13.135 --> 00:30:14.335
<v Speaker 1>a visualization.

00:30:14.735 --> 00:30:15.294
<v Speaker 1>And

00:30:16.255 --> 00:30:18.735
<v Speaker 1>what you see where you already went was

00:30:18.735 --> 00:30:21.855
<v Speaker 1>the query editor, that's the one that's down

00:30:21.855 --> 00:30:22.815
<v Speaker 1>to the left.

00:30:23.695 --> 00:30:26.655
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to the right, you

00:30:26.655 --> 00:30:27.855
<v Speaker 1>have the panel editor,

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:30.890
<v Speaker 1>which is responsible for controlling

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:33.450
<v Speaker 1>how we visualize data. So you can set

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:35.690
<v Speaker 1>the title, you can add a description and

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:37.610
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that. That is more general for

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:38.410
<v Speaker 1>all panels.

00:30:40.675 --> 00:30:43.955
<v Speaker 1>And then the next session section you'll see

00:30:43.955 --> 00:30:44.675
<v Speaker 1>is

00:30:44.915 --> 00:30:45.315
<v Speaker 1>yeah.

00:30:46.355 --> 00:30:48.755
<v Speaker 1>I'm just clicking stuff. Sorry. Nice. Very nice.

00:30:48.755 --> 00:30:51.795
<v Speaker 1>So the next section is the visualization section.

00:30:51.795 --> 00:30:54.355
<v Speaker 1>And then here you will actually get the

00:30:54.355 --> 00:30:56.490
<v Speaker 1>chance to select a visualization

00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:58.570
<v Speaker 1>that is more appropriate for the data you

00:30:58.570 --> 00:30:59.690
<v Speaker 1>wanna visualize.

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:02.330
<v Speaker 1>So you got a bunch of built in

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:04.170
<v Speaker 1>ones here, but again, you can extend this

00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:04.809
<v Speaker 1>with

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:07.450
<v Speaker 1>more visualizations

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:08.250
<v Speaker 1>from plugins.

00:31:09.145 --> 00:31:10.745
<v Speaker 1>But in this case, I think we can

00:31:10.745 --> 00:31:13.465
<v Speaker 1>just go with the graph for now. Yeah,

00:31:13.465 --> 00:31:15.144
<v Speaker 0>think that makes sense. Yeah.

00:31:15.945 --> 00:31:19.545
<v Speaker 1>And for the So the next sections are

00:31:19.545 --> 00:31:22.105
<v Speaker 1>more specific to this visualization

00:31:22.105 --> 00:31:23.385
<v Speaker 1>type, which is the graph.

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:25.230
<v Speaker 1>So, yeah,

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:27.310
<v Speaker 1>you can you can set it to be

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:28.590
<v Speaker 1>bars, lines,

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:32.030
<v Speaker 1>got points,

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:35.995
<v Speaker 1>can set all kinds of stuff here. I

00:31:35.995 --> 00:31:37.914
<v Speaker 1>usually go when it when it comes to,

00:31:37.914 --> 00:31:40.235
<v Speaker 1>you know, time series, I usually prefer the

00:31:40.235 --> 00:31:40.955
<v Speaker 1>lines.

00:31:42.715 --> 00:31:44.635
<v Speaker 1>And this is just a personal taste, but

00:31:44.635 --> 00:31:47.275
<v Speaker 1>I I actually like to remove the the

00:31:47.275 --> 00:31:48.635
<v Speaker 1>the area fill.

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:49.590
<v Speaker 1>So

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:52.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't actually see I only see the

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:54.390
<v Speaker 1>lines, but it's totally up to you. You

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:56.710
<v Speaker 1>can you can choose however you like.

00:31:57.670 --> 00:31:59.510
<v Speaker 1>If you wanna get fancy, you can even

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:01.270
<v Speaker 1>set a gradient for the the fill as

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:02.150
<v Speaker 1>well. So

00:32:05.485 --> 00:32:06.765
<v Speaker 0>Oh. Yeah, exactly.

00:32:08.445 --> 00:32:09.965
<v Speaker 1>Killer feature, I know.

00:32:11.485 --> 00:32:13.405
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, these things are important when you gotta

00:32:13.405 --> 00:32:14.525
<v Speaker 0>look at them all day.

00:32:15.325 --> 00:32:15.645
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.359
<v Speaker 1>Also

00:32:17.679 --> 00:32:18.799
<v Speaker 1>staircase

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.399
<v Speaker 1>could be

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.840
<v Speaker 1>a good option for you as well depending

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:26.720
<v Speaker 1>on how your data looks like. So

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.960
<v Speaker 1>if you only have discrete

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.465
<v Speaker 1>points, you

00:32:31.465 --> 00:32:33.385
<v Speaker 1>don't wanna show them interpolated.

00:32:33.385 --> 00:32:36.505
<v Speaker 1>So staircase helps you to really show where

00:32:36.505 --> 00:32:37.065
<v Speaker 1>the

00:32:37.784 --> 00:32:38.825
<v Speaker 1>points are.

00:32:42.024 --> 00:32:42.744
<v Speaker 1>And

00:32:43.145 --> 00:32:43.865
<v Speaker 1>what have we?

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:48.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You can can stack the the

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:51.510
<v Speaker 1>time series as well.

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:56.070
<v Speaker 1>Of course, stacking has some problems

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:59.545
<v Speaker 1>as well in in terms of understanding

00:32:59.545 --> 00:33:02.265
<v Speaker 1>what is actually happening in the graph. But

00:33:02.265 --> 00:33:04.025
<v Speaker 1>if if your use case

00:33:04.745 --> 00:33:06.265
<v Speaker 1>needs stacking

00:33:06.265 --> 00:33:07.385
<v Speaker 1>visualization,

00:33:07.385 --> 00:33:08.505
<v Speaker 1>then there you go.

00:33:09.225 --> 00:33:11.145
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You can you can change the the

00:33:11.145 --> 00:33:12.665
<v Speaker 1>units of each

00:33:13.225 --> 00:33:13.785
<v Speaker 1>axis.

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.480
<v Speaker 1>So you would have to know up ahead

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.080
<v Speaker 1>of time what

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.640
<v Speaker 1>unit the data source is returning.

00:33:26.554 --> 00:33:27.994
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. We're

00:33:28.315 --> 00:33:31.035
<v Speaker 1>we're working on adding more, you know, hints

00:33:31.035 --> 00:33:33.515
<v Speaker 1>from the data source to let, you know,

00:33:33.515 --> 00:33:34.475
<v Speaker 1>the the

00:33:34.794 --> 00:33:38.635
<v Speaker 1>the visualization do better guess at what units

00:33:38.635 --> 00:33:39.434
<v Speaker 1>should be set.

00:33:41.529 --> 00:33:42.570
<v Speaker 1>But for now,

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:46.409
<v Speaker 1>just just you have to know what what

00:33:46.409 --> 00:33:49.210
<v Speaker 1>unit. If you're using Prometheus then then you

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:51.450
<v Speaker 1>have a little idea because usually you see

00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:53.769
<v Speaker 1>bytes or you get you see seconds or

00:33:53.769 --> 00:33:54.809
<v Speaker 1>whatever

00:33:55.245 --> 00:33:56.125
<v Speaker 1>could be.

00:33:56.525 --> 00:33:59.165
<v Speaker 1>Okay. But yeah, so you have some options

00:33:59.165 --> 00:34:00.445
<v Speaker 1>here. And

00:34:01.965 --> 00:34:03.085
<v Speaker 1>for the graph,

00:34:03.965 --> 00:34:05.805
<v Speaker 1>if you scroll down you have something called

00:34:05.805 --> 00:34:09.245
<v Speaker 1>series overrides which is really the next, if

00:34:09.245 --> 00:34:10.764
<v Speaker 1>you really want to dig in there,

00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:13.349
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to scroll up a

00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:15.510
<v Speaker 1>little, no, a little more,

00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:17.750
<v Speaker 1>there. There we go. Series overrides.

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:19.670
<v Speaker 1>And this lets you set

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:20.790
<v Speaker 1>custom

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:22.790
<v Speaker 1>settings for each time series.

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:24.230
<v Speaker 1>So

00:34:24.315 --> 00:34:25.435
<v Speaker 1>do a regular

00:34:25.594 --> 00:34:27.675
<v Speaker 1>expression for the time series you wanna adjust

00:34:27.675 --> 00:34:29.915
<v Speaker 1>for. So you can set one time series

00:34:29.915 --> 00:34:32.474
<v Speaker 1>to be points or

00:34:32.474 --> 00:34:33.275
<v Speaker 1>another

00:34:33.275 --> 00:34:35.275
<v Speaker 1>to be bars and so on.

00:34:35.514 --> 00:34:37.435
<v Speaker 1>So if you really wanna dig into it,

00:34:37.435 --> 00:34:38.155
<v Speaker 1>that's where you go.

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:41.010
<v Speaker 1>This,

00:34:41.969 --> 00:34:43.570
<v Speaker 1>a little background,

00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:46.130
<v Speaker 1>the series overrides was something

00:34:46.449 --> 00:34:49.010
<v Speaker 1>that's been very powerful,

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:52.130
<v Speaker 1>but it's really been only available for a

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:53.570
<v Speaker 1>couple of visualizations,

00:34:54.145 --> 00:34:56.145
<v Speaker 1>graph being one of them. So

00:34:56.545 --> 00:34:58.305
<v Speaker 1>for seven point o,

00:34:59.745 --> 00:35:02.625
<v Speaker 1>this is now possible for any visualization.

00:35:03.905 --> 00:35:06.145
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the tabs up there

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:09.020
<v Speaker 1>that you see, that's kind of the next

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:10.140
<v Speaker 1>steps.

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:12.780
<v Speaker 1>So that's the evolution of series overrides.

00:35:19.745 --> 00:35:21.345
<v Speaker 1>So there's a there's a lot of work

00:35:21.345 --> 00:35:21.745
<v Speaker 1>go

00:35:22.305 --> 00:35:23.825
<v Speaker 1>moving over to a new

00:35:25.025 --> 00:35:25.825
<v Speaker 1>platform

00:35:26.625 --> 00:35:28.305
<v Speaker 1>in in Grafana.

00:35:28.305 --> 00:35:28.785
<v Speaker 1>And

00:35:30.545 --> 00:35:33.240
<v Speaker 1>the actually the graph is you'd think that's

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:35.720
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that you would migrate to

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.960
<v Speaker 1>the new platform, but it's actually one of

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:40.360
<v Speaker 1>the trickiest parts of Grafana.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:40.920
<v Speaker 1>So

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.640
<v Speaker 1>we're working on it right now. So

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:46.920
<v Speaker 1>it's not been completely migrated to the

00:35:47.085 --> 00:35:48.765
<v Speaker 1>you know, field overrides

00:35:48.765 --> 00:35:49.965
<v Speaker 1>model yet.

00:35:51.405 --> 00:35:53.565
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So I've got a suggestion then.

00:35:54.685 --> 00:35:56.525
<v Speaker 0>Right now, complete

00:35:56.925 --> 00:35:57.805
<v Speaker 0>serendipity,

00:35:57.805 --> 00:36:00.380
<v Speaker 0>I guess, but we're we're actually graphing something

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:02.220
<v Speaker 0>that's very easy for us to change. I

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:03.340
<v Speaker 0>mean, CPU would have been the same. We

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:04.620
<v Speaker 0>could have ran up a process on it

00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:06.380
<v Speaker 0>and try to spike it or whatever. But

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:07.980
<v Speaker 0>the upgrades is actually probably the easiest thing

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:09.340
<v Speaker 0>because I can just go and upgrade one

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:11.340
<v Speaker 0>of these boxes and really change this graph

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:12.140
<v Speaker 0>instantly. So

00:36:13.164 --> 00:36:14.765
<v Speaker 0>what I've seen here and this is where

00:36:14.765 --> 00:36:16.125
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna throw an idea at you and

00:36:16.125 --> 00:36:17.005
<v Speaker 0>we'll see how

00:36:18.125 --> 00:36:20.365
<v Speaker 0>painful this might be. But I see alerts

00:36:20.365 --> 00:36:22.285
<v Speaker 0>and I'm wondering, can we create an alert

00:36:22.285 --> 00:36:23.484
<v Speaker 0>that when a package

00:36:23.645 --> 00:36:25.325
<v Speaker 0>when the number of packages available for upgrade

00:36:25.325 --> 00:36:27.250
<v Speaker 0>goes to zero, we do something

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:30.369
<v Speaker 0>and like Yeah. We can try. The thing.

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:31.730
<v Speaker 0>Like You can try.

00:36:32.849 --> 00:36:35.410
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So if I say zero packages

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:37.650
<v Speaker 0>is the name of my other I'm just

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:39.250
<v Speaker 0>making this up. Feel free to correct whenever

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:40.529
<v Speaker 0>I get this wrong. But see how I

00:36:40.529 --> 00:36:41.890
<v Speaker 0>valued it. Can I do five seconds?

00:36:42.605 --> 00:36:44.765
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Should be able to. And we're looking

00:36:44.765 --> 00:36:46.045
<v Speaker 0>at the last five minutes.

00:36:47.005 --> 00:36:48.285
<v Speaker 0>If I I mean, I could just match

00:36:48.285 --> 00:36:50.125
<v Speaker 0>that. Right? So it's Yeah. So

00:36:51.005 --> 00:36:53.405
<v Speaker 1>the yeah. Four is if you if you

00:36:53.405 --> 00:36:55.645
<v Speaker 1>put a really high number or duration on

00:36:55.645 --> 00:36:58.450
<v Speaker 1>four, then we're not gonna see anything for

00:36:58.450 --> 00:36:59.890
<v Speaker 1>five minutes probably.

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:02.130
<v Speaker 1>So it makes sense to I can also

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:04.290
<v Speaker 0>set the last value here as well. So

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:05.970
<v Speaker 0>I guess that means if the four was

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:07.650
<v Speaker 0>over a wider period, but we're only looking

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:09.010
<v Speaker 0>at the last value which should hopefully be

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:11.250
<v Speaker 0>zero when I run this and Yes.

00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:12.530
<v Speaker 1>But

00:37:13.035 --> 00:37:13.755
<v Speaker 1>So

00:37:14.315 --> 00:37:17.355
<v Speaker 1>evaluate every five seconds, that's just gonna evaluate

00:37:17.355 --> 00:37:18.395
<v Speaker 1>that conditions.

00:37:19.355 --> 00:37:21.674
<v Speaker 1>But in order for that alert to trigger,

00:37:21.674 --> 00:37:22.555
<v Speaker 1>it needs to

00:37:22.954 --> 00:37:23.595
<v Speaker 1>be

00:37:23.914 --> 00:37:24.875
<v Speaker 1>evaluated

00:37:24.875 --> 00:37:28.380
<v Speaker 1>to true for a full five minutes or

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:29.820
<v Speaker 1>five seconds in this case.

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:32.619
<v Speaker 1>Before you will actually get an alert.

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.100
<v Speaker 1>So that's why you want in this case,

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.780
<v Speaker 1>you want something low. That makes sense. I

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:40.619
<v Speaker 0>get that. I was completely wrong with my

00:37:40.619 --> 00:37:42.460
<v Speaker 0>naive understanding there, but I've got it now.

00:37:43.055 --> 00:37:46.975
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So with this, when last of query

00:37:47.375 --> 00:37:49.215
<v Speaker 0>I mean, can I drop this down? Let's

00:37:49.215 --> 00:37:50.335
<v Speaker 0>say 10.

00:37:50.335 --> 00:37:51.615
<v Speaker 0>We try and get this alert to go

00:37:51.615 --> 00:37:53.055
<v Speaker 0>quickly and Mhmm.

00:37:54.495 --> 00:37:56.095
<v Speaker 0>See when you just click stuff and it's

00:37:56.095 --> 00:37:57.695
<v Speaker 0>just a quite intuitive. It's Mhmm. It's great.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.560
<v Speaker 0>So I'm gonna say below one.

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:02.760
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:07.880
<v Speaker 0>No data. We can ignore that. So send

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.160
<v Speaker 0>alert to.

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:11.815
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So you would have to set up

00:38:11.815 --> 00:38:12.775
<v Speaker 1>a notification

00:38:13.255 --> 00:38:15.975
<v Speaker 1>channel. So you would have somewhere to send

00:38:15.975 --> 00:38:16.615
<v Speaker 1>this.

00:38:17.895 --> 00:38:18.855
<v Speaker 0>Ah,

00:38:19.815 --> 00:38:21.895
<v Speaker 0>okay. So is that something I can just

00:38:21.895 --> 00:38:22.535
<v Speaker 0>click

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:25.090
<v Speaker 0>go from

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:25.810
<v Speaker 0>here?

00:38:26.609 --> 00:38:27.330
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:29.730
<v Speaker 1>So you would go to

00:38:30.609 --> 00:38:32.609
<v Speaker 1>No. You have another tab in the side

00:38:32.609 --> 00:38:35.010
<v Speaker 1>menu. There you go. Notification channels.

00:38:36.065 --> 00:38:38.625
<v Speaker 0>What are my options and email?

00:38:38.625 --> 00:38:40.305
<v Speaker 0>Oh, then I'll have to configure some sort

00:38:40.305 --> 00:38:41.345
<v Speaker 0>of Yeah.

00:38:42.545 --> 00:38:44.465
<v Speaker 0>To h t t p?

00:38:44.785 --> 00:38:45.905
<v Speaker 1>Yes. You can.

00:38:46.305 --> 00:38:48.305
<v Speaker 1>You can do you can do a web

00:38:48.305 --> 00:38:50.650
<v Speaker 1>hook. So it sends a post

00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:51.770
<v Speaker 1>to a URL.

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:54.330
<v Speaker 0>So one of my friends built this thing

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:55.530
<v Speaker 0>called rbox.

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:57.210
<v Speaker 0>App that gives you

00:38:57.850 --> 00:38:58.970
<v Speaker 0>an endpoint.

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh, that's that's that's awesome.

00:39:02.685 --> 00:39:05.085
<v Speaker 1>The service I've been using for doing that,

00:39:05.085 --> 00:39:07.005
<v Speaker 1>they have started charging,

00:39:08.285 --> 00:39:10.685
<v Speaker 1>I believe. So I haven't really been using

00:39:10.685 --> 00:39:11.565
<v Speaker 1>that lately.

00:39:11.965 --> 00:39:13.485
<v Speaker 1>Okay. I'll look at this one.

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:18.440
<v Speaker 0>Rawkode. So I I had test. I refreshed

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:20.440
<v Speaker 0>Rawkode and I can see the request came

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.840
<v Speaker 0>through just fine. So we now have an

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:25.240
<v Speaker 0>alerted endpoint. Right? Is that it?

00:39:26.359 --> 00:39:28.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So now we have somewhere to send

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.275
<v Speaker 1>the alert. So you should be able to

00:39:31.394 --> 00:39:33.394
<v Speaker 1>wonder if you might have to update this.

00:39:33.394 --> 00:39:35.394
<v Speaker 1>So if you go ahead and save the

00:39:35.394 --> 00:39:36.755
<v Speaker 1>the dashboard first.

00:39:36.835 --> 00:39:38.195
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we did that.

00:39:38.674 --> 00:39:39.954
<v Speaker 0>Let's

00:39:39.954 --> 00:39:40.835
<v Speaker 0>call this David.

00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:44.620
<v Speaker 0>Save. Yeah. Cool. So if you go back

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:47.020
<v Speaker 1>now and and sign the

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay. The alert channel. So my alert is

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:52.700
<v Speaker 0>still here. The only thing I need to

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:53.580
<v Speaker 0>do now is,

00:39:54.315 --> 00:39:56.555
<v Speaker 0>oh yeah. Send it to our box. Message

00:39:56.555 --> 00:39:57.515
<v Speaker 0>details.

00:39:57.915 --> 00:39:59.275
<v Speaker 0>No updates.

00:39:59.755 --> 00:40:01.915
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Let's see if emojis work.

00:40:06.555 --> 00:40:07.275
<v Speaker 0>Test rule.

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:08.330
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:10.570
<v Speaker 0>So

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:11.930
<v Speaker 0>that

00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:14.330
<v Speaker 0>tell me that it's not gonna fire, which

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:16.170
<v Speaker 0>I guess is to be expected right now.

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:16.810
<v Speaker 0>Right?

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:19.850
<v Speaker 0>Firing false, state okay, condition of false, false

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:21.610
<v Speaker 0>equals false. Wait. I

00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:22.570
<v Speaker 1>wonder if

00:40:22.994 --> 00:40:25.234
<v Speaker 1>So if you check your R box, see

00:40:25.394 --> 00:40:27.555
<v Speaker 1>Did you actually get a request? I think

00:40:27.555 --> 00:40:28.275
<v Speaker 1>you can

00:40:30.115 --> 00:40:31.075
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

00:40:31.555 --> 00:40:32.275
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:40:32.994 --> 00:40:34.914
<v Speaker 1>And that is the first request.

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:36.950
<v Speaker 1>Yes. That's that's just

00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:40.069
<v Speaker 1>the test request I think. Isn't it? Yeah.

00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:42.070
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So we never got another. Yeah.

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:44.230
<v Speaker 0>So let's

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:45.990
<v Speaker 0>let's

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:48.630
<v Speaker 0>say I view the last five minutes and

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:49.350
<v Speaker 0>this

00:40:49.625 --> 00:40:51.545
<v Speaker 0>So we can turn on auto refresh in

00:40:51.545 --> 00:40:52.505
<v Speaker 0>five seconds.

00:40:52.665 --> 00:40:53.305
<v Speaker 1>Mhmm.

00:40:53.625 --> 00:40:54.905
<v Speaker 0>So in theory,

00:40:55.545 --> 00:40:56.345
<v Speaker 0>if

00:40:57.224 --> 00:41:00.105
<v Speaker 0>making stuff up, find my app. Oh, no

00:41:00.105 --> 00:41:02.505
<v Speaker 0>back. There we go. I can run

00:41:02.984 --> 00:41:03.865
<v Speaker 0>upgrades.

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:10.730
<v Speaker 0>It's going pretty fast.

00:41:11.289 --> 00:41:13.369
<v Speaker 0>This is refreshing. Let's just

00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:15.850
<v Speaker 0>make this a bit bigger.

00:41:16.809 --> 00:41:19.210
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming within the next five, ten,

00:41:19.765 --> 00:41:22.085
<v Speaker 0>fifteen ish seconds, we should see one of

00:41:22.085 --> 00:41:23.445
<v Speaker 0>these time series

00:41:24.005 --> 00:41:26.165
<v Speaker 0>essentially fall off a cliff down to zero.

00:41:26.484 --> 00:41:26.805
<v Speaker 0>Right?

00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:33.550
<v Speaker 0>Maybe?

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:34.350
<v Speaker 0>Maybe?

00:41:34.589 --> 00:41:36.430
<v Speaker 0>Oh, it's still running. Oh, there's a kernel

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:37.950
<v Speaker 0>upgrade in there. So that may just take

00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:38.830
<v Speaker 0>a few seconds.

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:44.190
<v Speaker 0>Oh, we have a couple more comments. Sheidan

00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:47.150
<v Speaker 0>says, hey, folks. Hey, Sheidan. Thank you for

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:47.710
<v Speaker 0>joining us.

00:41:49.795 --> 00:41:51.555
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure at what point you got

00:41:51.555 --> 00:41:53.955
<v Speaker 0>your monkey eyes closed and mind blowing, but

00:41:53.955 --> 00:41:55.235
<v Speaker 0>that's cool. Thanks.

00:41:56.915 --> 00:41:59.235
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So our app upgrade is finished.

00:41:59.875 --> 00:42:01.795
<v Speaker 0>Let's see if we get another refresh here.

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:03.260
<v Speaker 0>And

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:05.580
<v Speaker 0>not what I was expecting.

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:08.619
<v Speaker 1>So Well, it could also be depending on

00:42:08.619 --> 00:42:10.780
<v Speaker 1>the scrape interval of Prometheus.

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:12.940
<v Speaker 1>Or if it's set to fifteen or thirty

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:15.980
<v Speaker 1>seconds, it could take up to that long

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:17.340
<v Speaker 1>for Prometheus actually.

00:42:18.805 --> 00:42:20.565
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. That's a good point actually. The

00:42:20.565 --> 00:42:22.885
<v Speaker 0>scrape interval in Prometheus is set to ten

00:42:22.885 --> 00:42:23.925
<v Speaker 0>seconds.

00:42:24.005 --> 00:42:24.725
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:42:25.605 --> 00:42:28.085
<v Speaker 0>So yeah, I guess we may just have

00:42:28.085 --> 00:42:29.925
<v Speaker 0>to There you go. I think, yeah, something

00:42:29.925 --> 00:42:30.325
<v Speaker 1>happened.

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:33.590
<v Speaker 1>Oh, no. Okay.

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:34.550
<v Speaker 1>God.

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:37.270
<v Speaker 1>Diagonal bit. And

00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:39.670
<v Speaker 0>then let's just do the

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:42.470
<v Speaker 0>blast everything approach.

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:44.630
<v Speaker 0>Everything is. Okay. So we should have a

00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:47.035
<v Speaker 0>zero. We should have a zero.

00:42:47.275 --> 00:42:48.795
<v Speaker 1>Might not be what we

00:42:50.395 --> 00:42:51.995
<v Speaker 1>what we thought it would be.

00:42:53.835 --> 00:42:55.675
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's what I get for making it.

00:42:55.675 --> 00:42:56.875
<v Speaker 0>I just assumed,

00:42:56.875 --> 00:42:59.195
<v Speaker 0>which is obviously the first problem that I

00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:00.770
<v Speaker 0>made here. That this was tracking the number

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:03.010
<v Speaker 0>of dependencies the app thought was available.

00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:05.490
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's go to let's okay. So we're

00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:07.410
<v Speaker 0>still making progress here. We've got a dashboard

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:09.410
<v Speaker 0>now. Let's save this.

00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:09.730
<v Speaker 0>Save.

00:43:12.204 --> 00:43:13.964
<v Speaker 0>I can click on David here and there's

00:43:13.964 --> 00:43:15.964
<v Speaker 0>my dashboard. So I can add another panel.

00:43:15.964 --> 00:43:17.725
<v Speaker 0>Right? Mhmm. Here. Okay.

00:43:18.045 --> 00:43:19.565
<v Speaker 0>Let's do maybe do something a little bit

00:43:19.565 --> 00:43:20.445
<v Speaker 0>more traditional.

00:43:21.005 --> 00:43:21.645
<v Speaker 0>So

00:43:22.845 --> 00:43:25.325
<v Speaker 0>something I guess we'd want to alert on

00:43:25.405 --> 00:43:26.605
<v Speaker 0>would be the

00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:28.430
<v Speaker 0>the disk utilization.

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:29.790
<v Speaker 0>Let's go with that. Right? I can I

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:31.549
<v Speaker 0>can write a massive fail for the disk?

00:43:31.549 --> 00:43:33.390
<v Speaker 0>So in order to alert on that, what

00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:34.670
<v Speaker 0>we wanna do is

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:37.790
<v Speaker 0>pick a metric. So this is gonna be

00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:38.190
<v Speaker 0>node.

00:43:39.315 --> 00:43:41.474
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I think you have in some file

00:43:41.474 --> 00:43:43.475
<v Speaker 1>system. Was it available?

00:43:45.155 --> 00:43:46.035
<v Speaker 0>Disk.

00:43:46.275 --> 00:43:48.915
<v Speaker 0>So that's regrade bytes. Alright.

00:43:49.954 --> 00:43:52.835
<v Speaker 0>Let's

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:54.280
<v Speaker 0>see what have we got available here. Oh.

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:56.280
<v Speaker 0>I really should have switched to Chrome. I've

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.960
<v Speaker 0>been persistent with this with Valid thing for

00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:58.680
<v Speaker 0>a while.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.280
<v Speaker 0>Oh, so that's the sky. Oh, yeah. We

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:05.240
<v Speaker 0>probably don't want that.

00:44:08.984 --> 00:44:10.505
<v Speaker 1>I think you want this file Yeah.

00:44:12.025 --> 00:44:14.025
<v Speaker 1>That one. Oh, we can actually see.

00:44:15.065 --> 00:44:16.905
<v Speaker 0>Was that my app running?

00:44:17.704 --> 00:44:19.385
<v Speaker 0>That we because we would have modified the

00:44:19.385 --> 00:44:21.065
<v Speaker 0>disk. Right? So the baits that are available

00:44:21.065 --> 00:44:22.740
<v Speaker 0>would would have dropped and then Yeah. To

00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:24.100
<v Speaker 0>remove the cache and then it would have

00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:26.740
<v Speaker 0>freed up a little bit. So okay. So

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:29.620
<v Speaker 0>cool. We can we can we can identify

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:30.260
<v Speaker 0>that.

00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:31.460
<v Speaker 0>So let's

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:33.540
<v Speaker 0>and we can see the three root file

00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:35.700
<v Speaker 0>systems from each of my devices. So I'm

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:36.580
<v Speaker 0>just gonna hit

00:44:37.325 --> 00:44:38.205
<v Speaker 0>apply.

00:44:39.805 --> 00:44:40.445
<v Speaker 0>And

00:44:41.484 --> 00:44:42.365
<v Speaker 0>can I

00:44:42.684 --> 00:44:44.205
<v Speaker 0>put these state by state?

00:44:44.525 --> 00:44:45.165
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:44:46.285 --> 00:44:48.204
<v Speaker 1>I think it's

00:44:48.204 --> 00:44:49.885
<v Speaker 1>easier if you resize them first.

00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:51.070
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:55.470
<v Speaker 0>Cool. There you go.

00:44:55.869 --> 00:44:58.270
<v Speaker 0>So let's try and

00:44:58.349 --> 00:45:00.270
<v Speaker 0>see if right into our desk is gonna

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:02.190
<v Speaker 0>cause this. We've still got our five second

00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:04.109
<v Speaker 0>refresh going on. We can still see this

00:45:04.109 --> 00:45:06.295
<v Speaker 0>that. I've dragged them side by side but

00:45:06.295 --> 00:45:07.015
<v Speaker 0>because

00:45:07.255 --> 00:45:09.495
<v Speaker 0>I probably actually wanna make that bigger for

00:45:09.495 --> 00:45:12.535
<v Speaker 0>everybody. Right? Because the zoom isn't too great

00:45:12.535 --> 00:45:15.255
<v Speaker 0>on this browser. So there we go.

00:45:16.695 --> 00:45:18.775
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's write big fail.

00:45:19.329 --> 00:45:20.050
<v Speaker 0>So

00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:21.410
<v Speaker 0>input

00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:22.290
<v Speaker 0>dev

00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:23.650
<v Speaker 0>random

00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:24.609
<v Speaker 0>output

00:45:24.609 --> 00:45:25.250
<v Speaker 0>my

00:45:25.809 --> 00:45:26.610
<v Speaker 0>big

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:27.970
<v Speaker 0>fail.

00:45:28.049 --> 00:45:29.970
<v Speaker 1>Did you set an alert? Was that what

00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:31.170
<v Speaker 1>you wanted to do? Or

00:45:32.345 --> 00:45:34.184
<v Speaker 1>or you I just wanted to confirm that

00:45:34.184 --> 00:45:36.105
<v Speaker 0>this worked first. Oh, gotcha. Gotcha.

00:45:36.265 --> 00:45:37.785
<v Speaker 0>So in theory, we should wait the ten

00:45:37.785 --> 00:45:39.945
<v Speaker 0>seconds for the Prometheus node export to detect

00:45:40.505 --> 00:45:42.825
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Makes new values or five second refreshes

00:45:42.825 --> 00:45:44.744
<v Speaker 0>running here. I'm assuming this is gonna be

00:45:44.744 --> 00:45:45.145
<v Speaker 0>the same.

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:47.910
<v Speaker 0>This blue line should be the same machine,

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:48.950
<v Speaker 0>the same server.

00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:50.790
<v Speaker 0>Yep. And there we go. We can start

00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:52.550
<v Speaker 0>to see that lane just stepping on the

00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:54.390
<v Speaker 0>end there. Right? Yeah. I'm not making that

00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:54.870
<v Speaker 0>up.

00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:57.750
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So let's add an alert.

00:45:59.705 --> 00:46:02.105
<v Speaker 0>So what do we got bates wise here?

00:46:03.225 --> 00:46:05.625
<v Speaker 0>219,000,000,000.

00:46:05.625 --> 00:46:06.825
<v Speaker 0>Oh, there we go. It's dropping.

00:46:09.065 --> 00:46:10.665
<v Speaker 0>But we've got enough disk space there that

00:46:10.665 --> 00:46:12.825
<v Speaker 0>we can survive and weather a little bit

00:46:12.825 --> 00:46:15.305
<v Speaker 0>of that d d running. So let's

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:16.500
<v Speaker 0>oh.

00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:17.460
<v Speaker 0>Edit.

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:19.620
<v Speaker 0>Alert.

00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:20.820
<v Speaker 0>Create.

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:25.940
<v Speaker 0>So I guess I just do last again.

00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:27.460
<v Speaker 0>Five seconds five seconds.

00:46:30.455 --> 00:46:32.135
<v Speaker 0>We set this to 10

00:46:32.135 --> 00:46:33.655
<v Speaker 0>and is

00:46:35.815 --> 00:46:36.855
<v Speaker 0>below.

00:46:40.775 --> 00:46:42.295
<v Speaker 0>Is there an easier way for me to

00:46:42.295 --> 00:46:44.560
<v Speaker 0>kind of have a relative value to where

00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:46.640
<v Speaker 0>it is right now at all?

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:48.720
<v Speaker 0>Or am I just gonna have to start

00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:49.840
<v Speaker 0>typing numbers?

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Check the the condition if you might have

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.599
<v Speaker 1>if you like instead of last, I'm thinking

00:46:57.599 --> 00:46:58.720
<v Speaker 1>you might have

00:47:01.525 --> 00:47:03.525
<v Speaker 1>a percent def maybe.

00:47:06.405 --> 00:47:08.485
<v Speaker 1>I haven't really used it so

00:47:10.325 --> 00:47:12.245
<v Speaker 1>I'm learning now as well. I I think

00:47:12.245 --> 00:47:14.405
<v Speaker 1>that's what you want. Like if it drops

00:47:14.810 --> 00:47:17.050
<v Speaker 1>drops too fast for example.

00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:19.370
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So if it drops more than

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:23.290
<v Speaker 0>well, it's not gonna drop 10% in ten

00:47:23.290 --> 00:47:24.170
<v Speaker 0>seconds.

00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:24.410
<v Speaker 0>So

00:47:26.875 --> 00:47:28.555
<v Speaker 0>let's just go with the big number approach.

00:47:28.555 --> 00:47:29.835
<v Speaker 0>At least then I don't have to build

00:47:29.835 --> 00:47:31.355
<v Speaker 0>up a mental model of what I'm actually

00:47:31.355 --> 00:47:37.195
<v Speaker 0>expecting to happen. So 217,000,000,000.

00:47:38.235 --> 00:47:40.555
<v Speaker 0>2 1 6 1 2 3. So that's

00:47:40.555 --> 00:47:41.515
<v Speaker 0>200,000,

00:47:41.515 --> 00:47:42.075
<v Speaker 0>2 million,

00:47:43.359 --> 00:47:45.840
<v Speaker 0>20 million, 2 hundred million, 2 billion. Right?

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:46.400
<v Speaker 1>Mhmm.

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:50.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You can also see where the alert

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:52.480
<v Speaker 1>is in the graph right now. So Oh,

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:55.120
<v Speaker 0>nice. Oh, Yeah. You can even drag that

00:47:55.359 --> 00:47:57.440
<v Speaker 1>with the handle if you wanna adjust it

00:47:57.924 --> 00:48:00.484
<v Speaker 1>down to the right on the actual pop

00:48:00.484 --> 00:48:02.805
<v Speaker 1>up. Yeah. I think yeah. You can probably

00:48:03.444 --> 00:48:04.405
<v Speaker 1>drag the whole Done.

00:48:06.005 --> 00:48:06.724
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:48:09.684 --> 00:48:11.204
<v Speaker 0>Alright. In fact, I can just

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.000
<v Speaker 0>it's it's going pretty fast. Okay. Let's stop

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.600
<v Speaker 0>the thing. Right?

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:18.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. What you can do is also to

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:21.760
<v Speaker 1>set a a a minimal value of the

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:24.400
<v Speaker 1>the the axis so you don't have to

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:26.720
<v Speaker 1>fight. Because right now it's it's taking the,

00:48:27.325 --> 00:48:29.885
<v Speaker 1>you know the the it's auto adjusting.

00:48:30.125 --> 00:48:32.205
<v Speaker 1>So you can instead set a fixed

00:48:32.605 --> 00:48:34.845
<v Speaker 1>min value of the axis

00:48:36.205 --> 00:48:39.085
<v Speaker 1>to help you with that. Alright. Well, so

00:48:39.085 --> 00:48:40.605
<v Speaker 0>we're not writing to the disc anymore. So

00:48:40.605 --> 00:48:41.485
<v Speaker 0>let's just

00:48:42.369 --> 00:48:45.650
<v Speaker 0>leave that there. That's just below where we

00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:48.290
<v Speaker 0>want it to be. I've clicked our box.

00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:49.490
<v Speaker 0>We'll see disk

00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:50.290
<v Speaker 0>going

00:48:50.369 --> 00:48:51.650
<v Speaker 0>to fall

00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:52.450
<v Speaker 0>over.

00:48:57.010 --> 00:48:57.974
<v Speaker 0>And apply.

00:48:59.255 --> 00:49:00.055
<v Speaker 0>Done.

00:49:00.135 --> 00:49:00.535
<v Speaker 0>And

00:49:01.575 --> 00:49:03.655
<v Speaker 0>is this my alert lane that's here?

00:49:04.295 --> 00:49:06.775
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That that's the threshold of

00:49:06.855 --> 00:49:08.935
<v Speaker 1>where it will start,

00:49:09.734 --> 00:49:10.454
<v Speaker 1>you know, evaluating.

00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:14.300
<v Speaker 1>So the the alert might not trigger right

00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:17.340
<v Speaker 1>away depending on our settings to

00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:19.420
<v Speaker 1>you know, to avoid spikes.

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:22.540
<v Speaker 1>So you know, if if it spikes over

00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:24.860
<v Speaker 1>the or under in this case, the the

00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:28.005
<v Speaker 1>threshold line, then and then it's back to

00:49:28.005 --> 00:49:30.165
<v Speaker 1>normal, then we might not, you know, send

00:49:30.165 --> 00:49:32.724
<v Speaker 1>the alarm just yet. So we might want

00:49:32.724 --> 00:49:34.645
<v Speaker 1>to have it triggering

00:49:34.645 --> 00:49:35.205
<v Speaker 1>for

00:49:35.445 --> 00:49:37.365
<v Speaker 1>for a few minutes at least or

00:49:38.085 --> 00:49:40.805
<v Speaker 0>So I've noticed something. There's a broken heart

00:49:40.805 --> 00:49:43.420
<v Speaker 0>on this one. Yes. What does that mean?

00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:46.140
<v Speaker 1>That means that one of your alerts is

00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:49.740
<v Speaker 1>firing right now. So it finally noticed my

00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:50.460
<v Speaker 0>updates.

00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:52.940
<v Speaker 0>Is that right? Yeah. I think so.

00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:56.335
<v Speaker 0>Right. Well, let's let's probably task. So let's

00:49:56.335 --> 00:49:58.095
<v Speaker 0>run that one again. We'll cause this one

00:49:58.095 --> 00:49:59.375
<v Speaker 0>to get me a broken heart.

00:49:59.935 --> 00:50:02.575
<v Speaker 0>Can I zoom in? Oh, I can. Yeah.

00:50:03.695 --> 00:50:06.415
<v Speaker 1>So if you hover those little triangles

00:50:06.415 --> 00:50:08.859
<v Speaker 1>at the bottom, you can see yeah. Oh

00:50:08.859 --> 00:50:11.420
<v Speaker 0>yeah. App update is pending zero. Okay. So

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:12.780
<v Speaker 0>it just took a little bit of time

00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:13.820
<v Speaker 0>whatever's

00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:15.900
<v Speaker 0>happening with the Prometheus export. You know, the

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:17.340
<v Speaker 0>Prometheus export probably

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:18.460
<v Speaker 0>doesn't

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:20.940
<v Speaker 0>check for updates in the app cache every

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:22.855
<v Speaker 0>ten seconds. Like that would be probably have

00:50:22.855 --> 00:50:25.335
<v Speaker 0>a negative performance on my machine. Like it

00:50:25.335 --> 00:50:27.734
<v Speaker 0>probably does that over a wider interval. Couldn't

00:50:27.974 --> 00:50:28.615
<v Speaker 1>yeah.

00:50:28.934 --> 00:50:30.695
<v Speaker 1>That's a plausible reason.

00:50:30.934 --> 00:50:33.414
<v Speaker 0>I'll I'll go with it. So in theory,

00:50:33.414 --> 00:50:34.375
<v Speaker 0>if I refresh here.

00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:38.790
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. We do. There's a little smiley.

00:50:40.789 --> 00:50:42.950
<v Speaker 0>There he goes. It worked the first name.

00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:44.230
<v Speaker 0>Says,

00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:46.789
<v Speaker 0>that's so cool. Yeah. I'm glad that worked

00:50:46.789 --> 00:50:48.549
<v Speaker 0>the spell. I wasn't nervous. So

00:50:51.175 --> 00:50:53.575
<v Speaker 0>awesome. So the app update trick worked. We

00:50:53.575 --> 00:50:55.335
<v Speaker 0>can come back to the main dashboard.

00:50:56.214 --> 00:50:58.295
<v Speaker 0>Is my DD running? It is

00:50:58.455 --> 00:50:59.974
<v Speaker 0>woah. It went the wrong way.

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:08.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure. For a bit. Don't have

00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:11.250
<v Speaker 1>no idea why. Oh. Because I just blew

00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:13.570
<v Speaker 0>away this device by rewriting over the top.

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:15.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Causing

00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:18.850
<v Speaker 0>actually freed up to this space, which was

00:51:18.850 --> 00:51:19.170
<v Speaker 0>clever.

00:51:19.655 --> 00:51:21.255
<v Speaker 0>And now it's got to climb back down

00:51:21.255 --> 00:51:22.695
<v Speaker 0>to where the thing is here. So let's

00:51:22.695 --> 00:51:24.135
<v Speaker 0>just leave that for a few minutes. We

00:51:24.135 --> 00:51:25.415
<v Speaker 0>have already seen a work in the layer.

00:51:25.415 --> 00:51:27.335
<v Speaker 0>That was really cool. I'm happy with that.

00:51:27.415 --> 00:51:30.295
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Let's we've got about ten minutes left.

00:51:30.295 --> 00:51:32.550
<v Speaker 0>So shall we import a dashboard that maybe

00:51:32.550 --> 00:51:33.830
<v Speaker 0>makes a bit more sense of our metrics

00:51:33.830 --> 00:51:35.830
<v Speaker 0>than us? Yeah. We'll try it. We'll try

00:51:35.830 --> 00:51:37.510
<v Speaker 1>it. So

00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:39.830
<v Speaker 1>if if

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:43.030
<v Speaker 1>you go to grafana.com/dashboards,

00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:47.350
<v Speaker 1>you've got a ton of community built dashboards

00:51:47.585 --> 00:51:48.865
<v Speaker 1>that you can use.

00:51:49.424 --> 00:51:51.825
<v Speaker 1>I think there is one that if you

00:51:51.825 --> 00:51:54.305
<v Speaker 1>just search for node export exporter.

00:51:55.904 --> 00:51:58.944
<v Speaker 1>And if you search or sort by downloads,

00:51:58.944 --> 00:52:00.704
<v Speaker 1>I think that you're gonna get

00:52:01.744 --> 00:52:03.025
<v Speaker 1>one that is

00:52:04.619 --> 00:52:06.620
<v Speaker 1>pretty Yeah, the the first one there.

00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:08.460
<v Speaker 1>If you click that one.

00:52:09.099 --> 00:52:12.300
<v Speaker 1>So if you look in at the the

00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:15.099
<v Speaker 1>the right, you see copy ID to clipboard.

00:52:16.395 --> 00:52:19.755
<v Speaker 1>So now we can go to Grafana

00:52:19.755 --> 00:52:20.555
<v Speaker 1>again.

00:52:22.875 --> 00:52:24.715
<v Speaker 1>If you just switch tab.

00:52:24.715 --> 00:52:26.235
<v Speaker 1>Yep. And then

00:52:26.715 --> 00:52:29.035
<v Speaker 1>go to, yes, that one, manage.

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:36.480
<v Speaker 1>And then you can click import to the

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:39.040
<v Speaker 1>right there. Yep. And then in the in

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:40.160
<v Speaker 1>the top field

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:41.520
<v Speaker 1>yep.

00:52:42.395 --> 00:52:44.075
<v Speaker 0>I mean it's just so intuitive.

00:52:46.555 --> 00:52:49.115
<v Speaker 1>Yes. And you need to set

00:52:49.115 --> 00:52:51.515
<v Speaker 1>the the data source you wanna use. But

00:52:51.515 --> 00:52:52.474
<v Speaker 1>that should be it.

00:52:54.330 --> 00:52:56.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh, there you go. There you go.

00:52:57.050 --> 00:52:58.410
<v Speaker 1>Thank you community.

00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:00.890
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. There's no way

00:53:02.650 --> 00:53:04.250
<v Speaker 0>I was building that and

00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:06.570
<v Speaker 0>that that's comprehensive.

00:53:06.570 --> 00:53:06.810
<v Speaker 0>Wow.

00:53:07.415 --> 00:53:09.815
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's got a lot of Would would

00:53:09.815 --> 00:53:12.215
<v Speaker 0>you mind just like there's

00:53:12.375 --> 00:53:13.815
<v Speaker 0>more than just the graphs that we've looked

00:53:13.815 --> 00:53:15.095
<v Speaker 0>at so far here. Can you just maybe

00:53:15.095 --> 00:53:16.935
<v Speaker 0>pack out a few of these different visualizations

00:53:16.935 --> 00:53:19.815
<v Speaker 0>and and tell us what they are? Yeah.

00:53:19.815 --> 00:53:21.220
<v Speaker 1>Sure. So the

00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:23.540
<v Speaker 1>on the top we see something called a

00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:24.180
<v Speaker 1>gauge.

00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:27.780
<v Speaker 1>So the gauge is typically like something you

00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:29.380
<v Speaker 1>would see in a car, know.

00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:33.300
<v Speaker 1>It has a lower number and a

00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:36.655
<v Speaker 1>higher number. So it lets you visualize

00:53:36.655 --> 00:53:38.335
<v Speaker 1>something that can,

00:53:38.815 --> 00:53:39.455
<v Speaker 1>you know,

00:53:40.494 --> 00:53:41.855
<v Speaker 1>something that has

00:53:43.135 --> 00:53:46.255
<v Speaker 1>a upper limit and a lower limit, basically.

00:53:46.494 --> 00:53:49.460
<v Speaker 1>So disk usage, for example. If you wanna

00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:50.660
<v Speaker 1>know that

00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:53.140
<v Speaker 1>wait, you're reaching a certain

00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:57.299
<v Speaker 1>percentage of disk available or something like that,

00:53:57.299 --> 00:53:58.980
<v Speaker 1>then you could use a gauge

00:53:59.299 --> 00:54:01.060
<v Speaker 1>because you can set thresholds.

00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:02.819
<v Speaker 1>Actually, if you go to one of the

00:54:02.819 --> 00:54:03.700
<v Speaker 1>the gauges

00:54:03.965 --> 00:54:04.685
<v Speaker 1>and

00:54:06.125 --> 00:54:08.685
<v Speaker 1>edit them, I think that we can adjust

00:54:08.765 --> 00:54:09.485
<v Speaker 1>the

00:54:10.765 --> 00:54:11.725
<v Speaker 1>thresholds.

00:54:12.365 --> 00:54:15.085
<v Speaker 1>I believe if you go to field,

00:54:15.085 --> 00:54:17.690
<v Speaker 1>the field tab to the right, yeah. And

00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:19.850
<v Speaker 1>then you scroll scroll down to the threshold

00:54:19.850 --> 00:54:21.690
<v Speaker 1>sections. Yeah. You can change

00:54:22.090 --> 00:54:23.130
<v Speaker 1>that as well.

00:54:24.810 --> 00:54:27.690
<v Speaker 1>So now the maximum, yeah, would be 10%.

00:54:31.530 --> 00:54:32.730
<v Speaker 0>If I set it to,

00:54:33.915 --> 00:54:36.475
<v Speaker 0>yeah, it's almost full. Yeah, exactly.

00:54:38.235 --> 00:54:39.835
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I'll put it back to a hundred.

00:54:40.155 --> 00:54:43.755
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Alright. And if you scroll down to

00:54:44.555 --> 00:54:45.595
<v Speaker 1>the the

00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:47.800
<v Speaker 1>threshold sections that

00:54:48.119 --> 00:54:49.800
<v Speaker 1>you can set those

00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:51.640
<v Speaker 1>orange,

00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:53.160
<v Speaker 1>when it goes to orange, when it goes

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:53.960
<v Speaker 1>to red.

00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:54.840
<v Speaker 1>So

00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:57.400
<v Speaker 1>you can try it now if you wanna

00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:59.800
<v Speaker 1>just update those to something,

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:00.680
<v Speaker 1>yeah, like that.

00:55:02.935 --> 00:55:06.295
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So let's say red is seven, we

00:55:06.295 --> 00:55:08.535
<v Speaker 0>should be orange. Alright. Nice. Okay. Cool.

00:55:08.855 --> 00:55:09.495
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:55:10.135 --> 00:55:10.695
<v Speaker 1>So

00:55:11.175 --> 00:55:13.015
<v Speaker 1>it's up to you. It's just a visual

00:55:13.015 --> 00:55:15.575
<v Speaker 1>indication of when things are starting to go

00:55:15.575 --> 00:55:16.775
<v Speaker 1>wrong

00:55:16.450 --> 00:55:18.290
<v Speaker 1>to catch them ahead of time.

00:55:23.090 --> 00:55:25.170
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you can actually do percentages as well.

00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:26.610
<v Speaker 0>Yep. So

00:55:26.610 --> 00:55:28.290
<v Speaker 0>it can be a bit more dynamic then

00:55:28.290 --> 00:55:30.155
<v Speaker 0>depending on that means, you know, if I'm

00:55:30.155 --> 00:55:32.395
<v Speaker 0>setting the max here, then the percentage do

00:55:32.395 --> 00:55:34.795
<v Speaker 0>seem like a much better workflow here.

00:55:35.275 --> 00:55:36.795
<v Speaker 0>Cool. Nice. Yeah.

00:55:37.435 --> 00:55:39.035
<v Speaker 0>Let's see what else we have.

00:55:39.515 --> 00:55:41.995
<v Speaker 1>And another one that's very heavily used as

00:55:41.995 --> 00:55:43.035
<v Speaker 1>the staff panel,

00:55:44.079 --> 00:55:46.079
<v Speaker 1>which I think you got to the yeah.

00:55:46.079 --> 00:55:48.160
<v Speaker 1>The This one? This one. Yep.

00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:51.040
<v Speaker 1>So if you edit edit yeah. I think

00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:52.560
<v Speaker 1>you can edit that one.

00:55:53.119 --> 00:55:54.960
<v Speaker 0>I could have I could click. There we

00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:57.200
<v Speaker 0>go. Yeah. Compare it so hard for me.

00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:57.920
<v Speaker 1>So

00:55:58.994 --> 00:56:02.275
<v Speaker 1>this dashboard is using the the old version

00:56:02.275 --> 00:56:03.315
<v Speaker 1>of this panel.

00:56:03.555 --> 00:56:05.634
<v Speaker 1>So that's why it's asking you to migrate

00:56:05.634 --> 00:56:08.434
<v Speaker 1>to the newer version in this case. Can

00:56:08.434 --> 00:56:10.355
<v Speaker 0>I just click that? Good

00:56:10.355 --> 00:56:11.555
<v Speaker 1>question. Try it.

00:56:12.115 --> 00:56:14.990
<v Speaker 1>Yo, there you go. Easy as pie. So

00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:16.830
<v Speaker 0>what's different between the old

00:56:17.550 --> 00:56:19.630
<v Speaker 0>what's this called? A stat? A stat and

00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:23.150
<v Speaker 0>then your stat? Yes. So there the main

00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:25.790
<v Speaker 1>difference is the underlying technology.

00:56:25.790 --> 00:56:27.869
<v Speaker 1>Grafana used to be written angular

00:56:28.555 --> 00:56:31.035
<v Speaker 1>and is now migrated to React.

00:56:32.075 --> 00:56:32.635
<v Speaker 1>So

00:56:32.875 --> 00:56:34.715
<v Speaker 1>this led us to do a lot of

00:56:34.715 --> 00:56:36.475
<v Speaker 1>bunch of new and cool things.

00:56:37.435 --> 00:56:39.835
<v Speaker 1>And that's that's one of the major reasons.

00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:43.060
<v Speaker 0>Okay. I would say

00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:45.700
<v Speaker 0>If I know React, I can write my

00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:46.820
<v Speaker 0>own visualizations,

00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:48.820
<v Speaker 0>my own Oh, for sure. Panels. Nice. For

00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:49.940
<v Speaker 1>sure. So,

00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:54.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah, you can use

00:56:55.535 --> 00:56:56.975
<v Speaker 1>A panel visualization

00:56:56.975 --> 00:56:59.295
<v Speaker 1>is basically just a React component

00:56:59.775 --> 00:57:01.775
<v Speaker 1>with custom properties.

00:57:03.135 --> 00:57:04.735
<v Speaker 1>So for sure you can write your own

00:57:04.735 --> 00:57:05.215
<v Speaker 1>one.

00:57:05.855 --> 00:57:08.095
<v Speaker 1>But yeah, so the stat panel is good

00:57:08.095 --> 00:57:11.360
<v Speaker 1>for if you have like these KPIs

00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:12.640
<v Speaker 1>that you

00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:15.520
<v Speaker 1>wanna report to upper management.

00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:18.320
<v Speaker 1>How many concurrent users do we have at

00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:19.200
<v Speaker 1>this moment?

00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:20.800
<v Speaker 1>Like

00:57:22.494 --> 00:57:24.734
<v Speaker 1>numbers that you wanna copy real quick. That's

00:57:24.734 --> 00:57:26.495
<v Speaker 1>that's a great use

00:57:26.895 --> 00:57:27.535
<v Speaker 1>of

00:57:28.335 --> 00:57:29.375
<v Speaker 1>stat panels.

00:57:30.095 --> 00:57:32.734
<v Speaker 1>But as you can see, graphs are really

00:57:32.734 --> 00:57:32.415
<v Speaker 1>the yeah.

00:57:34.095 --> 00:57:35.855
<v Speaker 1>That's really the main one

00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:38.220
<v Speaker 1>that you'll want to use.

00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:41.260
<v Speaker 0>But it's just so interesting you know, going

00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:43.340
<v Speaker 0>through these and seeing how my machine is

00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:45.180
<v Speaker 0>is operating by looking at all these you

00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:45.660
<v Speaker 0>know,

00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:48.335
<v Speaker 0>these these peaks and troughs and you know,

00:57:48.335 --> 00:57:49.855
<v Speaker 0>there's a lot of things that are pretty

00:57:49.855 --> 00:57:52.015
<v Speaker 0>static. You know, the temperature obviously isn't gonna

00:57:52.015 --> 00:57:53.055
<v Speaker 0>change too much.

00:57:53.775 --> 00:57:55.135
<v Speaker 0>System d, I mean

00:57:55.855 --> 00:57:57.375
<v Speaker 1>For sure it's a different kind of doom

00:57:57.375 --> 00:57:58.494
<v Speaker 1>doom scrolling.

00:57:58.815 --> 00:58:00.335
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You you can you can sit here.

00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:02.110
<v Speaker 0>You can you can see that d d

00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:04.030
<v Speaker 0>command kinda consistently

00:58:04.110 --> 00:58:06.110
<v Speaker 0>across as as we scroll down. At least

00:58:06.110 --> 00:58:08.270
<v Speaker 0>the first spike on I'm not sure what's

00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:09.790
<v Speaker 0>going on with the most recent one again.

00:58:09.790 --> 00:58:12.110
<v Speaker 0>I could just do my Prometheus setup,

00:58:12.110 --> 00:58:12.270
<v Speaker 0>which

00:58:15.194 --> 00:58:18.155
<v Speaker 0>this is all really cool. So Grafana,

00:58:18.155 --> 00:58:20.954
<v Speaker 0>you know, based on what we've covered, I'll

00:58:20.954 --> 00:58:22.715
<v Speaker 0>just pop back over here.

00:58:23.194 --> 00:58:24.875
<v Speaker 0>You know, based on what we've covered now

00:58:24.875 --> 00:58:27.089
<v Speaker 0>and like an hour Grafana is just this

00:58:27.089 --> 00:58:27.970
<v Speaker 0>multi

00:58:27.970 --> 00:58:29.730
<v Speaker 0>data source visualization

00:58:29.730 --> 00:58:32.289
<v Speaker 0>and dashboarding tool. But so much more beyond

00:58:32.289 --> 00:58:34.289
<v Speaker 0>that. Like, you know, we never even touched

00:58:34.289 --> 00:58:36.210
<v Speaker 0>on the transformations, but there's a whole lot

00:58:36.210 --> 00:58:37.569
<v Speaker 0>of things that we can do and these

00:58:37.569 --> 00:58:39.410
<v Speaker 0>panels with the data on the fly and

00:58:39.525 --> 00:58:41.525
<v Speaker 0>the alerting was really cool as well. Like

00:58:41.525 --> 00:58:43.444
<v Speaker 0>there's just so much power in this. Like

00:58:43.444 --> 00:58:44.885
<v Speaker 0>I think we're easily gonna have to do

00:58:44.885 --> 00:58:46.404
<v Speaker 0>another six of these and I'm just gonna

00:58:46.404 --> 00:58:48.724
