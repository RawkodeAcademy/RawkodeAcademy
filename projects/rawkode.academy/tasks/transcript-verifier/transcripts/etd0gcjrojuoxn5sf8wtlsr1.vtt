00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.560
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. We still have no cluster DNS.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.880
<v Speaker 0>Cube DNS has endpoint.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.440
<v Speaker 0>Okay. That's after eight.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.839
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.920
<v Speaker 0>Let's see if Guy wants to come in

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.759
<v Speaker 0>and give us a last bit of advice

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:15.440
<v Speaker 0>before we we wrap this up.

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:17.335
<v Speaker 0>Are we close?

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:22.055
<v Speaker 1>You've you've not looked at the configuration of

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:24.134
<v Speaker 1>core DNS. You've looked at the pods, but

00:00:24.134 --> 00:00:27.974
<v Speaker 1>not how the pods are configured to run

00:00:27.974 --> 00:00:28.695
<v Speaker 1>the DNS.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.130
<v Speaker 0>We have the DNS.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:33.130
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.210
<v Speaker 0>Just keeps coming.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.170
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.530
<v Speaker 0>Did we miss something?

00:00:43.185 --> 00:00:46.145
<v Speaker 0>Let's let's I'm gonna say cheat. Let's I'm

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:48.465
<v Speaker 0>gonna jump onto cluster 14

00:00:49.345 --> 00:00:51.504
<v Speaker 0>and grab the config map and see what's

00:00:51.504 --> 00:00:52.225
<v Speaker 0>different. What

00:00:52.945 --> 00:00:53.585
<v Speaker 1>about

00:00:53.905 --> 00:00:54.545
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:00:56.145 --> 00:00:57.425
<v Speaker 0>These are the exact same fail.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.690
<v Speaker 0>So he told us to look in the

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.570
<v Speaker 0>core DNS config and then there was nothing

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.650
<v Speaker 0>wrong with the core DNS config. That's just

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.209
<v Speaker 0>cruel.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.770
<v Speaker 0>I was saying there's a few pixels.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.210
<v Speaker 0>This is a white space error in the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.995
<v Speaker 0>core DNS config. I will be may be

00:01:13.995 --> 00:01:14.875
<v Speaker 0>frustrated.

00:01:19.275 --> 00:01:21.195
<v Speaker 1>It might not be a white space error.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.250
<v Speaker 0>He's mocking us now because he said you're

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.290
<v Speaker 0>jumping back and forward showed a slight difference.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.730
<v Speaker 0>This number seems arbitrary. Oh, you son of

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:35.770
<v Speaker 1>a bitch.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.970
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming

00:01:37.975 --> 00:01:40.455
<v Speaker 0>there's like a weird bug and I'm sure

00:01:40.455 --> 00:01:42.295
<v Speaker 0>he's found it because he works at Skyscanner

00:01:42.295 --> 00:01:43.575
<v Speaker 0>and they've got a level of scale that

00:01:43.575 --> 00:01:44.695
<v Speaker 0>most people don't have.

00:01:45.575 --> 00:01:46.215
<v Speaker 0>But

00:01:47.335 --> 00:01:49.415
<v Speaker 0>something to do with this number going so

00:01:49.415 --> 00:01:53.495
<v Speaker 0>high is maybe causing it to load an

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.460
<v Speaker 0>old config map in the pods or

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.220
<v Speaker 0>something. I don't really

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.060
<v Speaker 0>know.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.500
<v Speaker 0>But the number being so high worries me.

00:02:04.765 --> 00:02:06.125
<v Speaker 0>But we're now at the stage where I

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:07.565
<v Speaker 0>have to go and pick up my daughter.

00:02:07.565 --> 00:02:08.125
<v Speaker 0>So

00:02:08.604 --> 00:02:10.685
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I'm just gonna bring Guy in to

00:02:10.685 --> 00:02:12.845
<v Speaker 0>tell us what wonderful magical What we should

00:02:12.845 --> 00:02:15.485
<v Speaker 1>do. Is. Yeah. Alright, Guy.

00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:17.805
<v Speaker 0>Lay on us.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.180
<v Speaker 1>So

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.340
<v Speaker 1>when you were jumping back and forth between

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.260
<v Speaker 1>the working config and

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
<v Speaker 1>the non working config,

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.540
<v Speaker 1>if you look really hard at the c

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.859
<v Speaker 1>in front of the in the Kubernetes config,

00:02:37.255 --> 00:02:39.095
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you bastard.

00:02:39.735 --> 00:02:40.775
<v Speaker 1>The c?

00:02:42.375 --> 00:02:43.335
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:02:43.334 --> 00:02:44.535
<v Speaker 1>It's not a c.

00:02:44.855 --> 00:02:47.495
<v Speaker 1>No. It's character which looks a lot like

00:02:47.495 --> 00:02:47.895
<v Speaker 1>a c.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.190
<v Speaker 1>What? So the Kubernetes plug in became authoritative

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.830
<v Speaker 1>for

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.550
<v Speaker 1>letter that looks like c luster.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Local.
