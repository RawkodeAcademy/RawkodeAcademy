00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.150
<v Speaker 0>Hello,

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.550
<v Speaker 0>and welcome back to the complete guide to

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.510
<v Speaker 0>Teleport.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.750
<v Speaker 0>Today is a short tutorial

00:00:36.425 --> 00:00:39.785
<v Speaker 0>on how you can take a existing Teleport

00:00:39.785 --> 00:00:41.865
<v Speaker 0>cluster, which you've already seen

00:00:42.345 --> 00:00:44.825
<v Speaker 0>many times now throughout this course, how to

00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:46.345
<v Speaker 0>configure and get started.

00:00:46.825 --> 00:00:48.025
<v Speaker 0>And we're going to,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.359
<v Speaker 0>through the use of some YAML and the

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:53.879
<v Speaker 0>GitHub application, enable single sign on that works

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:54.679
<v Speaker 0>against

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.359
<v Speaker 0>teams and organizations

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:57.479
<v Speaker 0>on GitHub.

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:58.760
<v Speaker 0>So most likely

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.039
<v Speaker 0>where your developers already are or your operators,

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:02.359
<v Speaker 0>etcetera.

00:01:03.505 --> 00:01:04.145
<v Speaker 0>Now,

00:01:04.465 --> 00:01:06.225
<v Speaker 0>before we get started, I will say this

00:01:06.225 --> 00:01:08.145
<v Speaker 0>was supposed to be the the first tutorial

00:01:08.145 --> 00:01:10.305
<v Speaker 0>that was going to livestream to YouTube

00:01:10.385 --> 00:01:12.865
<v Speaker 0>where we are now, but also to Twitter

00:01:12.865 --> 00:01:14.065
<v Speaker 0>and to LinkedIn

00:01:14.065 --> 00:01:15.025
<v Speaker 0>and to

00:01:15.345 --> 00:01:16.225
<v Speaker 0>somewhere else.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.650
<v Speaker 0>But I made a boo boo.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.650
<v Speaker 0>I accidentally hit start stream and end stream,

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.010
<v Speaker 0>which now means I can no longer send

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.770
<v Speaker 0>it to those other destinations. So we're gonna

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.770
<v Speaker 0>make YouTube. So if you're watching, thank you

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.890
<v Speaker 0>for joining. We're gonna get started right away.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.770
<v Speaker 0>So

00:01:43.725 --> 00:01:45.884
<v Speaker 0>we have a screen share here.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.840
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully, this is still the same machine.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.760
<v Speaker 0>It is indeed.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.799
<v Speaker 0>What we have here is an Ubuntu box

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.560
<v Speaker 0>with Teleport already pre configured, web DNS enabled.

00:02:00.645 --> 00:02:03.125
<v Speaker 0>Again, these have been covered in prior videos,

00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:04.405
<v Speaker 0>so we're not going to be doing that

00:02:04.405 --> 00:02:05.204
<v Speaker 0>today.

00:02:05.765 --> 00:02:06.965
<v Speaker 0>What we do have

00:02:10.724 --> 00:02:12.405
<v Speaker 0>Where's my public IPv4

00:02:12.405 --> 00:02:12.805
<v Speaker 0>address?

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.420
<v Speaker 0>I'm being really silly.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.340
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.459
<v Speaker 0>I'll

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:22.660
<v Speaker 0>just get it from

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.780
<v Speaker 0>here. This is my public IPv4 address.

00:02:27.325 --> 00:02:29.245
<v Speaker 0>And we have a browser here where I

00:02:29.245 --> 00:02:31.725
<v Speaker 0>have the documentation on setting up single sign

00:02:31.725 --> 00:02:33.245
<v Speaker 0>on with GitHub,

00:02:33.965 --> 00:02:35.965
<v Speaker 0>the IP address, which we actually don't need

00:02:35.965 --> 00:02:39.885
<v Speaker 0>because I have this configured as Teleport.Rawkode.live.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.569
<v Speaker 0>Now I haven't created a single user on

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:43.849
<v Speaker 0>this via

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.810
<v Speaker 0>the Teleport control command. So this is a

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:47.690
<v Speaker 0>working

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:51.049
<v Speaker 0>Teleport instance, but there are no users. I

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.530
<v Speaker 0>literally could not log into this if I

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.930
<v Speaker 0>wanted to.

00:02:56.225 --> 00:02:58.145
<v Speaker 0>So we're gonna work through the process, which

00:02:58.145 --> 00:03:01.425
<v Speaker 0>is documented here for setting this up. Now

00:03:01.425 --> 00:03:03.105
<v Speaker 0>the first thing the documentation wants you to

00:03:03.105 --> 00:03:05.185
<v Speaker 0>do is is just to confirm some versions.

00:03:05.345 --> 00:03:07.025
<v Speaker 0>We definitely could run this, but I I

00:03:07.025 --> 00:03:08.625
<v Speaker 0>know that we run the latest version of

00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:11.600
<v Speaker 0>Teleport nine, so I'm not gonna run the

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.080
<v Speaker 0>same commands again just now. We can run

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.080
<v Speaker 0>t control status, although I actually don't have

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.880
<v Speaker 0>my local machine configured with this Teleport cluster.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.240
<v Speaker 0>So I'm not going to run that, but

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.520
<v Speaker 0>we could run it inside the cluster.

00:03:23.865 --> 00:03:25.145
<v Speaker 0>And we can see there.

00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:26.265
<v Speaker 0>Perfect.

00:03:27.625 --> 00:03:29.785
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So in order for this to work,

00:03:29.785 --> 00:03:30.905
<v Speaker 0>we have to be able to create a

00:03:30.905 --> 00:03:31.705
<v Speaker 0>GitHub

00:03:31.785 --> 00:03:33.065
<v Speaker 0>authentication

00:03:33.225 --> 00:03:35.785
<v Speaker 0>and what this let me make that a

00:03:35.785 --> 00:03:37.630
<v Speaker 0>little bit bigger for you. Go.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.630
<v Speaker 0>What this is telling us here is that

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.670
<v Speaker 0>we need a DNS name configured because GitHub

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.150
<v Speaker 0>is gonna redirect the traffic on the OAuth

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.150
<v Speaker 0>dance back to our Teleport server.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.790
<v Speaker 0>I guess you could do this with just

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.065
<v Speaker 0>IP addresses, but doing this is a lot

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:52.785
<v Speaker 0>nicer.

00:03:53.425 --> 00:03:56.305
<v Speaker 0>And we need the path postfix

00:03:56.305 --> 00:03:57.825
<v Speaker 0>that we've got onto the end.

00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:01.585
<v Speaker 0>So we need to create an OAuth application.

00:04:01.585 --> 00:04:03.505
<v Speaker 0>This link goes to the documentation.

00:04:03.665 --> 00:04:06.510
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to bypass that, copy this and

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.349
<v Speaker 0>just go straight to github.com

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.230
<v Speaker 0>where we have the Rawkode Academy GitHub.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.470
<v Speaker 0>From here, we can go to settings.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.190
<v Speaker 0>And if we scroll down

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.190
<v Speaker 0>and go to GitHub applications,

00:04:20.884 --> 00:04:21.685
<v Speaker 0>Maybe

00:04:21.685 --> 00:04:22.725
<v Speaker 0>I need my

00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:28.405
<v Speaker 0>I'm trying to do this myself rather than

00:04:28.405 --> 00:04:29.525
<v Speaker 0>as an organization.

00:04:29.604 --> 00:04:30.565
<v Speaker 0>Oh, there we go.

00:04:32.725 --> 00:04:35.445
<v Speaker 0>New OAuth application and we will call this

00:04:35.445 --> 00:04:36.324
<v Speaker 0>Teleport

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.140
<v Speaker 0>Tutorial.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.060
<v Speaker 0>And then let's just say Rawkode.live.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.419
<v Speaker 0>Now the operation callback is this thing, but

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.820
<v Speaker 0>we need to swap out our proxy address

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.540
<v Speaker 0>for teleport.rockode.live.

00:04:51.335 --> 00:04:53.015
<v Speaker 0>So if we zoom in on that, you'll

00:04:53.015 --> 00:04:55.975
<v Speaker 0>see our authorization callback is just our domain

00:04:55.975 --> 00:04:57.495
<v Speaker 0>with the postfix.

00:04:58.855 --> 00:05:01.015
<v Speaker 0>We can register this application and we're gonna

00:05:01.015 --> 00:05:03.895
<v Speaker 0>get some secret details, which I can't remember

00:05:03.895 --> 00:05:05.255
<v Speaker 0>are visually visible.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.700
<v Speaker 0>Oh, okay. Cool. So we can copy this

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.540
<v Speaker 0>client ID and then generate a new secret

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.700
<v Speaker 0>when required. But we're gonna go back to

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.140
<v Speaker 0>the Teleport documentation first,

00:05:18.715 --> 00:05:21.515
<v Speaker 0>and we're gonna start specking out this YAML.

00:05:21.515 --> 00:05:24.635
<v Speaker 0>So everything in Teleport can be configured through

00:05:24.635 --> 00:05:25.595
<v Speaker 0>t control

00:05:26.075 --> 00:05:28.955
<v Speaker 0>apply and a YAML link interface.

00:05:29.755 --> 00:05:31.675
<v Speaker 0>So I'll do this in the ATC directory

00:05:31.675 --> 00:05:33.915
<v Speaker 0>because we actually already have

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:35.970
<v Speaker 0>our teleport.YAML

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.090
<v Speaker 0>here. So

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.730
<v Speaker 0>what I found works rather well is just

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.450
<v Speaker 0>to do a teleport.GitHub.YAML,

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.570
<v Speaker 0>gif, gif hub.

00:05:49.185 --> 00:05:50.785
<v Speaker 0>Yes. I am live now.

00:05:51.585 --> 00:05:52.465
<v Speaker 0>I hope.

00:05:55.264 --> 00:05:56.705
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'm live.

00:05:57.104 --> 00:05:59.104
<v Speaker 0>Can't make it through. I should be. So

00:05:59.104 --> 00:06:00.544
<v Speaker 0>teleport.gif.yaml.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.780
<v Speaker 0>We will drop in all this YAML and

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:04.900
<v Speaker 0>we come up to the top. Now we

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.380
<v Speaker 0>can just remove the comments. Those are far

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.900
<v Speaker 0>from important just now. We can see here

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.980
<v Speaker 0>we need our client ID and client secrets.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.020
<v Speaker 0>We'll come back to that.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.860
<v Speaker 0>Displays us as GitHub.

00:06:14.175 --> 00:06:16.815
<v Speaker 0>We add our redirect URL here.

00:06:17.694 --> 00:06:18.335
<v Speaker 0>This

00:06:20.254 --> 00:06:24.014
<v Speaker 0>is Teleport.Rawkode.

00:06:25.294 --> 00:06:26.895
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'm live. Yeah. Thanks, Russell.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.080
<v Speaker 0>I guess this this is the first tutorial

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.480
<v Speaker 0>that I've done live. Normally, I just prerecorded.

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:35.040
<v Speaker 0>I decided

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.360
<v Speaker 0>to try and livestream this one today. So

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.600
<v Speaker 0>if you prefer the prerecorded, just let me

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.479
<v Speaker 0>know. I won't do it again.

00:06:42.445 --> 00:06:43.805
<v Speaker 0>So organization

00:06:43.805 --> 00:06:47.325
<v Speaker 0>is I'm going to allow the Rawkode Academy

00:06:47.565 --> 00:06:48.685
<v Speaker 0>organization

00:06:49.805 --> 00:06:50.765
<v Speaker 0>to

00:06:50.765 --> 00:06:53.005
<v Speaker 0>log in to the best Teleport cluster.

00:06:53.405 --> 00:06:55.645
<v Speaker 0>And then we can specify the teams

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:56.740
<v Speaker 0>or the team.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.300
<v Speaker 0>And I'm going to say the team will

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.300
<v Speaker 0>be a tutorial. So I'll create a new

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.460
<v Speaker 0>team that gives me access to this when

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.180
<v Speaker 0>we're ready.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.420
<v Speaker 0>And then we can decide

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:07.780
<v Speaker 0>what access

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.665
<v Speaker 0>we want to give to this. Now, of

00:07:10.665 --> 00:07:11.865
<v Speaker 0>course we could do

00:07:12.185 --> 00:07:12.905
<v Speaker 0>editor,

00:07:13.785 --> 00:07:14.585
<v Speaker 0>audit,

00:07:14.905 --> 00:07:15.785
<v Speaker 0>etcetera.

00:07:16.105 --> 00:07:18.905
<v Speaker 0>However, I'm just going to do access

00:07:19.065 --> 00:07:20.105
<v Speaker 0>for now

00:07:20.745 --> 00:07:22.265
<v Speaker 0>and remove that comment.

00:07:22.505 --> 00:07:24.770
<v Speaker 0>So this is pretty close.

00:07:25.569 --> 00:07:28.450
<v Speaker 0>So let's swap out these missing values.

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:31.410
<v Speaker 0>So let's grab our client ID from our

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.530
<v Speaker 0>newly created

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:35.410
<v Speaker 0>GitHub authentication

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:36.370
<v Speaker 0>app

00:07:38.675 --> 00:07:39.555
<v Speaker 0>And

00:07:39.635 --> 00:07:41.715
<v Speaker 0>we'll generate a secret,

00:07:42.035 --> 00:07:44.195
<v Speaker 0>which I'll delete ASAP.

00:07:45.155 --> 00:07:46.675
<v Speaker 0>We'll use it for today.

00:07:47.235 --> 00:07:48.915
<v Speaker 0>Copy. There's no point in trying to hide

00:07:48.915 --> 00:07:50.275
<v Speaker 0>this because I need to paste into them.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:53.450
<v Speaker 0>Like so.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:56.970
<v Speaker 0>So I think,

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.250
<v Speaker 0>don't wanna get too confident, but I think

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.610
<v Speaker 0>this is enough.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.050
<v Speaker 0>So we save this file.

00:08:04.185 --> 00:08:05.705
<v Speaker 0>You can cat it just so you can

00:08:05.705 --> 00:08:07.465
<v Speaker 0>see that there's nothing changed. It's exactly what

00:08:07.465 --> 00:08:08.745
<v Speaker 0>as we did. And then we can do

00:08:08.745 --> 00:08:10.185
<v Speaker 0>a t control apply

00:08:10.185 --> 00:08:12.185
<v Speaker 0>dash f GitHub.

00:08:14.505 --> 00:08:16.665
<v Speaker 0>Does it not apply? I'm not being silly.

00:08:18.505 --> 00:08:18.825
<v Speaker 0>Create.

00:08:19.789 --> 00:08:21.310
<v Speaker 0>Apply with b kip control.

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:28.830
<v Speaker 0>Like so. And now it's telling us that

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:31.389
<v Speaker 0>our authentication connected GitHub has been created.

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:35.549
<v Speaker 0>What this means is that if we come

00:08:34.644 --> 00:08:37.765
<v Speaker 0>to this page and we refresh, that we

00:08:37.765 --> 00:08:41.204
<v Speaker 0>will no longer be presented with the manual

00:08:41.204 --> 00:08:42.885
<v Speaker 0>slash custom login screen

00:08:43.365 --> 00:08:44.245
<v Speaker 0>like so.

00:08:44.485 --> 00:08:46.005
<v Speaker 0>Now, of course, we can if we had

00:08:46.005 --> 00:08:48.325
<v Speaker 0>local users, but we don't, so we get

00:08:48.325 --> 00:08:50.170
<v Speaker 0>rid of it. And now we click the

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.730
<v Speaker 0>help button. Now I'm going to try and

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.730
<v Speaker 0>log in with this. It's going to fail.

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:57.209
<v Speaker 0>I hope it's going to fail, but it

00:08:57.209 --> 00:08:59.529
<v Speaker 0>should fail because I added as part of

00:08:59.529 --> 00:09:00.330
<v Speaker 0>the configuration

00:09:02.505 --> 00:09:05.225
<v Speaker 0>that our team has to be tutorial to

00:09:05.225 --> 00:09:07.305
<v Speaker 0>get access to the cluster.

00:09:07.865 --> 00:09:10.265
<v Speaker 0>So if I do this, this team doesn't

00:09:10.265 --> 00:09:12.425
<v Speaker 0>exist yet. We haven't created it.

00:09:12.745 --> 00:09:14.905
<v Speaker 0>But you'll see that my Teleport tutorial application

00:09:14.905 --> 00:09:16.105
<v Speaker 0>by Rawkode Academy,

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.160
<v Speaker 0>I have lots of different organizations, but we'll

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.280
<v Speaker 0>skip past that.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.080
<v Speaker 0>And we get unable to process callback.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.760
<v Speaker 0>Is that the error message I'm expecting?

00:09:30.665 --> 00:09:32.425
<v Speaker 0>Not sure, but we're gonna find out.

00:09:32.985 --> 00:09:36.024
<v Speaker 0>I think that Teleport Rawkode is alive. I'm

00:09:36.024 --> 00:09:37.545
<v Speaker 0>gonna double check.

00:09:40.185 --> 00:09:41.464
<v Speaker 0>There's config.

00:09:41.464 --> 00:09:43.545
<v Speaker 0>Teleport Rawkode. Yeah. I think it's okay.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.070
<v Speaker 0>And I didn't mess that up in here.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.990
<v Speaker 0>Teleport.org. Yeah. I think we're good. I think

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.150
<v Speaker 0>that is just a weird error message for

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:51.910
<v Speaker 0>the team problem, but we're gonna fix that

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.150
<v Speaker 0>now. So we'll come back to those Rawkode

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.550
<v Speaker 0>Academy settings. We'll try no. We don't want

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.310
<v Speaker 0>team discussions. We want teams.

00:09:58.815 --> 00:10:00.255
<v Speaker 0>Go to my profile,

00:10:01.775 --> 00:10:02.735
<v Speaker 0>teams,

00:10:03.295 --> 00:10:04.415
<v Speaker 0>new team,

00:10:04.975 --> 00:10:07.215
<v Speaker 0>and we'll call this one tutorial

00:10:08.255 --> 00:10:09.455
<v Speaker 0>and click create.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.079
<v Speaker 0>Now I'm already a member of this because

00:10:13.079 --> 00:10:14.920
<v Speaker 0>I am the owner of the organization.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.600
<v Speaker 0>So let's try.

00:10:19.079 --> 00:10:19.880
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully,

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:21.880
<v Speaker 0>again.

00:10:23.319 --> 00:10:24.440
<v Speaker 0>Wonderful.

00:10:26.035 --> 00:10:27.955
<v Speaker 0>And now we have access to Teleport. So

00:10:27.955 --> 00:10:29.315
<v Speaker 0>now we can connect

00:10:29.714 --> 00:10:30.515
<v Speaker 0>to

00:10:30.515 --> 00:10:32.834
<v Speaker 0>the nodes. Oh, I haven't given myself user

00:10:32.834 --> 00:10:34.195
<v Speaker 0>access, but that's okay.

00:10:34.995 --> 00:10:38.035
<v Speaker 0>We can modify the GitHub configuration to support

00:10:38.035 --> 00:10:38.435
<v Speaker 0>that there.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.760
<v Speaker 0>Wonderful.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.520
<v Speaker 0>So I do see that we have a

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.880
<v Speaker 0>question from

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.200
<v Speaker 0>Ali.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.240
<v Speaker 0>Hello.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.280
<v Speaker 0>Long one.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.280
<v Speaker 0>First time I look the Teleport and it

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:55.920
<v Speaker 0>seems amazing.

00:10:56.265 --> 00:10:57.065
<v Speaker 0>It is.

00:10:57.625 --> 00:10:59.305
<v Speaker 0>However, I was wondering what is the difference

00:10:59.305 --> 00:11:01.785
<v Speaker 0>between Hashicorp Vault and Teleport? Are there any

00:11:01.785 --> 00:11:02.985
<v Speaker 0>pros and cons?

00:11:03.465 --> 00:11:05.065
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's

00:11:05.065 --> 00:11:06.825
<v Speaker 0>a good question. So

00:11:07.705 --> 00:11:08.265
<v Speaker 0>Teleport

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.640
<v Speaker 0>cannot really be compared to HashiCorp Vault.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.600
<v Speaker 0>Vault is a KMS system. It stores secrets,

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.480
<v Speaker 0>encryption keys, and valuable information, which can be

00:11:22.645 --> 00:11:25.685
<v Speaker 0>exposed to one or many users or groups

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:27.365
<v Speaker 0>depending on the level of access they have

00:11:27.365 --> 00:11:29.845
<v Speaker 0>to the vault based on paths and prefixes.

00:11:30.485 --> 00:11:33.925
<v Speaker 0>So you could probably actually use vault along

00:11:33.925 --> 00:11:34.565
<v Speaker 0>with

00:11:34.725 --> 00:11:35.445
<v Speaker 0>Teleport.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:39.740
<v Speaker 0>However, you can compare

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.100
<v Speaker 0>Teleport to

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.420
<v Speaker 0>HashiCorp's boundary.

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:48.540
<v Speaker 0>Now, boundary is far from feature parity with

00:11:47.625 --> 00:11:50.425
<v Speaker 0>what we get from Teleport. So really, I'm

00:11:50.425 --> 00:11:53.545
<v Speaker 0>just gonna see Teleport is probably lead Teleport

00:11:53.545 --> 00:11:54.665
<v Speaker 0>is leading here.

00:11:54.905 --> 00:11:56.665
<v Speaker 0>And I would encourage everybody to really go

00:11:56.665 --> 00:11:57.625
<v Speaker 0>down this path.

00:11:58.825 --> 00:12:02.610
<v Speaker 0>With access to Linux systems, to databases, to

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:04.770
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes, to applications,

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:06.770
<v Speaker 0>and even desktop, Windows desktop,

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:08.930
<v Speaker 0>for example, which we did a video on

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:09.650
<v Speaker 0>recently

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:12.770
<v Speaker 0>with Ben from that team, from the Teleport

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:13.410
<v Speaker 0>team.

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:16.655
<v Speaker 0>So Teleport, it just went us hands down.

00:12:16.655 --> 00:12:19.215
<v Speaker 0>Although there are a similar products out there,

00:12:19.215 --> 00:12:19.775
<v Speaker 0>but

00:12:20.335 --> 00:12:22.015
<v Speaker 0>we like Teleport. It's great.

00:12:23.295 --> 00:12:25.215
<v Speaker 0>All right. Let's

00:12:25.295 --> 00:12:26.415
<v Speaker 0>fix

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:29.529
<v Speaker 0>some stuff.

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:37.690
<v Speaker 0>If we come in here,

00:12:41.765 --> 00:12:43.845
<v Speaker 0>We don't need to worry about this.

00:12:44.645 --> 00:12:47.285
<v Speaker 0>I'm just curious about the spec for the

00:12:47.285 --> 00:12:48.005
<v Speaker 0>users.

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:00.290
<v Speaker 0>Computer is being weird.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:02.770
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's just find that.

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:06.370
<v Speaker 0>So one of my favorite pages in the

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:07.410
<v Speaker 0>documentation,

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:09.330
<v Speaker 0>if I can remember where it is.

00:13:11.165 --> 00:13:12.285
<v Speaker 0>The architecture.

00:13:12.285 --> 00:13:13.805
<v Speaker 0>Let's see. Reference.

00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:23.084
<v Speaker 0>Oh, there's more references and then dot.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:29.180
<v Speaker 0>Reference.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.860
<v Speaker 0>And then we have the config fail.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.020
<v Speaker 0>Does this include

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:37.980
<v Speaker 0>GitHub?

00:13:43.394 --> 00:13:44.835
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's see.

00:13:56.834 --> 00:13:57.955
<v Speaker 0>That's taking me back.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:01.020
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:07.740
<v Speaker 0>Let's take a look at one I already

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:08.060
<v Speaker 0>use.

00:14:15.464 --> 00:14:17.384
<v Speaker 0>I forgot I didn't remove all the SSH

00:14:17.384 --> 00:14:19.065
<v Speaker 0>keys from the organization,

00:14:19.065 --> 00:14:20.345
<v Speaker 0>but that's alright.

00:14:20.584 --> 00:14:22.024
<v Speaker 0>We can take a look at the clustered

00:14:22.024 --> 00:14:23.704
<v Speaker 0>setup because we already did this here.

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:27.100
<v Speaker 0>So if we come into clustered and take

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.620
<v Speaker 0>a look at the

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.660
<v Speaker 0>cluster automation and inside this, we have a

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.180
<v Speaker 0>whole bunch of cloud edit scripts and a

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.100
<v Speaker 0>whole bunch of main setup, Teleport.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.340
<v Speaker 0>And if we take a look at

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.834
<v Speaker 0>Nope, not Teleport install.

00:14:42.675 --> 00:14:44.915
<v Speaker 0>I don't think it's the agent actually either.

00:14:47.235 --> 00:14:48.915
<v Speaker 0>Not yet. Oh, maybe?

00:14:48.995 --> 00:14:49.714
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:14:50.435 --> 00:14:52.850
<v Speaker 0>Teleport server. There you go. I wrote these

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.050
<v Speaker 0>scripts. Okay. So

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.890
<v Speaker 0>what we do here is you see logins

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:06.370
<v Speaker 0>Rawkode.

00:15:06.745 --> 00:15:09.545
<v Speaker 0>So we're using the access role. So we

00:15:09.545 --> 00:15:12.185
<v Speaker 0>could modify that. That's a good point, actually.

00:15:16.265 --> 00:15:18.105
<v Speaker 0>Or we could create a new role. Let's

00:15:18.105 --> 00:15:19.545
<v Speaker 0>create a new role. Let's do it in

00:15:19.545 --> 00:15:20.185
<v Speaker 0>a proper way.

00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:24.920
<v Speaker 0>So what I'm gonna do here is copy

00:15:25.399 --> 00:15:27.160
<v Speaker 0>this rule template

00:15:28.439 --> 00:15:30.759
<v Speaker 0>and we'll just do this. I think we

00:15:30.759 --> 00:15:32.199
<v Speaker 0>can get away with just doing this all

00:15:32.199 --> 00:15:32.759
<v Speaker 0>in the water.

00:15:36.725 --> 00:15:38.884
<v Speaker 0>We use three lanes as a separator, and

00:15:38.884 --> 00:15:40.245
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna have to swap out some stuff

00:15:40.245 --> 00:15:43.204
<v Speaker 0>that I normally interpret and manually manually automatically.

00:15:44.165 --> 00:15:45.845
<v Speaker 0>And we'll create this rule here. So this

00:15:45.845 --> 00:15:47.925
<v Speaker 0>is a very inclusive rule. This is my

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.660
<v Speaker 0>super special rule when I am filming clustered.

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.860
<v Speaker 0>And we actually did a Teleport Rback deep

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:57.660
<v Speaker 0>dive session, which you can find at Rawkode.live

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.420
<v Speaker 0>if you just search for Teleport Rback.

00:16:00.665 --> 00:16:02.264
<v Speaker 0>But here, we're saying, okay, we have a

00:16:02.264 --> 00:16:02.824
<v Speaker 0>team,

00:16:03.545 --> 00:16:06.504
<v Speaker 0>and I'm gonna call this team Rawkode.

00:16:06.504 --> 00:16:08.345
<v Speaker 0>And this is the bit that was missing

00:16:08.985 --> 00:16:11.785
<v Speaker 0>from just using the straight access rule is

00:16:11.785 --> 00:16:13.305
<v Speaker 0>that we have to tell it which logins

00:16:13.305 --> 00:16:15.870
<v Speaker 0>we have access to. So by default with

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:17.470
<v Speaker 0>the access role,

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:19.950
<v Speaker 0>it becomes a service. You'll see that when

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:22.510
<v Speaker 0>I click connect, I get my own username.

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:25.870
<v Speaker 0>That just means that that username actually needs

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:27.310
<v Speaker 0>to exist on the host

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:30.245
<v Speaker 0>or the login will fail. And in fact,

00:16:30.245 --> 00:16:32.725
<v Speaker 0>I think the error message is user unknown.

00:16:33.685 --> 00:16:34.245
<v Speaker 0>So

00:16:34.965 --> 00:16:36.885
<v Speaker 0>here, if we just say that actually this

00:16:36.885 --> 00:16:37.925
<v Speaker 0>person can

00:16:39.045 --> 00:16:41.765
<v Speaker 0>access or communicate using the root user, which

00:16:41.765 --> 00:16:43.430
<v Speaker 0>is what we wanna use here. Of course,

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:45.270
<v Speaker 0>there are pros and cons to this. As

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:46.950
<v Speaker 0>far as node labels go, I'm gonna go

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:49.510
<v Speaker 0>with wonderful star star for today.

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:54.790
<v Speaker 0>It should be here. And I'm not fussed

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:56.550
<v Speaker 0>about app labels. We don't have any applications

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:57.510
<v Speaker 0>exposed at the moment.

00:16:58.925 --> 00:16:59.565
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:17:01.884 --> 00:17:04.765
<v Speaker 0>This is my super role, which I don't

00:17:04.765 --> 00:17:05.404
<v Speaker 0>think

00:17:05.724 --> 00:17:08.444
<v Speaker 0>we are going to need right now. So

00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:09.885
<v Speaker 0>we can just remove this. But this is

00:17:09.885 --> 00:17:12.125
<v Speaker 0>just very explicit and allowing me to actually

00:17:12.125 --> 00:17:15.599
<v Speaker 0>manage the Teleport cluster. This is a modified

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:17.119
<v Speaker 0>editor role.

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:19.359
<v Speaker 0>So there's a lot of permissions here, but

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:21.440
<v Speaker 0>we don't need that for today's session.

00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:25.919
<v Speaker 0>Bigger than I remember.

00:17:27.935 --> 00:17:29.375
<v Speaker 0>There we go. Really, I should have been

00:17:29.375 --> 00:17:32.174
<v Speaker 0>using some VEM key vagrants here. Key

00:17:33.055 --> 00:17:34.174
<v Speaker 0>the. Okay.

00:17:36.175 --> 00:17:39.055
<v Speaker 0>So now we're gonna get myself the Rawkode

00:17:39.055 --> 00:17:41.280
<v Speaker 0>role. So this role should be able see

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.640
<v Speaker 0>any machine and log in as rich. Let's

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.080
<v Speaker 0>try that again.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.720
<v Speaker 0>Teleport.get

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:49.360
<v Speaker 0>up.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.559
<v Speaker 0>Seems nicer.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:53.280
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:17:53.855 --> 00:17:55.695
<v Speaker 0>Let's do a refresh. Now do I need

00:17:55.695 --> 00:17:58.015
<v Speaker 0>to log out and then perhaps, so let's

00:17:58.015 --> 00:18:00.495
<v Speaker 0>sign out, refresh my credentials.

00:18:02.495 --> 00:18:04.575
<v Speaker 0>And now we have access to root and

00:18:04.575 --> 00:18:06.575
<v Speaker 0>now we are on our

00:18:06.655 --> 00:18:07.215
<v Speaker 0>machine.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:09.559
<v Speaker 0>Simple.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:13.640
<v Speaker 0>So

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:18.040
<v Speaker 0>thanks for tuning in. That is our GitHub

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.040
<v Speaker 0>authentication web Teleport video.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:21.880
<v Speaker 0>We got

00:18:23.255 --> 00:18:25.895
<v Speaker 0>Ali says, thanks for the explanation. No problem.

00:18:26.375 --> 00:18:27.895
<v Speaker 0>That's why I like doing these things live

00:18:27.895 --> 00:18:30.055
<v Speaker 0>so we can get some questions and hopefully

00:18:30.055 --> 00:18:31.655
<v Speaker 0>make your life a little bit easier.

00:18:32.535 --> 00:18:34.855
<v Speaker 0>All right. We've got another big question.

00:18:35.495 --> 00:18:37.095
<v Speaker 0>Will it fit in the screen? Yeah, I'll

00:18:37.095 --> 00:18:40.080
<v Speaker 0>get there. I also started testing Teleport as

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.720
<v Speaker 0>our access management solution. I'm wondering how others

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.960
<v Speaker 0>handle joining all scaling group instances when scaling

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.120
<v Speaker 0>happens or EKS node groups.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.080
<v Speaker 0>For EKS, you can deploy

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.405
<v Speaker 0>remove that off my face. For EKS, you

00:18:53.405 --> 00:18:55.245
<v Speaker 0>could deploy Teleport

00:18:55.245 --> 00:18:58.445
<v Speaker 0>inside of your Kubernetes cluster using some privileged

00:18:58.445 --> 00:19:00.125
<v Speaker 0>access to get anything that you need onto

00:19:00.125 --> 00:19:02.285
<v Speaker 0>the host is one way. With the auto

00:19:02.285 --> 00:19:04.125
<v Speaker 0>scaling grip, you're gonna wanna use

00:19:04.285 --> 00:19:05.725
<v Speaker 0>custom launch configuration,

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.840
<v Speaker 0>which may configure Teleport

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.600
<v Speaker 0>to

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.240
<v Speaker 0>which will mean the machines when they spin

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.000
<v Speaker 0>up automatically add the things that you need

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.519
<v Speaker 0>for Teleport for that to work.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.559
<v Speaker 0>I'll link to one thing really quickly before

00:19:19.559 --> 00:19:20.440
<v Speaker 0>I go off there,

00:19:22.415 --> 00:19:24.655
<v Speaker 0>which is machine ID. So this is a

00:19:24.655 --> 00:19:26.335
<v Speaker 0>really new feature.

00:19:30.095 --> 00:19:30.735
<v Speaker 0>Go.

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:34.510
<v Speaker 0>This is a really new feature with Teleport

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:36.830
<v Speaker 0>nine. We actually did a session on this

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:38.110
<v Speaker 0>with Ben as well.

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:40.750
<v Speaker 0>So there's like that.

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:43.710
<v Speaker 0>Teleport

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:44.190
<v Speaker 0>nine.

00:19:45.005 --> 00:19:46.765
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, go to this Q and A

00:19:47.325 --> 00:19:49.245
<v Speaker 0>with Ben Adams from the Teleport team. We

00:19:49.245 --> 00:19:50.925
<v Speaker 0>actually do a demo and talk about machine

00:19:50.925 --> 00:19:53.005
<v Speaker 0>ID in much more detail, but machine ID

00:19:53.005 --> 00:19:55.565
<v Speaker 0>will allow you to use cloud, KMS, etcetera,

00:19:55.565 --> 00:19:58.205
<v Speaker 0>to kind of broker that initial connection

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:01.309
<v Speaker 0>and a machine configuration also works with CICD.

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:03.309
<v Speaker 0>So it's worth looking at

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:05.710
<v Speaker 0>and playing with an experiment with.

00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:09.710
<v Speaker 0>Okay. A question from Russell.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:11.150
<v Speaker 0>Assume

00:20:12.235 --> 00:20:13.674
<v Speaker 0>on the screen, I assume that all the

00:20:13.674 --> 00:20:15.755
<v Speaker 0>other features of Teleport are available when using

00:20:15.755 --> 00:20:17.114
<v Speaker 0>GitHub authentication,

00:20:17.434 --> 00:20:19.835
<v Speaker 0>I e, simply access via approvals.

00:20:22.235 --> 00:20:25.515
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So the OAuth Dance just gets you

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:26.740
<v Speaker 0>mapped to a Teleport role and then all

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.780
<v Speaker 0>the other features will function as normal.

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.060
<v Speaker 0>So any of those cool features like privilege

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:33.940
<v Speaker 0>elevation,

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:35.299
<v Speaker 0>etcetera,

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:36.340
<v Speaker 0>all just work.

00:20:39.735 --> 00:20:42.135
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, thanks for your time today. We've

00:20:42.135 --> 00:20:44.855
<v Speaker 0>got another three videos left in this Teleport

00:20:44.855 --> 00:20:47.495
<v Speaker 0>course coming within the next two weeks. All

00:20:47.495 --> 00:20:49.335
<v Speaker 0>juggles around KubeCon,

00:20:49.495 --> 00:20:50.695
<v Speaker 0>but I'm excited.

00:20:50.934 --> 00:20:53.174
<v Speaker 0>And we'll get you more

00:20:53.495 --> 00:20:55.700
<v Speaker 0>because let's face it, right? We've already seen

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.220
<v Speaker 0>in the six months that I've been working

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.940
<v Speaker 0>on this course that Teleport have shipped three

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:02.980
<v Speaker 0>major versions. So when Teleport ten ships, I'll

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:04.180
<v Speaker 0>be sure to update this course and keep

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.700
<v Speaker 0>the content coming. So

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:07.780
<v Speaker 0>if you like these videos, thumb it up,

00:21:07.965 --> 00:21:10.125
<v Speaker 0>share it with your friends and colleagues, and

00:21:10.125 --> 00:21:12.205
<v Speaker 0>remember to subscribe to the channel. And I'll

00:21:12.205 --> 00:21:13.804
<v Speaker 0>see you all soon. Thanks for your time.

00:21:13.965 --> 00:21:14.284
<v Speaker 0>Bye.
