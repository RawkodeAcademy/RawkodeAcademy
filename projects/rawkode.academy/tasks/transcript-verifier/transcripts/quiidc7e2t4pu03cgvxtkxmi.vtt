00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:09.519
<v Speaker 0>Filling out with beats so sleek.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.120
<v Speaker 0>Sebastian

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.360
<v Speaker 0>Seated guy, the geek.

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.079
<v Speaker 0>Runmeets has

00:04:00.055 --> 00:04:03.415
<v Speaker 1>Hello, and welcome back to the Rawkode Academy.

00:04:03.495 --> 00:04:05.415
<v Speaker 1>I'm your host, David Flanagan, known across the

00:04:05.415 --> 00:04:07.655
<v Speaker 1>Internet as Rawkode. And today, we continue the

00:04:07.655 --> 00:04:09.575
<v Speaker 1>Rawkode live series where we take a look

00:04:09.575 --> 00:04:11.790
<v Speaker 1>at awesome open source software that will make

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.950
<v Speaker 1>your cloud native lives all that little bit

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:14.670
<v Speaker 1>easier.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.910
<v Speaker 1>And today, we're taking a look at a

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.910
<v Speaker 1>project that I've been adopting within the Rawkode

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.070
<v Speaker 1>Academy itself, which makes us an extra fun

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.870
<v Speaker 1>episode.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.790
<v Speaker 1>And I am joined by

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:28.245
<v Speaker 1>cofounder and CTO, Sebastian. Hey. How's it going,

00:04:28.245 --> 00:04:28.965
<v Speaker 0>man? Hey.

00:04:29.685 --> 00:04:31.285
<v Speaker 0>It's it's going good. How are you?

00:04:31.685 --> 00:04:33.845
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Good. I'm

00:04:33.845 --> 00:04:35.845
<v Speaker 1>I'm just bobbing along to the electronic music.

00:04:35.845 --> 00:04:37.764
<v Speaker 1>You know? I'm I'm really I think the

00:04:37.764 --> 00:04:39.380
<v Speaker 1>AI like, I know people are probably gonna

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.820
<v Speaker 1>just go on with the show already, but

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.820
<v Speaker 1>maybe AI music, it it puts a smile

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.260
<v Speaker 1>on my face before we go live. So

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.300
<v Speaker 1>what more can you ask for? I I

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.979
<v Speaker 0>think it's great. I mean, I also love

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.340
<v Speaker 0>hearing my name in it, and I'm not

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.900
<v Speaker 0>usually I don't love having attention on me,

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.100
<v Speaker 0>but I will definitely listen to that in

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.419
<v Speaker 0>my car.

00:04:54.255 --> 00:04:56.095
<v Speaker 1>No attention on you, but I'm gonna put

00:04:56.095 --> 00:04:57.615
<v Speaker 1>the spot right on you right now and

00:04:57.615 --> 00:04:59.615
<v Speaker 1>ask you to introduce yourself to the audience

00:04:59.615 --> 00:05:01.375
<v Speaker 1>and share a little bit about you.

00:05:01.935 --> 00:05:02.735
<v Speaker 0>Will do.

00:05:04.495 --> 00:05:07.055
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So my name is Sebastian. I'm the

00:05:07.055 --> 00:05:09.539
<v Speaker 0>CTO at Stateful, and we make runme. I

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:11.460
<v Speaker 0>I'm kinda all decked out, so Stateful is

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.220
<v Speaker 0>the company. Right? We have no idea. It's

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.620
<v Speaker 0>a merit. And and runme is the project

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.699
<v Speaker 0>that we're making, which is essentially

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.860
<v Speaker 0>open source technology.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.220
<v Speaker 0>I've been in sort of the cloud cloud

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.379
<v Speaker 0>native ecosystem

00:05:24.765 --> 00:05:26.365
<v Speaker 0>for a couple of years now.

00:05:26.925 --> 00:05:29.645
<v Speaker 0>Spent a lot of time at Sauce Labs

00:05:29.805 --> 00:05:31.805
<v Speaker 0>helping with, like, test automation

00:05:32.125 --> 00:05:34.285
<v Speaker 0>and then made my way into cloud native

00:05:34.285 --> 00:05:35.165
<v Speaker 0>PKI,

00:05:35.165 --> 00:05:37.565
<v Speaker 0>you know, service meshes and the TLS mutual

00:05:37.565 --> 00:05:40.389
<v Speaker 0>TLS aspect of that. And, you know, about

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:42.790
<v Speaker 0>four years ago, kinda went on this journey

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.230
<v Speaker 0>to start a company and,

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.150
<v Speaker 0>worked through this,

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.070
<v Speaker 0>problem that I still think is unsolved,

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.750
<v Speaker 0>but, like, I think runme closes the gap.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.350
<v Speaker 0>Well, I'm hoping that runme will close the

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.990
<v Speaker 0>gap where

00:05:54.405 --> 00:05:57.125
<v Speaker 0>I think we our tool chain is too

00:05:57.125 --> 00:05:58.645
<v Speaker 0>fragmented. Right? We have a we have a

00:05:58.645 --> 00:06:00.405
<v Speaker 0>terminal. We have a browser. We have an

00:06:00.405 --> 00:06:02.165
<v Speaker 0>editor. We have a cloud console.

00:06:02.405 --> 00:06:04.325
<v Speaker 0>And anytime we we use one or the

00:06:04.325 --> 00:06:06.405
<v Speaker 0>other, we actually have to switch into another

00:06:06.405 --> 00:06:08.660
<v Speaker 0>tool. And I call these sort of, like,

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.220
<v Speaker 0>default lines between, you know, the seventies I've

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.260
<v Speaker 0>created with POSIX, Unix, and and the process

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.860
<v Speaker 0>model that's been so successful.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.420
<v Speaker 0>But in the long run, you know, essentially,

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.705
<v Speaker 0>it's a lot of tech debt. You know?

00:06:20.705 --> 00:06:21.985
<v Speaker 0>I'm saying this in a in a sort

00:06:21.985 --> 00:06:23.985
<v Speaker 0>of, like, loving way because I am also

00:06:23.985 --> 00:06:25.264
<v Speaker 0>in love with the terminal.

00:06:25.985 --> 00:06:27.745
<v Speaker 0>So before we obviously, before I get too

00:06:27.745 --> 00:06:28.625
<v Speaker 0>deep into that,

00:06:29.025 --> 00:06:30.065
<v Speaker 0>what came out of that is sort of

00:06:30.065 --> 00:06:31.585
<v Speaker 0>the idea of flipping it on its side

00:06:31.585 --> 00:06:34.784
<v Speaker 0>using a notebook UX to bring all these

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.910
<v Speaker 0>different tools into one place.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.470
<v Speaker 0>And then also, you know, layer a a

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.190
<v Speaker 0>CLI, you know, not over it, but, like,

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.430
<v Speaker 0>over the same core, you know, so you

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.190
<v Speaker 0>can have sort of a multimodal way of

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:46.830
<v Speaker 0>interacting

00:06:47.245 --> 00:06:48.925
<v Speaker 0>with, you know, tools

00:06:49.485 --> 00:06:51.645
<v Speaker 0>those tools and, you know, the workflows that

00:06:51.645 --> 00:06:53.485
<v Speaker 0>you're describing, the task that you're describing,

00:06:53.725 --> 00:06:55.565
<v Speaker 0>that sort of stuff. And I really enjoy

00:06:55.565 --> 00:06:57.805
<v Speaker 0>talking about this stuff, and I can get

00:06:57.805 --> 00:07:00.720
<v Speaker 0>really deep into, you know, Chrome architectures and

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.000
<v Speaker 0>all that. But, like, I'll leave it at

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.919
<v Speaker 0>that intro, and I'm sure we'll get into

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:04.400
<v Speaker 0>it.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I like that early on you've already

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.440
<v Speaker 1>mentioned, like, multimodal.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.120
<v Speaker 1>So, you know, before we go live, you

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.639
<v Speaker 1>know, full disclosure, I was talking about all

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:13.919
<v Speaker 1>the different things I've tried in the past

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:16.055
<v Speaker 1>to do this exact thing. You know, there

00:07:16.055 --> 00:07:17.975
<v Speaker 1>are there are no shortage of tools out

00:07:17.975 --> 00:07:20.535
<v Speaker 1>there, but what I I really appreciated in

00:07:20.535 --> 00:07:22.455
<v Speaker 1>light and why I've stuck with runme is

00:07:22.455 --> 00:07:24.615
<v Speaker 1>just that I do wanna work on the

00:07:24.615 --> 00:07:26.375
<v Speaker 1>command line except when I don't, and I

00:07:26.375 --> 00:07:28.535
<v Speaker 1>do wanna work in Versus Code except when

00:07:28.535 --> 00:07:31.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't. And, like, that is definitely the

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.450
<v Speaker 1>differentiator. If I want, I can use the

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.050
<v Speaker 1>CLI and people will see that, you know,

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.130
<v Speaker 1>shortly as we get into it. But if

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:38.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm already in Versus Code and I just

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.970
<v Speaker 1>wanna run something, the button's, like, right there.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.050
<v Speaker 1>And I love that you're not really forcing

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.415
<v Speaker 1>too many opinions on me. I mean, there

00:07:45.415 --> 00:07:47.735
<v Speaker 1>are obviously opinions, but I get to work

00:07:47.735 --> 00:07:49.095
<v Speaker 1>the way I wanna work with my tools

00:07:49.095 --> 00:07:51.175
<v Speaker 1>and that keeps me happy every single time.

00:07:51.175 --> 00:07:53.255
<v Speaker 1>I say this every episode almost, like, don't

00:07:53.255 --> 00:07:55.095
<v Speaker 1>take my tools away from me. Give me

00:07:55.255 --> 00:07:56.775
<v Speaker 1>enrich my tools in some way. And I

00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:58.215
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. You gotta meet people where they are.

00:07:58.215 --> 00:07:59.419
<v Speaker 0>Right? I mean, it was kinda, like, one

00:07:59.419 --> 00:08:01.020
<v Speaker 0>of the choices that informed

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.539
<v Speaker 0>you know, we did a lot of development

00:08:02.539 --> 00:08:03.100
<v Speaker 0>that,

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.819
<v Speaker 0>you know, like, makes that possible that, like,

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:07.900
<v Speaker 0>you know, almost is invisible. It's sort of

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.180
<v Speaker 0>like the stuff we are it's a little

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.115
<v Speaker 0>bit like how Apple designs product. It's like,

00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:12.715
<v Speaker 0>you don't really see how much work goes

00:08:12.715 --> 00:08:15.435
<v Speaker 0>into making it so so easy and so,

00:08:15.435 --> 00:08:16.555
<v Speaker 0>you know, frictionless.

00:08:16.635 --> 00:08:18.075
<v Speaker 0>And you just kinda assume that's how it

00:08:18.075 --> 00:08:19.835
<v Speaker 0>is. And, you know, that's one of the

00:08:19.835 --> 00:08:21.675
<v Speaker 0>big design principles. I kinda meet people where

00:08:21.675 --> 00:08:23.595
<v Speaker 0>they are. And as much as I, you

00:08:23.595 --> 00:08:25.780
<v Speaker 0>know, throw the POSIX, you know, and the

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.340
<v Speaker 0>process model and the UNIX history under the

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.860
<v Speaker 0>bus, right, I'm doing it in a in

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:30.979
<v Speaker 0>a way where I'm like, I still don't

00:08:30.979 --> 00:08:32.980
<v Speaker 0>wanna I don't wanna go to a WASM

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.059
<v Speaker 0>and say, like, goodbye. I'm out of here.

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:36.580
<v Speaker 0>Right? Because I know that, you know, we're

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.179
<v Speaker 0>both on the shoulder of giants. Right? And

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:39.539
<v Speaker 0>we kinda have to meet people where they

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:40.774
<v Speaker 0>are. Yeah.

00:08:41.815 --> 00:08:44.375
<v Speaker 1>I'll throw out one other little not really

00:08:44.375 --> 00:08:46.375
<v Speaker 1>a story, maybe just like an anecdote. But

00:08:46.855 --> 00:08:48.935
<v Speaker 1>I would say three months ago, I was

00:08:49.095 --> 00:08:51.735
<v Speaker 1>fully committed to saying goodbye to Markdown from

00:08:51.735 --> 00:08:54.214
<v Speaker 1>my entire life, like every repository, my mono

00:08:54.214 --> 00:08:55.175
<v Speaker 1>repository, the whole work.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.660
<v Speaker 1>And I'll throw Martin under the bus as

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.500
<v Speaker 1>I do not think it is

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.500
<v Speaker 1>what it's not up it's not set for

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.100
<v Speaker 1>purpose, right, for what we need it to

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.980
<v Speaker 1>do. And I started adopting AsciiDoc across all

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.300
<v Speaker 1>of my repositories because it's really extensible to

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.580
<v Speaker 1>the point where I can,

00:09:10.375 --> 00:09:13.255
<v Speaker 1>you know, import lines from a make file,

00:09:13.255 --> 00:09:15.495
<v Speaker 1>justify whatever and to my my readme. But

00:09:15.495 --> 00:09:17.975
<v Speaker 1>then you lose GitHub support. You lose the

00:09:17.975 --> 00:09:20.535
<v Speaker 1>GitLab support for Joe, Gitty, whatever you're using,

00:09:20.535 --> 00:09:23.095
<v Speaker 1>like, everything has built on markdown to the

00:09:23.095 --> 00:09:24.215
<v Speaker 1>point where I was just like, well, screw

00:09:24.215 --> 00:09:26.055
<v Speaker 1>all these services. I'm gonna ask you doc.

00:09:26.295 --> 00:09:28.030
<v Speaker 1>And I think runme was probably the tool

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:29.470
<v Speaker 1>that made me go, you know what? Let's

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:30.990
<v Speaker 1>just stick with markdown because this is really

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:32.190
<v Speaker 1>cool. And

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:34.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't think markdown is set for purpose,

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.110
<v Speaker 1>but I think the way

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:39.710
<v Speaker 1>that runme integrates with the markdown is different

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:41.375
<v Speaker 1>from what I've seen in the past and

00:09:41.375 --> 00:09:44.095
<v Speaker 1>that it almost feels like it worked. Like,

00:09:44.335 --> 00:09:45.935
<v Speaker 1>I I still feel like I'm writing markdown,

00:09:45.935 --> 00:09:48.415
<v Speaker 1>which is nice. Whereas other tools, they always

00:09:48.415 --> 00:09:50.575
<v Speaker 1>expect me to do weird structures with headings

00:09:50.575 --> 00:09:52.495
<v Speaker 1>or they expect me to do code box

00:09:52.495 --> 00:09:54.335
<v Speaker 1>for metadata and front matters and stuff like

00:09:54.335 --> 00:09:54.495
<v Speaker 1>that.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.150
<v Speaker 1>There's they share some of those things. I

00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:59.350
<v Speaker 1>had some commonality,

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:01.670
<v Speaker 1>but does stick to strictly Martin code blocks,

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.270
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was a really neat really

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.710
<v Speaker 1>neat trick. I mean, that's that's good to

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.710
<v Speaker 0>hear. I I just I wanna say Monday

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:09.185
<v Speaker 0>or Tuesday, I forget exactly Wednesday, probably most

00:10:09.185 --> 00:10:10.945
<v Speaker 0>of the day deep down in an abstract

00:10:10.945 --> 00:10:12.465
<v Speaker 0>syntax tree of markdown

00:10:12.625 --> 00:10:14.464
<v Speaker 0>to, like, really just iron out one of

00:10:14.464 --> 00:10:15.904
<v Speaker 0>those little kind of things that you run

00:10:15.904 --> 00:10:18.785
<v Speaker 0>into. And we spend a lot of time

00:10:19.105 --> 00:10:21.550
<v Speaker 0>really making it so that, like, even when

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:23.470
<v Speaker 0>you when you modify something in the notebook

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:25.550
<v Speaker 0>editor, then you get the minimal diff. Right?

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:26.589
<v Speaker 0>Like, we preserve,

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.589
<v Speaker 0>you know, like, lines at the end and

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.029
<v Speaker 0>you know? So so, I mean, there's a

00:10:30.029 --> 00:10:31.470
<v Speaker 0>lot of stuff work that goes into it.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.709
<v Speaker 0>So, you I'm glad you're saying that because,

00:10:33.709 --> 00:10:36.385
<v Speaker 0>like, conceivably, we could build an ASCII doc

00:10:36.385 --> 00:10:38.785
<v Speaker 0>AST into the notebook, kinda like, you know,

00:10:38.785 --> 00:10:39.505
<v Speaker 0>at the end of the day, it's like

00:10:39.505 --> 00:10:40.785
<v Speaker 0>decoding, encoding.

00:10:41.505 --> 00:10:43.505
<v Speaker 0>But I'm not looking forward to build another,

00:10:43.505 --> 00:10:44.625
<v Speaker 0>you know, AST

00:10:44.945 --> 00:10:46.865
<v Speaker 0>transformer that, you know, like,

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.160
<v Speaker 0>works out all those kings, but at least

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.920
<v Speaker 0>not in the short term. But I I

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.480
<v Speaker 0>agree. Like, am I in love with markdown?

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.920
<v Speaker 0>Is there something better? Maybe. But, like, it's

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.920
<v Speaker 0>everywhere. Right? It's like it's it's the same

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.600
<v Speaker 0>relationship I have with the terminal where I'm

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.014
<v Speaker 0>like, it I know it so well that

00:11:03.014 --> 00:11:05.415
<v Speaker 0>it's like, I type faster than anything else,

00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:07.574
<v Speaker 0>but I also understand that, like, it has

00:11:07.574 --> 00:11:09.735
<v Speaker 0>it has a difficult it has difficulties with,

00:11:09.735 --> 00:11:10.855
<v Speaker 0>like, sharing

00:11:10.935 --> 00:11:11.815
<v Speaker 0>workflows,

00:11:11.815 --> 00:11:14.120
<v Speaker 0>sharing what you're doing, and bringing in, like,

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.440
<v Speaker 0>you know, more graphical concepts. Right? Like, a

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.000
<v Speaker 0>UI is a is a really, like, from

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.920
<v Speaker 0>a fidelity point of view, dump down way

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.480
<v Speaker 0>of, like, making user interfaces available. Right? So

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.640
<v Speaker 0>it's yeah. But I'm I'm glad you're saying

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.035
<v Speaker 0>that, And I'm happy we brought that to

00:11:28.035 --> 00:11:28.515
<v Speaker 0>you.

00:11:29.315 --> 00:11:31.075
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I I mean, I don't think anything

00:11:31.235 --> 00:11:34.115
<v Speaker 1>there are better tools. Right? But than to

00:11:34.115 --> 00:11:34.915
<v Speaker 1>markdown.

00:11:35.395 --> 00:11:37.395
<v Speaker 1>But Absolutely. You can't fight the gravity of

00:11:37.395 --> 00:11:39.475
<v Speaker 1>it. It is ubiquitous and you just gotta

00:11:39.475 --> 00:11:42.070
<v Speaker 1>lean into that. And yeah. To pairing it

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:43.750
<v Speaker 1>with runme solved all my problems where my

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:45.110
<v Speaker 1>documentation becomes

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:46.870
<v Speaker 1>living. And that that was really what I

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:48.310
<v Speaker 1>was trying to achieve. Right? It wasn't that

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:50.310
<v Speaker 1>I I was at markdowns, like, good enough.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:51.589
<v Speaker 1>Have to replace it. It's just that I

00:11:51.589 --> 00:11:53.430
<v Speaker 1>want my documentation. I want to I want

00:11:53.555 --> 00:11:55.875
<v Speaker 1>guarantees. I want proof. I want physical

00:11:56.595 --> 00:11:59.315
<v Speaker 1>proof that that works. That still works across

00:11:59.475 --> 00:12:00.995
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Emily. I mean, like, one one of

00:12:00.995 --> 00:12:02.675
<v Speaker 0>those sort of design principles that I just

00:12:02.675 --> 00:12:04.035
<v Speaker 0>talked about was, like, you know, meeting people

00:12:04.035 --> 00:12:05.394
<v Speaker 0>where they are. Right? Another one is,

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.680
<v Speaker 0>you know, like, to to get to a

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.680
<v Speaker 0>place where our documentation is not just a

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.520
<v Speaker 0>thing off to the site. Right? It's not

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.080
<v Speaker 0>like an afterthought. It's not something that you

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.680
<v Speaker 0>you kinda, like, copy and paste a bunch

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:16.800
<v Speaker 0>of stuff that you currently did, and then

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.320
<v Speaker 0>you edit it somewhere and paste it into

00:12:18.615 --> 00:12:21.495
<v Speaker 0>a markdown document irrespective whether it will actually

00:12:21.495 --> 00:12:23.815
<v Speaker 0>run or not. Right? And there's obviously all

00:12:23.815 --> 00:12:25.415
<v Speaker 0>sorts of reasons why it might not run,

00:12:25.415 --> 00:12:27.335
<v Speaker 0>but, like, oftentimes, you would be surprised, and

00:12:27.335 --> 00:12:29.415
<v Speaker 0>I'm sure you've experienced that too, that people

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:31.630
<v Speaker 0>just made up make up command line flags,

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:33.150
<v Speaker 0>then they started it. Right? Like, out of

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.470
<v Speaker 0>them, Terraform apply has the same ones as

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:37.950
<v Speaker 0>Terraform plan, but in actuality, that's not true.

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.070
<v Speaker 0>So the idea of using, you know, like,

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:42.750
<v Speaker 0>those tools that we use to get work

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:45.355
<v Speaker 0>done and how we document it so we

00:12:45.355 --> 00:12:47.755
<v Speaker 0>can essentially, you know, have the best parts

00:12:47.755 --> 00:12:49.675
<v Speaker 0>of both worlds. Right? The written word to

00:12:49.675 --> 00:12:50.795
<v Speaker 0>contextualize

00:12:51.115 --> 00:12:52.955
<v Speaker 0>the code. And, you know, when I say

00:12:52.955 --> 00:12:55.595
<v Speaker 0>code, mean commands here too and API calls

00:12:55.595 --> 00:12:57.930
<v Speaker 0>for that matter to to get the work

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:00.250
<v Speaker 0>done. Right? To actually do the how. Right?

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:01.930
<v Speaker 0>That that is sort of, like, something that,

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.010
<v Speaker 0>like, I think is underappreciated.

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:06.250
<v Speaker 0>Right? And, like, I I feel like once

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:08.250
<v Speaker 0>you get on random to runme and then

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:09.769
<v Speaker 0>it seems like you kinda gotten over that

00:13:09.769 --> 00:13:12.024
<v Speaker 0>hump here, you kinda make that realization that,

00:13:12.024 --> 00:13:14.025
<v Speaker 0>like, now I actually have working documentation,

00:13:14.265 --> 00:13:16.745
<v Speaker 0>and I have my make targets. Right?

00:13:17.625 --> 00:13:18.185
<v Speaker 0>So

00:13:18.665 --> 00:13:20.185
<v Speaker 0>so you essentially get to this place where,

00:13:20.185 --> 00:13:21.385
<v Speaker 0>like, you know, now it's now it's one

00:13:21.385 --> 00:13:23.400
<v Speaker 0>of the same thing. It's like documentation, but

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.840
<v Speaker 0>also how you interact with the world and

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.280
<v Speaker 0>how you get your work done. Right? And

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.120
<v Speaker 0>I think that's very powerful, and and we

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.760
<v Speaker 0>are so nihilistic about documentation. Like, I mean,

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.280
<v Speaker 0>sometimes I feel like I shouldn't even start

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.880
<v Speaker 0>with the word documentation. We put people to

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.880
<v Speaker 0>you now. They're like, has never worked. Undone

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.125
<v Speaker 0>here. Goodbye. Right? And that's that's a that

00:13:38.204 --> 00:13:39.644
<v Speaker 0>that's kinda like what we wanna change. Right?

00:13:39.644 --> 00:13:41.245
<v Speaker 0>Because it doesn't have to be that way.

00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:42.524
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Definitely.

00:13:43.084 --> 00:13:45.485
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Let's say hi to Ravi and Kat.

00:13:45.485 --> 00:13:47.565
<v Speaker 1>Kat has plus one for the Ascii doc

00:13:47.565 --> 00:13:48.444
<v Speaker 1>support,

00:13:48.444 --> 00:13:49.644
<v Speaker 1>so I guess you're gonna have to ship

00:13:49.644 --> 00:13:50.365
<v Speaker 1>that now. Sorry.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:51.920
<v Speaker 1>But the

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.760
<v Speaker 1>the tides are cheap. I mean, that's it.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.760
<v Speaker 0>Kat's been putting stuff on my, you know,

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.840
<v Speaker 0>my to do list, you know, which are

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.600
<v Speaker 0>all good, good. And I'm I'm I'm trying

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.960
<v Speaker 0>to tick them off, but I think we

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:01.920
<v Speaker 0>might have to do

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.320
<v Speaker 0>during before we do Asciidoc.

00:14:05.725 --> 00:14:08.045
<v Speaker 1>Nice. Well, we're gonna get hands on in

00:14:08.045 --> 00:14:09.885
<v Speaker 1>just a few minutes. But before we do

00:14:09.885 --> 00:14:12.365
<v Speaker 1>that, I'm curious just about the the history.

00:14:12.365 --> 00:14:13.485
<v Speaker 1>Right? You you give us a bit of

00:14:13.485 --> 00:14:15.965
<v Speaker 1>background about yourself and the cloud native.

00:14:16.365 --> 00:14:18.845
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming at some point you woke up

00:14:18.845 --> 00:14:21.350
<v Speaker 1>and when I wanna solve documentation and mark

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:23.350
<v Speaker 1>that and and runme popped out of your

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:24.630
<v Speaker 1>head. Like, maybe you could just share a

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.870
<v Speaker 1>bit more about what the pain points were,

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:28.390
<v Speaker 1>why you decided to build this thing, and

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:29.670
<v Speaker 1>and how you managed to turn it into

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:30.070
<v Speaker 1>a company.

00:14:31.285 --> 00:14:32.165
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So,

00:14:32.645 --> 00:14:34.405
<v Speaker 0>it's kinda interesting because, like, you know, when

00:14:34.405 --> 00:14:36.005
<v Speaker 0>it comes to the company's trajectory, the company

00:14:36.005 --> 00:14:37.125
<v Speaker 0>actually came first.

00:14:37.605 --> 00:14:38.965
<v Speaker 0>And we did, you know, what, like, in

00:14:38.965 --> 00:14:40.405
<v Speaker 0>startup, Lan is called a pivot.

00:14:41.125 --> 00:14:42.965
<v Speaker 0>After we we, you know, sort of, like,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.560
<v Speaker 0>you know, discovered is probably a better word

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.200
<v Speaker 0>than, like, you know, created runme. And I

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.720
<v Speaker 0>I'm, like, of a big I'm a big

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.160
<v Speaker 0>believer that, like, when it comes to both

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.800
<v Speaker 0>technology and products, you discover them. You don't

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.320
<v Speaker 0>you don't build them. I mean, you you

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.295
<v Speaker 0>you hone them and you refine them, which

00:14:58.295 --> 00:14:59.654
<v Speaker 0>is in the building process.

00:15:00.055 --> 00:15:02.295
<v Speaker 0>So the company came first for two years,

00:15:02.295 --> 00:15:03.654
<v Speaker 0>and we're trying to figure out

00:15:04.055 --> 00:15:07.334
<v Speaker 0>if there's a way we can quantify,

00:15:07.654 --> 00:15:09.095
<v Speaker 0>you know, developers'

00:15:09.495 --> 00:15:11.014
<v Speaker 0>sort of activity in a way where they

00:15:11.014 --> 00:15:13.399
<v Speaker 0>can learn from their own metrics,

00:15:13.399 --> 00:15:15.640
<v Speaker 0>sort of, like almost like a health tracker,

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.320
<v Speaker 0>but, like, for yourself, not for

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.480
<v Speaker 0>I mean, definitely not for your manager. Right?

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.000
<v Speaker 0>Not for other people, but so that you

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.399
<v Speaker 0>can more or less compete with yourself. Right?

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.399
<v Speaker 0>And I think we ran into some real

00:15:25.399 --> 00:15:25.959
<v Speaker 0>issues there,

00:15:26.545 --> 00:15:28.145
<v Speaker 0>which is not even worth talking about. But,

00:15:28.145 --> 00:15:29.745
<v Speaker 0>like, we decided to sort of, like, you

00:15:29.745 --> 00:15:30.225
<v Speaker 0>know,

00:15:30.625 --> 00:15:33.425
<v Speaker 0>abandon it, I would I would say. But

00:15:33.425 --> 00:15:35.665
<v Speaker 0>we we we always were kinda, like, focused

00:15:35.665 --> 00:15:37.585
<v Speaker 0>on building on the Versus Code platform. Right?

00:15:37.585 --> 00:15:39.265
<v Speaker 0>So so runme is built on the Versus

00:15:39.265 --> 00:15:40.945
<v Speaker 0>Code platform. I think that's important to say

00:15:40.945 --> 00:15:43.820
<v Speaker 0>because the main, you know, like, application

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:47.020
<v Speaker 0>that's bundled and distributed is is is Versus

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.500
<v Speaker 0>Code desktop. Right? But, you know, there's Codespaces,

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:50.300
<v Speaker 0>GitPods,

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:51.820
<v Speaker 0>Google IDX,

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.900
<v Speaker 0>Codespaces, yada yada yada, and and Coda server.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.585
<v Speaker 0>Right? That is essentially the same relationship, you

00:15:58.585 --> 00:16:00.905
<v Speaker 0>know, all these tools have is the is

00:16:00.905 --> 00:16:03.145
<v Speaker 0>is is very much was very similar to

00:16:03.145 --> 00:16:04.345
<v Speaker 0>how Chromium

00:16:04.425 --> 00:16:07.705
<v Speaker 0>powers Chrome and Brave and I mean, without

00:16:07.705 --> 00:16:10.105
<v Speaker 0>without the UI, you know, even Edge. Right?

00:16:10.105 --> 00:16:12.190
<v Speaker 0>I mean, has the same rendering engine. And,

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:13.310
<v Speaker 0>like, you know so we so we were

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:14.750
<v Speaker 0>always, like, really focused on, like, this is

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:16.750
<v Speaker 0>a ubiquitous platform. It's kinda like building on

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:19.070
<v Speaker 0>iOS. Right? So we learned a lot, you

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:20.990
<v Speaker 0>know, from building these two years of this

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:22.510
<v Speaker 0>sort of, like, coding metrics

00:16:23.389 --> 00:16:25.885
<v Speaker 0>idea and and vision. And we learned a

00:16:25.885 --> 00:16:27.085
<v Speaker 0>lot about, you know, the ins and outs

00:16:27.085 --> 00:16:29.245
<v Speaker 0>of of Versus Code. Right? And then when

00:16:29.245 --> 00:16:31.645
<v Speaker 0>we decide, okay. Well, this this concept, we

00:16:31.645 --> 00:16:33.805
<v Speaker 0>can't get it legs. Right?

00:16:34.285 --> 00:16:36.045
<v Speaker 0>Let's let's figure out what's next. We we

00:16:36.045 --> 00:16:38.125
<v Speaker 0>kinda like my my cofounder, Adam, and I,

00:16:38.125 --> 00:16:40.560
<v Speaker 0>we're kinda introspective, and we spent a lot

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.040
<v Speaker 0>of time at Sauce Labs building, like, cloud

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.880
<v Speaker 0>infrastructure from the ground up. And when I

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.400
<v Speaker 0>say from the ground up, I really mean,

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.000
<v Speaker 0>like, data center, power density,

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.760
<v Speaker 0>you know, like like, really from the ground

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.080
<v Speaker 0>up. Not, like, you know, deploying into AWS.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.315
<v Speaker 0>I wish we it was as easy, in

00:16:54.315 --> 00:16:56.555
<v Speaker 0>your quotes, as doing that, but we had,

00:16:56.555 --> 00:16:59.115
<v Speaker 0>like, such esoteric requirements for the hardware that

00:16:59.115 --> 00:17:00.875
<v Speaker 0>we have to build our own data centers.

00:17:01.035 --> 00:17:02.715
<v Speaker 0>And, you know, in that whole process,

00:17:03.035 --> 00:17:05.275
<v Speaker 0>it's just like there's so much work that

00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:07.115
<v Speaker 0>you have to do and so many moving

00:17:07.115 --> 00:17:07.515
<v Speaker 0>pieces,

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:09.710
<v Speaker 0>and there's no TerraForm to do that for

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.069
<v Speaker 0>you. There's no I mean, at the time,

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:13.069
<v Speaker 0>was probably a grant. Right? And we just

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:14.750
<v Speaker 0>kinda, like, came back to this point of,

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:15.869
<v Speaker 0>there's no way

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:17.549
<v Speaker 0>to describe

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:19.709
<v Speaker 0>what we're doing in documentation

00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:21.549
<v Speaker 0>that doesn't match the shelf life of a

00:17:21.549 --> 00:17:23.525
<v Speaker 0>milk carton, right, where the moment you write

00:17:23.525 --> 00:17:26.244
<v Speaker 0>it, it's basically outdated. Right? So

00:17:26.405 --> 00:17:28.085
<v Speaker 0>kinda starting with a very simple idea of,

00:17:28.085 --> 00:17:30.005
<v Speaker 0>like, basically what you described earlier where it's

00:17:30.005 --> 00:17:32.645
<v Speaker 0>like, you know, there's a NPM install where

00:17:32.645 --> 00:17:34.885
<v Speaker 0>a Go gets, you know, something where Go

00:17:34.885 --> 00:17:35.605
<v Speaker 0>installs something.

00:17:36.299 --> 00:17:38.059
<v Speaker 0>In my readme, right in front of me,

00:17:38.059 --> 00:17:39.500
<v Speaker 0>fully rendered. Why can't I click a play

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.339
<v Speaker 0>button? Right? And

00:17:41.659 --> 00:17:43.659
<v Speaker 0>using that sort of, like, near simple idea

00:17:43.659 --> 00:17:46.059
<v Speaker 0>and then looking at the Versus Code platform

00:17:46.059 --> 00:17:47.980
<v Speaker 0>that essentially has APIs

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:48.940
<v Speaker 0>for extensions

00:17:50.165 --> 00:17:52.885
<v Speaker 0>to build notebooks because they essentially retrofitted the

00:17:52.885 --> 00:17:55.445
<v Speaker 0>Jupyter notebooks inside of Versus Code. We just

00:17:55.445 --> 00:17:57.524
<v Speaker 0>kinda, like, kinda connected those dots.

00:17:58.325 --> 00:17:59.925
<v Speaker 0>But before we even did that, we started

00:17:59.925 --> 00:18:01.445
<v Speaker 0>with the CLI because we were like, well,

00:18:01.445 --> 00:18:04.005
<v Speaker 0>we can parse markdown into an abstract syntax

00:18:04.005 --> 00:18:06.460
<v Speaker 0>tree and then, you know, sort of noodle

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.100
<v Speaker 0>through,

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.420
<v Speaker 0>you know, your markdown document and figure out

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.580
<v Speaker 0>what's code and what isn't and make that

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:12.460
<v Speaker 0>executable.

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:13.980
<v Speaker 0>And we shipped a little binary at the

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:15.740
<v Speaker 0>time. It was called RDME,

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.655
<v Speaker 0>like, you know, sort of like a a

00:18:17.655 --> 00:18:19.095
<v Speaker 0>shorter version of readme,

00:18:19.415 --> 00:18:21.095
<v Speaker 0>and and launched it. And I wrote a

00:18:21.095 --> 00:18:22.535
<v Speaker 0>blog post about it, and it was like

00:18:22.695 --> 00:18:24.615
<v Speaker 0>I think we dropped it on f two,

00:18:24.615 --> 00:18:27.255
<v Speaker 0>and it was, like, the highest traffic piece

00:18:27.255 --> 00:18:29.015
<v Speaker 0>for for the whole week. I mean, we're

00:18:29.015 --> 00:18:31.860
<v Speaker 0>kinda blown away. Like, interestingly,

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:34.740
<v Speaker 0>what I found was that more people

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.540
<v Speaker 0>the concept resonated more than I think the

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:39.620
<v Speaker 0>implementation because the implementation was so rough. It

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.180
<v Speaker 0>was basically an alpha prototype kind of thing.

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:43.780
<v Speaker 0>But that really kinda, like, gave us more

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:46.115
<v Speaker 0>more confidence in, like, pursuing that direction, And

00:18:46.115 --> 00:18:47.715
<v Speaker 0>I think that really crossing

00:18:47.715 --> 00:18:49.475
<v Speaker 0>over into the notebook

00:18:49.555 --> 00:18:52.035
<v Speaker 0>without leaving a CLI behind was also, like,

00:18:52.035 --> 00:18:53.075
<v Speaker 0>kinda, like, a big

00:18:54.515 --> 00:18:55.235
<v Speaker 0>evolution.

00:18:55.395 --> 00:18:57.235
<v Speaker 0>And and I wanna say, like, two months

00:18:57.235 --> 00:18:59.555
<v Speaker 0>later, we shipped something on runme.dev.

00:18:59.555 --> 00:19:01.030
<v Speaker 0>That's kinda how the website the the project

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:02.309
<v Speaker 0>website was created.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:04.710
<v Speaker 0>And we dropped it on the Internet. I

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:06.470
<v Speaker 0>I don't even remember we had someone read

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:07.990
<v Speaker 0>it, and we just got hit with a

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:10.310
<v Speaker 0>tsunami of traffic. And we somehow got on

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:11.670
<v Speaker 0>hacker views. I think we were, like, in

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:12.310
<v Speaker 0>the top 50.

00:19:13.285 --> 00:19:14.725
<v Speaker 0>And that, you know, that kinda, like, sort

00:19:14.725 --> 00:19:16.885
<v Speaker 0>of, like, kinda builds that momentum. Right?

00:19:17.285 --> 00:19:18.645
<v Speaker 0>But then you think you kinda, like, get

00:19:18.645 --> 00:19:20.485
<v Speaker 0>really high up on hacker views and everything

00:19:20.485 --> 00:19:22.805
<v Speaker 0>is easy, but, you know, it kinda just

00:19:22.805 --> 00:19:24.085
<v Speaker 0>kinda gives you a little bit of, like,

00:19:24.085 --> 00:19:25.685
<v Speaker 0>tailwind in the moment, but then you kinda,

00:19:25.685 --> 00:19:27.419
<v Speaker 0>like, get do it for it. But at

00:19:27.419 --> 00:19:28.539
<v Speaker 0>the end of the day, that's kinda, like,

00:19:28.539 --> 00:19:31.259
<v Speaker 0>the the long story almost. Right? And and

00:19:31.259 --> 00:19:32.860
<v Speaker 0>since we have done a lot of more

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:34.940
<v Speaker 0>intricate things of, like, making sure that, you

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.659
<v Speaker 0>know, we have much broader compatibility and move

00:19:37.659 --> 00:19:39.980
<v Speaker 0>away from the alpha stage, and I think

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:42.145
<v Speaker 0>the core runme is, like, a lot know,

00:19:42.145 --> 00:19:43.745
<v Speaker 0>it's not even better anymore. It's, like, fairly

00:19:43.745 --> 00:19:45.905
<v Speaker 0>stable. Right? And and but we keep layering

00:19:45.905 --> 00:19:47.585
<v Speaker 0>things on top of it. So that's kinda,

00:19:47.585 --> 00:19:50.065
<v Speaker 0>like, you know, the story there, and runme

00:19:50.065 --> 00:19:51.664
<v Speaker 0>is sort of the the technology,

00:19:51.825 --> 00:19:53.985
<v Speaker 0>the open source project, Apache

00:19:53.985 --> 00:19:56.120
<v Speaker 0>two license. And what we're trying to do

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.639
<v Speaker 0>at Stateful is then, you know, like, pull

00:19:57.639 --> 00:19:59.880
<v Speaker 0>the collaboration layer around it so that, you

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.719
<v Speaker 0>know, if you run commands, they fail.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.799
<v Speaker 0>I mean, it happens. Right? I mean, entropy

00:20:03.799 --> 00:20:05.879
<v Speaker 0>is a problem. Right? The universe is not

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.479
<v Speaker 0>regular. It expands.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.919
<v Speaker 0>And especially when you're working with, like, remotes,

00:20:11.375 --> 00:20:12.095
<v Speaker 0>clouds,

00:20:12.255 --> 00:20:14.975
<v Speaker 0>you know, there's, like from credentials to,

00:20:15.375 --> 00:20:17.295
<v Speaker 0>you know, the Internet being under the weather.

00:20:17.295 --> 00:20:20.415
<v Speaker 0>Right? Just things that you can't control. And

00:20:20.495 --> 00:20:22.895
<v Speaker 0>what we think is a is an another

00:20:22.895 --> 00:20:25.215
<v Speaker 0>clap to gap to close before we make,

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.620
<v Speaker 0>you know, something like Terraform fully deterministic is

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.380
<v Speaker 0>to just make it easier to escalate issues

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.820
<v Speaker 0>instead of, like, you know, getting on a

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.340
<v Speaker 0>Zoom call, screen sharing,

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.500
<v Speaker 0>or exchanging screenshots.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.020
<v Speaker 0>Right? Like, why can't we not have a

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.340
<v Speaker 0>high fidelity bug report with one click? Right?

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:41.005
<v Speaker 0>And that's kinda a little bit like what

00:20:41.005 --> 00:20:43.165
<v Speaker 0>Stateful is for and then, you know, doing

00:20:43.165 --> 00:20:44.445
<v Speaker 0>that in a secure way where you can

00:20:44.445 --> 00:20:46.125
<v Speaker 0>share with the team and you have all

00:20:46.125 --> 00:20:48.765
<v Speaker 0>the controls on visibility and and and sharing

00:20:48.765 --> 00:20:50.285
<v Speaker 0>and all that sort of stuff. Yeah. And

00:20:50.285 --> 00:20:51.645
<v Speaker 0>that's kinda like, you know, we're really early

00:20:51.645 --> 00:20:53.485
<v Speaker 0>on there. If anybody's interested in that, please

00:20:53.485 --> 00:20:53.965
<v Speaker 0>let me know.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.520
<v Speaker 0>You can go on stateful.com, sign up for

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.200
<v Speaker 0>it, try it out. But if you at

00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.480
<v Speaker 0>the core of your runme.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.159
<v Speaker 1>Nice.

00:21:01.559 --> 00:21:03.640
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Thank you for sharing all of that

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.960
<v Speaker 1>history and context there. And I think it's

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.880
<v Speaker 1>time to get some fingers onto keyboards and

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:10.435
<v Speaker 1>show people how runme works. So

00:21:11.075 --> 00:21:12.835
<v Speaker 1>with that, let's pop over.

00:21:13.155 --> 00:21:13.875
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm.

00:21:14.275 --> 00:21:15.075
<v Speaker 1>Here.

00:21:15.715 --> 00:21:18.755
<v Speaker 1>So you've already said the website is runme.dev.

00:21:18.915 --> 00:21:20.835
<v Speaker 1>So you can go here and get started.

00:21:20.835 --> 00:21:22.755
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna go to the getting started page.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.360
<v Speaker 1>And I guess we'll show the CLI and

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.799
<v Speaker 1>the Versus Code extension

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.320
<v Speaker 1>just so people get an understanding of what

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.560
<v Speaker 1>that, you know, what the first ten minutes

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.000
<v Speaker 1>in front of me is like.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.495
<v Speaker 1>Well, we start with it. I don't know.

00:21:36.495 --> 00:21:37.695
<v Speaker 1>What would you normally start with when you

00:21:37.695 --> 00:21:40.015
<v Speaker 1>show people it? Versus code or the CLI?

00:21:40.655 --> 00:21:42.815
<v Speaker 0>I mean, you know, it kinda probably depends

00:21:42.815 --> 00:21:44.815
<v Speaker 0>on the use case. So, I mean, like,

00:21:44.815 --> 00:21:46.975
<v Speaker 0>since you're driving and and and, you know,

00:21:46.975 --> 00:21:48.975
<v Speaker 0>you you have used runme before and you

00:21:48.975 --> 00:21:50.735
<v Speaker 0>put in this in a particular way, I'll

00:21:50.735 --> 00:21:53.110
<v Speaker 0>probably let you choose. Because I think, you

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:55.030
<v Speaker 0>know, there's, like, probably different use cases how

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:56.549
<v Speaker 0>you would arrive at runme,

00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:57.429
<v Speaker 0>and

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:59.190
<v Speaker 0>that kinda picks your journey.

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:01.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I'm gonna start with the CLI just

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.909
<v Speaker 1>because

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:03.590
<v Speaker 1>I think it's where I'm more comfortable.

00:22:04.784 --> 00:22:06.384
<v Speaker 1>Mhmm. And then we could layer you know,

00:22:06.384 --> 00:22:07.904
<v Speaker 1>I I always feel like the Versus Code

00:22:07.904 --> 00:22:10.225
<v Speaker 1>extension is like that value add, but it's

00:22:10.225 --> 00:22:11.745
<v Speaker 1>not it's not my bread and butter. The

00:22:11.745 --> 00:22:13.184
<v Speaker 1>CLI is my bread and butter. So we're

00:22:13.184 --> 00:22:13.904
<v Speaker 1>gonna start So

00:22:14.625 --> 00:22:16.304
<v Speaker 1>people could just install this. It's

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:19.169
<v Speaker 1>painless for most people, not painless for me.

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:22.130
<v Speaker 1>You can install You're you're a next OS

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:25.330
<v Speaker 0>user. Right? So caveat here. Yeah. It's painful

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:26.850
<v Speaker 1>for me because I'm on Nexus.

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:27.650
<v Speaker 1>But,

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:30.394
<v Speaker 1>you know, things are getting better.

00:22:30.635 --> 00:22:32.955
<v Speaker 1>So you can install the CLI. Brew is

00:22:32.955 --> 00:22:34.155
<v Speaker 1>probably the way that most of you are

00:22:34.155 --> 00:22:35.755
<v Speaker 1>gonna wanna get ahold of this. That's fine.

00:22:35.755 --> 00:22:38.155
<v Speaker 1>Just brew install runme. There is the Windows

00:22:38.155 --> 00:22:38.715
<v Speaker 1>one.

00:22:39.995 --> 00:22:41.675
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I mean, we're not gonna go over

00:22:41.675 --> 00:22:44.009
<v Speaker 1>the installation. It's pretty painless. I think that

00:22:44.009 --> 00:22:46.250
<v Speaker 1>installing software is pretty much a solved problem

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:47.849
<v Speaker 1>these days, except for Next.

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:50.649
<v Speaker 1>Know

00:22:51.529 --> 00:22:53.690
<v Speaker 1>solving that. Well, yeah. I'm not batching on

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:55.370
<v Speaker 0>Next. Next is the best way to install

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:56.330
<v Speaker 1>software. However,

00:22:56.794 --> 00:22:59.115
<v Speaker 1>the version of runme on the Next packages,

00:22:59.115 --> 00:23:00.154
<v Speaker 1>which is really, really old

00:23:00.794 --> 00:23:02.235
<v Speaker 1>and I did update it, but it's not

00:23:02.235 --> 00:23:03.994
<v Speaker 1>been merged yet. So alright.

00:23:05.034 --> 00:23:07.115
<v Speaker 1>But either way, we get oh, I'm in

00:23:07.115 --> 00:23:08.955
<v Speaker 1>a directory with stuff. Let's go away from

00:23:08.955 --> 00:23:09.115
<v Speaker 1>that.

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.040
<v Speaker 1>If we run runme, it's just telling us

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.800
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing here. So we could do runme

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:16.440
<v Speaker 1>help.

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.040
<v Speaker 1>And we can see the kind of main

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.200
<v Speaker 1>invocation points here. There's the two a. You

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.360
<v Speaker 1>can run individual commands and so forth. But

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.919
<v Speaker 1>it all starts with the readme.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:26.440
<v Speaker 1>And I think

00:23:26.905 --> 00:23:28.905
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna say, you know, markdown is

00:23:28.905 --> 00:23:31.385
<v Speaker 1>a better purpose anymore. It's what we have.

00:23:31.465 --> 00:23:33.705
<v Speaker 1>So we'll just create a very simple readme.

00:23:34.665 --> 00:23:38.105
<v Speaker 1>I'm

00:23:38.105 --> 00:23:39.545
<v Speaker 1>gonna keep it really simple. I hope that's

00:23:39.545 --> 00:23:40.105
<v Speaker 1>alright with you.

00:23:40.909 --> 00:23:42.350
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Yeah. Like, I mean, maybe I'll give

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:43.950
<v Speaker 0>you a little context while you're typing. Like,

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:45.950
<v Speaker 0>this is a fenced code block. Right? And

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:48.990
<v Speaker 0>there's this sort of, like, notion of attributes

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:50.750
<v Speaker 0>inside of fenced code blocks. It's, I think,

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:52.909
<v Speaker 0>part of the extended markdown standard.

00:23:53.415 --> 00:23:54.935
<v Speaker 0>And, you know, the commonly, you would put

00:23:54.935 --> 00:23:56.935
<v Speaker 0>the language. I mean, that's part of the

00:23:56.935 --> 00:23:58.455
<v Speaker 0>standard that you can say, hey. This code

00:23:58.455 --> 00:24:01.015
<v Speaker 0>block is shell or JavaScript or Python. Right?

00:24:01.095 --> 00:24:02.855
<v Speaker 0>And what we do in runme, we also

00:24:02.855 --> 00:24:04.295
<v Speaker 0>lay out other attributes,

00:24:04.295 --> 00:24:05.815
<v Speaker 0>you know, on top of that if we

00:24:05.899 --> 00:24:08.700
<v Speaker 0>wanna control certain aspects of execution. Right? But

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:11.099
<v Speaker 0>we'll get into that probably further down. But

00:24:11.259 --> 00:24:12.940
<v Speaker 0>the main idea is to use those code

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:14.779
<v Speaker 0>blocks when you wanna run code. Right? And

00:24:14.779 --> 00:24:17.820
<v Speaker 0>code could be commands or literally JavaScript,

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:19.580
<v Speaker 0>Python, any interpretive language.

00:24:20.845 --> 00:24:21.484
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:24:21.804 --> 00:24:22.524
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.

00:24:24.044 --> 00:24:25.804
<v Speaker 1>I guess what was important here for the

00:24:25.804 --> 00:24:27.885
<v Speaker 1>people watching is just it's a standard read

00:24:27.885 --> 00:24:29.804
<v Speaker 1>me. We're not actually doing anything

00:24:30.125 --> 00:24:31.004
<v Speaker 1>unique here.

00:24:31.245 --> 00:24:33.005
<v Speaker 1>This is probably what you're shipping already to

00:24:33.005 --> 00:24:35.280
<v Speaker 1>GitHub. GitHub is parsing this. It makes it

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.120
<v Speaker 1>visual, but it doesn't make it interactive. And

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.640
<v Speaker 1>that's really where runme shines.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.960
<v Speaker 1>And Mhmm. Kat wants some

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:41.840
<v Speaker 1>ASMR

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:42.960
<v Speaker 1>of my keyboard.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.360
<v Speaker 1>This is my precious. I've had this for

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.960
<v Speaker 1>a while now, and then I'm not letting

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:47.200
<v Speaker 1>it go.

00:24:49.675 --> 00:24:51.355
<v Speaker 1>I know when I'm on a stream, I

00:24:51.355 --> 00:24:53.035
<v Speaker 1>should be using, like, my really quiet

00:24:53.515 --> 00:24:55.115
<v Speaker 1>normal one, but then I just don't get

00:24:55.195 --> 00:24:56.955
<v Speaker 1>it just it doesn't bring me joy. Right?

00:24:56.955 --> 00:24:58.235
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't And also when you're not

00:24:58.235 --> 00:24:59.995
<v Speaker 0>talking, people know that you're working. Right? I

00:24:59.995 --> 00:25:01.195
<v Speaker 0>mean, it's sort of, like, kinda like when

00:25:01.195 --> 00:25:03.275
<v Speaker 0>people, you know, just say Mhmm. Mhmm. And

00:25:03.275 --> 00:25:04.380
<v Speaker 0>they're not, you know.

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:07.020
<v Speaker 0>It confirms that you're doing something.

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:10.060
<v Speaker 1>That's that's true. Yeah. But that backs against

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:11.260
<v Speaker 1>you when you're on a call with someone

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.780
<v Speaker 1>that's one to one, and I'm looking at

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.860
<v Speaker 1>them, but really I'm like, type it out.

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Type it Type it So anyway,

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:18.700
<v Speaker 1>let's not go into my terrible working habits.

00:25:20.005 --> 00:25:22.164
<v Speaker 1>So if we run runme now,

00:25:22.485 --> 00:25:24.565
<v Speaker 1>things change a little bit. We've got a

00:25:24.565 --> 00:25:26.725
<v Speaker 1>couple of what it's saying are unnamed tasks.

00:25:26.725 --> 00:25:28.405
<v Speaker 1>We'll get into that in a little bit,

00:25:28.405 --> 00:25:30.325
<v Speaker 1>but it does allow me to run and

00:25:30.325 --> 00:25:31.765
<v Speaker 1>select each of these

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:33.379
<v Speaker 1>like so.

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:38.739
<v Speaker 1>Oh, it doesn't like that. Yeah.

00:25:40.179 --> 00:25:41.700
<v Speaker 0>Also, you're on a really old version of

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.460
<v Speaker 0>runme three zero.

00:25:45.059 --> 00:25:46.179
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I don't know why it did.

00:25:49.515 --> 00:25:50.955
<v Speaker 0>I mean, my my guess is, like, that

00:25:50.955 --> 00:25:52.875
<v Speaker 0>you you are, like, on an ancient version

00:25:53.035 --> 00:25:56.475
<v Speaker 0>music. I I I am. I have downloaded

00:25:56.475 --> 00:25:57.995
<v Speaker 1>the newer ones. So this is quite an

00:25:57.995 --> 00:25:58.794
<v Speaker 1>old one.

00:25:59.675 --> 00:26:01.435
<v Speaker 0>It's probably built by Nick's. Right? Because it

00:26:01.435 --> 00:26:03.650
<v Speaker 0>has also has the the Unix epoch at

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:05.409
<v Speaker 0>zero nineteen seventies.

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:07.490
<v Speaker 1>There we go.

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Let's just kill it. I think it's it's

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:16.450
<v Speaker 1>whenever I use comma, I'm not gonna do

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:17.945
<v Speaker 1>that anymore. That's a horrible next thing that

00:26:17.945 --> 00:26:20.025
<v Speaker 1>people don't care about anyway. So we'll skip

00:26:20.025 --> 00:26:20.585
<v Speaker 1>over.

00:26:21.225 --> 00:26:23.625
<v Speaker 1>Let's modify our readme. So we've got unnamed

00:26:23.625 --> 00:26:24.664
<v Speaker 1>tasks. So

00:26:25.145 --> 00:26:25.785
<v Speaker 1>by default

00:26:26.185 --> 00:26:27.705
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is really powerful for

00:26:27.705 --> 00:26:29.545
<v Speaker 1>the people that are watching, like, if you

00:26:29.545 --> 00:26:31.945
<v Speaker 1>just have a repository with readmes, with code

00:26:31.945 --> 00:26:33.730
<v Speaker 1>blocks, those just work right out the gate.

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:35.169
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing that you need to do.

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:38.450
<v Speaker 1>But we do have the ability to annotate

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:40.049
<v Speaker 1>this. And I this this is where I

00:26:40.049 --> 00:26:40.609
<v Speaker 1>got

00:26:41.169 --> 00:26:41.730
<v Speaker 1>happy

00:26:42.049 --> 00:26:43.249
<v Speaker 1>and confused

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:44.450
<v Speaker 1>with runme,

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:46.370
<v Speaker 1>but in a a nice way, not a

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:46.850
<v Speaker 1>bad way.

00:26:47.554 --> 00:26:48.994
<v Speaker 1>Let's just call this echo.

00:26:49.875 --> 00:26:51.715
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't know you could do this.

00:26:51.715 --> 00:26:52.835
<v Speaker 1>And I says, I don't know if this

00:26:52.835 --> 00:26:54.755
<v Speaker 1>is spec compliant markdown or if that spec

00:26:54.755 --> 00:26:55.794
<v Speaker 1>is evolving.

00:26:55.795 --> 00:26:56.915
<v Speaker 1>If I mean, I don't know if people

00:26:56.915 --> 00:26:58.674
<v Speaker 1>have runme or trying to push forward that

00:26:58.674 --> 00:27:00.195
<v Speaker 1>spec. Is it a dead spec? Maybe you

00:27:00.195 --> 00:27:01.980
<v Speaker 1>can share a better context. But what are

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:03.980
<v Speaker 1>we doing here with this little code block?

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:05.179
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.260
<v Speaker 0>Right. So the so the the fence code

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:09.260
<v Speaker 0>block and I and I you know, like,

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.460
<v Speaker 0>it's kinda hard to piece a little bit

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:12.460
<v Speaker 0>together historically because, like, there's not, like, one

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.595
<v Speaker 0>authority that, like, hands down the markdown standard.

00:27:15.675 --> 00:27:16.955
<v Speaker 0>It's a little bit like how the web

00:27:16.955 --> 00:27:17.515
<v Speaker 0>works.

00:27:18.315 --> 00:27:20.635
<v Speaker 0>And, so the fence code block, I think,

00:27:20.635 --> 00:27:22.555
<v Speaker 0>was introduced because the previous notion of a

00:27:22.555 --> 00:27:24.795
<v Speaker 0>code block didn't have any annotations,

00:27:24.795 --> 00:27:25.755
<v Speaker 0>any attributes.

00:27:25.755 --> 00:27:28.000
<v Speaker 0>Right? So the idea with defense code block

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.480
<v Speaker 0>was to first encode what language it's in.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:31.440
<v Speaker 0>And

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.800
<v Speaker 0>what we've what I have noticed is that

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:35.680
<v Speaker 0>Jupiter

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.680
<v Speaker 0>as well as some other I think Jupiter

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:38.480
<v Speaker 0>mostly,

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.400
<v Speaker 0>but also Google and a couple of other

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:41.520
<v Speaker 0>markdown based tools,

00:27:42.015 --> 00:27:43.294
<v Speaker 0>they use this

00:27:43.535 --> 00:27:45.695
<v Speaker 0>these attributes. Right? So now where you where

00:27:45.695 --> 00:27:48.495
<v Speaker 0>you have name echo, it's a JSON encoded,

00:27:48.495 --> 00:27:50.495
<v Speaker 0>you know, like, sort of payload in there

00:27:50.735 --> 00:27:53.455
<v Speaker 0>that most almost every I think, like, it

00:27:53.455 --> 00:27:55.840
<v Speaker 0>might actually be part of the standard.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.559
<v Speaker 0>Will it like, every renderer will ignore. Right?

00:27:58.559 --> 00:27:59.840
<v Speaker 0>So if you render it in in Versus

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.360
<v Speaker 0>Code or in in GitHub,

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.039
<v Speaker 0>it will just not appear. Right?

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.440
<v Speaker 0>However, you know, the renderer inside of GitHub

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.200
<v Speaker 0>will obviously parse that it's shell and then

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:10.175
<v Speaker 0>sometimes apply some syntax highlighting. Right? What what

00:28:10.175 --> 00:28:11.695
<v Speaker 0>is sort of a nice side effect is

00:28:11.695 --> 00:28:14.335
<v Speaker 0>that these attributes then can optionally be used

00:28:14.335 --> 00:28:16.895
<v Speaker 0>by any form of, like, you know, markdown

00:28:16.895 --> 00:28:17.855
<v Speaker 0>processor,

00:28:17.855 --> 00:28:19.535
<v Speaker 0>you know, you well, that's a renderer or,

00:28:19.535 --> 00:28:21.055
<v Speaker 0>like, something that we do where we transform

00:28:21.055 --> 00:28:23.615
<v Speaker 0>it into a different representation, which is a

00:28:23.615 --> 00:28:24.015
<v Speaker 0>notebook.

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:25.780
<v Speaker 0>You can,

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.900
<v Speaker 0>you know, insert certain attributes that,

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:31.140
<v Speaker 0>you know our metadata, essentially. Right? Like, you

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:32.980
<v Speaker 0>you don't wanna, like, you know you know,

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:34.420
<v Speaker 0>soil your code with

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:36.980
<v Speaker 0>some extra information that really, like, you know,

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.780
<v Speaker 0>just confuses whoever is the consumer, the reader

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.425
<v Speaker 0>of it. So it gives you the ability

00:28:41.425 --> 00:28:43.825
<v Speaker 0>to, like, in encode, you know, metadata that

00:28:43.825 --> 00:28:46.385
<v Speaker 0>then, you know, informs how the downstream processing

00:28:46.385 --> 00:28:47.025
<v Speaker 0>works. Right?

00:28:47.585 --> 00:28:49.025
<v Speaker 0>What you've currently done is you've given the

00:28:49.025 --> 00:28:50.145
<v Speaker 0>code block a name.

00:28:50.625 --> 00:28:52.625
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And that that's what like I said,

00:28:52.625 --> 00:28:53.585
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things that I really

00:28:53.585 --> 00:28:55.330
<v Speaker 1>like because I played with a lot of

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:58.210
<v Speaker 1>tools to try to make documentation 11. And

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:00.770
<v Speaker 1>what they they tend to do is, like,

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:03.649
<v Speaker 1>enforce some sort of hierarchy for headings or

00:29:03.649 --> 00:29:05.090
<v Speaker 1>comments within

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:07.515
<v Speaker 1>the code block. Right. And and I feel

00:29:07.515 --> 00:29:09.435
<v Speaker 0>We don't wanna do that. I don't want

00:29:09.435 --> 00:29:11.675
<v Speaker 1>to I I feel like that's it's pollution.

00:29:11.675 --> 00:29:13.515
<v Speaker 1>Right? It's it's detracting from the value of

00:29:13.515 --> 00:29:15.755
<v Speaker 1>the documentation because developers are what actually see

00:29:15.755 --> 00:29:16.395
<v Speaker 1>this.

00:29:16.555 --> 00:29:18.315
<v Speaker 1>And what I loved and don't expect with

00:29:18.315 --> 00:29:19.035
<v Speaker 1>us,

00:29:19.275 --> 00:29:22.875
<v Speaker 1>well, JSON payload after the language is that

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:24.660
<v Speaker 1>it is stripped out by GitHub renderer, etcetera.

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:27.380
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't it doesn't sophisticate what I'm trying

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:29.620
<v Speaker 1>to tell anyone looking at documentation that they

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:31.780
<v Speaker 1>haven't come across runme yet. Right. So yeah.

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:32.980
<v Speaker 0>And what what we've done is, like, we

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:34.980
<v Speaker 0>we default to JSON, but if you could

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:35.860
<v Speaker 0>also use

00:29:36.755 --> 00:29:38.595
<v Speaker 0>essentially, like, HTML attributes.

00:29:38.595 --> 00:29:40.595
<v Speaker 0>You know? It's, like, literally pretend like it's

00:29:40.595 --> 00:29:42.434
<v Speaker 0>an attribute of an HTML tag. I think

00:29:42.434 --> 00:29:45.634
<v Speaker 0>that's what the initial spec has. You you

00:29:45.634 --> 00:29:46.754
<v Speaker 0>still have to do the

00:29:47.394 --> 00:29:49.714
<v Speaker 0>the the curly braces. And,

00:29:50.274 --> 00:29:52.760
<v Speaker 0>actually, it doesn't do it doesn't do quotes.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:54.200
<v Speaker 0>Right? And by the way, you don't have

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.799
<v Speaker 0>to do the the quotes on the on

00:29:55.799 --> 00:29:56.999
<v Speaker 0>the beginning and the end.

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.200
<v Speaker 0>A what?

00:29:58.679 --> 00:30:01.480
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So this will work. Yeah. And, yeah,

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.384
<v Speaker 0>and and this will work too. So, you

00:30:04.384 --> 00:30:05.985
<v Speaker 0>know, like, what we've noticed is that the

00:30:05.985 --> 00:30:07.585
<v Speaker 0>the spec allows you to, like, use your

00:30:07.585 --> 00:30:09.585
<v Speaker 0>your custom form of encoding, and we default

00:30:09.585 --> 00:30:11.424
<v Speaker 0>to JSON because it's just a little it's

00:30:11.424 --> 00:30:12.304
<v Speaker 0>more readable.

00:30:12.705 --> 00:30:14.945
<v Speaker 0>I have, however, noticed that Google doesn't like

00:30:14.945 --> 00:30:17.019
<v Speaker 0>it, so we'll probably just continue.

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:18.940
<v Speaker 0>Like, when we when we parse it, we'll

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:20.059
<v Speaker 0>probably write it back in the way we

00:30:20.059 --> 00:30:22.460
<v Speaker 0>parsed it instead of always forcing in JSON,

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:24.380
<v Speaker 0>which is what currently happens. But, yes, that

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:25.019
<v Speaker 0>should work.

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.980
<v Speaker 1>Alright. God. I didn't know that. That's pretty

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:30.059
<v Speaker 1>cool. Let's see what happens if we run

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.345
<v Speaker 0>I mean, if if you're on you know,

00:30:31.345 --> 00:30:32.465
<v Speaker 0>the the the one thing I will say

00:30:32.465 --> 00:30:33.825
<v Speaker 0>is the caveat might be that you're on

00:30:33.825 --> 00:30:36.225
<v Speaker 0>three zero two. Your old version might be

00:30:36.225 --> 00:30:36.945
<v Speaker 0>too old.

00:30:37.985 --> 00:30:39.664
<v Speaker 1>No. It's it's picked it up. We've got

00:30:39.664 --> 00:30:41.264
<v Speaker 1>echo and we've got Oh, yeah. Right. We've

00:30:41.264 --> 00:30:41.904
<v Speaker 1>got really

00:30:42.865 --> 00:30:45.490
<v Speaker 1>alright. Nice. Let's I'm not won't bother running

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:47.970
<v Speaker 1>those again because those are pretty dull and

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:49.890
<v Speaker 1>we've already seen this now. So let's remove

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:50.450
<v Speaker 1>this.

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:53.410
<v Speaker 1>But obviously, our code blocks can get quite

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:54.129
<v Speaker 1>chunky.

00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:57.250
<v Speaker 1>So let's say we wanna do an l

00:30:57.250 --> 00:30:59.575
<v Speaker 1>s, a p s. I know these are

00:30:59.575 --> 00:31:03.735
<v Speaker 1>horribly contrived commands, but we'll

00:31:03.735 --> 00:31:05.974
<v Speaker 1>do bash dash c echo

00:31:06.294 --> 00:31:07.174
<v Speaker 1>hello.

00:31:07.335 --> 00:31:09.575
<v Speaker 1>Eventually get back down to hello world.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.200
<v Speaker 1>So, yeah, not realistic.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:13.760
<v Speaker 1>However,

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.480
<v Speaker 1>when we're presented with this, one of the

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:17.920
<v Speaker 1>things that I also really like about this

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.000
<v Speaker 1>product is that we have the space expand

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
<v Speaker 1>command, which will actually drop down and show

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.760
<v Speaker 1>me everything that I am going to run.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.794
<v Speaker 1>And it's just such a simple thing, but

00:31:26.795 --> 00:31:27.995
<v Speaker 1>very, very cool.

00:31:28.475 --> 00:31:30.315
<v Speaker 1>And we can run that, and we get

00:31:30.315 --> 00:31:32.875
<v Speaker 1>hello, which is nice. Yep. And to to

00:31:32.875 --> 00:31:34.075
<v Speaker 0>add and I I can maybe show this

00:31:34.075 --> 00:31:35.755
<v Speaker 0>later in the newer version, we will also

00:31:35.995 --> 00:31:37.515
<v Speaker 0>if there's a preceding paragraph,

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:40.589
<v Speaker 0>we will show a a sort of teaser

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:42.749
<v Speaker 0>of that paragraph after the commands.

00:31:43.309 --> 00:31:45.230
<v Speaker 0>So it it kinda, like, contextualizes.

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:46.350
<v Speaker 0>You know, if it says echo, it could

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:48.669
<v Speaker 0>say, like, you know, prince hello world. Right?

00:31:48.669 --> 00:31:50.429
<v Speaker 0>I mean, it probably doesn't need that form

00:31:50.429 --> 00:31:53.205
<v Speaker 0>of documentation because it's obvious, but, like, with

00:31:53.205 --> 00:31:55.605
<v Speaker 0>more complex commands or something like

00:31:55.845 --> 00:31:57.205
<v Speaker 0>make deploy,

00:31:57.445 --> 00:31:59.605
<v Speaker 0>right, you might wanna, like, add what it

00:31:59.605 --> 00:32:02.245
<v Speaker 0>actually deploys. Right? And You mean like this?

00:32:02.245 --> 00:32:02.485
<v Speaker 1>And it

00:32:03.765 --> 00:32:05.605
<v Speaker 0>yeah. Like, if you have a preceding paragraph.

00:32:05.605 --> 00:32:06.804
<v Speaker 0>So if you wrote just like

00:32:07.365 --> 00:32:08.005
<v Speaker 0>yeah. Exactly.

00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:13.570
<v Speaker 0>But you have to be on a on

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:14.529
<v Speaker 0>a later version

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:16.450
<v Speaker 0>for that to be displayed.

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:17.490
<v Speaker 1>I have one.

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:22.930
<v Speaker 0>That does not look like a latest version

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:23.410
<v Speaker 0>to me.

00:32:24.664 --> 00:32:26.105
<v Speaker 0>I I think, you know, like, your your

00:32:26.105 --> 00:32:28.025
<v Speaker 0>build system, your next probably, like, is tricking

00:32:28.025 --> 00:32:28.585
<v Speaker 0>you.

00:32:29.544 --> 00:32:31.225
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Well, I'll let you show the cool

00:32:31.225 --> 00:32:32.585
<v Speaker 1>stuff then. I'll I'll just show what I

00:32:32.585 --> 00:32:34.265
<v Speaker 1>can. But, you know, the fundamentals are not

00:32:34.265 --> 00:32:36.345
<v Speaker 0>different. Right? It's we we've just done a

00:32:36.345 --> 00:32:38.184
<v Speaker 0>little bit more, you know, like, work on

00:32:38.184 --> 00:32:40.089
<v Speaker 0>refining the the user experience.

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:42.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Someone's

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:44.009
<v Speaker 1>at my door, but I'm gonna just ignore

00:32:44.009 --> 00:32:44.570
<v Speaker 1>that.

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:48.250
<v Speaker 1>Now something that I only discovered yesterday,

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:49.690
<v Speaker 1>and I promise you, I've been using runme

00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:51.370
<v Speaker 1>for weeks, is that you get to runme

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:53.129
<v Speaker 1>list, which just throws them out like that.

00:32:53.129 --> 00:32:54.809
<v Speaker 1>So and there's that description, which is cool.

00:32:55.715 --> 00:32:58.035
<v Speaker 0>Right. Right. And that description is basically then

00:32:58.035 --> 00:32:59.395
<v Speaker 0>also showing up in the in the t

00:32:59.395 --> 00:33:00.995
<v Speaker 0>y. It's the it's the same idea.

00:33:01.795 --> 00:33:04.034
<v Speaker 0>One thing I I do wanna mention because

00:33:04.355 --> 00:33:05.715
<v Speaker 0>I think you have pointed out, like, a

00:33:05.715 --> 00:33:07.154
<v Speaker 0>very important feature is

00:33:07.395 --> 00:33:08.515
<v Speaker 0>naming code blocks.

00:33:09.289 --> 00:33:11.370
<v Speaker 0>By default, the code blocks are not named.

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:13.210
<v Speaker 0>They are being hidden. And and the idea

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:15.210
<v Speaker 0>here is kinda, like, to create a public

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:17.129
<v Speaker 0>interface in the CLI.

00:33:17.289 --> 00:33:19.609
<v Speaker 0>So, like, you you the ones that you

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:20.409
<v Speaker 0>name,

00:33:20.649 --> 00:33:22.010
<v Speaker 0>you're basically exporting.

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:23.450
<v Speaker 0>You know, if you're a program on the

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:24.330
<v Speaker 0>export function

00:33:24.934 --> 00:33:27.335
<v Speaker 0>where you make it public, you oftentimes, you

00:33:27.335 --> 00:33:28.775
<v Speaker 0>know, like, mark that as, like, this is

00:33:28.775 --> 00:33:30.054
<v Speaker 0>my public interface.

00:33:30.295 --> 00:33:31.895
<v Speaker 0>So it's leaned, like, you know, on that

00:33:31.895 --> 00:33:34.054
<v Speaker 0>same idea that you can give an entry

00:33:34.054 --> 00:33:36.375
<v Speaker 0>point that is more narrowed down. Right? So

00:33:36.375 --> 00:33:37.895
<v Speaker 0>that that you don't overwhelm,

00:33:37.895 --> 00:33:39.655
<v Speaker 0>you know, people that come to your readme,

00:33:39.655 --> 00:33:40.730
<v Speaker 0>to your documentation

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:43.450
<v Speaker 0>with all the code blocks that are possibly

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:44.570
<v Speaker 0>available. Right?

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:46.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:48.010
<v Speaker 1>Cool.

00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Let's run help. So

00:33:52.245 --> 00:33:54.245
<v Speaker 1>the I mean, I guess we should show

00:33:54.245 --> 00:33:57.045
<v Speaker 1>Versus code. Right? But what we've essentially shown

00:33:57.045 --> 00:33:59.525
<v Speaker 1>is the interactive two, which allows us to

00:33:59.525 --> 00:34:00.884
<v Speaker 1>select commands.

00:34:01.125 --> 00:34:02.965
<v Speaker 1>We've done less and we've done run.

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:06.690
<v Speaker 1>There's the format to a canonical

00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:08.929
<v Speaker 1>format, which I've never run before. I don't

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:10.290
<v Speaker 1>know what that does, so maybe we can

00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:11.250
<v Speaker 1>get into that.

00:34:11.890 --> 00:34:13.969
<v Speaker 1>And you offer shell completion, which I didn't

00:34:13.969 --> 00:34:15.250
<v Speaker 1>know either. So,

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:17.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean, my life could be a lot

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:19.250
<v Speaker 1>easier even after this session, which I'm already

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:21.204
<v Speaker 1>excited about. So. Well, you know, it's all

00:34:21.204 --> 00:34:23.445
<v Speaker 0>about education. Right? So we all learn, and

00:34:23.445 --> 00:34:24.725
<v Speaker 0>I learn from this too.

00:34:25.045 --> 00:34:25.525
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm.

00:34:25.925 --> 00:34:27.364
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So if you wanted want me to

00:34:27.364 --> 00:34:29.364
<v Speaker 0>quickly say a word on format.

00:34:30.244 --> 00:34:31.765
<v Speaker 0>So format is essentially,

00:34:31.925 --> 00:34:33.525
<v Speaker 0>you know, it prices all your markdown,

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.719
<v Speaker 0>sort of, like, runs it, you know, like,

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:37.960
<v Speaker 0>ingested into an abstract syntax tree and then

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.280
<v Speaker 0>renders it from there. So what what will

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.440
<v Speaker 0>happen is, you know, for example, if you

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.000
<v Speaker 0>had,

00:34:44.119 --> 00:34:45.320
<v Speaker 0>you know, irregulars

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:47.080
<v Speaker 0>in, like, how, you know, your

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.945
<v Speaker 0>attributes are, you know, encoded in your fence

00:34:49.945 --> 00:34:52.505
<v Speaker 0>code blocks, it will normalize that to all

00:34:52.505 --> 00:34:54.984
<v Speaker 0>JSON. Right? So it's it's basically almost kinda

00:34:54.984 --> 00:34:57.545
<v Speaker 0>like, you know, take take an existing markdown

00:34:57.545 --> 00:34:58.505
<v Speaker 0>code base,

00:34:58.905 --> 00:35:01.545
<v Speaker 0>and then you can run it through a

00:35:01.545 --> 00:35:04.619
<v Speaker 0>c deserialization and a serialization step and write

00:35:04.619 --> 00:35:05.260
<v Speaker 0>it back.

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:07.819
<v Speaker 0>And what that will do, especially when you

00:35:07.819 --> 00:35:09.819
<v Speaker 0>get started on runme, is, like, runme is

00:35:09.819 --> 00:35:11.260
<v Speaker 0>really like, we spend a lot of time

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:13.019
<v Speaker 0>making it so that we change your markdown

00:35:13.019 --> 00:35:13.900
<v Speaker 0>minimally,

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.140
<v Speaker 0>but there are certain things that people do

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:18.795
<v Speaker 0>in markdown that is really difficult parse into

00:35:18.795 --> 00:35:21.675
<v Speaker 0>a linear representation like a notebook and then

00:35:21.675 --> 00:35:24.954
<v Speaker 0>reconstruct. And, for example, like, what lists inside

00:35:24.954 --> 00:35:26.635
<v Speaker 0>of, like, on what are lists inside of

00:35:26.795 --> 00:35:28.555
<v Speaker 0>and then having code blocks inside of that

00:35:28.555 --> 00:35:31.190
<v Speaker 0>is just a little difficult. Right? I mean,

00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:32.869
<v Speaker 0>like, you know, preserving that information and then

00:35:32.869 --> 00:35:35.109
<v Speaker 0>reconstructing it, especially, you know, since you also

00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:36.390
<v Speaker 0>can edit notebooks.

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:38.630
<v Speaker 0>Right? So, you know, this is a long

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:40.549
<v Speaker 0>way of saying we kinda, like, get ahead.

00:35:40.549 --> 00:35:41.829
<v Speaker 0>You can run the command. You could do

00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:43.509
<v Speaker 0>that the first thing if you, like, deciding

00:35:43.509 --> 00:35:45.725
<v Speaker 0>to implement this in your repo. And then

00:35:45.725 --> 00:35:47.405
<v Speaker 0>the diffs that come after are, like, extra

00:35:47.405 --> 00:35:49.085
<v Speaker 0>minimal. Right? Because they're, like, really just the

00:35:49.085 --> 00:35:50.445
<v Speaker 0>edits that you're making and not some sort

00:35:50.445 --> 00:35:52.925
<v Speaker 0>of, like just because more you know, runme

00:35:52.925 --> 00:35:55.005
<v Speaker 0>is slightly opinionated in the way it run

00:35:55.085 --> 00:35:55.965
<v Speaker 0>writes markdown.

00:35:56.365 --> 00:35:58.765
<v Speaker 0>Obviously, you know, we try to be as

00:35:58.765 --> 00:36:01.490
<v Speaker 0>accommodating as possible within, like, those constraints. Right?

00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:03.330
<v Speaker 0>And that's what the format command is for.

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Ah, nice.

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:07.329
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Let's do one more thing on the

00:36:07.329 --> 00:36:08.849
<v Speaker 1>the CLI and then we'll pop this open

00:36:08.849 --> 00:36:11.329
<v Speaker 1>in Versus Code. So now that we know

00:36:11.329 --> 00:36:13.490
<v Speaker 1>from your chat earlier on that the original

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:15.565
<v Speaker 1>name was r d m r d m

00:36:15.565 --> 00:36:17.245
<v Speaker 1>e. Right? Mhmm. Yes.

00:36:18.365 --> 00:36:18.845
<v Speaker 1>Know,

00:36:19.645 --> 00:36:22.125
<v Speaker 1>open source projects particularly, they like to have

00:36:22.125 --> 00:36:25.245
<v Speaker 1>a readme that is for users of the

00:36:25.245 --> 00:36:27.725
<v Speaker 1>project. Right? And then, typically, you'd have some

00:36:27.725 --> 00:36:29.960
<v Speaker 1>sort of contributing

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:31.800
<v Speaker 1>dot m d,

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.680
<v Speaker 1>which could have more documentation.

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.119
<v Speaker 1>So I just wanna show that this works

00:36:38.119 --> 00:36:41.720
<v Speaker 1>across multiple files and directories and whatever. So

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:42.359
<v Speaker 1>contributing,

00:36:43.674 --> 00:36:45.195
<v Speaker 1>and I'll name it as well.

00:36:45.674 --> 00:36:47.675
<v Speaker 1>Do I need the braces for this format?

00:36:49.434 --> 00:36:51.755
<v Speaker 0>Yep. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That's that's just to

00:36:51.755 --> 00:36:52.795
<v Speaker 0>terminate the

00:36:53.115 --> 00:36:54.715
<v Speaker 0>all the attributes. Right?

00:36:56.234 --> 00:36:57.035
<v Speaker 1>And I see it.

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh, come on, New Shell. You don't like

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.040
<v Speaker 1>dash p?

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:08.920
<v Speaker 1>That was a horrible way to do it,

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:10.875
<v Speaker 1>but it it'll work. And I'll call that.

00:37:10.875 --> 00:37:12.635
<v Speaker 1>I mean, the markdown name, as far as

00:37:12.635 --> 00:37:14.635
<v Speaker 1>I know, doesn't actually mean anything, so I'm

00:37:14.635 --> 00:37:15.995
<v Speaker 1>gonna call it arbitrary.

00:37:17.275 --> 00:37:19.035
<v Speaker 1>And then we'll have another shell.

00:37:19.275 --> 00:37:21.355
<v Speaker 1>And then we'll talk about other things besides

00:37:21.355 --> 00:37:22.715
<v Speaker 1>shell because I don't know the answer to

00:37:22.715 --> 00:37:25.115
<v Speaker 1>that and I am curious. So Mhmm. We'll

00:37:25.115 --> 00:37:26.450
<v Speaker 1>call this nest ed.

00:37:27.089 --> 00:37:29.970
<v Speaker 1>It's just as echo nested. Okay. So we've

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:32.049
<v Speaker 1>got a contributing file. We've got a deeply

00:37:32.049 --> 00:37:34.690
<v Speaker 1>nested world dot m d. All our tasks

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:37.010
<v Speaker 1>are named. We run this

00:37:37.569 --> 00:37:40.930
<v Speaker 1>and we have nested here and contrib here.

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:42.985
<v Speaker 1>So it's like it scans

00:37:42.985 --> 00:37:45.865
<v Speaker 1>everything below my current directory, and I think

00:37:45.945 --> 00:37:47.385
<v Speaker 1>please correct me if I'm wrong. If we're

00:37:47.385 --> 00:37:49.705
<v Speaker 1>in a GET repository, it scans the entire

00:37:49.705 --> 00:37:50.585
<v Speaker 1>repository

00:37:50.585 --> 00:37:53.385
<v Speaker 1>for tasks. Right? Correct. Yeah.

00:37:54.105 --> 00:37:55.305
<v Speaker 0>So so the way it works, it will

00:37:55.305 --> 00:37:56.744
<v Speaker 0>it will honor your git ignore

00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.339
<v Speaker 0>just so, you know, like, if you, for

00:37:59.339 --> 00:38:00.460
<v Speaker 0>example, have, like,

00:38:00.859 --> 00:38:03.420
<v Speaker 0>vendors like, node modules, right, like, the same

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:05.180
<v Speaker 0>directory, it will skip all of those.

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:07.020
<v Speaker 0>But, yeah, we'll traverse the whole tree and

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:09.340
<v Speaker 0>then and then identify markdown files,

00:38:09.579 --> 00:38:11.579
<v Speaker 0>parse them all, and then and then glob

00:38:11.579 --> 00:38:13.020
<v Speaker 0>them, so, you know, so to speak, together.

00:38:14.055 --> 00:38:16.695
<v Speaker 0>But then also filter out all the unnamed

00:38:16.695 --> 00:38:19.095
<v Speaker 0>task unless you hit you right now. Right?

00:38:19.095 --> 00:38:20.455
<v Speaker 0>And but I I don't think you probably

00:38:20.214 --> 00:38:21.895
<v Speaker 0>I don't know how to do Yeah. Yeah.

00:38:21.895 --> 00:38:23.575
<v Speaker 0>So it's it's the same thing. But that

00:38:23.575 --> 00:38:25.095
<v Speaker 0>way, you know, you kinda and and you're

00:38:25.095 --> 00:38:26.455
<v Speaker 0>right. If you're, like if you're deeper down

00:38:26.455 --> 00:38:28.135
<v Speaker 0>in the directory, it will actually walk up

00:38:28.135 --> 00:38:30.320
<v Speaker 0>and check if it's a git repository.

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.240
<v Speaker 0>And that's this is behavior that you can

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:34.240
<v Speaker 0>change, and I know that you you opinionated

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.240
<v Speaker 0>about them. I I agree in mono repos.

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.040
<v Speaker 0>That makes sense.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:39.200
<v Speaker 0>But the idea really is for you to

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.720
<v Speaker 0>make it a no brainer

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:41.840
<v Speaker 0>to run,

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.640
<v Speaker 0>you know, like, important commands irrespective of where

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.135
<v Speaker 0>you are. Right? Even if you do runme

00:38:46.135 --> 00:38:49.015
<v Speaker 0>run and then specify the name, it will

00:38:49.015 --> 00:38:51.335
<v Speaker 0>run from any directory. It will always anchor

00:38:51.335 --> 00:38:53.174
<v Speaker 0>the current working directory based on where the

00:38:53.174 --> 00:38:55.894
<v Speaker 0>file is. Right? So that's just for convenience

00:38:55.894 --> 00:38:57.894
<v Speaker 0>so you don't get, like, lost in in

00:38:57.894 --> 00:38:58.855
<v Speaker 0>the directory tree.

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:00.890
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:03.050
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So I hadn't really appreciated

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:05.770
<v Speaker 1>that. So now I'm curious what happens and

00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:07.370
<v Speaker 1>sorry. I'm gonna go off track for just

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:08.890
<v Speaker 1>a minute. Right? So

00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:10.970
<v Speaker 1>let's have echo.

00:39:11.415 --> 00:39:14.295
<v Speaker 1>We'll call this echo button nested, and I'm

00:39:14.295 --> 00:39:15.655
<v Speaker 1>gonna give it the same name.

00:39:15.975 --> 00:39:17.975
<v Speaker 1>How does it handle that then? Does it

00:39:17.975 --> 00:39:19.655
<v Speaker 1>does the anchoring to the

00:39:20.535 --> 00:39:21.495
<v Speaker 1>this directory?

00:39:22.935 --> 00:39:23.975
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:25.360
<v Speaker 0>when you have

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.440
<v Speaker 0>well, so that this you know, this old

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.680
<v Speaker 0>version, so I'm not entirely sure. Oh, in

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:31.600
<v Speaker 0>three point zero. But what will happen is,

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.600
<v Speaker 0>like, if you have you know, if you

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.440
<v Speaker 0>use a TOI and you have two

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.974
<v Speaker 0>tasks that have the same name, both of

00:39:37.974 --> 00:39:39.495
<v Speaker 0>them will show up. They will just have,

00:39:40.695 --> 00:39:43.255
<v Speaker 0>their file that's associated with is always next

00:39:43.255 --> 00:39:45.255
<v Speaker 0>to it. If you do it runme run,

00:39:45.255 --> 00:39:46.615
<v Speaker 0>it will just say, like, hey. I found

00:39:46.615 --> 00:39:48.295
<v Speaker 0>two. Pick the one you want.

00:39:49.494 --> 00:39:51.015
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Yeah. So

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:53.140
<v Speaker 1>from here, we can select the echo that

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:54.980
<v Speaker 1>we want. Mhmm. And then from If you

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:56.820
<v Speaker 0>did run me run me run and then

00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:59.140
<v Speaker 0>type echo, I think it should, you know,

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:01.300
<v Speaker 0>prompt you to yeah. Nice.

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:01.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:40:03.795 --> 00:40:04.515
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:40:04.755 --> 00:40:05.635
<v Speaker 1>Very cool.

00:40:06.675 --> 00:40:07.315
<v Speaker 1>Now

00:40:08.435 --> 00:40:10.675
<v Speaker 1>I've not tried this before and I don't

00:40:10.675 --> 00:40:11.954
<v Speaker 1>know if this is a dead end, but

00:40:11.954 --> 00:40:13.555
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna ask. Does

00:40:13.555 --> 00:40:14.835
<v Speaker 1>runme support

00:40:14.835 --> 00:40:17.715
<v Speaker 1>extra languages on the Fence code block?

00:40:17.954 --> 00:40:19.315
<v Speaker 1>Can I do

00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:21.070
<v Speaker 1>Python?

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:24.350
<v Speaker 0>You you should be able to. Again, caveat

00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:25.390
<v Speaker 0>is, like, I don't know if it will

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:27.070
<v Speaker 0>work with the three point o version.

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:30.910
<v Speaker 0>Because, like, that's, like, you know, we have

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:31.950
<v Speaker 0>three eight now.

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:35.470
<v Speaker 0>We did release a feature that we call

00:40:34.665 --> 00:40:36.985
<v Speaker 0>sheeting. Right? I like this leaned on

00:40:37.225 --> 00:40:37.945
<v Speaker 0>how

00:40:38.665 --> 00:40:40.825
<v Speaker 0>the shell handles it. So what we do

00:40:40.825 --> 00:40:43.065
<v Speaker 0>is, like, when you use Python, JavaScript, anything

00:40:43.065 --> 00:40:44.105
<v Speaker 0>that's interpreted,

00:40:44.345 --> 00:40:46.985
<v Speaker 0>we we we basically look for a binary.

00:40:46.985 --> 00:40:48.265
<v Speaker 0>Right? And we we kinda have a map

00:40:48.425 --> 00:40:50.859
<v Speaker 0>mapping list there where, you for Python, we

00:40:50.859 --> 00:40:52.780
<v Speaker 0>look for binary called Python three. Right? And

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:54.300
<v Speaker 0>then if we don't find that, we look

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.380
<v Speaker 0>for Python two. Right?

00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.500
<v Speaker 0>And then, yeah, for for Dino, use Dino.

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.660
<v Speaker 0>You can also do TS for TypeScript, and

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:02.619
<v Speaker 0>then we will attempt

00:41:03.025 --> 00:41:03.905
<v Speaker 0>the different

00:41:04.225 --> 00:41:06.785
<v Speaker 0>TypeScript run times. Right? Ah.

00:41:08.785 --> 00:41:09.985
<v Speaker 1>Do I have Python?

00:41:10.145 --> 00:41:12.945
<v Speaker 1>No. I had Dano. Alright. That'll do.

00:41:13.905 --> 00:41:17.265
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. But I think you might be

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:18.130
<v Speaker 0>too many releases behind. But, like, you know,

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:19.970
<v Speaker 0>may maybe just try and see what happens.

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:22.130
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Like, think you're too many Oh, I

00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:23.890
<v Speaker 1>did name them. That's what it is.

00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:26.930
<v Speaker 0>Oh, okay. Cool. If I show unnamed now

00:41:29.445 --> 00:41:31.605
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Got them. Okay.

00:41:31.605 --> 00:41:33.765
<v Speaker 1>There's demo. Deno log demo. And

00:41:34.325 --> 00:41:36.165
<v Speaker 1>this is the Python one. So

00:41:37.285 --> 00:41:39.445
<v Speaker 1>ah. Yeah. Okay. It it will it will

00:41:39.445 --> 00:41:41.125
<v Speaker 0>work in in 3.8.

00:41:41.589 --> 00:41:42.790
<v Speaker 0>But, like, in a in a in a

00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:44.950
<v Speaker 0>much more like, 03/30 is old.

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:47.109
<v Speaker 0>I think we're talking, like, you know, like,

00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:48.390
<v Speaker 0>almost a year old.

00:41:48.869 --> 00:41:51.349
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Sorry for my my very old version.

00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:53.190
<v Speaker 1>But, you know It's it's okay. I I'll

00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:54.710
<v Speaker 1>let you stick your hands on your keyboard

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:56.470
<v Speaker 1>very, very soon. I will take I was

00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:57.935
<v Speaker 0>gonna say I I can show that. But

00:41:58.095 --> 00:41:59.855
<v Speaker 0>yeah. So so, you know, just to close

00:41:59.855 --> 00:42:00.815
<v Speaker 0>the loop there,

00:42:01.855 --> 00:42:04.015
<v Speaker 0>there's a default mapping list. Right? And it

00:42:04.015 --> 00:42:06.335
<v Speaker 0>it it looks in your path, but there's

00:42:06.335 --> 00:42:08.495
<v Speaker 0>also, an attribute. And it's easier to do

00:42:08.495 --> 00:42:09.935
<v Speaker 0>this in Versus Code because you can kinda

00:42:09.935 --> 00:42:10.975
<v Speaker 0>get a little list of them where you

00:42:10.975 --> 00:42:13.089
<v Speaker 0>can set the custom interpreter. Right? So if

00:42:13.089 --> 00:42:13.810
<v Speaker 0>you had

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:15.650
<v Speaker 0>some some language,

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:17.730
<v Speaker 0>you know, like, that you created yourself,

00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:20.690
<v Speaker 0>you can associate a cell with that interpreter,

00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:22.450
<v Speaker 0>and it will just run it with using

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:23.490
<v Speaker 0>your custom interpreter.

00:42:24.845 --> 00:42:27.805
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Well, I have opened in Versus Code.

00:42:27.885 --> 00:42:29.724
<v Speaker 1>So this is the the same readme that

00:42:29.724 --> 00:42:30.925
<v Speaker 1>we were working

00:42:31.325 --> 00:42:32.765
<v Speaker 1>against. Right? So

00:42:33.325 --> 00:42:34.525
<v Speaker 0>So if you hit the play button on

00:42:34.525 --> 00:42:34.845
<v Speaker 0>Deno

00:42:35.404 --> 00:42:36.765
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure if Deno works. You might

00:42:36.765 --> 00:42:37.965
<v Speaker 0>have to do TypeScript.

00:42:38.605 --> 00:42:40.550
<v Speaker 0>Because, like, at the end of the day,

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:42.310
<v Speaker 0>Dino is TypeScript.

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:45.030
<v Speaker 0>I know that Dino.log is the Dino flavor

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:47.350
<v Speaker 0>of, I guess, TypeScript you could call it.

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:50.310
<v Speaker 0>So, yeah, that probably won't work.

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:51.350
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So,

00:42:52.005 --> 00:42:54.244
<v Speaker 1>okay, let's start with this simple example. Right?

00:42:54.244 --> 00:42:55.605
<v Speaker 1>Just and then we'll talk about how we

00:42:55.605 --> 00:42:58.244
<v Speaker 1>configure tasks. So Mhmm. This

00:42:58.484 --> 00:42:59.925
<v Speaker 1>one here is a standard

00:43:00.164 --> 00:43:01.845
<v Speaker 1>shell exec. We had to play but

00:43:05.830 --> 00:43:08.070
<v Speaker 1>What is that? What have I done? Oh,

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:09.830
<v Speaker 1>I know what this is. This is me.

00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:10.390
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:18.550
<v Speaker 1>Not only am I running next, but I

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:19.510
<v Speaker 1>use new shell.

00:43:20.645 --> 00:43:21.445
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

00:43:22.165 --> 00:43:24.645
<v Speaker 0>are you it's it's it's actually dashes, not,

00:43:25.365 --> 00:43:26.724
<v Speaker 0>you know, like, not the way you turn

00:43:26.724 --> 00:43:27.845
<v Speaker 1>it from there. Yeah.

00:43:30.565 --> 00:43:31.285
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.

00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:35.700
<v Speaker 1>Rust backtrace. Why is it running Rust?

00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:38.100
<v Speaker 1>That's crashing my shell now.

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:44.500
<v Speaker 1>I should I I should just stop playing

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:46.900
<v Speaker 1>with new tools. That's that's the problem.

00:43:47.555 --> 00:43:48.995
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I mean, the the problem with with

00:43:48.995 --> 00:43:50.275
<v Speaker 0>broad compatible

00:43:50.275 --> 00:43:52.755
<v Speaker 0>shell support is that if they're not, like,

00:43:52.755 --> 00:43:55.315
<v Speaker 0>POSIX and and and sort of Unix compatible,

00:43:55.315 --> 00:43:57.475
<v Speaker 0>like, 100%, it's it's you know, you really,

00:43:57.475 --> 00:43:59.955
<v Speaker 0>like, run into all the the corner cases.

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Is it shell at the top? That

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:06.080
<v Speaker 1>should be right. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. I

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.600
<v Speaker 1>felt like it did. Also looks like it's

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.600
<v Speaker 0>trying to execute it. Yeah. Because, like,

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:11.280
<v Speaker 0>this all looks right, but,

00:44:13.215 --> 00:44:14.815
<v Speaker 0>yeah, that does not look right.

00:44:16.735 --> 00:44:19.535
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Let's just say it's my fault. So

00:44:19.775 --> 00:44:21.535
<v Speaker 1>I'm not Yeah. I mean, I don't wanna,

00:44:21.535 --> 00:44:23.135
<v Speaker 0>you know, blame anybody.

00:44:24.335 --> 00:44:26.495
<v Speaker 1>Oh, this is I think this is using

00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:29.510
<v Speaker 1>his own downloaded version,

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:32.150
<v Speaker 1>which again, I'm on Nexus. So there's always

00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:33.590
<v Speaker 1>a world of hurt there. Why don't we

00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:35.350
<v Speaker 1>jump over to your screen share and you

00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:36.150
<v Speaker 1>can actually

00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:38.230
<v Speaker 1>and I'll just shut down my computer and

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:39.990
<v Speaker 1>go to bed and you can take over.

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:43.105
<v Speaker 0>I could show the happy path. Yeah. To

00:44:43.105 --> 00:44:44.705
<v Speaker 0>to be fair, it's it's it's a lot

00:44:44.705 --> 00:44:46.385
<v Speaker 0>happier, you know, if you if you don't

00:44:46.385 --> 00:44:48.145
<v Speaker 0>have a a whole lot of custom

00:44:48.465 --> 00:44:50.865
<v Speaker 0>and and new tools. So I'll share. Right?

00:44:50.865 --> 00:44:52.705
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Please. Let's see.

00:44:52.945 --> 00:44:56.030
<v Speaker 0>I'm just gonna do entire screen.

00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:56.670
<v Speaker 0>So I'm gonna

00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:59.150
<v Speaker 0>is that visible?

00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:01.150
<v Speaker 1>It will be in just a moment. I'm

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:02.750
<v Speaker 1>gonna swap this out.

00:45:03.070 --> 00:45:04.910
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, I can see your Versus code.

00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:05.870
<v Speaker 1>Take it away, man.

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:08.750
<v Speaker 0>Cool. Alright. So maybe I'll I'll kinda, like,

00:45:09.565 --> 00:45:11.405
<v Speaker 0>pick up where you left off. Right?

00:45:11.725 --> 00:45:12.365
<v Speaker 0>So,

00:45:12.685 --> 00:45:13.805
<v Speaker 0>you know, for example,

00:45:14.045 --> 00:45:16.125
<v Speaker 0>font mailer, you can encode in TOML. You

00:45:16.125 --> 00:45:17.325
<v Speaker 0>don't have to use

00:45:19.325 --> 00:45:20.205
<v Speaker 0>YAML.

00:45:20.365 --> 00:45:21.645
<v Speaker 0>You know? Like, so we we kinda, like,

00:45:21.645 --> 00:45:22.765
<v Speaker 0>try to be broadly compatible.

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:24.820
<v Speaker 0>But in this case here,

00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:27.060
<v Speaker 0>you know, I'm using Python. Right? And,

00:45:27.859 --> 00:45:30.260
<v Speaker 0>you know, like, obviously, you can write this

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:32.260
<v Speaker 0>over here or you can just select you

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:34.340
<v Speaker 0>can change the whatever language you are

00:45:35.619 --> 00:45:36.180
<v Speaker 0>using here.

00:45:37.015 --> 00:45:38.215
<v Speaker 0>Then, you know, we'll just change it for

00:45:38.215 --> 00:45:40.135
<v Speaker 0>you, right, because it serializes. But, obviously, this

00:45:40.135 --> 00:45:42.295
<v Speaker 0>is not JavaScript. It's Python. And

00:45:42.935 --> 00:45:44.535
<v Speaker 0>I think what you were trying to do

00:45:44.535 --> 00:45:45.175
<v Speaker 0>is

00:45:45.655 --> 00:45:48.215
<v Speaker 0>run runme, and and this is the the

00:45:48.215 --> 00:45:50.055
<v Speaker 0>latest, you know, 3.83,

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:53.090
<v Speaker 0>which has the the documentation

00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:54.610
<v Speaker 0>kinda teased here. Right?

00:45:55.090 --> 00:45:56.610
<v Speaker 0>If you would like to find out more,

00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:59.090
<v Speaker 0>yada yada. But, essentially, you you know, that

00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:01.410
<v Speaker 0>way you can kinda contextualize what the commands

00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:03.490
<v Speaker 0>actually does. Because in lot of ways, write,

00:46:03.615 --> 00:46:06.095
<v Speaker 0>install this thing and then run this step

00:46:06.095 --> 00:46:08.494
<v Speaker 0>and run this step. And in the CLI,

00:46:08.494 --> 00:46:11.295
<v Speaker 0>you, you know, your space constraints, but, like,

00:46:11.295 --> 00:46:13.935
<v Speaker 0>it still helps you understand what's actually going

00:46:13.935 --> 00:46:14.655
<v Speaker 0>on. Right?

00:46:15.055 --> 00:46:17.695
<v Speaker 0>So now if I go and

00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:21.470
<v Speaker 0>run this escape Confluence step, right, which is

00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:22.590
<v Speaker 0>Python,

00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:24.830
<v Speaker 0>it will just run Python.

00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:28.590
<v Speaker 0>So it eventually just executes this here. Right?

00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:29.950
<v Speaker 0>And

00:46:30.425 --> 00:46:31.705
<v Speaker 0>for what it's worth,

00:46:32.265 --> 00:46:33.625
<v Speaker 0>it does that for, like,

00:46:33.865 --> 00:46:35.625
<v Speaker 0>all of the interpreted languages. If you need

00:46:35.625 --> 00:46:37.705
<v Speaker 0>a binary or a jar of some sort,

00:46:37.705 --> 00:46:39.465
<v Speaker 0>you probably have to build it first anyways,

00:46:39.465 --> 00:46:40.744
<v Speaker 0>and then you can just run the binary.

00:46:40.744 --> 00:46:42.025
<v Speaker 0>Right? So you just run it as a

00:46:42.025 --> 00:46:42.345
<v Speaker 0>command.

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:45.619
<v Speaker 0>What else did we show that didn't work?

00:46:45.619 --> 00:46:47.300
<v Speaker 0>Just so I closed the loop on it.

00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:52.260
<v Speaker 0>So let's see. One thing that, like, you

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:55.140
<v Speaker 0>know, is also kinda important to understand or,

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:57.615
<v Speaker 0>like, helpful to understand is, again,

00:46:58.015 --> 00:46:59.775
<v Speaker 0>you know, we scan the whole directory,

00:47:00.255 --> 00:47:02.255
<v Speaker 0>so it doesn't really matter where you are.

00:47:02.415 --> 00:47:04.095
<v Speaker 0>But what does matter is

00:47:04.495 --> 00:47:06.495
<v Speaker 0>the proximity where you are on the directory

00:47:06.495 --> 00:47:08.575
<v Speaker 0>tree, so the sorting will be different. Right?

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:11.099
<v Speaker 0>So the the idea is, like, the the

00:47:11.099 --> 00:47:13.420
<v Speaker 0>markdown files that are closer to you, right,

00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:15.099
<v Speaker 0>in this case, I have a docs folder.

00:47:15.099 --> 00:47:15.580
<v Speaker 0>Right?

00:47:16.859 --> 00:47:18.859
<v Speaker 0>When I'm in the in the directory here,

00:47:18.859 --> 00:47:19.900
<v Speaker 0>they will show up

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:22.525
<v Speaker 0>first. Right? And then, you know, as you

00:47:22.525 --> 00:47:24.205
<v Speaker 0>can see here, there's a, you know, dot

00:47:24.205 --> 00:47:25.245
<v Speaker 0>dot readme.

00:47:25.485 --> 00:47:27.565
<v Speaker 0>So it traverses out of the directory. Right?

00:47:27.565 --> 00:47:29.165
<v Speaker 0>The idea here being is, like, the closer

00:47:29.165 --> 00:47:30.685
<v Speaker 0>you are to the markdown file, the more

00:47:30.685 --> 00:47:32.845
<v Speaker 0>interested you probably are in the tasks that

00:47:32.845 --> 00:47:34.765
<v Speaker 0>can you know, are contained inside of it.

00:47:34.765 --> 00:47:34.925
<v Speaker 0>Right?

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:37.559
<v Speaker 0>So there's a lot of, like, kinda, like,

00:47:37.559 --> 00:47:39.000
<v Speaker 0>you know, thought that we put into that.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000
<v Speaker 0>Not sure if that resonates. If it doesn't,

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.080
<v Speaker 0>you know, please create a GitHub issue.

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:45.319
<v Speaker 0>I would love to hear, you know, why

00:47:45.319 --> 00:47:46.359
<v Speaker 0>and why not.

00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:47.960
<v Speaker 0>So

00:47:48.615 --> 00:47:50.215
<v Speaker 0>so yeah. So the you know, this is

00:47:50.215 --> 00:47:52.295
<v Speaker 0>kind of a terminal experience, and and David's

00:47:52.295 --> 00:47:54.695
<v Speaker 0>done a a a great job showing that

00:47:54.695 --> 00:47:55.255
<v Speaker 0>off.

00:47:55.575 --> 00:47:56.135
<v Speaker 0>But,

00:47:56.695 --> 00:47:58.375
<v Speaker 0>you know, once you get into the notebook,

00:47:58.375 --> 00:48:00.295
<v Speaker 0>the other things we can do. Right? And

00:48:00.295 --> 00:48:02.055
<v Speaker 0>the reason why that is because we're not

00:48:02.055 --> 00:48:03.735
<v Speaker 0>constrained to a character interface.

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:07.280
<v Speaker 0>So I'm not gonna go through through installing

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:09.600
<v Speaker 0>all these prerequisites because I've already done that.

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:10.480
<v Speaker 0>But

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:12.640
<v Speaker 0>a thing that we can do is, like,

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.520
<v Speaker 0>inline cloud resources. Right? So instead of, like,

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000
<v Speaker 0>some sort of esoteric command with, like, lots

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.724
<v Speaker 0>of command options, you can literally copy and

00:48:19.724 --> 00:48:21.565
<v Speaker 0>paste the URL. Right? So if I go

00:48:21.885 --> 00:48:23.885
<v Speaker 0>on here and open that, I get my

00:48:23.885 --> 00:48:26.045
<v Speaker 0>runme c I clusters in my Google console,

00:48:26.045 --> 00:48:27.325
<v Speaker 0>and you can obviously do the same thing

00:48:27.325 --> 00:48:28.445
<v Speaker 0>for AWS.

00:48:29.244 --> 00:48:31.040
<v Speaker 0>But when you hit the play button, it

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:32.240
<v Speaker 0>will expand

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.880
<v Speaker 0>that UI right into your notebook. Right? What?

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:37.599
<v Speaker 0>And I didn't know that. Yeah. Well, you

00:48:37.599 --> 00:48:38.800
<v Speaker 0>know, that's why we're here.

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:40.480
<v Speaker 0>And

00:48:41.119 --> 00:48:43.440
<v Speaker 0>and so another another useful feature that we

00:48:43.215 --> 00:48:44.815
<v Speaker 0>found is that you can kinda, you know,

00:48:44.815 --> 00:48:47.375
<v Speaker 0>create these sort of, like, session carbon copies

00:48:47.375 --> 00:48:48.495
<v Speaker 0>of what you're doing.

00:48:48.815 --> 00:48:51.295
<v Speaker 0>And in fact, even in the session file,

00:48:51.295 --> 00:48:53.535
<v Speaker 0>we will we will render the underlying

00:48:53.615 --> 00:48:54.575
<v Speaker 0>API's,

00:48:54.575 --> 00:48:57.135
<v Speaker 0>you know, response. Right? So if you're recording

00:48:57.135 --> 00:48:57.535
<v Speaker 0>yourself,

00:48:58.059 --> 00:49:00.380
<v Speaker 0>you in the markdown file, right, you might

00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:02.700
<v Speaker 0>not get the render UI, but you still

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:05.900
<v Speaker 0>know what was being displayed. Right? So we

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:08.140
<v Speaker 0>kinda, like, really try to, like, deliver

00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:10.619
<v Speaker 0>on this concept of, like, being able to

00:49:10.619 --> 00:49:12.380
<v Speaker 0>create audio facts of what you're doing. Right?

00:49:12.465 --> 00:49:13.985
<v Speaker 0>If you wanna share them, that's up to

00:49:13.985 --> 00:49:15.665
<v Speaker 0>you. Right? But, like, sometimes it even helps

00:49:15.665 --> 00:49:17.825
<v Speaker 0>just having them, you know, be recorded so

00:49:17.825 --> 00:49:19.665
<v Speaker 0>you can go back later and see, hey.

00:49:19.665 --> 00:49:21.185
<v Speaker 0>What did I do? Or what was the

00:49:21.185 --> 00:49:22.545
<v Speaker 0>thing at the time when I ran it?

00:49:22.545 --> 00:49:24.225
<v Speaker 0>Right? Yeah. That's entropy.

00:49:24.225 --> 00:49:25.025
<v Speaker 1>That is so cool.

00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:27.180
<v Speaker 0>And, you know, like, another thing you can

00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:28.700
<v Speaker 0>do is click on it and insert another

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:29.340
<v Speaker 0>cell.

00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:30.620
<v Speaker 0>And

00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:33.740
<v Speaker 0>in in this case, since I'm looking at

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:35.100
<v Speaker 0>a Kubernetes cluster

00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:36.860
<v Speaker 0>list, right, it will give me the Kubernetes

00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:40.065
<v Speaker 0>cluster details. Right? So I clicked on cluster

00:49:40.065 --> 00:49:41.425
<v Speaker 0>two because it's the only one that has

00:49:41.425 --> 00:49:42.065
<v Speaker 0>nodes.

00:49:42.465 --> 00:49:44.225
<v Speaker 0>And then, know, like, you you essentially get

00:49:44.225 --> 00:49:45.585
<v Speaker 0>a little UI here,

00:49:46.545 --> 00:49:48.785
<v Speaker 0>that kinda traverses into it. Right? So you

00:49:48.785 --> 00:49:50.785
<v Speaker 0>have all the list of clusters and the

00:49:50.785 --> 00:49:51.505
<v Speaker 0>clusters,

00:49:51.665 --> 00:49:52.545
<v Speaker 0>list of nodes,

00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:54.800
<v Speaker 0>and you can even go all the way

00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:55.680
<v Speaker 0>into

00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:57.520
<v Speaker 0>the VM level. Right?

00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:00.480
<v Speaker 0>And we're we're trying to expand that library

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:01.520
<v Speaker 0>of available,

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:02.480
<v Speaker 0>you know, like,

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:04.720
<v Speaker 0>cloud resources in the notebooks.

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:06.560
<v Speaker 0>Essentially, what this really is is a web

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:09.734
<v Speaker 0>component, which is also open standard. We're basically

00:50:09.734 --> 00:50:11.494
<v Speaker 0>just building custom vendors for that. And the

00:50:11.494 --> 00:50:13.894
<v Speaker 0>notebook knows how to associate, you know, these

00:50:13.894 --> 00:50:15.015
<v Speaker 0>these resources.

00:50:15.174 --> 00:50:17.174
<v Speaker 1>Is that using the g cloud command behind

00:50:17.174 --> 00:50:19.734
<v Speaker 1>the scenes to get this information and then

00:50:19.734 --> 00:50:21.974
<v Speaker 1>render it? Yeah. Behind the scenes, it uses

00:50:21.974 --> 00:50:22.935
<v Speaker 0>the SDK,

00:50:23.095 --> 00:50:25.390
<v Speaker 0>which, you know, yeah, which but which is

00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:27.790
<v Speaker 0>also sensitive and and and, you know, tuned

00:50:27.790 --> 00:50:30.590
<v Speaker 0>to pick up on your environment. So so

00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:32.270
<v Speaker 0>it's it's it's essentially using the same tool

00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:34.510
<v Speaker 0>chain. So if you like, I'm currently authenticating

00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:35.390
<v Speaker 0>with my account,

00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:37.665
<v Speaker 0>so that way it knows what, you know,

00:50:37.665 --> 00:50:40.065
<v Speaker 0>like, how to authenticate against the APIs and

00:50:40.065 --> 00:50:41.665
<v Speaker 0>what authorization I have.

00:50:41.905 --> 00:50:43.825
<v Speaker 0>So it's all transparent in that way.

00:50:44.305 --> 00:50:44.785
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:50:45.185 --> 00:50:47.185
<v Speaker 0>And, you know, it works for AWS too.

00:50:47.665 --> 00:50:50.785
<v Speaker 0>We're still you know, this is kinda like

00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:51.790
<v Speaker 0>a lot of legwork involved. You're building out

00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:52.750
<v Speaker 0>these UIs.

00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:54.589
<v Speaker 0>But, you know, like, you know, in a

00:50:54.589 --> 00:50:56.030
<v Speaker 0>in a in a ideal world, we would

00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:57.470
<v Speaker 0>have that for all of GCP, for all

00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:59.550
<v Speaker 0>of AWS, for all of Azure. Right? And

00:50:59.550 --> 00:51:01.230
<v Speaker 0>it's sort of the work in progress that

00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:02.190
<v Speaker 0>we're trying to

00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:03.710
<v Speaker 0>churn through. Right?

00:51:04.605 --> 00:51:08.125
<v Speaker 0>Another thing is when you turn off interactive

00:51:08.205 --> 00:51:09.725
<v Speaker 0>the interactive flag here,

00:51:10.925 --> 00:51:12.845
<v Speaker 0>essentially, what this does I mean, we're gonna

00:51:12.845 --> 00:51:14.205
<v Speaker 0>show it over here because it kinda, like,

00:51:14.205 --> 00:51:15.245
<v Speaker 0>brings it back to

00:51:15.885 --> 00:51:16.285
<v Speaker 0>the

00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:19.870
<v Speaker 0>markdown representation.

00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:22.110
<v Speaker 0>It sets the attribute to, you know, true

00:51:22.110 --> 00:51:23.950
<v Speaker 0>or false. Right? And the

00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:26.430
<v Speaker 0>difference here is, like, interactive is really just

00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:28.190
<v Speaker 0>like, is this a terminal, or is it

00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:30.030
<v Speaker 0>some is it something else? Right? Is the

00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:32.295
<v Speaker 0>output that I'm expecting a terminal?

00:51:32.455 --> 00:51:34.855
<v Speaker 0>It will just render a terminal. Right? But

00:51:34.855 --> 00:51:37.975
<v Speaker 0>if, for example, you are curling an image,

00:51:38.135 --> 00:51:38.695
<v Speaker 0>right,

00:51:39.095 --> 00:51:40.695
<v Speaker 0>it's not you know, if you if you

00:51:40.695 --> 00:51:42.695
<v Speaker 0>run it internally, you get a binary block.

00:51:42.695 --> 00:51:43.735
<v Speaker 0>It looks a little bit like what you

00:51:43.735 --> 00:51:45.655
<v Speaker 0>saw on David when in David's terminal when

00:51:45.655 --> 00:51:48.360
<v Speaker 0>this when this Nick's crashed.

00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:50.440
<v Speaker 0>But, you know, like, the notebook knows how

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.960
<v Speaker 0>to, like, render images. It knows how to

00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:54.119
<v Speaker 0>render CSV files. Right? So what it does

00:51:54.119 --> 00:51:55.640
<v Speaker 0>here is, like, it just renders the image.

00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:56.200
<v Speaker 0>Right?

00:51:56.599 --> 00:51:58.680
<v Speaker 0>And it works kinda like me similarly how

00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:01.480
<v Speaker 0>these components here work, these cloud resources where,

00:52:01.935 --> 00:52:03.615
<v Speaker 0>you know, we we try to be smart

00:52:03.615 --> 00:52:05.455
<v Speaker 0>about detecting what MIME type it has and

00:52:05.455 --> 00:52:08.415
<v Speaker 0>then render it accordingly. Right? And this is

00:52:08.415 --> 00:52:11.455
<v Speaker 0>kinda like where you're starting to, obviously, from

00:52:11.695 --> 00:52:13.855
<v Speaker 0>a from a UI standpoint, break out of

00:52:13.855 --> 00:52:14.655
<v Speaker 0>a terminal.

00:52:14.895 --> 00:52:16.255
<v Speaker 0>But, you know, the cool thing is at

00:52:16.255 --> 00:52:18.230
<v Speaker 0>the end of the day, people can still

00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:20.069
<v Speaker 0>run this in the terminal. Right? And you

00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:22.150
<v Speaker 0>can still and we haven't like, I still

00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:24.150
<v Speaker 0>have to actually close out that ticket. If

00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:25.349
<v Speaker 0>you ran on a terminal, it could pop

00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:28.150
<v Speaker 0>you into a browser. Right? So I think

00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:29.829
<v Speaker 0>the important thing that we wanted to do

00:52:29.829 --> 00:52:31.670
<v Speaker 0>here is bring the UI into the notebook,

00:52:32.105 --> 00:52:34.184
<v Speaker 0>but don't close the door behind us for

00:52:34.184 --> 00:52:35.944
<v Speaker 0>people that don't wanna use a notebook, right,

00:52:35.944 --> 00:52:37.785
<v Speaker 0>which is, for example, a terminal.

00:52:38.105 --> 00:52:40.424
<v Speaker 0>And, you know, so it it remains functional.

00:52:40.424 --> 00:52:42.105
<v Speaker 0>Right? Because at the end of the day,

00:52:42.345 --> 00:52:43.944
<v Speaker 0>you know, I'm just opening a URL and

00:52:43.944 --> 00:52:45.785
<v Speaker 0>you get your cloud console over here. Right?

00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:50.350
<v Speaker 0>So this sort of concept is is, like,

00:52:50.350 --> 00:52:52.510
<v Speaker 0>you know, somewhat exclusive to the notebook, but

00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:53.950
<v Speaker 0>for obvious reasons because we're not in the

00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:55.390
<v Speaker 0>character interface. Yeah.

00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:58.750
<v Speaker 0>Another thing that is is worth mentioning is,

00:52:59.575 --> 00:53:01.495
<v Speaker 0>you know, like, not having the sort of

00:53:01.495 --> 00:53:03.735
<v Speaker 0>clutter of, like, how do I get the

00:53:03.735 --> 00:53:04.695
<v Speaker 0>project name,

00:53:04.855 --> 00:53:06.695
<v Speaker 0>you know, to be entered by the user?

00:53:07.095 --> 00:53:08.375
<v Speaker 0>You know, like, now you could write some

00:53:08.375 --> 00:53:10.615
<v Speaker 0>sales script and do some gum and and,

00:53:10.615 --> 00:53:12.615
<v Speaker 0>you know, like, STD. What is it called?

00:53:12.615 --> 00:53:14.375
<v Speaker 0>The read command and the terminal and all

00:53:14.375 --> 00:53:16.700
<v Speaker 0>that. But, like, a design principle that we

00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:19.020
<v Speaker 0>have in runme is it should look like

00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:20.060
<v Speaker 0>documentation.

00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:22.460
<v Speaker 0>You know? Like, we shouldn't have the imperative

00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:25.260
<v Speaker 0>steps how to enter the project name that

00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:27.020
<v Speaker 0>just caught us in documentation because it doesn't

00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:27.579
<v Speaker 0>add anything

00:53:28.065 --> 00:53:30.385
<v Speaker 0>to what I'm currently doing. Right? So when

00:53:30.385 --> 00:53:31.265
<v Speaker 0>I run this,

00:53:31.665 --> 00:53:33.585
<v Speaker 0>it will actually prompt me. Right? So I

00:53:33.585 --> 00:53:36.545
<v Speaker 0>can say, like, runme c I. Right? Where,

00:53:36.785 --> 00:53:38.944
<v Speaker 0>if you put quotes on it, it will

00:53:38.944 --> 00:53:40.464
<v Speaker 0>use it as a default value. Right? So

00:53:40.464 --> 00:53:41.665
<v Speaker 0>I can just confirm it.

00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:45.160
<v Speaker 0>Right? So that way, you know, like, again,

00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:46.920
<v Speaker 0>if you're in the terminal, you can still

00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:48.440
<v Speaker 0>copy and paste it. In fact, if I

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:49.640
<v Speaker 0>run this in the terminal,

00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.560
<v Speaker 0>it will also ask me. Right?

00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:53.720
<v Speaker 0>I might have to do some digging here

00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:55.640
<v Speaker 0>because, like, I didn't give this a name.

00:53:56.115 --> 00:53:58.275
<v Speaker 0>But anytime you see an export statement on

00:53:58.275 --> 00:53:59.555
<v Speaker 0>it, it will ask you,

00:54:00.835 --> 00:54:02.435
<v Speaker 0>see how it does this here? Enter your

00:54:02.435 --> 00:54:04.595
<v Speaker 0>project ID runme CI.

00:54:04.595 --> 00:54:06.035
<v Speaker 0>Right? Yeah. That's slick.

00:54:06.355 --> 00:54:08.035
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So the idea is to, like you

00:54:08.035 --> 00:54:09.555
<v Speaker 0>know, that way you can actually produce generic

00:54:09.555 --> 00:54:10.515
<v Speaker 0>documentation

00:54:10.755 --> 00:54:12.560
<v Speaker 0>but not make it so generic that everybody

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:14.320
<v Speaker 0>has to reverse engineer it. Right?

00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:18.080
<v Speaker 0>And another cool thing that we do is

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:19.680
<v Speaker 0>once this is set,

00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:21.920
<v Speaker 0>we don't ask again. Right? So if I

00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:24.425
<v Speaker 0>rerun this, the values are known, but you

00:54:24.425 --> 00:54:26.905
<v Speaker 0>can always say, like, prompt for input anyways,

00:54:26.905 --> 00:54:29.145
<v Speaker 0>and then it will reask you. Right?

00:54:30.185 --> 00:54:32.905
<v Speaker 0>And another thing that should work in here,

00:54:32.905 --> 00:54:34.185
<v Speaker 0>so I can see my cursor.

00:54:35.829 --> 00:54:36.790
<v Speaker 0>Runme.

00:54:37.109 --> 00:54:39.670
<v Speaker 0>Yep. Is, once the value is also known,

00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:41.670
<v Speaker 0>the terminal and the notebook share

00:54:41.829 --> 00:54:42.950
<v Speaker 0>the environments,

00:54:43.109 --> 00:54:44.550
<v Speaker 0>which, you know, there's a lot of engineering

00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:46.710
<v Speaker 0>effort that went into that. So it also

00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:47.910
<v Speaker 0>doesn't ask you. So, essentially,

00:54:48.705 --> 00:54:50.145
<v Speaker 0>the terminal ends,

00:54:50.465 --> 00:54:53.665
<v Speaker 0>the notebook share a managed environment, right, that

00:54:53.825 --> 00:54:56.225
<v Speaker 0>sort of transcends, you know, your terminal session.

00:54:56.225 --> 00:54:58.385
<v Speaker 0>So you when you complete steps in here,

00:54:58.385 --> 00:54:59.505
<v Speaker 0>you can kinda pick up on them in

00:54:59.505 --> 00:55:00.545
<v Speaker 0>the terminal and vice versa.

00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:04.140
<v Speaker 0>That is, like, currently, you know, specific to

00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:06.060
<v Speaker 0>Versus Code because we really use the the

00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:07.980
<v Speaker 0>way, you know, the terminal is integrated into

00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:09.900
<v Speaker 0>Versus Code to make that happen because it's

00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:10.780
<v Speaker 0>not trivial

00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:12.780
<v Speaker 0>to cross boundaries. Right?

00:55:14.155 --> 00:55:15.915
<v Speaker 0>And, yeah, at the end of the day,

00:55:16.075 --> 00:55:18.715
<v Speaker 0>I think it was a cluster two,

00:55:19.035 --> 00:55:20.715
<v Speaker 0>if I'm not mistaken.

00:55:21.355 --> 00:55:21.995
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

00:55:22.395 --> 00:55:24.795
<v Speaker 0>You know, you can you can essentially just,

00:55:24.795 --> 00:55:26.395
<v Speaker 0>you know, see if any parts are running.

00:55:26.395 --> 00:55:26.635
<v Speaker 0>Right?

00:55:28.109 --> 00:55:29.630
<v Speaker 0>Another thing that we do in the UI

00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:31.950
<v Speaker 0>here is when you set the background flag,

00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:34.190
<v Speaker 0>we don't block the notebook. Right? It it

00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:36.430
<v Speaker 0>just drops you into a background watcher.

00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:38.590
<v Speaker 0>And that one, you can also

00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:40.829
<v Speaker 0>can you know, you can watch down here

00:55:40.829 --> 00:55:42.430
<v Speaker 0>too. So we multiplex the terminal.

00:55:43.095 --> 00:55:45.015
<v Speaker 0>And, you know, I can apply, for example,

00:55:45.015 --> 00:55:46.855
<v Speaker 0>a YAML file or install a Helm chart

00:55:46.855 --> 00:55:47.575
<v Speaker 0>or

00:55:47.655 --> 00:55:49.494
<v Speaker 0>whatever it is. Right? And you you could

00:55:49.494 --> 00:55:51.255
<v Speaker 0>even, like, move on and just keep an

00:55:51.255 --> 00:55:52.695
<v Speaker 0>eye on it here, right, because the terminal

00:55:52.695 --> 00:55:53.895
<v Speaker 0>is multiplexed.

00:55:54.535 --> 00:55:55.095
<v Speaker 0>And

00:55:57.015 --> 00:55:57.895
<v Speaker 0>yeah. So

00:55:58.670 --> 00:56:00.190
<v Speaker 0>those are kinda, like just kind of the

00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:01.870
<v Speaker 0>bread and butter of the notebook.

00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:03.950
<v Speaker 0>Sort of the What does the

00:56:04.350 --> 00:56:05.710
<v Speaker 1>fork button do?

00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:08.110
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So the fork button is brand new

00:56:08.110 --> 00:56:10.190
<v Speaker 0>and, like, you have to turn on version

00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:10.830
<v Speaker 0>two.

00:56:11.070 --> 00:56:12.590
<v Speaker 0>Let me see if I have that turned

00:56:12.590 --> 00:56:15.914
<v Speaker 0>on here. Like, maybe let's do something down

00:56:15.914 --> 00:56:16.555
<v Speaker 0>here.

00:56:17.355 --> 00:56:18.955
<v Speaker 0>So echo

00:56:19.434 --> 00:56:20.795
<v Speaker 0>my name.

00:56:21.115 --> 00:56:22.795
<v Speaker 0>Right? So when I run this,

00:56:23.035 --> 00:56:24.315
<v Speaker 0>of course, my name is a is a

00:56:24.315 --> 00:56:26.395
<v Speaker 0>brand new variable, you know, environment

00:56:26.395 --> 00:56:28.150
<v Speaker 0>variable I made up. So what you can

00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:29.350
<v Speaker 0>do now is you can hit the fork

00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:29.990
<v Speaker 0>button.

00:56:30.310 --> 00:56:31.910
<v Speaker 0>Right? You could do something like

00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:34.230
<v Speaker 0>I did this before. My dog Luna, right,

00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:36.630
<v Speaker 0>is my name. And so the fork button,

00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:38.870
<v Speaker 0>the idea is you fork the terminal session.

00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:40.310
<v Speaker 0>Right? And then you can roll it up

00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:44.055
<v Speaker 0>again. Right? So I inherit the environment of

00:56:44.055 --> 00:56:46.135
<v Speaker 0>the notebook in this terminal at the time

00:56:46.135 --> 00:56:47.815
<v Speaker 0>of you know, when I hit the fork

00:56:47.815 --> 00:56:49.655
<v Speaker 0>button. So if I had you know, actually,

00:56:49.655 --> 00:56:50.535
<v Speaker 0>if I do

00:56:51.095 --> 00:56:51.975
<v Speaker 0>what is it?

00:56:53.335 --> 00:56:55.015
<v Speaker 0>Just hop back for a hot second.

00:56:56.099 --> 00:56:58.980
<v Speaker 0>I'm just gonna have to see cluster name.

00:56:58.980 --> 00:56:59.540
<v Speaker 0>Right?

00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:02.339
<v Speaker 0>This should be set here. No. It's not.

00:57:02.339 --> 00:57:02.900
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:06.339
<v Speaker 0>The reason why that is this gives me

00:57:06.339 --> 00:57:08.420
<v Speaker 0>right now. But, essentially, the idea then is,

00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:09.859
<v Speaker 0>like, if you can exit this terminal,

00:57:11.195 --> 00:57:12.795
<v Speaker 0>and now when I run this,

00:57:13.275 --> 00:57:14.795
<v Speaker 0>you know, like so when I roll it

00:57:14.795 --> 00:57:16.315
<v Speaker 0>up, it will then, you know, close the

00:57:16.315 --> 00:57:18.875
<v Speaker 0>terminal and update all the environment variables with

00:57:18.875 --> 00:57:21.515
<v Speaker 0>whatever I set them or mutated them in

00:57:21.515 --> 00:57:22.315
<v Speaker 0>the terminal session.

00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:26.470
<v Speaker 0>Another thing that you can do is

00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:29.430
<v Speaker 0>if you don't like clicking around here and,

00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:30.390
<v Speaker 0>like, do use

00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:32.150
<v Speaker 0>the the notebook editor,

00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:34.230
<v Speaker 0>you can also hit the forward button and

00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:36.230
<v Speaker 0>then just go about your ways. Right?

00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:38.630
<v Speaker 0>Do your thing and then type save,

00:57:39.325 --> 00:57:40.445
<v Speaker 0>and then it will

00:57:40.685 --> 00:57:42.845
<v Speaker 0>grab the whole session and and and and,

00:57:42.845 --> 00:57:44.685
<v Speaker 0>essentially, like, hoist it into

00:57:45.805 --> 00:57:47.485
<v Speaker 0>into the notebook. So you can, you know,

00:57:47.485 --> 00:57:50.125
<v Speaker 0>you can essentially start editing. Right? And what

00:57:50.125 --> 00:57:51.245
<v Speaker 0>we wanna do here, and this is a

00:57:51.245 --> 00:57:52.365
<v Speaker 0>lot of work because we have to build

00:57:52.365 --> 00:57:54.605
<v Speaker 0>yet another, you know, abstract syntax tree, is

00:57:54.605 --> 00:57:58.230
<v Speaker 0>to parse the the sequence of characters and

00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:59.510
<v Speaker 0>then and then chop it up into a

00:57:59.510 --> 00:58:00.790
<v Speaker 0>notebook for you. But

00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:03.830
<v Speaker 0>the idea here is to make authoring easier.

00:58:03.830 --> 00:58:06.070
<v Speaker 0>Right? So That's neat. Yeah. Long I like

00:58:06.070 --> 00:58:07.510
<v Speaker 1>that. You know, long story short is, like,

00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:09.665
<v Speaker 0>you fork the notebook on two ways. Right?

00:58:09.665 --> 00:58:11.505
<v Speaker 0>The actual content of it, but also the

00:58:11.505 --> 00:58:12.225
<v Speaker 0>environment.

00:58:12.465 --> 00:58:13.905
<v Speaker 0>And then whether you exit it with exit

00:58:13.905 --> 00:58:16.385
<v Speaker 0>or save. So save will roll up the

00:58:16.385 --> 00:58:17.265
<v Speaker 0>environment,

00:58:17.425 --> 00:58:19.105
<v Speaker 0>and save will roll up the environment in

00:58:19.105 --> 00:58:21.185
<v Speaker 0>literally the session and and copy it into

00:58:21.185 --> 00:58:22.145
<v Speaker 0>a into a cell.

00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:24.980
<v Speaker 1>So see

00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:28.260
<v Speaker 1>the session, is that what those extra

00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:31.380
<v Speaker 1>readme fail like, markdown fails are? You can

00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:33.460
<v Speaker 1>see you've got two cloud files and two

00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:34.100
<v Speaker 1>three

00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:35.540
<v Speaker 1>cloud files and two gapless.

00:58:36.315 --> 00:58:37.595
<v Speaker 0>See how I have the I have the

00:58:37.595 --> 00:58:39.675
<v Speaker 0>auto save on? This is like, you know,

00:58:39.675 --> 00:58:40.075
<v Speaker 0>like,

00:58:40.555 --> 00:58:43.115
<v Speaker 0>when we when we serialize, you know, what's

00:58:43.115 --> 00:58:44.875
<v Speaker 0>in this file here, right, when we go

00:58:44.875 --> 00:58:45.595
<v Speaker 0>in here,

00:58:46.315 --> 00:58:47.835
<v Speaker 0>and this is the notebook diff view, but

00:58:47.835 --> 00:58:49.595
<v Speaker 0>you can always do the file diff view.

00:58:50.155 --> 00:58:51.115
<v Speaker 0>You know, see how

00:58:51.810 --> 00:58:53.970
<v Speaker 0>this has now changed, and it has

00:58:54.370 --> 00:58:55.250
<v Speaker 0>all the stuff

00:58:55.810 --> 00:58:57.890
<v Speaker 0>inside of the cell. So when you when

00:58:57.890 --> 00:58:58.930
<v Speaker 0>you hit save,

00:58:59.010 --> 00:59:01.090
<v Speaker 0>it will only serialize input cells. It will

00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:03.250
<v Speaker 0>ignore output cells. Right? Because the idea is,

00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:06.215
<v Speaker 0>like, documentation is only, you know, relevant to

00:59:06.215 --> 00:59:08.375
<v Speaker 0>you for the inputs. You create your own

00:59:08.375 --> 00:59:09.495
<v Speaker 0>outputs. Right?

00:59:09.735 --> 00:59:11.815
<v Speaker 0>When you turn on auto save, it will

00:59:11.815 --> 00:59:14.135
<v Speaker 0>create a separate file that is really, like,

00:59:14.135 --> 00:59:15.735
<v Speaker 0>a carbon copy of what

00:59:15.975 --> 00:59:17.815
<v Speaker 0>the inputs are, but it also includes the

00:59:17.815 --> 00:59:18.215
<v Speaker 0>outputs.

00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:20.780
<v Speaker 0>And it does that per session. So if

00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:23.020
<v Speaker 0>I hit the reset session button here

00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:25.260
<v Speaker 0>and then I save again, you know, I

00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:27.340
<v Speaker 0>get a brand new file. And Okay.

00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:29.980
<v Speaker 0>And, you know so the idea here is,

00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:32.380
<v Speaker 0>you know, like, I did all of this

00:59:32.085 --> 00:59:33.525
<v Speaker 0>and, you know, maybe I ran out of

00:59:33.525 --> 00:59:35.765
<v Speaker 0>disco. My my next door has a problem,

00:59:35.765 --> 00:59:37.445
<v Speaker 0>and and then I can go on my

00:59:37.445 --> 00:59:39.525
<v Speaker 0>session output and I can say generate a

00:59:39.525 --> 00:59:40.085
<v Speaker 0>gist,

00:59:41.205 --> 00:59:43.685
<v Speaker 0>log in to to GitHub, and then, you

00:59:43.685 --> 00:59:45.789
<v Speaker 0>know, I have a secure gist here. Secure

00:59:45.789 --> 00:59:47.230
<v Speaker 0>in the way that it's not listed. You

00:59:47.230 --> 00:59:48.750
<v Speaker 0>know, everybody can access it if they have

00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:49.550
<v Speaker 0>the URL.

00:59:49.710 --> 00:59:51.150
<v Speaker 0>But I could send that over to you.

00:59:51.150 --> 00:59:52.510
<v Speaker 0>Right? So it kinda, like, just makes the

00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:54.190
<v Speaker 0>cuts out the steps it takes to,

00:59:54.510 --> 00:59:57.310
<v Speaker 0>you know, like, copy and paste, do screenshots,

00:59:57.549 --> 00:59:58.269
<v Speaker 0>that sort of stuff.

00:59:59.115 --> 01:00:00.555
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I can imagine this would be really

01:00:00.555 --> 01:00:02.955
<v Speaker 1>helpful, like, if you're say someone's play move

01:00:02.955 --> 01:00:05.515
<v Speaker 1>runme and they have a problem, they can

01:00:05.515 --> 01:00:08.155
<v Speaker 1>just create a notebook, guess that, and then

01:00:08.155 --> 01:00:09.595
<v Speaker 1>pop it into the issue.

01:00:10.555 --> 01:00:12.235
<v Speaker 0>Right? And and, you know, like, the idea

01:00:12.235 --> 01:00:14.550
<v Speaker 0>really is to sometimes even give people a

01:00:14.550 --> 01:00:16.550
<v Speaker 0>readme as sort of a starting point to

01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:18.470
<v Speaker 0>platform them. Right? Like, you know, use your

01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:20.630
<v Speaker 0>cluster. Here are the common things that you

01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:21.750
<v Speaker 0>do, and here's a little bit of a

01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:22.870
<v Speaker 0>troubleshooting section.

01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:25.110
<v Speaker 0>And if you can't troubleshoot yourself, just run

01:00:25.110 --> 01:00:26.710
<v Speaker 0>all the cells and then and then, you

01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:27.910
<v Speaker 0>know, gist it. Right?

01:00:29.065 --> 01:00:30.905
<v Speaker 0>This is also where we have, you know,

01:00:30.905 --> 01:00:32.985
<v Speaker 0>like, a stateful as a product come in.

01:00:33.065 --> 01:00:34.985
<v Speaker 0>I can log in with my stateful accounts

01:00:34.985 --> 01:00:35.945
<v Speaker 0>over here.

01:00:36.505 --> 01:00:37.065
<v Speaker 0>And

01:00:37.945 --> 01:00:40.025
<v Speaker 0>and, essentially, then instead of, like, creating gist,

01:00:40.310 --> 01:00:42.630
<v Speaker 0>pump that into our platform, and then you

01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:44.070
<v Speaker 0>get all the features of sharing it with

01:00:44.070 --> 01:00:45.750
<v Speaker 0>the team, posting into Slack,

01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:47.510
<v Speaker 0>that sort of stuff. But, yeah, it really

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:49.030
<v Speaker 0>is sort of for the troubleshooting.

01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:51.190
<v Speaker 0>I mean, troubleshooting and also recording what you

01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:53.735
<v Speaker 0>did scenario. Right? Because sometimes you wanna, I

01:00:53.735 --> 01:00:55.415
<v Speaker 0>don't know. Like, something on a on a

01:00:55.415 --> 01:00:57.575
<v Speaker 0>server where you are, MRF, you

01:00:58.055 --> 01:00:59.255
<v Speaker 0>know, some

01:00:59.415 --> 01:01:00.775
<v Speaker 0>I I don't know. Like, something that you

01:01:00.775 --> 01:01:02.215
<v Speaker 0>wanna, like, okay. I wanna have an artifact

01:01:02.215 --> 01:01:03.975
<v Speaker 0>of that when it happened and what happens.

01:01:03.975 --> 01:01:05.575
<v Speaker 0>Right? Because it's a high stakes task.

01:01:07.359 --> 01:01:08.000
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.800
<v Speaker 0>And I'm I'm editing the which I shouldn't

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:11.520
<v Speaker 0>be doing the

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.720
<v Speaker 0>I mean, you can. Right? You can you

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.400
<v Speaker 0>can redact and then create a

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:17.840
<v Speaker 0>a gist of it.

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:20.000
<v Speaker 0>One thing that I quickly wanna show before

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.680
<v Speaker 0>I hop on to another

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:22.480
<v Speaker 0>sort of features,

01:01:23.435 --> 01:01:25.195
<v Speaker 0>What I find need is, like, for VMs,

01:01:25.195 --> 01:01:27.195
<v Speaker 0>for example, we don't just give you the

01:01:27.195 --> 01:01:29.435
<v Speaker 0>resource, but you can, you know, click on

01:01:29.435 --> 01:01:31.595
<v Speaker 0>the SSH button here, it will literally drop

01:01:31.595 --> 01:01:33.675
<v Speaker 0>you into an SSH session to the VM.

01:01:34.155 --> 01:01:35.675
<v Speaker 0>So that's that's kinda neat. Right?

01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:38.230
<v Speaker 0>Because it kinda, like, literally, like, I'm on

01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:40.710
<v Speaker 0>the node of my Kubernetes cluster. I think

01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:42.390
<v Speaker 0>I clicked. Right? Or did I use instance

01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:44.789
<v Speaker 0>Nided instance, but I could, you know, just

01:01:44.789 --> 01:01:48.070
<v Speaker 0>h SSH into cluster two's node here

01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:49.510
<v Speaker 0>with one click and,

01:01:50.135 --> 01:01:51.974
<v Speaker 0>I don't know, do some sort of, like,

01:01:51.974 --> 01:01:54.295
<v Speaker 0>you know, analysis work and then, like, hop

01:01:54.295 --> 01:01:55.815
<v Speaker 0>out and and be done with it. Right?

01:01:55.815 --> 01:01:57.575
<v Speaker 0>And it all records in my session file

01:01:57.575 --> 01:01:58.135
<v Speaker 0>too.

01:01:58.454 --> 01:02:00.454
<v Speaker 1>But you said that you support AWS and

01:02:00.454 --> 01:02:02.295
<v Speaker 1>GCP for that. Right? That that that's a

01:02:02.295 --> 01:02:04.135
<v Speaker 1>color feature. I hadn't seen that. I love

01:02:04.135 --> 01:02:05.720
<v Speaker 1>it. Do you plan to do the same

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.400
<v Speaker 1>for Kubernetes to the point if I run

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:09.079
<v Speaker 1>get pods, can I then just click show

01:02:09.079 --> 01:02:11.319
<v Speaker 1>me logs of this pod? Because that would

01:02:11.319 --> 01:02:12.520
<v Speaker 1>be a really cool feature.

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:14.119
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I mean, like, you know, all of

01:02:14.119 --> 01:02:16.040
<v Speaker 0>this stuff is very extensible. I mean, we

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:18.359
<v Speaker 0>did a a integration with Dagger that, like,

01:02:18.359 --> 01:02:21.435
<v Speaker 0>essentially uses the CLI button layers, you know,

01:02:21.835 --> 01:02:23.674
<v Speaker 0>sort of actions on top that, you know,

01:02:23.674 --> 01:02:25.515
<v Speaker 0>conceivably, you could also, if you, for example,

01:02:25.515 --> 01:02:26.715
<v Speaker 0>build a directory

01:02:27.035 --> 01:02:29.515
<v Speaker 0>or build into a file. A directory is

01:02:29.515 --> 01:02:31.275
<v Speaker 0>probably a better example, could then actually list,

01:02:31.275 --> 01:02:32.795
<v Speaker 0>you know, directory and the files inside of

01:02:32.795 --> 01:02:34.490
<v Speaker 0>it. And then you could maybe even have

01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:35.930
<v Speaker 0>a button that then opens the file in

01:02:35.930 --> 01:02:37.130
<v Speaker 0>in another tab.

01:02:38.410 --> 01:02:38.970
<v Speaker 0>So

01:02:39.450 --> 01:02:41.850
<v Speaker 0>yeah. That's I mean, yes. Yeah. Anything

01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:45.369
<v Speaker 0>is possible. Yeah. More time, more people, more

01:02:45.369 --> 01:02:47.450
<v Speaker 1>hours. Like, that's Right. What it boils down

01:02:47.450 --> 01:02:50.204
<v Speaker 1>to. So Exactly. And, you know, like, another

01:02:50.204 --> 01:02:51.325
<v Speaker 0>thing that we have, we have a few

01:02:51.325 --> 01:02:53.565
<v Speaker 0>GitHub workflows that we trigger manually.

01:02:54.444 --> 01:02:56.125
<v Speaker 0>So this is kinda neat because when you're

01:02:56.125 --> 01:02:58.525
<v Speaker 0>contributing MD, we have a release flow and

01:02:58.525 --> 01:03:00.765
<v Speaker 0>then, you know, if I mean, not not

01:03:00.765 --> 01:03:02.605
<v Speaker 0>all of our pipelines run. There's you know,

01:03:02.605 --> 01:03:03.964
<v Speaker 0>most of them run on push,

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:06.820
<v Speaker 0>but the release one, we we just dispatch

01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:07.700
<v Speaker 0>a workflow.

01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:08.660
<v Speaker 0>So

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:11.300
<v Speaker 0>this is, I think, a test no. It's

01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:12.900
<v Speaker 0>actually the live repo, but I I can

01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:14.820
<v Speaker 0>build a a prerelease version. That's not gonna

01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:15.700
<v Speaker 0>hurt anybody.

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:18.020
<v Speaker 0>But this will literally, like, kick off

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:20.180
<v Speaker 0>a GitHub workflow.

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:22.155
<v Speaker 0>And if I open it over here, you

01:03:22.155 --> 01:03:23.595
<v Speaker 0>know, you'll see it just this is your

01:03:23.595 --> 01:03:24.715
<v Speaker 0>familiar UI.

01:03:25.195 --> 01:03:26.955
<v Speaker 1>Are these integrations documented?

01:03:26.955 --> 01:03:28.155
<v Speaker 1>Because I I don't know how I missed

01:03:28.155 --> 01:03:30.635
<v Speaker 1>this. Like, do you list where these are?

01:03:31.515 --> 01:03:35.170
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. There is an integration section. So I

01:03:35.170 --> 01:03:36.450
<v Speaker 0>think cloud renderers,

01:03:36.450 --> 01:03:37.410
<v Speaker 0>AWS,

01:03:37.410 --> 01:03:41.410
<v Speaker 0>Cloud Run, Cloud Platform. Yeah. And yeah. Yeah.

01:03:41.410 --> 01:03:42.930
<v Speaker 0>There there yeah. Maybe a little hidden away

01:03:42.930 --> 01:03:45.250
<v Speaker 0>here. For example, Dagger is in here too.

01:03:46.530 --> 01:03:48.615
<v Speaker 0>And, yeah, we've there's also a lot to

01:03:48.615 --> 01:03:50.295
<v Speaker 0>get to, right, which is kinda, like, I

01:03:50.295 --> 01:03:52.055
<v Speaker 0>think, part of the problem, which is also

01:03:52.055 --> 01:03:53.415
<v Speaker 0>why I'm moving on because there's a lot

01:03:53.415 --> 01:03:54.135
<v Speaker 0>to get to.

01:03:56.215 --> 01:03:58.775
<v Speaker 0>So so the other killer feature in my

01:03:58.775 --> 01:04:00.775
<v Speaker 0>mind is, like, if you have a diverse

01:04:00.775 --> 01:04:03.110
<v Speaker 0>team, including people like Mix and some Windows

01:04:03.110 --> 01:04:03.830
<v Speaker 0>users,

01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:07.270
<v Speaker 0>you can actually peer your notebooks and your

01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:09.190
<v Speaker 0>documentation with, like, what I call an ops

01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.990
<v Speaker 0>container,

01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:12.070
<v Speaker 0>which is literally just a a fancy way

01:04:12.070 --> 01:04:13.910
<v Speaker 0>of saying a dev container.

01:04:14.865 --> 01:04:17.105
<v Speaker 0>But, like, since you you are more

01:04:17.905 --> 01:04:20.385
<v Speaker 0>operating software and not developing software, I like

01:04:20.385 --> 01:04:21.745
<v Speaker 0>calling it ops container.

01:04:21.985 --> 01:04:24.145
<v Speaker 0>So what I just did is my repo

01:04:24.145 --> 01:04:26.465
<v Speaker 0>here, I open up inside of the container.

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:29.740
<v Speaker 0>And what that will do is, like, I

01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:31.660
<v Speaker 0>have some generic container on it right now,

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:34.220
<v Speaker 0>but you could literally have any container image

01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:36.380
<v Speaker 0>running behind it. I think this just has

01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:39.020
<v Speaker 0>a bull's eye. Like, what is that? Debian,

01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:40.380
<v Speaker 0>I think. Yeah. Debian. Linux.

01:04:40.845 --> 01:04:41.405
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:04:41.725 --> 01:04:44.125
<v Speaker 0>And what's cool about it is now you

01:04:44.125 --> 01:04:46.605
<v Speaker 0>could go and lock in your dependencies,

01:04:46.605 --> 01:04:49.885
<v Speaker 0>your system dependencies. Right? Like, the kubectl version,

01:04:49.885 --> 01:04:51.645
<v Speaker 0>the the Terraform that you're using down to

01:04:51.645 --> 01:04:54.205
<v Speaker 0>the patch version and distribute the image and

01:04:54.205 --> 01:04:56.360
<v Speaker 0>just pin your image to this repo, and

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.520
<v Speaker 0>everybody always has the same dependencies. Right? There's

01:04:58.520 --> 01:04:59.400
<v Speaker 0>no excuse

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:01.560
<v Speaker 0>for the documentation not to work because the

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:05.240
<v Speaker 0>upstream system dependencies are not met. Right? And

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:07.880
<v Speaker 0>this is obviously kinda like an advanced feature.

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:10.280
<v Speaker 0>Right? Like, I think oftentimes documentation plan doesn't

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:11.640
<v Speaker 0>work because it's actually just long.

01:05:12.335 --> 01:05:14.654
<v Speaker 0>But there's another side to that coin, right,

01:05:14.654 --> 01:05:16.575
<v Speaker 0>where if your documentation is right, your system

01:05:16.575 --> 01:05:18.815
<v Speaker 0>dependencies might not be missed. Right? And and

01:05:18.815 --> 01:05:20.654
<v Speaker 0>this is just kinda like a fantastic way

01:05:20.654 --> 01:05:22.575
<v Speaker 0>to just bake it into it. Right?

01:05:23.615 --> 01:05:26.620
<v Speaker 0>And then distribute your repo like usual,

01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:28.540
<v Speaker 0>you know, and you can manage all of

01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:31.260
<v Speaker 0>your changes to your documentation through

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:34.300
<v Speaker 0>pull request, you know, a Git workflow.

01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:34.780
<v Speaker 0>And

01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:37.660
<v Speaker 0>but everybody can, you know, essentially have a

01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:38.700
<v Speaker 0>reproducible environment

01:05:39.225 --> 01:05:41.705
<v Speaker 0>and run the same stuff. Right? And without

01:05:41.705 --> 01:05:43.465
<v Speaker 0>having to, you know, sacrifice,

01:05:43.945 --> 01:05:45.465
<v Speaker 0>you know, the the the sort of comfort

01:05:45.465 --> 01:05:47.625
<v Speaker 0>of, like, having the same notebook UI because,

01:05:47.625 --> 01:05:49.385
<v Speaker 0>like, there is really no difference when you

01:05:49.385 --> 01:05:51.145
<v Speaker 0>look at it. Right? It says, like, I'm

01:05:51.145 --> 01:05:52.985
<v Speaker 0>running in a in a dev container. Right?

01:05:53.790 --> 01:05:56.030
<v Speaker 0>If I reopen this locally again

01:05:56.110 --> 01:05:57.710
<v Speaker 0>and I run the same cells, it will

01:05:57.710 --> 01:05:58.510
<v Speaker 0>say, like,

01:05:59.390 --> 01:06:01.550
<v Speaker 0>I'm running locally because I am running locally.

01:06:01.550 --> 01:06:02.110
<v Speaker 0>Right?

01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:05.150
<v Speaker 0>So

01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:07.464
<v Speaker 0>that's one way of, like, you know, sharing

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:08.825
<v Speaker 0>that with your team. And if you wanted

01:06:08.825 --> 01:06:10.105
<v Speaker 0>to get real fancy,

01:06:10.425 --> 01:06:11.865
<v Speaker 0>you could even I'm not sure if my

01:06:11.865 --> 01:06:13.865
<v Speaker 0>VM is up and running. But you can

01:06:13.865 --> 01:06:16.665
<v Speaker 0>also attach your Versus codes to a

01:06:16.984 --> 01:06:17.785
<v Speaker 0>remote

01:06:17.785 --> 01:06:19.065
<v Speaker 0>server using SSH.

01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:22.540
<v Speaker 0>So you maintain the same notebook UI locally,

01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:25.020
<v Speaker 0>but you are in fact running against,

01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:27.020
<v Speaker 0>you know, a jump host, for example.

01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:30.060
<v Speaker 0>And you could do the same thing with

01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:31.260
<v Speaker 0>code spaces

01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:33.900
<v Speaker 0>or get pod or any of those things.

01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:34.940
<v Speaker 0>Let me just open something.

01:06:37.664 --> 01:06:39.984
<v Speaker 0>And, you know, you basically have the same

01:06:39.984 --> 01:06:41.664
<v Speaker 0>UI, but, like, the subtle difference is, like,

01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:43.424
<v Speaker 0>now I'm actually on a remote host, and

01:06:43.424 --> 01:06:45.585
<v Speaker 0>you'll probably depending on how far away you

01:06:45.585 --> 01:06:46.944
<v Speaker 0>are from I think this runs on the

01:06:46.944 --> 01:06:48.464
<v Speaker 0>East Coast. You get a little bit of

01:06:48.464 --> 01:06:51.390
<v Speaker 0>latency. Right? But you have the same

01:06:52.030 --> 01:06:53.470
<v Speaker 0>you know, more or less the same

01:06:53.790 --> 01:06:55.310
<v Speaker 0>tools, the same environment,

01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:57.630
<v Speaker 0>but it runs remotely now. But my Chrome,

01:06:57.630 --> 01:06:58.830
<v Speaker 0>you know, what I'm seeing is they hold

01:06:58.830 --> 01:07:00.670
<v Speaker 0>the same. Right? And I get the same

01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:00.990
<v Speaker 0>features.

01:07:01.725 --> 01:07:03.485
<v Speaker 0>Nothing really changes, but it it's sort of

01:07:03.485 --> 01:07:04.765
<v Speaker 0>portable in the way that, like, we had

01:07:04.765 --> 01:07:06.845
<v Speaker 0>a computer and made a memory. It's almost,

01:07:06.925 --> 01:07:08.285
<v Speaker 0>you know, indistinguishable,

01:07:08.285 --> 01:07:10.845
<v Speaker 0>right, unless you look for the details here.

01:07:11.165 --> 01:07:11.885
<v Speaker 1>Nice.

01:07:12.445 --> 01:07:13.085
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:07:14.045 --> 01:07:14.925
<v Speaker 0>And

01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:17.490
<v Speaker 0>to kinda close the loop, right, because, you

01:07:17.490 --> 01:07:19.250
<v Speaker 0>know, it's upstream dependencies,

01:07:19.730 --> 01:07:21.410
<v Speaker 0>like, the system dependencies,

01:07:21.730 --> 01:07:23.010
<v Speaker 0>you know, credentials,

01:07:23.410 --> 01:07:24.050
<v Speaker 0>and then

01:07:24.370 --> 01:07:27.410
<v Speaker 0>documentation workflow and task being right, something that

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:29.090
<v Speaker 0>we're working on that's still

01:07:30.185 --> 01:07:32.105
<v Speaker 0>literally actively being worked on that I wanna

01:07:32.105 --> 01:07:33.465
<v Speaker 0>release soon is

01:07:33.945 --> 01:07:36.025
<v Speaker 0>this managed environment score.

01:07:37.225 --> 01:07:39.785
<v Speaker 0>We we we really wanna create way of

01:07:39.785 --> 01:07:41.785
<v Speaker 0>making it visible. Right? And

01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:44.860
<v Speaker 0>when I say visible is, like, also when

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:46.300
<v Speaker 0>you mutate it. So

01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:48.540
<v Speaker 0>this sounds a little esoteric, and I should

01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:50.940
<v Speaker 0>probably stop using computer science terms. But,

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:52.700
<v Speaker 0>you know, what you can see on the

01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:54.220
<v Speaker 0>bottom is, like, what is currently in my

01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:56.220
<v Speaker 0>managed environment store. Right? So

01:07:56.664 --> 01:07:58.744
<v Speaker 0>when runme starts a new session,

01:07:59.224 --> 01:08:01.625
<v Speaker 0>it'll look for dot infile, dot inf local

01:08:01.625 --> 01:08:03.545
<v Speaker 0>files, and then load them in your environment.

01:08:03.545 --> 01:08:04.904
<v Speaker 0>Right? And it also obviously does it with

01:08:04.904 --> 01:08:06.825
<v Speaker 0>your dash or your z shell or c.

01:08:08.550 --> 01:08:10.470
<v Speaker 0>One thing that we created, and that's that's

01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:12.390
<v Speaker 0>kind of the work in process, is, like,

01:08:12.550 --> 01:08:14.230
<v Speaker 0>a simple type system

01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:17.189
<v Speaker 0>so that you can describe your how your

01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:18.870
<v Speaker 0>environment is supposed to look like,

01:08:19.270 --> 01:08:21.430
<v Speaker 0>and it accounts for sensitivities

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:23.990
<v Speaker 0>of variables. Right? So one thing that I'm,

01:08:24.185 --> 01:08:26.104
<v Speaker 0>well, you know, somewhat proud of is, like,

01:08:26.104 --> 01:08:27.705
<v Speaker 0>I'm not shy to show you my OpenAI

01:08:27.705 --> 01:08:30.505
<v Speaker 0>key because it's redacted. Right? So I marked

01:08:30.505 --> 01:08:31.545
<v Speaker 0>this as a secret,

01:08:31.705 --> 01:08:33.225
<v Speaker 0>and now it's being shown as a secret.

01:08:33.225 --> 01:08:34.425
<v Speaker 0>So if I take a screenshot of it,

01:08:34.425 --> 01:08:35.785
<v Speaker 0>I don't have to worry about leaking my

01:08:35.785 --> 01:08:36.505
<v Speaker 0>secrets. Right?

01:08:38.389 --> 01:08:39.029
<v Speaker 0>And

01:08:39.270 --> 01:08:40.949
<v Speaker 0>if I, for example,

01:08:42.310 --> 01:08:44.710
<v Speaker 0>I could even overwrite, you know, like, values

01:08:44.710 --> 01:08:46.949
<v Speaker 0>in this environment story here. Let's say,

01:08:48.869 --> 01:08:50.469
<v Speaker 0>allow URL patterns. Right?

01:08:51.395 --> 01:08:53.154
<v Speaker 0>One thing that, you know, is also not

01:08:53.154 --> 01:08:56.274
<v Speaker 0>obvious, you can when you name a cell,

01:08:56.274 --> 01:08:57.875
<v Speaker 0>like, an environment variable,

01:08:58.035 --> 01:08:59.635
<v Speaker 0>the content of the cell will actually be

01:08:59.635 --> 01:09:01.314
<v Speaker 0>stuck into the like, it will wind up

01:09:01.314 --> 01:09:03.635
<v Speaker 0>in the environment. Right? So if I do

01:09:03.635 --> 01:09:04.915
<v Speaker 0>something like this

01:09:06.010 --> 01:09:07.450
<v Speaker 0>and then run this,

01:09:08.729 --> 01:09:10.330
<v Speaker 0>see how the value has changed to one,

01:09:10.330 --> 01:09:12.010
<v Speaker 0>two, three, four? Mhmm.

01:09:12.570 --> 01:09:14.010
<v Speaker 0>And, you know, so, like, it it it

01:09:14.010 --> 01:09:16.250
<v Speaker 0>tracks the values, you know, over time. Right?

01:09:16.250 --> 01:09:18.250
<v Speaker 0>So, like, even if you mutate them, it

01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:19.050
<v Speaker 0>will change.

01:09:19.930 --> 01:09:20.649
<v Speaker 0>Also

01:09:20.885 --> 01:09:22.805
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I seeded my environment

01:09:23.125 --> 01:09:25.365
<v Speaker 0>using this environment file.

01:09:26.405 --> 01:09:29.925
<v Speaker 0>But if I, for example, remove a required

01:09:31.045 --> 01:09:32.965
<v Speaker 0>variable, will show me, hey. My database URL

01:09:32.965 --> 01:09:33.525
<v Speaker 0>is not set.

01:09:34.939 --> 01:09:37.260
<v Speaker 0>So the idea here and I'm still building

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:39.179
<v Speaker 0>this out. We are you know, there are

01:09:39.179 --> 01:09:40.219
<v Speaker 0>sort of two

01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:42.060
<v Speaker 0>parts to this type system. One is sort

01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:44.060
<v Speaker 0>of like a a primitive type that just,

01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:45.819
<v Speaker 0>you know, controls the visibility

01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:47.659
<v Speaker 0>and whether or not it's required,

01:09:48.385 --> 01:09:49.744
<v Speaker 0>sort of a binary

01:09:49.904 --> 01:09:52.304
<v Speaker 0>that you need this to run your service,

01:09:52.304 --> 01:09:53.904
<v Speaker 0>your repo, your documentation.

01:09:54.385 --> 01:09:55.824
<v Speaker 0>And then we'll be layering on top of

01:09:55.824 --> 01:09:57.344
<v Speaker 0>that type as validation.

01:09:57.344 --> 01:09:58.704
<v Speaker 0>And in in this case,

01:09:59.105 --> 01:10:01.520
<v Speaker 0>you know, like, it it understands that database

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:03.840
<v Speaker 0>URL needs to be compliant to a database

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:06.400
<v Speaker 0>URL. Right? So it has to, you know,

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.560
<v Speaker 0>actually be a valid database URL, so, like,

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:10.560
<v Speaker 0>a Postgres, for example. Right?

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:11.520
<v Speaker 0>And

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.680
<v Speaker 0>what that then will do is, like, if

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:16.225
<v Speaker 0>I, for example, make up some stuff, I

01:10:16.225 --> 01:10:17.425
<v Speaker 0>call this Sebastian,

01:10:18.385 --> 01:10:20.545
<v Speaker 0>and I reset my environment, it will tell

01:10:20.545 --> 01:10:21.185
<v Speaker 0>me

01:10:21.905 --> 01:10:23.905
<v Speaker 0>that this is actually not valid.

01:10:25.025 --> 01:10:27.665
<v Speaker 0>Unknown database scheme. Right? And

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:29.680
<v Speaker 0>so this environment

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:31.520
<v Speaker 0>this managed environment store,

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:33.040
<v Speaker 0>you know, I almost kinda we wanna get

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:35.200
<v Speaker 0>to a place where you can include and

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:37.280
<v Speaker 0>we'll probably create some sort of CRD for

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:37.840
<v Speaker 0>this.

01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:39.920
<v Speaker 0>Right now, we lean it on the examples

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:42.400
<v Speaker 0>file where you essentially annotate it.

01:10:43.825 --> 01:10:45.585
<v Speaker 0>You will make it so that you can,

01:10:45.585 --> 01:10:47.425
<v Speaker 0>you know, type your environments.

01:10:48.065 --> 01:10:48.625
<v Speaker 0>And

01:10:49.105 --> 01:10:51.585
<v Speaker 0>that way, when you load into it, you

01:10:51.585 --> 01:10:53.585
<v Speaker 0>know what's missing. Right? If you have a

01:10:53.585 --> 01:10:55.860
<v Speaker 0>dot in file and it's partial, what's from

01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:57.780
<v Speaker 0>an older version, it will show you what

01:10:57.780 --> 01:10:59.460
<v Speaker 0>the difference is. It's like, oh, somebody introduced

01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:01.300
<v Speaker 0>a new environment there, but you haven't set

01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:04.100
<v Speaker 0>that one. Guess what? Your documentation won't work

01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:06.100
<v Speaker 0>because you're missing, you know, some core piece

01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:06.979
<v Speaker 0>to it. Right?

01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:08.900
<v Speaker 0>And,

01:11:09.665 --> 01:11:12.545
<v Speaker 0>you know, like, the idea is to specify,

01:11:12.705 --> 01:11:13.985
<v Speaker 0>you know, in a in a sort of,

01:11:13.985 --> 01:11:16.065
<v Speaker 0>like, well formed way how your environment is

01:11:16.065 --> 01:11:17.105
<v Speaker 0>supposed to look like.

01:11:17.425 --> 01:11:18.785
<v Speaker 0>And then another layer that we can lay

01:11:18.785 --> 01:11:20.145
<v Speaker 0>on top of it that I'm still working

01:11:20.145 --> 01:11:21.665
<v Speaker 0>on is that we can also do resolution.

01:11:21.665 --> 01:11:22.625
<v Speaker 0>Right? I can go

01:11:22.990 --> 01:11:24.350
<v Speaker 0>use your GCP

01:11:24.670 --> 01:11:25.550
<v Speaker 0>identity

01:11:25.950 --> 01:11:28.030
<v Speaker 0>and, you know, like, go into the GCP

01:11:28.030 --> 01:11:30.350
<v Speaker 0>secret manager or use, you know, a cloud

01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:31.230
<v Speaker 0>key MS

01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:34.110
<v Speaker 0>to either decrypt some stuff or grab them

01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:36.205
<v Speaker 0>from a secret manager. I didn't I was

01:11:36.205 --> 01:11:38.445
<v Speaker 1>literally about to ask you for that feature

01:11:38.445 --> 01:11:40.605
<v Speaker 1>when you showed me the episode there because

01:11:40.685 --> 01:11:41.645
<v Speaker 1>I use

01:11:41.965 --> 01:11:45.405
<v Speaker 1>GCP secret manager with bare glass secret references.

01:11:45.485 --> 01:11:47.565
<v Speaker 1>And I was like, if you could just

01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:49.100
<v Speaker 1>detect all of those bare glass secret references

01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:51.100
<v Speaker 1>and resolve them with the g cloud CLI,

01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:51.499
<v Speaker 1>like,

01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:54.460
<v Speaker 1>that would be phenomenal. Like No. That's that's

01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:55.340
<v Speaker 0>that's

01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:56.459
<v Speaker 0>exactly the plan.

01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:58.460
<v Speaker 0>And, you know, you probably get an environment

01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:00.139
<v Speaker 0>picker where you click down here.

01:12:00.699 --> 01:12:03.375
<v Speaker 0>And, you know, you can say, like, staging

01:12:03.375 --> 01:12:06.655
<v Speaker 0>one, staging US, staging Europe, production. And so

01:12:06.655 --> 01:12:08.735
<v Speaker 0>so, like, I think, like, it will not

01:12:08.735 --> 01:12:11.775
<v Speaker 0>just resolve. It might also prevent accidents because,

01:12:11.775 --> 01:12:15.054
<v Speaker 0>like, I remember some company, like, six months

01:12:15.054 --> 01:12:17.640
<v Speaker 0>ago posted a postmortem on on Hacker News,

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:20.040
<v Speaker 0>how they accidentally blew their production database away

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:22.840
<v Speaker 0>because somebody had their local environment configured to

01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:25.080
<v Speaker 0>point at production without knowing. Right?

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:26.040
<v Speaker 0>And

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:28.280
<v Speaker 0>this is, like, highly programmable.

01:12:29.375 --> 01:12:31.135
<v Speaker 0>So, you know, like, what you're seeing here

01:12:31.135 --> 01:12:32.974
<v Speaker 0>is really, like, kinda like a UI version

01:12:33.375 --> 01:12:34.735
<v Speaker 0>of it, but, like, what's under the hood

01:12:34.735 --> 01:12:36.655
<v Speaker 0>is, like, a graph representation of it. So

01:12:36.655 --> 01:12:39.135
<v Speaker 0>I can also do the same view in

01:12:39.135 --> 01:12:42.010
<v Speaker 0>in the CLI. So I get, like, the

01:12:42.010 --> 01:12:43.849
<v Speaker 0>same listing where it's from.

01:12:44.409 --> 01:12:46.729
<v Speaker 0>And and, you know, like, the resolution

01:12:46.730 --> 01:12:48.170
<v Speaker 0>aspect of it, I still need to build

01:12:48.170 --> 01:12:49.449
<v Speaker 0>out, but, like, it's

01:12:49.770 --> 01:12:51.369
<v Speaker 0>pretty easy to lay on top of it

01:12:51.369 --> 01:12:52.810
<v Speaker 0>once you, you know, once you have a

01:12:52.810 --> 01:12:54.650
<v Speaker 0>specification of how your environment has to look

01:12:54.650 --> 01:12:56.975
<v Speaker 0>like. And then my my sort of idea

01:12:56.975 --> 01:12:57.855
<v Speaker 0>for the resolve

01:12:58.175 --> 01:13:00.895
<v Speaker 0>resolver part, and sounds like this would help

01:13:00.895 --> 01:13:03.775
<v Speaker 0>you too, is to ideally just use conventions.

01:13:03.775 --> 01:13:05.535
<v Speaker 0>Right? Like, you know you know it's a

01:13:05.535 --> 01:13:07.455
<v Speaker 0>secret, and then, you know, this looks like

01:13:07.455 --> 01:13:09.560
<v Speaker 0>this. If you lower case it, that's the

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:11.400
<v Speaker 0>value is inside of the secret manager using

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:14.040
<v Speaker 0>that project. Right? To kinda, like, make it

01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:16.200
<v Speaker 0>really easy and not create yet another, you

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:17.960
<v Speaker 0>know, YAML file, another thing where you have

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.480
<v Speaker 0>to then manage your mapping. Right?

01:13:21.445 --> 01:13:23.525
<v Speaker 0>But that's all kinda, like, the loosey goosey

01:13:23.525 --> 01:13:26.325
<v Speaker 0>still because it's, like, literally inactive development. Right?

01:13:26.325 --> 01:13:27.845
<v Speaker 1>Hey. Shit. I want it I want it

01:13:27.845 --> 01:13:30.325
<v Speaker 1>today, please. Like, just Yeah. Yeah. Like, I'm

01:13:30.325 --> 01:13:32.005
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to. I'm going to. Like, the

01:13:32.005 --> 01:13:33.125
<v Speaker 0>thing that I wanna do is I wanna

01:13:33.125 --> 01:13:34.885
<v Speaker 0>do a little bit more work to go

01:13:34.885 --> 01:13:35.125
<v Speaker 0>from,

01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:38.179
<v Speaker 0>you know, the managed environments to a currently

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:40.820
<v Speaker 0>like, you only really ever need to describe,

01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:42.260
<v Speaker 0>you know, sort of the critical part of

01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:44.420
<v Speaker 0>the environment. Right? But all the other part

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:46.579
<v Speaker 0>of the environment is still in here. Right?

01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:48.100
<v Speaker 0>What I wanna do is, like, just make

01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:50.260
<v Speaker 0>sure that we showcase how the validation works

01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:51.219
<v Speaker 0>a little bit better

01:13:51.675 --> 01:13:54.715
<v Speaker 0>because the validation part is also something that

01:13:54.715 --> 01:13:57.835
<v Speaker 0>then you can customize. Right? So, essentially, this

01:13:57.835 --> 01:13:59.755
<v Speaker 0>database URL, when there will probably be a

01:13:59.755 --> 01:14:00.875
<v Speaker 0>bunch of ones that come out of the

01:14:00.875 --> 01:14:03.275
<v Speaker 0>box because everybody needs them, but you can

01:14:03.275 --> 01:14:05.675
<v Speaker 0>literally also write your own, right, where you

01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:08.150
<v Speaker 0>I think I used the validator library, the

01:14:08.150 --> 01:14:09.110
<v Speaker 0>Golang one,

01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:11.430
<v Speaker 0>and you can you can just,

01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:14.550
<v Speaker 0>you know, make up your own. Right? But

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:16.310
<v Speaker 0>the good news is it's gonna be inside

01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:17.990
<v Speaker 0>of your repo. Right? And your repo is

01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:20.335
<v Speaker 0>collocated with your dependencies. It's collocated with your

01:14:20.335 --> 01:14:23.135
<v Speaker 0>documentation. It's collocated with your environment spec.

01:14:23.375 --> 01:14:24.015
<v Speaker 0>Right?

01:14:24.495 --> 01:14:26.655
<v Speaker 0>And then the resolution can either use your

01:14:26.655 --> 01:14:29.455
<v Speaker 0>human identity, right, my GCP identity because I

01:14:29.455 --> 01:14:31.615
<v Speaker 0>ran, what was it, g cloud auth login.

01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:34.280
<v Speaker 0>But in CI, I can use the same

01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:36.519
<v Speaker 0>thing. I just use a workload identity. Right?

01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:37.639
<v Speaker 0>So that way,

01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:40.760
<v Speaker 0>we get away from doing this thing where

01:14:41.079 --> 01:14:43.960
<v Speaker 0>we stick all this information inside of GitHub

01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:44.679
<v Speaker 0>or

01:14:44.935 --> 01:14:45.815
<v Speaker 0>GitLab.

01:14:45.815 --> 01:14:47.574
<v Speaker 0>And then anytime we wanna move from one

01:14:47.574 --> 01:14:48.695
<v Speaker 0>CI to the other, we have to go

01:14:48.695 --> 01:14:50.054
<v Speaker 0>in and figure out what all these these

01:14:50.054 --> 01:14:52.775
<v Speaker 0>variables are here. Right? What's this stuff here?

01:14:52.775 --> 01:14:54.295
<v Speaker 0>Right? So, I mean,

01:14:54.695 --> 01:14:56.534
<v Speaker 0>call me call me a you know, call

01:14:56.534 --> 01:14:57.735
<v Speaker 0>me crazy or, like, maybe you have a

01:14:57.735 --> 01:14:59.380
<v Speaker 0>chip on my shoulder, but, like, I think

01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:01.220
<v Speaker 0>we're really handing over all of our bargaining

01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:02.900
<v Speaker 0>chips to these cloud providers so they can

01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:04.659
<v Speaker 0>charge us for locking us in.

01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:06.900
<v Speaker 0>If we could just do something like this

01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:09.060
<v Speaker 0>and then actually also make the user experience

01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:11.700
<v Speaker 0>better because, like, if my environment is incomplete,

01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:13.300
<v Speaker 0>the thing will actually yell at me. Right?

01:15:13.915 --> 01:15:14.554
<v Speaker 0>And,

01:15:14.795 --> 01:15:16.155
<v Speaker 0>you know, there's also, like, a lot of

01:15:16.155 --> 01:15:17.834
<v Speaker 0>stuff you could put on top of it.

01:15:17.995 --> 01:15:19.275
<v Speaker 0>For example, what I really want is a

01:15:19.275 --> 01:15:20.554
<v Speaker 0>little button here that says, like, ping my

01:15:20.554 --> 01:15:21.275
<v Speaker 0>database

01:15:21.355 --> 01:15:22.795
<v Speaker 0>and make sure I can actually connect to

01:15:22.795 --> 01:15:23.755
<v Speaker 0>it. Right?

01:15:23.915 --> 01:15:25.755
<v Speaker 0>Like, imagine how how many, like, you know,

01:15:25.755 --> 01:15:27.195
<v Speaker 0>how how you don't have to, like, look

01:15:27.195 --> 01:15:29.370
<v Speaker 0>for a needle on the haystack. Right? Where

01:15:29.370 --> 01:15:32.090
<v Speaker 0>if a base 64 encoded string has a

01:15:32.090 --> 01:15:34.250
<v Speaker 0>space at the end. Right? And the base

01:15:34.250 --> 01:15:36.810
<v Speaker 0>64 encoding is, like, you know, falling over

01:15:36.810 --> 01:15:38.490
<v Speaker 0>and you spend hours of your life trying

01:15:38.490 --> 01:15:40.490
<v Speaker 0>to figure out where that problem comes from,

01:15:40.490 --> 01:15:42.804
<v Speaker 0>turns out the environment variable is just ever

01:15:42.804 --> 01:15:44.164
<v Speaker 0>so slightly wrong. Right?

01:15:44.885 --> 01:15:46.885
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It means you could like, one of

01:15:46.885 --> 01:15:48.645
<v Speaker 1>my use cases is which I think you're

01:15:48.645 --> 01:15:50.485
<v Speaker 1>gonna be able to support just by everything

01:15:50.485 --> 01:15:51.764
<v Speaker 1>that you're building here is, like, you know,

01:15:51.764 --> 01:15:53.844
<v Speaker 1>there's a command for deploying to production, but

01:15:53.844 --> 01:15:55.204
<v Speaker 1>there's a big note above it saying you

01:15:55.204 --> 01:15:57.284
<v Speaker 1>need access to these secrets. And it's like,

01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:59.190
<v Speaker 1>you could just have little text saying, hey.

01:15:59.190 --> 01:16:01.510
<v Speaker 1>You can run this command. And, like Yeah.

01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:03.190
<v Speaker 1>I I did not expect to see this,

01:16:03.190 --> 01:16:04.630
<v Speaker 1>and I could not be happier to see

01:16:04.630 --> 01:16:06.309
<v Speaker 1>this. This is a fantastic feature.

01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:08.070
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. But what what we're trying to with

01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:09.750
<v Speaker 0>runme is is and, you know, like, you

01:16:09.750 --> 01:16:12.065
<v Speaker 0>kinda, like, wind up wandering off into, like,

01:16:12.065 --> 01:16:15.265
<v Speaker 0>little pockets because, like, certain features resonate immediately.

01:16:15.505 --> 01:16:17.025
<v Speaker 0>But what we're trying to get to is,

01:16:17.025 --> 01:16:18.865
<v Speaker 0>like, you know, not to solve the greatest

01:16:18.865 --> 01:16:20.545
<v Speaker 0>problems of computer science. I wish I could

01:16:20.545 --> 01:16:22.145
<v Speaker 0>that. I'm really not that smart.

01:16:23.185 --> 01:16:24.945
<v Speaker 0>Like, you know, key versus NP and then

01:16:24.945 --> 01:16:25.825
<v Speaker 0>all that stuff. But,

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:28.239
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I didn't think I was ever

01:16:28.239 --> 01:16:29.760
<v Speaker 0>gonna say I'm gonna build my own type

01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:31.280
<v Speaker 0>system, but, like, you know, I wind up

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:31.999
<v Speaker 0>doing it.

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:34.640
<v Speaker 0>But what we wanna do is, like, have

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:37.040
<v Speaker 0>essentially a complete tool a complete tool chain,

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:38.000
<v Speaker 0>a complete suite

01:16:38.325 --> 01:16:40.725
<v Speaker 0>that solves these problems that we're getting bogged

01:16:40.725 --> 01:16:42.405
<v Speaker 0>down, especially as humans

01:16:42.725 --> 01:16:43.525
<v Speaker 0>because

01:16:43.525 --> 01:16:44.405
<v Speaker 0>DevOps

01:16:44.405 --> 01:16:46.005
<v Speaker 0>and cloud infrastructure,

01:16:46.325 --> 01:16:48.645
<v Speaker 0>instead of, like, the left shift have worked

01:16:48.645 --> 01:16:50.965
<v Speaker 0>backwards from production. And I feel like now

01:16:50.965 --> 01:16:52.890
<v Speaker 0>we have sort of, like, this massive gap

01:16:52.890 --> 01:16:54.570
<v Speaker 0>in between. We have all this tooling

01:16:54.890 --> 01:16:57.370
<v Speaker 0>that, like, things like machines and treats things

01:16:57.370 --> 01:16:59.210
<v Speaker 0>like machines, and it works really well with

01:16:59.210 --> 01:17:01.130
<v Speaker 0>that. But once you hit the human, it's

01:17:01.130 --> 01:17:02.490
<v Speaker 0>kinda like, oh, you have to fill in

01:17:02.490 --> 01:17:05.130
<v Speaker 0>the gaps. Right? Like, here's the environments,

01:17:05.210 --> 01:17:06.490
<v Speaker 0>you know, the angles that you have to

01:17:06.490 --> 01:17:09.095
<v Speaker 0>fill out. Good luck. Find the values yourself.

01:17:09.095 --> 01:17:10.375
<v Speaker 0>Right? So

01:17:10.775 --> 01:17:13.015
<v Speaker 0>I'm not against, you know, the left shift,

01:17:13.015 --> 01:17:15.335
<v Speaker 0>and I'm not against developer tooling, but, like,

01:17:15.335 --> 01:17:17.175
<v Speaker 0>I think making it so that we can

01:17:17.175 --> 01:17:19.095
<v Speaker 0>connect the human better

01:17:19.335 --> 01:17:21.415
<v Speaker 0>to, you know, all the work that we've

01:17:21.415 --> 01:17:22.775
<v Speaker 0>done in the last ten or fifteen years,

01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:24.740
<v Speaker 0>I think it's sort of like we had

01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:27.460
<v Speaker 0>a developer gap actually is. Right? It's like,

01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:29.460
<v Speaker 0>how do we, you know, make no difference

01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:31.700
<v Speaker 0>between a human identity and a workload identity?

01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:34.500
<v Speaker 0>Right? And I think this amongst, you know,

01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:35.940
<v Speaker 0>all these other things is a way to

01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:37.700
<v Speaker 0>bridge that gap. Right? Is it perfect? Probably

01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:38.900
<v Speaker 0>not because it's very incomplete.

01:17:39.755 --> 01:17:41.275
<v Speaker 0>But I'm glad to hear that, like, I

01:17:41.275 --> 01:17:43.435
<v Speaker 0>just recruited David Flanagan as a as a

01:17:43.435 --> 01:17:44.314
<v Speaker 0>better user.

01:17:45.755 --> 01:17:47.435
<v Speaker 1>Hey. If I could give you a beer

01:17:47.435 --> 01:17:48.954
<v Speaker 1>or a high five right now, I totally

01:17:48.954 --> 01:17:49.435
<v Speaker 1>would like

01:17:50.235 --> 01:17:52.074
<v Speaker 1>I I could be happier to see this

01:17:52.074 --> 01:17:54.635
<v Speaker 1>feature in development. You and you mentioned something

01:17:54.635 --> 01:17:55.940
<v Speaker 1>earlier that but now it makes a whole

01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:57.380
<v Speaker 1>lot more sense. Was it you said you

01:17:57.380 --> 01:17:59.700
<v Speaker 1>were gonna support DuraEnf. Right? I'm assuming that's

01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:02.340
<v Speaker 1>part of this this work. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:04.340
<v Speaker 0>So DuraEnf is is kinda, like, helpful in

01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:06.180
<v Speaker 0>two ways. Right? A, people already use it

01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:06.980
<v Speaker 0>in cat.

01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:08.900
<v Speaker 0>We'll be able to ditch a lot of,

01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:10.580
<v Speaker 0>like, extra code you put into your task

01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:11.060
<v Speaker 0>files

01:18:11.755 --> 01:18:14.795
<v Speaker 0>because, like, the way we share environments between

01:18:14.795 --> 01:18:17.675
<v Speaker 0>cells is not we don't we don't share

01:18:17.675 --> 01:18:19.675
<v Speaker 0>it the way a bash script would. We

01:18:19.675 --> 01:18:22.555
<v Speaker 0>actually snapshot the environment before and after and

01:18:22.555 --> 01:18:24.315
<v Speaker 0>then and then put it in this managed

01:18:24.315 --> 01:18:26.500
<v Speaker 0>environment store so we can also then port

01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:28.740
<v Speaker 0>it between modalities. Right? Modality, you're being a

01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:29.460
<v Speaker 0>notebook.

01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:32.420
<v Speaker 0>I mean, another thing that, like, you'll probably

01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:33.860
<v Speaker 0>see is we can also run blocks from

01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:34.340
<v Speaker 0>here.

01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:36.420
<v Speaker 0>And what we wanted to do is, like,

01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:37.860
<v Speaker 0>we didn't want people to fall into yet

01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:40.900
<v Speaker 0>another fault line between one modality into another.

01:18:41.375 --> 01:18:43.855
<v Speaker 0>So if you complete the environment over here,

01:18:44.175 --> 01:18:46.015
<v Speaker 0>it was really important to me and to

01:18:46.015 --> 01:18:47.855
<v Speaker 0>us that then when you run it on

01:18:47.855 --> 01:18:49.455
<v Speaker 0>another in another place that it has the

01:18:49.455 --> 01:18:50.895
<v Speaker 0>same values. Right? So this is why we

01:18:50.895 --> 01:18:52.494
<v Speaker 0>have this managed environment store.

01:18:52.735 --> 01:18:55.489
<v Speaker 0>So now the problem in the theory of

01:18:55.489 --> 01:18:57.650
<v Speaker 0>interest solving is, like, it's just a program

01:18:57.650 --> 01:19:00.050
<v Speaker 0>away of of, you know, I guess, specifying

01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:01.730
<v Speaker 0>a dot in file. Right? Because it allows

01:19:01.730 --> 01:19:02.849
<v Speaker 0>you to write shell.

01:19:03.170 --> 01:19:04.450
<v Speaker 0>The other thing that it allows you to

01:19:04.450 --> 01:19:06.770
<v Speaker 0>do is, like, there might be some prerequisite

01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:08.695
<v Speaker 0>steps, you know, whether it's, like, you wanna

01:19:08.695 --> 01:19:10.215
<v Speaker 0>run some stuff where,

01:19:10.295 --> 01:19:11.735
<v Speaker 0>you know, like, what's the command to get

01:19:11.735 --> 01:19:14.455
<v Speaker 0>the Google project. Right? It's like g cloud

01:19:14.455 --> 01:19:16.295
<v Speaker 0>config gets. Right?

01:19:17.015 --> 01:19:18.775
<v Speaker 0>You might just wanna run this and and

01:19:18.775 --> 01:19:21.679
<v Speaker 0>and and stash it into environment file. Sorry.

01:19:21.679 --> 01:19:24.080
<v Speaker 0>Into an environment variable to then use it

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.840
<v Speaker 0>downstream in your documentation. You wanna run it

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:27.999
<v Speaker 0>every time somebody starts a new session. Right?

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:29.840
<v Speaker 0>So it kinda gives you the ability to

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:30.559
<v Speaker 0>define

01:19:30.719 --> 01:19:33.120
<v Speaker 0>some prerequisite code that needs to run, in

01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:34.000
<v Speaker 0>this case, stash.

01:19:34.525 --> 01:19:36.045
<v Speaker 0>So it it it kinda checks a lot

01:19:36.045 --> 01:19:37.405
<v Speaker 0>of boxes, and then I also like the

01:19:37.405 --> 01:19:39.245
<v Speaker 0>way they authorize. Right? They they ask you,

01:19:39.245 --> 01:19:41.565
<v Speaker 0>like, are you okay with running this? Right?

01:19:41.565 --> 01:19:43.645
<v Speaker 0>It kinda fits into this runme philosophy where

01:19:43.645 --> 01:19:45.165
<v Speaker 0>we want things to be easy,

01:19:45.645 --> 01:19:47.005
<v Speaker 0>but we don't want them to be easy

01:19:47.005 --> 01:19:48.365
<v Speaker 0>at the expense of being secure.

01:19:51.410 --> 01:19:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Cat was just saying that's one of

01:19:53.170 --> 01:19:54.929
<v Speaker 1>the things that blew our mind after already

01:19:54.929 --> 01:19:56.610
<v Speaker 1>adopting the tool. I mean, same for me.

01:19:56.610 --> 01:19:58.050
<v Speaker 1>I've been using runme for

01:19:58.690 --> 01:20:00.690
<v Speaker 1>weeks now, and I could not be more

01:20:00.690 --> 01:20:03.675
<v Speaker 1>excited for this end store. So that's amazing.

01:20:03.675 --> 01:20:04.875
<v Speaker 0>Right. And and, you know, that's something that

01:20:04.875 --> 01:20:06.955
<v Speaker 0>I wanna release, you know, ideally in the

01:20:06.955 --> 01:20:07.995
<v Speaker 0>next four weeks.

01:20:08.555 --> 01:20:10.795
<v Speaker 0>If you if you're really curious,

01:20:11.435 --> 01:20:13.675
<v Speaker 0>there is a little bit of documentation on

01:20:13.915 --> 01:20:16.730
<v Speaker 0>I mean, kinda like the principles of it

01:20:17.050 --> 01:20:18.570
<v Speaker 0>on the repository.

01:20:18.810 --> 01:20:20.410
<v Speaker 0>By the way, the managed environment, so I

01:20:20.410 --> 01:20:22.410
<v Speaker 0>call our store because, like, you know, when

01:20:22.410 --> 01:20:24.090
<v Speaker 0>you when you figure out the environment, that's

01:20:24.090 --> 01:20:25.850
<v Speaker 0>what you left with. Right? It's like,

01:20:26.090 --> 01:20:28.615
<v Speaker 0>I I blacked out the let's call it

01:20:28.615 --> 01:20:30.695
<v Speaker 0>freaking so we don't have to use exodus.

01:20:31.415 --> 01:20:33.495
<v Speaker 0>So it's called because also a much cooler

01:20:33.495 --> 01:20:36.215
<v Speaker 0>three letter acronym than inf. So internally, we

01:20:36.215 --> 01:20:36.775
<v Speaker 0>call it the.

01:20:37.495 --> 01:20:39.975
<v Speaker 0>But in in the UI, you will just

01:20:39.975 --> 01:20:42.520
<v Speaker 0>notice that there's another tab down here where

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:45.559
<v Speaker 0>in the CLI, you can run snapshots.

01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:49.000
<v Speaker 0>But, you know, this is the idea is

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.080
<v Speaker 0>very simple. Right? It's like it's a very

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:52.360
<v Speaker 0>simple type system

01:20:52.679 --> 01:20:54.840
<v Speaker 0>that basically just describes how the environment needs

01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:57.085
<v Speaker 0>to look like, right, both from a security

01:20:57.085 --> 01:20:59.005
<v Speaker 0>standpoint so you don't leak secrets,

01:20:59.165 --> 01:21:01.405
<v Speaker 0>but then also has validation built in.

01:21:01.645 --> 01:21:02.925
<v Speaker 0>And then with this sort of, like, three

01:21:02.925 --> 01:21:04.764
<v Speaker 0>way relationship, you have a name, you have

01:21:04.764 --> 01:21:05.485
<v Speaker 0>a type,

01:21:05.804 --> 01:21:07.405
<v Speaker 0>and you have a value. You know, like,

01:21:07.405 --> 01:21:08.685
<v Speaker 0>when you have two, you can find the

01:21:08.685 --> 01:21:09.324
<v Speaker 0>third one. Right?

01:21:10.630 --> 01:21:12.789
<v Speaker 0>And the caveat here is, like, to find

01:21:12.789 --> 01:21:14.710
<v Speaker 0>the third one, you can take human identity

01:21:14.710 --> 01:21:16.869
<v Speaker 0>into account. You can take into account what

01:21:16.869 --> 01:21:18.469
<v Speaker 0>device you're running on. Right? Are you running

01:21:18.469 --> 01:21:20.309
<v Speaker 0>on a code spaces instance or on your

01:21:20.309 --> 01:21:22.309
<v Speaker 0>local laptop? Right? So there's a lot of,

01:21:22.309 --> 01:21:24.725
<v Speaker 0>like, security hygiene you can do out of

01:21:24.725 --> 01:21:26.645
<v Speaker 0>the box without burdening the user. Right? I

01:21:26.645 --> 01:21:28.725
<v Speaker 0>mean, whether it's, like, rotating certificates.

01:21:29.765 --> 01:21:32.085
<v Speaker 0>And I build it all on on GraphQL,

01:21:32.085 --> 01:21:34.005
<v Speaker 0>which I was, like, kinda, like, going back

01:21:34.005 --> 01:21:35.445
<v Speaker 0>and forth on until I thought I saw

01:21:35.445 --> 01:21:36.805
<v Speaker 0>the dagger was doing it too, I was

01:21:36.805 --> 01:21:37.925
<v Speaker 0>like, well, if they're doing it, then why

01:21:37.925 --> 01:21:39.889
<v Speaker 0>should I be doing it.

01:21:40.449 --> 01:21:42.449
<v Speaker 0>But what that helps me do is, like

01:21:42.530 --> 01:21:43.810
<v Speaker 0>and you don't have after I graph you

01:21:43.810 --> 01:21:46.050
<v Speaker 0>all. Right? This is really just to serialize

01:21:46.369 --> 01:21:48.130
<v Speaker 0>sort of what's going on inside of that

01:21:48.130 --> 01:21:49.969
<v Speaker 0>in store. This is all kind of inside

01:21:49.969 --> 01:21:50.610
<v Speaker 0>of a kernel.

01:21:51.045 --> 01:21:53.445
<v Speaker 0>The UI you interact with is this, right,

01:21:53.445 --> 01:21:54.164
<v Speaker 0>where,

01:21:54.485 --> 01:21:56.965
<v Speaker 0>you know, the specification file. But what it

01:21:56.965 --> 01:21:58.485
<v Speaker 0>allows us to do or, like, allows me

01:21:58.485 --> 01:22:00.485
<v Speaker 0>to do is, like, I can have a

01:22:00.485 --> 01:22:02.565
<v Speaker 0>simple dot end example file where I can

01:22:02.565 --> 01:22:04.800
<v Speaker 0>have a CRD or I can have the

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:06.720
<v Speaker 0>the the sort of, like, on ramps into

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:07.920
<v Speaker 0>how to specify

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
<v Speaker 0>an environment that the front end for that

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.840
<v Speaker 0>can be completely agnostic

01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:14.720
<v Speaker 0>to the environment store. Right? And and then,

01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:15.840
<v Speaker 0>you know, like, here,

01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:18.400
<v Speaker 0>you know, whether you use a shell command

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.855
<v Speaker 0>to resolve the values, right, or you use

01:22:20.855 --> 01:22:22.135
<v Speaker 0>some custom webhook,

01:22:22.295 --> 01:22:24.455
<v Speaker 0>or you use the stateful products, or you

01:22:24.455 --> 01:22:27.575
<v Speaker 0>use a secret manager. Right? It's kinda programmable

01:22:27.575 --> 01:22:29.975
<v Speaker 0>in that way. So it kinda like yeah.

01:22:29.975 --> 01:22:31.975
<v Speaker 0>It really was to, like, leave the room

01:22:31.975 --> 01:22:33.895
<v Speaker 0>open for people to, like, be opinionated about

01:22:33.895 --> 01:22:36.660
<v Speaker 0>how they wanna resolve their configuration values and

01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:38.260
<v Speaker 0>their secrets. Right? If they wanna build their

01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:40.180
<v Speaker 0>own or if they wanna use what my

01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:41.780
<v Speaker 0>company builds or if they just wanna use

01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:44.100
<v Speaker 0>a vanilla, you know, secret manager inside of

01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:45.380
<v Speaker 0>AWS or or GCP.

01:22:47.475 --> 01:22:49.074
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So, like, a lot of work has

01:22:49.074 --> 01:22:50.114
<v Speaker 0>gone into this,

01:22:50.435 --> 01:22:52.355
<v Speaker 0>and I feel like, you know, anytime I

01:22:52.355 --> 01:22:53.955
<v Speaker 0>wanna release it, I find something else. But

01:22:53.955 --> 01:22:55.315
<v Speaker 0>I think I just kinda have to jump

01:22:55.315 --> 01:22:56.354
<v Speaker 0>jump the shark

01:22:56.994 --> 01:22:58.195
<v Speaker 0>release it.

01:22:58.435 --> 01:22:59.474
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.

01:22:59.715 --> 01:23:00.594
<v Speaker 1>That is super cool.

01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:03.680
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. And, you know, if anybody is, like,

01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:05.760
<v Speaker 0>sort of computer science y and interested in,

01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:07.120
<v Speaker 0>like, how this stuff works,

01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:10.400
<v Speaker 0>it's all, like, a little go kernel.

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:12.400
<v Speaker 0>And, you know, like, my plan would be

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:14.720
<v Speaker 0>to continue to develop it inside of runme,

01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:15.840
<v Speaker 0>but, like, what I really wanna do is

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:18.035
<v Speaker 0>spin it out into probably a tool called

01:23:18.035 --> 01:23:18.915
<v Speaker 0>OWL that

01:23:19.475 --> 01:23:21.795
<v Speaker 0>really only does this one thing, which is,

01:23:22.035 --> 01:23:23.395
<v Speaker 0>you know, specify,

01:23:23.875 --> 01:23:26.835
<v Speaker 0>validate, and resolve environment variables and and do

01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:28.035
<v Speaker 0>that in a way where you can use

01:23:28.035 --> 01:23:28.915
<v Speaker 0>human identity

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:32.000
<v Speaker 0>and and workload identity. Right? And just kinda

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.160
<v Speaker 0>do away with all these paper cuts. Right?

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:34.719
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:37.200
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Yeah. So I took you on a

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:40.000
<v Speaker 0>esoteric, you know, turn there, but I feel

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.400
<v Speaker 0>like this is an unsolved problem of, you

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:43.120
<v Speaker 0>know, software

01:23:43.745 --> 01:23:45.265
<v Speaker 0>and, you know, the the what is it?

01:23:45.265 --> 01:23:48.065
<v Speaker 0>The 12 factor movement has done a good

01:23:48.065 --> 01:23:50.225
<v Speaker 0>job separating configuration from the environment,

01:23:50.385 --> 01:23:51.585
<v Speaker 0>but sort of at the detriment of the

01:23:51.585 --> 01:23:53.585
<v Speaker 0>human. And I'm trying to close that gap

01:23:53.585 --> 01:23:55.345
<v Speaker 0>now. Right? And and I think it was,

01:23:55.345 --> 01:23:56.385
<v Speaker 0>you know, right to do that,

01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:59.120
<v Speaker 0>but it is annoying that we now, you

01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:01.120
<v Speaker 0>know, have nothing that makes this easy, and

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:03.039
<v Speaker 0>I think this will resolve that problem.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.040
<v Speaker 1>No. I appreciate that segue down this path.

01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:07.679
<v Speaker 1>That is

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.520
<v Speaker 1>you know, this is exactly the thing I

01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:11.375
<v Speaker 1>wanted. Well, not that I wanted to see

01:24:11.375 --> 01:24:12.415
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't know I was going to

01:24:12.415 --> 01:24:13.775
<v Speaker 1>see it, but the fact that now that

01:24:13.775 --> 01:24:14.974
<v Speaker 1>I know this exists

01:24:15.455 --> 01:24:17.375
<v Speaker 1>and that this problem is being solved makes

01:24:17.375 --> 01:24:18.974
<v Speaker 1>me a very happy man because

01:24:19.215 --> 01:24:22.735
<v Speaker 1>I have spent weeks in fact, probably months

01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:24.670
<v Speaker 1>going from secret manager tool to environment tool,

01:24:24.670 --> 01:24:26.350
<v Speaker 1>from dot env to dot env x to

01:24:26.350 --> 01:24:28.910
<v Speaker 1>in physical to Google secrets manager to one

01:24:28.910 --> 01:24:30.590
<v Speaker 1>password to Doppler.

01:24:30.910 --> 01:24:32.350
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to just rack my brain

01:24:32.350 --> 01:24:34.385
<v Speaker 1>about how do I fix this because, you

01:24:34.385 --> 01:24:36.385
<v Speaker 1>know, we have config. We have secrets. They

01:24:36.385 --> 01:24:38.224
<v Speaker 1>have types. They have to be validated.

01:24:38.625 --> 01:24:40.785
<v Speaker 1>And it's Right. A solved problem. And now

01:24:40.785 --> 01:24:42.305
<v Speaker 1>I've just got the happiest smile on my

01:24:42.305 --> 01:24:43.905
<v Speaker 1>face ever because I know that you are

01:24:43.905 --> 01:24:45.905
<v Speaker 1>going down this path of fixing this thing.

01:24:45.905 --> 01:24:47.710
<v Speaker 1>And I I I will be your alpha

01:24:47.710 --> 01:24:49.230
<v Speaker 1>tester, your beta tester, and

01:24:50.349 --> 01:24:50.909
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:24:51.150 --> 01:24:52.270
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I I wanna I wanna get

01:24:52.270 --> 01:24:53.389
<v Speaker 0>it to a point, honestly, and I think

01:24:53.389 --> 01:24:55.150
<v Speaker 0>this is totally possible doing a little bit

01:24:55.150 --> 01:24:56.830
<v Speaker 0>more of that work where going from one

01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:58.909
<v Speaker 0>secret manager to another is is changing one

01:24:58.909 --> 01:24:59.150
<v Speaker 0>line.

01:25:00.125 --> 01:25:02.125
<v Speaker 0>Mean, granted that you use the same conventions,

01:25:02.125 --> 01:25:03.885
<v Speaker 0>but, like, we could even have a transformation

01:25:03.885 --> 01:25:06.285
<v Speaker 0>step. Right? That uppercases it all remove, like,

01:25:06.285 --> 01:25:07.885
<v Speaker 0>make snake case out of it or makes

01:25:07.885 --> 01:25:09.804
<v Speaker 0>k pop case. Like, that sort of stuff

01:25:09.804 --> 01:25:11.804
<v Speaker 0>is also, like since it's so programmable,

01:25:12.605 --> 01:25:14.750
<v Speaker 0>it's it's you know, like, SOPs. Right? You,

01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:16.670
<v Speaker 0>like, even, like, delegate it to another tool.

01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:18.190
<v Speaker 0>But the idea is really to, like, do

01:25:18.190 --> 01:25:19.789
<v Speaker 0>all the front load, all the,

01:25:20.270 --> 01:25:22.829
<v Speaker 0>you know, the specification and the validation

01:25:22.989 --> 01:25:24.670
<v Speaker 0>that when you then, like, go reach into

01:25:24.670 --> 01:25:26.110
<v Speaker 0>it or, like, the other way around, when

01:25:26.110 --> 01:25:27.390
<v Speaker 0>you reach into it, then you can also

01:25:27.390 --> 01:25:29.150
<v Speaker 0>check, does it actually need the stack. Right?

01:25:29.704 --> 01:25:31.465
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. But But literally make that like a

01:25:31.465 --> 01:25:33.545
<v Speaker 0>no brainer. Right. And because you know how

01:25:33.545 --> 01:25:35.465
<v Speaker 1>to resolve all these values and you have

01:25:35.465 --> 01:25:37.545
<v Speaker 1>type information and you potentially know where these

01:25:37.545 --> 01:25:39.304
<v Speaker 1>values come from depending on how deep it

01:25:39.304 --> 01:25:41.784
<v Speaker 1>goes, you could do automatic secret rotation as

01:25:41.784 --> 01:25:43.784
<v Speaker 1>well. Oh, and it could run me and

01:25:43.784 --> 01:25:45.760
<v Speaker 1>all this other really cool. But, like, I

01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:47.119
<v Speaker 1>mean, you could be working on this for

01:25:47.119 --> 01:25:48.880
<v Speaker 1>the next six months, adding new features. I

01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:50.239
<v Speaker 1>don't think you run out of ideas.

01:25:50.719 --> 01:25:52.320
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I I built this thing because

01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:54.159
<v Speaker 0>I gotta talk into, you know, the the

01:25:54.159 --> 01:25:55.599
<v Speaker 0>rejects event at

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.295
<v Speaker 0>at KubeCon in Europe. I had sort of,

01:25:58.295 --> 01:25:59.895
<v Speaker 0>like, a conceptual prototype, and then I got

01:25:59.895 --> 01:26:01.335
<v Speaker 0>to talk in. And then within four weeks,

01:26:01.335 --> 01:26:02.535
<v Speaker 0>I actually have to build it.

01:26:03.975 --> 01:26:05.975
<v Speaker 0>Was probably the most stressful part of my

01:26:05.975 --> 01:26:08.615
<v Speaker 0>life. Conference driven development at its best. Yeah.

01:26:08.615 --> 01:26:10.680
<v Speaker 0>That that my my wife was out of

01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:12.120
<v Speaker 0>town for, like, two or three weeks of

01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:12.760
<v Speaker 0>that.

01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:15.080
<v Speaker 0>And, you know, I guess it wasn't good

01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:16.920
<v Speaker 0>for my health, but but, you know, I

01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:18.120
<v Speaker 0>I really wanna get it out in front

01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:19.880
<v Speaker 0>of people. And I think there's a lot

01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:22.200
<v Speaker 0>of, like, sort of misconceptions around that that

01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:24.305
<v Speaker 0>problem is solved. Because people say, like, secret

01:26:24.305 --> 01:26:26.545
<v Speaker 0>management use vault, use you know, it's not

01:26:26.545 --> 01:26:28.465
<v Speaker 0>a it's not a it's an un it's

01:26:28.465 --> 01:26:29.905
<v Speaker 0>not an unsolved problem anymore,

01:26:30.225 --> 01:26:32.465
<v Speaker 0>and I I have to disagree. I think

01:26:32.545 --> 01:26:33.985
<v Speaker 0>it's solved in a way where we're giving

01:26:33.985 --> 01:26:35.905
<v Speaker 0>away all the bargaining chips to all these

01:26:35.905 --> 01:26:38.330
<v Speaker 0>big cloud providers. They lock us in, and

01:26:38.330 --> 01:26:40.570
<v Speaker 0>then we entirely remove it from the human.

01:26:40.570 --> 01:26:42.330
<v Speaker 0>Right? So, you know, like, I think this

01:26:42.330 --> 01:26:44.010
<v Speaker 0>is also why platform teams are so busy

01:26:44.010 --> 01:26:46.330
<v Speaker 0>because they have to bridge that gap using,

01:26:46.570 --> 01:26:48.890
<v Speaker 0>you know, like Jira tickets, right, or Zoom

01:26:48.890 --> 01:26:51.530
<v Speaker 0>calls. Right? And it's silly because it doesn't

01:26:51.530 --> 01:26:52.250
<v Speaker 0>have to be that way.

01:26:54.315 --> 01:26:56.715
<v Speaker 1>Wow. Alright. And that's just normally why I'd

01:26:56.715 --> 01:26:58.955
<v Speaker 1>say what's coming next, but you you've more

01:26:58.955 --> 01:27:00.395
<v Speaker 1>than covered that. So

01:27:02.155 --> 01:27:04.875
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I mean, that's coming. The runme terminal

01:27:04.875 --> 01:27:06.820
<v Speaker 0>is probably gonna go out of better, like

01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:08.660
<v Speaker 0>the thing where, you know, it rolls up.

01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:10.420
<v Speaker 0>And, you know, the idea is really to

01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:12.020
<v Speaker 0>kinda connect the dots between

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:15.380
<v Speaker 0>or, like, remove the the boundaries between the

01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:17.620
<v Speaker 0>modalities, right, so that, you know, people are

01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:18.900
<v Speaker 0>comfortable in the terminal. They can stay in

01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:21.515
<v Speaker 0>the terminal. We also wanna bring most of

01:27:21.515 --> 01:27:22.635
<v Speaker 0>that functionality

01:27:22.875 --> 01:27:24.635
<v Speaker 0>out of Versus codes. You know, there will

01:27:24.635 --> 01:27:27.355
<v Speaker 0>probably be terminal commands that, in other ways,

01:27:27.355 --> 01:27:29.595
<v Speaker 0>are gonna try to bring the same integrated

01:27:29.595 --> 01:27:31.595
<v Speaker 0>way together. It's a little bit more difficult

01:27:31.595 --> 01:27:32.235
<v Speaker 0>because,

01:27:32.555 --> 01:27:34.475
<v Speaker 0>you know, terminal is an island

01:27:35.449 --> 01:27:37.530
<v Speaker 0>and and really just kinda, like, continue to

01:27:37.530 --> 01:27:38.570
<v Speaker 0>do more of that.

01:27:39.370 --> 01:27:40.810
<v Speaker 0>And, yeah, like, I think for what it's

01:27:40.810 --> 01:27:43.530
<v Speaker 0>worth, like, know, just people kicking the tires,

01:27:44.010 --> 01:27:46.250
<v Speaker 0>telling us what resonates. Right? Like, I mean,

01:27:46.250 --> 01:27:47.370
<v Speaker 0>there's a lot of work we could be

01:27:47.370 --> 01:27:49.095
<v Speaker 0>doing. You know, like, I think we already

01:27:49.095 --> 01:27:50.535
<v Speaker 0>put a couple of things on that stack

01:27:50.535 --> 01:27:51.175
<v Speaker 0>of

01:27:51.415 --> 01:27:52.695
<v Speaker 0>what we could be doing on a road

01:27:52.695 --> 01:27:54.375
<v Speaker 0>map, but we really also wanna be user

01:27:54.375 --> 01:27:57.495
<v Speaker 0>user feedback driven. Right? So, you know, people

01:27:57.495 --> 01:27:59.415
<v Speaker 0>using it. I mean, you kick the tires.

01:27:59.895 --> 01:28:01.655
<v Speaker 0>I'm probably gonna go back to filtering and

01:28:01.655 --> 01:28:03.015
<v Speaker 0>searching the t y. Right?

01:28:04.090 --> 01:28:06.090
<v Speaker 0>I we really wanna unblock people. I usually

01:28:06.090 --> 01:28:08.410
<v Speaker 0>kinda, like, split my time between doing the

01:28:08.410 --> 01:28:10.010
<v Speaker 0>the things that come in and then the

01:28:10.010 --> 01:28:12.570
<v Speaker 0>larger development projects. Yep. And we're doing this

01:28:12.570 --> 01:28:14.010
<v Speaker 0>the same way with the team. Yeah. But

01:28:14.010 --> 01:28:16.010
<v Speaker 0>those are kinda, like, the more tangible, you

01:28:16.010 --> 01:28:17.690
<v Speaker 0>know, next couple of projects that are gonna

01:28:17.690 --> 01:28:17.930
<v Speaker 0>come.

01:28:19.135 --> 01:28:22.175
<v Speaker 1>Nice. Well, I would encourage anyone watching to

01:28:22.175 --> 01:28:24.735
<v Speaker 1>go check out the repository, get it installed,

01:28:24.735 --> 01:28:27.855
<v Speaker 1>start kicking the tires, open issues, and keep

01:28:27.855 --> 01:28:29.695
<v Speaker 1>you and the team busy because

01:28:29.935 --> 01:28:30.975
<v Speaker 1>this is a Discworks.

01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:33.699
<v Speaker 1>This is a product that just solves a

01:28:33.699 --> 01:28:37.219
<v Speaker 1>lot of paper cuts, right, frustrations from development,

01:28:37.219 --> 01:28:39.380
<v Speaker 1>especially for me. And I'm on a repository,

01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:41.620
<v Speaker 1>but or anyone doing cloud native microservices.

01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:44.340
<v Speaker 1>Right? We've got all this documentation and internal

01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:45.860
<v Speaker 1>knowledge that needs to become

01:28:46.744 --> 01:28:49.224
<v Speaker 1>shared and commoditized across your team and your

01:28:49.224 --> 01:28:50.024
<v Speaker 1>organization,

01:28:50.025 --> 01:28:51.704
<v Speaker 1>and runme is a fantastic tool to do

01:28:51.704 --> 01:28:53.465
<v Speaker 1>that. So thank you so much for building

01:28:53.465 --> 01:28:55.385
<v Speaker 1>it and for spending the last ninety minutes

01:28:55.385 --> 01:28:56.264
<v Speaker 1>of your life

01:28:56.744 --> 01:28:58.665
<v Speaker 1>dealing with my next source, but also showing

01:28:58.665 --> 01:29:00.105
<v Speaker 1>us some really cool stuff with what's coming

01:29:00.105 --> 01:29:02.400
<v Speaker 1>along. I love talking about this stuff. I

01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:04.240
<v Speaker 0>probably don't do it enough because I'm I'm,

01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:05.840
<v Speaker 0>you know, usually busy, like, trying to, like,

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:08.400
<v Speaker 0>go down the the AST rabbit hole or,

01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:10.880
<v Speaker 0>like, the Alstor rabbit hole, but I appreciate,

01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:12.960
<v Speaker 0>you know, that you invited me to come

01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:14.400
<v Speaker 0>on the show. And, you know, maybe we

01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:16.400
<v Speaker 0>can do it again when the Alstor is

01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:17.735
<v Speaker 0>a little bit more developed and we can

01:29:17.735 --> 01:29:19.735
<v Speaker 0>kinda, like, really go a little bit deeper.

01:29:19.735 --> 01:29:21.335
<v Speaker 0>And, like, I think the resolution part of

01:29:21.335 --> 01:29:21.814
<v Speaker 0>it,

01:29:22.534 --> 01:29:24.135
<v Speaker 0>you know, is gonna be really important.

01:29:25.175 --> 01:29:27.494
<v Speaker 0>Tire kicking. Yes. Russell is kicking tires for

01:29:27.494 --> 01:29:28.614
<v Speaker 1>you now, so that is awesome.

01:29:29.670 --> 01:29:31.350
