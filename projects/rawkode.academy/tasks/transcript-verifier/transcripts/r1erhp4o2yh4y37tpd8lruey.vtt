00:00:46.725 --> 00:00:49.925
<v Speaker 0>Hello, and welcome to today's episode of Clustered

00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:52.324
<v Speaker 0>at the Rawkode Academy. I am your host,

00:00:52.324 --> 00:00:52.805
<v Speaker 0>Rawkode.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.860
<v Speaker 0>Today, we have two great teams picking up

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.900
<v Speaker 0>the clustered mantle and fighting each other to

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.980
<v Speaker 0>win. This one's a bit weird because all

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.260
<v Speaker 0>the teams know each other, and I think

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.180
<v Speaker 0>it's gonna be a whole lot of fun.

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.820
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Now before we get started, this is

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.625
<v Speaker 0>a little bit of housekeeping. If you're not

00:01:08.625 --> 00:01:10.545
<v Speaker 0>already subscribed to the channel, I would encourage

00:01:10.545 --> 00:01:12.625
<v Speaker 0>you to do so now. Also, if you'd

00:01:12.625 --> 00:01:14.784
<v Speaker 0>be so kind, thumb up the video, like

00:01:14.784 --> 00:01:17.505
<v Speaker 0>it, comment, share, all those other things. It's

00:01:17.505 --> 00:01:19.585
<v Speaker 0>just gonna help YouTube share this content with

00:01:19.585 --> 00:01:19.985
<v Speaker 0>more people.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.010
<v Speaker 0>We also have membership options available at the

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.770
<v Speaker 0>academy, so you can check them out and

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.450
<v Speaker 0>join for as little as 99p

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.970
<v Speaker 0>per month or cents,

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.970
<v Speaker 0>and this just allows you to support it,

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.050
<v Speaker 0>and I would appreciate that very much. And

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.290
<v Speaker 0>if you want to continue

00:01:34.095 --> 00:01:35.935
<v Speaker 0>conversation or you're not watching live, we do

00:01:35.935 --> 00:01:39.215
<v Speaker 0>have a Discord server available at Rawkode.chat.

00:01:39.215 --> 00:01:41.935
<v Speaker 0>There's only 600 cloud native technologists in there

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:44.735
<v Speaker 0>talking about all things cloud native, Kubernetes, EBPF,

00:01:44.735 --> 00:01:46.175
<v Speaker 0>and everything in between.

00:01:46.495 --> 00:01:47.935
<v Speaker 0>So come and say hello, and I look

00:01:47.935 --> 00:01:50.170
<v Speaker 0>forward to meeting you. I also want to

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.730
<v Speaker 0>thank Teleport for sponsoring Clustered. This was the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.250
<v Speaker 0>easiest decision I've ever had to make. We've

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.250
<v Speaker 0>been using Teleport since the very beginning. It

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.930
<v Speaker 0>is a fantastic tool. You're going to see

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.250
<v Speaker 0>us using it today to pair and share

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.244
<v Speaker 0>terminal sessions on these rather broken clusters. So

00:02:03.244 --> 00:02:04.604
<v Speaker 0>check it out, get it running in your

00:02:04.604 --> 00:02:06.125
<v Speaker 0>cluster, and let us know how get on.

00:02:06.445 --> 00:02:08.205
<v Speaker 0>You just use rockhode.

00:02:08.205 --> 00:02:09.324
<v Speaker 0>Liveteleport.

00:02:09.324 --> 00:02:11.165
<v Speaker 0>It's a UTM link, but it keeps the

00:02:11.165 --> 00:02:13.325
<v Speaker 0>sponsor happy, so that keeps me happy.

00:02:14.444 --> 00:02:16.570
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So we had a little bit of

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.210
<v Speaker 0>technical troubles, but we are back in action,

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.210
<v Speaker 0>and I am gonna introduce our two teams

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.610
<v Speaker 0>today. So let's pop over here. We have

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.210
<v Speaker 0>a slightly different layout. We've got two teams

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.210
<v Speaker 0>of two, which means we can have everybody

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.130
<v Speaker 0>on the screen at the same time. It's

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.974
<v Speaker 0>gonna be a whole lot of fun. Let's

00:02:30.974 --> 00:02:33.135
<v Speaker 0>start at the top left. Jack, do you

00:02:33.135 --> 00:02:35.135
<v Speaker 0>wanna say hello, introduce yourself, and then we'll

00:02:35.135 --> 00:02:37.215
<v Speaker 0>just move around the windows, please.

00:02:38.174 --> 00:02:41.855
<v Speaker 1>Sure. So I'm Jack from Control Plane. I'm

00:02:41.855 --> 00:02:43.135
<v Speaker 1>an infrastructure engineer.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.160
<v Speaker 1>Usually, I'm I'm doing more throwing stuff at

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.960
<v Speaker 1>clusters.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.920
<v Speaker 1>But,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.560

<v Speaker 2>I'm also used to

00:03:03.334 --> 00:03:05.815
<v Speaker 2>breaking things and pointing out broken things a

00:03:05.815 --> 00:03:08.135
<v Speaker 2>bit more, so looking forward to having to

00:03:08.135 --> 00:03:09.334

<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Thanks for sharing.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.120
<v Speaker 3>Hello. I'm Chris.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.960
<v Speaker 3>I guess, stumbled into some bits of DevOps.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.760
<v Speaker 3>I spend most of my time kinda helping

00:03:24.515 --> 00:03:27.395
<v Speaker 3>digital teams become kinda more efficient and

00:03:27.635 --> 00:03:30.275
<v Speaker 3>more empowered and enabled and stuff. I'm a

00:03:30.275 --> 00:03:32.114
<v Speaker 3>developer at heart. So

00:03:32.915 --> 00:03:35.235
<v Speaker 3>but, yeah, ended up kinda looking at DevOps

00:03:35.235 --> 00:03:37.715
<v Speaker 3>and other buzzword nonsense,

00:03:38.275 --> 00:03:39.955
<v Speaker 3>which made me stumble into Kubernetes.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.580
<v Speaker 3>And I'm currently a teacher at Learn k

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.700
<v Speaker 3>eights. Awesome.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.700
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.660
<v Speaker 4>Hey. My name is Simonik Bao. And just

<v Speaker 4>like Chris, I am also an instructor for

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.885
<v Speaker 4>Kubernetes at Learn k eights, and I also

00:03:54.885 --> 00:03:57.685
<v Speaker 4>work as an MLOps engineer for Appia.

00:03:57.845 --> 00:04:00.565
<v Speaker 4>I usually break stuff and don't

00:04:00.565 --> 00:04:02.645
<v Speaker 4>bother fixing them. That's what I do. So

00:04:02.725 --> 00:04:04.165
<v Speaker 4>but today is gonna be a real test

00:04:04.165 --> 00:04:05.525
<v Speaker 4>for me to try and fix the broken

00:04:05.525 --> 00:04:05.845
<v Speaker 4>stuff.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.650
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Thank you all for introducing yourselves.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.730
<v Speaker 0>So we're gonna kick things off with our

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.450
<v Speaker 0>first cluster. I have the learn Kate's cluster

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.450
<v Speaker 0>in front of me. So that means team

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.370

00:04:21.315 --> 00:04:23.474
<v Speaker 0>I am going to click here to open

00:04:23.474 --> 00:04:25.634
<v Speaker 0>a session on the control plane node. Please

00:04:25.634 --> 00:04:27.315
<v Speaker 0>do not use that button yourself. There is

00:04:27.315 --> 00:04:30.195

<v Speaker 0>Got one of you. Is the newest one.

00:04:55.815 --> 00:04:57.735
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I guess that's it. We've got both

00:04:57.735 --> 00:04:58.935
<v Speaker 0>of you in the chat.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.560

<v Speaker 0>Alright. I'm gonna start the timer. Feel free

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.600
<v Speaker 0>to configure your cube config and best of

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.160
<v Speaker 0>luck.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.240
<v Speaker 1>Okey dokey. Yeah. I guess you could you

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.639
<v Speaker 1>could use

00:05:12.465 --> 00:05:14.625
<v Speaker 1>teleport and a session as the

00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:16.865
<v Speaker 1>as a chat.

00:05:17.505 --> 00:05:20.145
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna get started by bringing some of

00:05:20.145 --> 00:05:21.185
<v Speaker 1>my own tools

00:05:21.585 --> 00:05:23.425
<v Speaker 1>just so that I can debug

00:05:23.585 --> 00:05:24.305
<v Speaker 1>nice and quick.

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:27.060
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't like that. Okay. Never mind.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.540
<v Speaker 1>Right. Let's let's have a look what we're

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.340
<v Speaker 1>working with.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.340
<v Speaker 4>What kind of tools were we done with

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.060
<v Speaker 4>inject?

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.139
<v Speaker 1>It

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.035
<v Speaker 1>was going to be, like bringing my own

00:05:40.035 --> 00:05:40.915
<v Speaker 1>kubectl

00:05:40.915 --> 00:05:43.075
<v Speaker 1>just in case I can't trust it.

00:05:43.715 --> 00:05:46.595
<v Speaker 0>Oh, come on now. It's the first step.

00:05:46.915 --> 00:05:47.955
<v Speaker 4>You still Oh, no.

00:05:48.355 --> 00:05:50.995
<v Speaker 4>On. That's the first step. You've definitely watched

00:05:50.995 --> 00:05:52.835
<v Speaker 0>us before if you don't trust kubectl. I'm

00:05:52.835 --> 00:05:53.235
<v Speaker 0>just saying.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Let's get that going.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:00.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean, let's just have a look at

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.610
<v Speaker 1>pods. Okey dokey. Oh, look at that. Maybe

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.850
<v Speaker 0>you shouldn't have trusted it. Oh. Oh, yeah.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:06.730
<v Speaker 4>Damn.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.890
<v Speaker 4>Fixed it. Has it already fixed

00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:10.165
<v Speaker 1>If

00:06:10.165 --> 00:06:12.805
<v Speaker 1>I Let's see what that error was. I

00:06:12.805 --> 00:06:14.005
<v Speaker 1>haven't used it. You can't do it as

00:06:14.005 --> 00:06:16.325
<v Speaker 0>root. You'd have to add a user. Okay.

00:06:17.285 --> 00:06:19.525
<v Speaker 1>I have a solution for this already.

00:06:20.885 --> 00:06:22.005
<v Speaker 4>Jack came prepared.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:24.770
<v Speaker 4>This stream is not going to last too

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.930
<v Speaker 4>long now. Okay. Let's grab this instead.

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Copy.

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:06:37.445 --> 00:06:39.365
<v Speaker 1>Cool. I have next portable.

00:06:45.445 --> 00:06:47.045
<v Speaker 1>Just make sure it works.

00:06:47.525 --> 00:06:49.525
<v Speaker 1>And then let me just grab my tools.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.280
<v Speaker 1>So I'm using next to grab a bunch

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.440
<v Speaker 1>of tools. I could just write a script

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:03.840
<v Speaker 1>with wget or whatever.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.800
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you're using next flakes as well, not

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.035
<v Speaker 0>this next shell? Yes. Nice.

00:07:09.755 --> 00:07:10.875
<v Speaker 1>So

00:07:11.195 --> 00:07:13.115
<v Speaker 1>I'll I'll go over the tools that are

00:07:13.115 --> 00:07:16.235
<v Speaker 1>in there in a bit. But hopefully, once

00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:18.075
<v Speaker 1>this downloads a bunch of stuff,

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.050
<v Speaker 1>we'll be able to see it a bit

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.690
<v Speaker 1>clearer.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.570
<v Speaker 1>But in theory, if I didn't well,

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.449
<v Speaker 1>in this I've got kubectl.

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:29.050
<v Speaker 1>I've got, like, BusyBox,

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.010
<v Speaker 1>you know, Rarkess.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.105
<v Speaker 1>I've got BAT so that I can get

00:07:34.105 --> 00:07:35.545
<v Speaker 1>some nice colors and

00:07:35.865 --> 00:07:38.585
<v Speaker 1>a couple other bits and bobs. I do

00:07:38.585 --> 00:07:39.705
<v Speaker 0>appreciate some colors. You

00:07:40.345 --> 00:07:42.985
<v Speaker 4>come prepared. Yeah. You Exactly. If you're typically

00:07:42.985 --> 00:07:43.865
<v Speaker 1>debugging

00:07:43.865 --> 00:07:46.590
<v Speaker 1>your own cluster, you probably don't need treat

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.710
<v Speaker 1>it as such an adversary.

00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:51.229
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,

00:07:51.789 --> 00:07:54.590
<v Speaker 1>have seen some pretty nasty stuff during clustered,

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.830
<v Speaker 1>so I thought bring your own tools might

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.030
<v Speaker 1>help. I like it.

00:08:00.354 --> 00:08:02.435
<v Speaker 1>And yeah, I mean, hopefully that will fix

00:08:02.435 --> 00:08:05.395
<v Speaker 1>this problem. We can also look into kind

00:08:05.395 --> 00:08:06.595
<v Speaker 1>of what happened to

00:08:07.155 --> 00:08:07.715
<v Speaker 1>there.

00:08:08.914 --> 00:08:11.074
<v Speaker 1>I think messing with kubectl might be a

00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:12.275
<v Speaker 1>bit of a theme here.

00:08:13.395 --> 00:08:14.115
<v Speaker 1>But we'll see.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.960
<v Speaker 1>I could have also slimmed this down a

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.800
<v Speaker 1>bit. I did pull in stuff like Docker

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.320
<v Speaker 1>as well, which is a bit

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.240
<v Speaker 1>bit too extra.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.840
<v Speaker 4>I think you did the right thing. You'll

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.600
<v Speaker 4>need that. You'll need that later on.

00:08:26.919 --> 00:08:28.875
<v Speaker 1>So if I do which kubectl,

00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:30.795
<v Speaker 1>it's now in the next store.

00:08:31.435 --> 00:08:34.075
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't actually exist on the host. It's

00:08:34.395 --> 00:08:36.155
<v Speaker 1>because I'm using next portable.

00:08:36.395 --> 00:08:38.554
<v Speaker 1>It's in a different location.

00:08:39.195 --> 00:08:41.850
<v Speaker 1>But we can skip over that. So if

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:42.970
<v Speaker 1>I do that

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:44.570
<v Speaker 1>flake

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.810
<v Speaker 1>next, we can see the tools.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:48.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm pulling in kubectl,

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.290
<v Speaker 1>dig Nice. Proc s, nodectl,

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:53.850
<v Speaker 1>yeah, bunch of other stuff. And I thought

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:55.050
<v Speaker 1>busy box because

00:08:56.185 --> 00:08:58.105
<v Speaker 1>why even trust p s when you can

00:08:58.105 --> 00:08:59.385
<v Speaker 1>just bring your own?

00:09:00.425 --> 00:09:02.985
<v Speaker 1>So if we look at user bin

00:09:03.785 --> 00:09:04.745
<v Speaker 1>kubectl,

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.160
<v Speaker 1>I guess yeah. So it's not executable.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.320
<v Speaker 1>I guess we could make it executable.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.960
<v Speaker 1>The other thing we can do is

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.560
<v Speaker 4>We have a control plane control plane employee

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.680
<v Speaker 4>going rogue

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.640
<v Speaker 4>in this location.

00:09:24.815 --> 00:09:27.535
<v Speaker 0>We see Lewis popping his head up. Lewis,

00:09:27.535 --> 00:09:28.575
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing, man?

00:09:28.975 --> 00:09:31.135
<v Speaker 1>So we can see that they're they're roughly

00:09:31.135 --> 00:09:32.895
<v Speaker 1>the same size. There might have been some

00:09:32.895 --> 00:09:33.775
<v Speaker 1>meddling going on.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:35.800
<v Speaker 1>But they

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.280
<v Speaker 1>are going to be built slightly differently anyway.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.440
<v Speaker 0>Are you going to try chip modding your

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:43.160
<v Speaker 0>left Yeah.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.600
<v Speaker 1>Let's try it.

00:09:48.375 --> 00:09:48.855
<v Speaker 1>If it

00:09:52.055 --> 00:09:53.895
<v Speaker 1>yeah. Let's just see what it does.

00:09:55.255 --> 00:09:57.335
<v Speaker 1>I mean, hopefully, it doesn't, like, exit me

00:09:57.335 --> 00:09:58.775
<v Speaker 1>out of this session or something.

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay. It looks it looks alright.

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:11.290
<v Speaker 0>Okay. No API server. I like that.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Let me just use my one, just in

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:14.970
<v Speaker 1>case.

00:10:17.435 --> 00:10:18.475
<v Speaker 1>That's

00:10:18.475 --> 00:10:19.115
<v Speaker 1>fine.

00:10:20.075 --> 00:10:21.675
<v Speaker 1>Right. What should we do now? Should we

00:10:21.675 --> 00:10:23.755
<v Speaker 1>should we check Kubla quickly?

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:31.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh.

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:32.750
<v Speaker 1>In a true.

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:34.990
<v Speaker 1>K. Let's let's pop out of this.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:40.750
<v Speaker 1>K. Kubler. What's it doing?

00:10:42.435 --> 00:10:43.235
<v Speaker 1>Anything

00:10:43.235 --> 00:10:44.595
<v Speaker 1>popping out here

00:10:45.475 --> 00:10:47.155
<v Speaker 1>for you, James? So

00:10:47.795 --> 00:10:50.435
<v Speaker 1>we've got some some pods that are broken.

00:10:51.795 --> 00:10:53.955
<v Speaker 2>We're dialing 6443, but I'm not sure that's

00:10:53.955 --> 00:10:55.315
<v Speaker 2>particularly

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:58.810
<v Speaker 2>that's maybe expected since API server isn't up.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:00.810
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:01.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:02.650
<v Speaker 1>We could

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:04.410
<v Speaker 1>look at

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.490
<v Speaker 1>PTC cube manifests.

00:11:10.095 --> 00:11:11.855
<v Speaker 0>Let's see if we can spot anything amiss

00:11:11.855 --> 00:11:14.015
<v Speaker 2>in the API server, YAML, maybe.

00:11:15.455 --> 00:11:18.175
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That sounds like a a good good

00:11:18.575 --> 00:11:19.455
<v Speaker 1>thing

00:11:19.615 --> 00:11:21.455
<v Speaker 1>to try out. Let me just

00:11:22.335 --> 00:11:23.535
<v Speaker 1>grab my VIM again.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:26.290
<v Speaker 4>David, we're supposed to say hot or cold

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:28.930
<v Speaker 4>if they're getting closer or or we're not?

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:30.770
<v Speaker 0>No. If if they wanna hand, they can

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:32.850
<v Speaker 0>give you a note. Alright. Just feel free

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:35.090
<v Speaker 0>to taunt and laugh if you wish. Alright.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:36.610
<v Speaker 0>Draw stuff to loose if you want. That's

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:38.290
<v Speaker 4>exactly where I'd That's exactly where I'd

00:11:39.105 --> 00:11:40.865
<v Speaker 3>I'll maybe save the taunts in the last

00:11:41.024 --> 00:11:43.024
<v Speaker 3>for the last five minutes if we get

00:11:43.024 --> 00:11:44.065
<v Speaker 3>anywhere near that.

00:11:46.545 --> 00:11:48.385
<v Speaker 1>Sounds good. Sounds good.

00:11:48.945 --> 00:11:50.785
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps, Jack, we could have a little look

00:11:50.785 --> 00:11:52.464
<v Speaker 2>at the time stamps on the files in

00:11:52.464 --> 00:11:54.400
<v Speaker 2>that folder to see if I am. Oh,

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.120
<v Speaker 4>man. A lot of people Willy keeps Willy's

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.000
<v Speaker 4>saying hot.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.800
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.200
<v Speaker 1>Sixteen. So, yeah, manifest has changed.

00:12:06.635 --> 00:12:08.315
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if it manifests.

00:12:09.035 --> 00:12:11.355
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at the cube controller,

00:12:11.515 --> 00:12:12.875
<v Speaker 1>cube scheduler.

00:12:13.835 --> 00:12:15.435
<v Speaker 1>And as you do. As

00:12:15.515 --> 00:12:17.915
<v Speaker 1>well. I'm not looking forward to that. Yeah.

00:12:17.915 --> 00:12:19.515
<v Speaker 0>I love it when people have time stamps

00:12:19.515 --> 00:12:21.435
<v Speaker 0>from, like, thirty minutes before the show.

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:23.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Oh, shit.

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:26.110
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean There's some stuff modified a few

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:30.990
<v Speaker 4>minutes before the show as well. Full closure.

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:33.230
<v Speaker 2>Sure. Yeah. Start with XD.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:35.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Can do.

00:12:36.555 --> 00:12:38.395
<v Speaker 1>The other thing I was thinking is I

00:12:38.395 --> 00:12:41.675
<v Speaker 1>have a I have a little

00:12:42.555 --> 00:12:43.755
<v Speaker 1>file

00:12:43.755 --> 00:12:45.355
<v Speaker 1>here that I can just

00:12:45.835 --> 00:12:47.035
<v Speaker 1>pop in here.

00:12:48.714 --> 00:12:49.115
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:52.980
<v Speaker 0>Now you came prepared.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.940
<v Speaker 1>So let's see what the the diff is

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.660
<v Speaker 1>for the Kubernetes

00:12:59.459 --> 00:13:00.420
<v Speaker 1>backups.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.020
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:04.180
<v Speaker 1>manifests,

00:13:04.595 --> 00:13:06.515
<v Speaker 1>and then ETC.

00:13:06.515 --> 00:13:09.955
<v Speaker 1>That's Kubernetes Let's

00:13:09.955 --> 00:13:11.475
<v Speaker 1>pop this into

00:13:11.875 --> 00:13:12.595
<v Speaker 1>that

00:13:12.915 --> 00:13:14.435
<v Speaker 1>so we can have a look.

00:13:15.475 --> 00:13:17.955
<v Speaker 1>So let's see. Is there anything

00:13:18.435 --> 00:13:19.875
<v Speaker 1>odd that just looks

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:21.710
<v Speaker 1>pretty normal stuff?

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:25.230
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a scroll through.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:29.390
<v Speaker 2>That that read only, I think, looks pretty

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:29.790
<v Speaker 2>sus.

00:13:32.795 --> 00:13:35.675
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. The read only is interesting for sure.

00:13:35.675 --> 00:13:36.714
<v Speaker 1>So which files that

00:13:37.995 --> 00:13:40.154
<v Speaker 1>that's the etcd manifest.

00:13:40.154 --> 00:13:40.795
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:13:42.235 --> 00:13:43.035
<v Speaker 1>Very nice.

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:48.149
<v Speaker 1>Because yeah, I noticed in a lot of

00:13:48.149 --> 00:13:50.470
<v Speaker 1>these in a lot of these clustered

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:53.270
<v Speaker 1>exercises, it's just a case of

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.390
<v Speaker 1>what has changed and what has not. Okay.

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:57.430
<v Speaker 1>Control has

00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.630
<v Speaker 1>been changed.

00:13:59.955 --> 00:14:02.435
<v Speaker 0>Are you seeing and learn, Kate, seeing this

00:14:02.595 --> 00:14:05.475
<v Speaker 0>being deconstructed right in front of you? Good.

00:14:05.475 --> 00:14:07.475
<v Speaker 4>It's learning experience for everyone. That's what we

00:14:07.475 --> 00:14:09.955
<v Speaker 4>want. Learn Yeah. People to learn about Kubernetes.

00:14:10.595 --> 00:14:12.115
<v Speaker 4>Now the breaks I'm

00:14:12.115 --> 00:14:13.475
<v Speaker 1>not familiar with this format.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:15.310
<v Speaker 1>So disable

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:17.790
<v Speaker 1>replica sets.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:20.670
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So the controllers,

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:23.470
<v Speaker 0>can do dash replica set, dash replica,

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:26.110
<v Speaker 0>replication controller. And it will disable that individual

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:27.550
<v Speaker 0>controller and the controller manager.

00:14:28.105 --> 00:14:30.905
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That's very cool. I guess I guess

00:14:30.905 --> 00:14:32.665
<v Speaker 1>if you know that you don't need something,

00:14:32.665 --> 00:14:35.385
<v Speaker 1>you can just remove it Yeah. To reduce

00:14:35.385 --> 00:14:36.905
<v Speaker 1>your attack surface.

00:14:38.105 --> 00:14:39.625
<v Speaker 1>Anything else of interest?

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.320
<v Speaker 2>I could see that the replica set controller

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.240
<v Speaker 2>might be quite useful, though.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It probably is useful. We might want

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:50.360
<v Speaker 3>that, I guess.

00:14:53.165 --> 00:14:54.125
<v Speaker 1>Right.

00:14:54.125 --> 00:14:55.005
<v Speaker 1>So let's

00:14:55.245 --> 00:14:56.925
<v Speaker 1>have a go. So I think the main

00:14:56.925 --> 00:14:58.845
<v Speaker 1>things there was the read only and the

00:14:58.845 --> 00:15:00.045
<v Speaker 1>rep cassettes.

00:15:02.524 --> 00:15:03.005
<v Speaker 1>Fact,

00:15:03.644 --> 00:15:05.644
<v Speaker 1>one of the files was touched, but I

00:15:05.644 --> 00:15:06.204
<v Speaker 1>didn't

00:15:06.605 --> 00:15:07.644
<v Speaker 1>notice any difference.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.480
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't paying a massive amount of attention.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:12.800
<v Speaker 0>It's

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.800
<v Speaker 0>quite hard to notice these differences. Manifests.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:17.200
<v Speaker 0>SPEAKER

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.639
<v Speaker 0>So I think there was one in etcd,

00:15:18.639 --> 00:15:10.640
<v Speaker 0>wasn't there? There was a read only. Two:

00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:22.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That was the read only you spotted.

00:15:22.639 --> 00:15:23.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:15:23.925 --> 00:15:26.085
<v Speaker 1>Also, did it open on read only?

00:15:26.645 --> 00:15:29.365
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing. Does does Vim open

00:15:29.365 --> 00:15:31.605
<v Speaker 1>where where the change happened?

00:15:32.165 --> 00:15:33.125
<v Speaker 1>It was controller.

00:15:35.445 --> 00:15:38.245
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So so Vim has opened at where

00:15:38.245 --> 00:15:38.965
<v Speaker 1>the issue is.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.320
<v Speaker 0>It's always funny. Nice and helpful.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I I was looking into that earlier,

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.800
<v Speaker 1>and the file of interest is

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.160
<v Speaker 1>is it Vim info? It's Vim info.

00:15:55.605 --> 00:15:57.765
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. VimInfo. So if we go in

00:15:59.285 --> 00:16:00.325
<v Speaker 1>VimInfo,

00:16:00.325 --> 00:16:02.485
<v Speaker 1>we can find some other interesting things that

00:16:02.485 --> 00:16:03.845
<v Speaker 1>I have edited.

00:16:04.885 --> 00:16:06.565
<v Speaker 4>We got it. We got it, Jack.

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:10.650
<v Speaker 0>Keys to the castle. There we go. Yeah.

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:12.730
<v Speaker 3>Gonna a very me, trying to think about

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:15.530
<v Speaker 0>The big question is whether Jack and James

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.770
<v Speaker 0>have cleared their Vim info before shutting down

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:18.490
<v Speaker 0>their cluster.

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:20.570
<v Speaker 1>I I don't think I'd be showing it

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:21.210
<v Speaker 1>off.

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:22.010
<v Speaker 1>We'd like

00:16:24.485 --> 00:16:25.125
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:16:25.525 --> 00:16:27.125
<v Speaker 1>So I'm

00:16:27.125 --> 00:16:28.725
<v Speaker 1>not sure why this file has been opened

00:16:28.725 --> 00:16:31.045
<v Speaker 1>either. I guess we'll find out. A lot

00:16:31.045 --> 00:16:33.125
<v Speaker 0>of laughter in the comments and people enjoying

00:16:33.125 --> 00:16:35.045
<v Speaker 0>the forensic approach for this.

00:16:35.445 --> 00:16:37.365
<v Speaker 4>Very good. Very good job. Right.

00:16:37.845 --> 00:16:39.940
<v Speaker 2>I think we there's also a cube fit.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.779
<v Speaker 2>It looked like it had been might have

00:16:41.779 --> 00:16:43.860
<v Speaker 2>been edited that we didn't spot earlier. So

00:16:44.339 --> 00:16:46.180
<v Speaker 2>I would to

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.660
<v Speaker 1>you to touch that. Yeah. It turns out

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.300
<v Speaker 1>we broke cube fit without trying to break

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:51.540
<v Speaker 1>it.

00:16:52.475 --> 00:16:53.755
<v Speaker 1>Caused some issues.

00:16:55.115 --> 00:16:55.595
<v Speaker 1>So

00:16:55.995 --> 00:16:58.315
<v Speaker 0>Great tip from Russell there. Start editing all

00:16:58.315 --> 00:16:59.435
<v Speaker 0>files was said.

00:17:00.394 --> 00:17:01.115
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm.

00:17:01.995 --> 00:17:03.915
<v Speaker 1>Does the kubla just restart itself?

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:08.510
<v Speaker 0>The Kubla won't restart itself. No. But it'll

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:11.230
<v Speaker 0>restart any static manifests or modified when it

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:12.430
<v Speaker 0>notices the change.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:13.870
<v Speaker 1>Got

00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:16.270
<v Speaker 1>it. Okay. Or you can force it with

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:16.750
<v Speaker 0>the restart.

00:17:19.035 --> 00:17:19.994
<v Speaker 1>So,

00:17:19.994 --> 00:17:21.915
<v Speaker 1>I mean, it might be a minute or

00:17:21.915 --> 00:17:23.275
<v Speaker 1>two for the changes.

00:17:24.875 --> 00:17:27.275
<v Speaker 1>I guess the other thing we could look

00:17:27.275 --> 00:17:28.315
<v Speaker 1>into is that

00:17:29.355 --> 00:17:30.875
<v Speaker 1>other file that changed. So

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:35.590
<v Speaker 1>prep.

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:38.710
<v Speaker 1>There's a vet.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Or should we look at the VIP

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:44.790
<v Speaker 1>first, actually?

00:17:50.995 --> 00:17:51.874
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes

00:17:52.035 --> 00:17:53.394
<v Speaker 1>manifests.

00:17:53.715 --> 00:17:54.914
<v Speaker 1>Kubit.

00:17:56.035 --> 00:17:57.715
<v Speaker 1>So okay. And that one started at the

00:17:57.715 --> 00:17:58.355
<v Speaker 1>top,

00:17:58.835 --> 00:18:00.115
<v Speaker 1>which is interesting,

00:18:00.595 --> 00:18:01.155
<v Speaker 1>I guess.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:04.859
<v Speaker 1>Backups,

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes,

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.499
<v Speaker 1>manifests,

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.340
<v Speaker 1>kube, vip,

00:18:10.059 --> 00:18:12.139
<v Speaker 1>and then you see

00:18:12.539 --> 00:18:14.220
<v Speaker 1>kube manifests,

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:15.900
<v Speaker 1>kube, vip.

00:18:16.615 --> 00:18:18.294
<v Speaker 1>And then I'll just pipe that into BAM

00:18:18.294 --> 00:18:20.054
<v Speaker 1>for some Oh, I don't have that. You're

00:18:20.054 --> 00:18:22.695
<v Speaker 1>not in the shell anymore. Escaped the shell.

00:18:23.575 --> 00:18:24.854
<v Speaker 1>What have we got here?

00:18:28.615 --> 00:18:31.494
<v Speaker 0>It's just custom made So, like, sensible differences,

00:18:31.495 --> 00:18:33.720
<v Speaker 1>yeah. I mean, in in theory, it could

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.560
<v Speaker 1>have been changed, but we'll find out, I

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.040
<v Speaker 1>guess.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.800
<v Speaker 1>Also, if KuBip

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.440
<v Speaker 1>was screwed up, I guess we wouldn't be

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.800
<v Speaker 1>in Teleport right now.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.360
<v Speaker 1>So

00:18:44.644 --> 00:18:46.084
<v Speaker 1>the other thing was

00:18:47.125 --> 00:18:48.804
<v Speaker 1>this file.

00:18:49.845 --> 00:18:51.124
<v Speaker 1>So this

00:18:52.004 --> 00:18:54.164
<v Speaker 1>is a file that I'm

00:18:54.164 --> 00:18:55.204
<v Speaker 1>not familiar with.

00:18:56.565 --> 00:18:59.125
<v Speaker 1>And, also, I do not have backup of,

00:18:59.125 --> 00:19:00.485
<v Speaker 1>so I can't just cheat.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:02.540
<v Speaker 4>I

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.780
<v Speaker 1>don't know if you're familiar with this one

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:07.740
<v Speaker 1>either, James.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.260
<v Speaker 1>But, yeah. Would

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:12.620
<v Speaker 1>never touched this folder.

00:19:15.065 --> 00:19:17.144
<v Speaker 1>Okay. That looks very fun.

00:19:17.945 --> 00:19:19.865
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure we even need this file.

00:19:19.865 --> 00:19:20.424
<v Speaker 1>So

00:19:20.825 --> 00:19:21.945
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to

00:19:22.745 --> 00:19:25.465
<v Speaker 1>can you comment? Maybe you can comment in

00:19:25.465 --> 00:19:26.024
<v Speaker 1>these files.

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:28.260
<v Speaker 2>I, from

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.980
<v Speaker 2>the name, would hazard a guess that the

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:34.660
<v Speaker 2>if up dot d would run on interface

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.020
<v Speaker 2>being brought up.

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:39.300
<v Speaker 2>So potentially,

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.980
<v Speaker 2>we might need to undo that in IP

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:41.380
<v Speaker 2>tables.

00:19:42.555 --> 00:19:43.515
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

00:19:43.675 --> 00:19:46.555
<v Speaker 1>I'm also not very familiar with IP tables,

00:19:46.555 --> 00:19:48.475
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not looking forward to this.

00:19:50.715 --> 00:19:51.755
<v Speaker 1>Right. Okay.

00:19:52.235 --> 00:19:53.755
<v Speaker 1>So

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:00.539
<v Speaker 4>so

00:20:02.059 --> 00:20:02.700
<v Speaker 1>My

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:04.059
<v Speaker 1>yeah. At

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.580
<v Speaker 1>some stuff. Don't know whether the state would

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.020
<v Speaker 2>have been saved in the

00:20:10.325 --> 00:20:11.605
<v Speaker 2>save state file,

00:20:11.685 --> 00:20:13.125
<v Speaker 2>whether we can restore from that or whether

00:20:13.125 --> 00:20:14.885
<v Speaker 2>we'll just have to target it manually.

00:20:16.245 --> 00:20:18.005
<v Speaker 0>So you can run I b tables dash

00:20:18.005 --> 00:20:20.565
<v Speaker 0>capital l to list all the different rules.

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:25.269
<v Speaker 2>And what dash t not properly to target

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:27.510
<v Speaker 2>the NAT table

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:28.870
<v Speaker 2>since that's where it's at it?

00:20:34.405 --> 00:20:36.485
<v Speaker 1>Would that just be the tile?

00:20:36.965 --> 00:20:38.645
<v Speaker 1>Let me just grab something with a t

00:20:38.645 --> 00:20:39.525
<v Speaker 1>a t.

00:20:44.325 --> 00:20:46.645
<v Speaker 0>James is right with the dash t net.

00:20:46.645 --> 00:20:48.165
<v Speaker 0>He don't need to do the the graph.

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh. The dash is capital l, base dash

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:52.899
<v Speaker 0>t net.

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.700
<v Speaker 1>Can I do them in any order? Yeah.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:56.500
<v Speaker 2>Yes.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.260
<v Speaker 2>And you might want dash n as well,

00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:59.620
<v Speaker 2>which will give us the rule number.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Sounds very

00:21:02.905 --> 00:21:05.305
<v Speaker 1>low. Thanks, Anne. Oh, maybe not actually. Moment

00:21:05.305 --> 00:21:07.785
<v Speaker 2>ends. Maybe you don't need the l of

00:21:07.785 --> 00:21:08.825
<v Speaker 0>the dash t.

00:21:10.745 --> 00:21:12.024
<v Speaker 0>No. You don't. Okay.

00:21:12.825 --> 00:21:14.345
<v Speaker 0>This seems a bit noisy. But

00:21:16.265 --> 00:21:16.585
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:19.509
<v Speaker 1>Let me just do a clear

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:22.789
<v Speaker 1>right. While we're

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:23.749
<v Speaker 1>with him.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:29.830
<v Speaker 2>So I think about middle of the screen,

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:32.549
<v Speaker 2>there's the offending rule in the output chain.

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:35.025
<v Speaker 1>Mhmm. Oh, yeah. My my highlight isn't showing.

00:21:35.025 --> 00:21:38.065
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Below the second Cilium comment.

00:21:38.544 --> 00:21:39.184
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:21:40.465 --> 00:21:42.225
<v Speaker 1>So I guess we have two options. We

00:21:42.225 --> 00:21:43.744
<v Speaker 1>can either delete that rule

00:21:43.985 --> 00:21:46.570
<v Speaker 1>or change the whole cluster so that it's

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:49.050
<v Speaker 1>not on that port anymore. Just a

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:51.290
<v Speaker 2>quick bit of Google food to try and

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:53.050
<v Speaker 2>remind myself exactly

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:56.570
<v Speaker 2>the IP tables incantation.

00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Sounds good. I'm gonna The comments are spot

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:01.130
<v Speaker 0>on if you need them.

00:22:01.894 --> 00:22:05.335
<v Speaker 2>Yep. I think dash dash line numbers is

00:22:05.335 --> 00:22:07.014
<v Speaker 2>the The tack is flag I was looking

00:22:07.014 --> 00:22:08.774
<v Speaker 2>for earlier. All of it.

00:22:09.495 --> 00:22:11.174
<v Speaker 2>There we go. Yes. That's the

00:22:12.615 --> 00:22:13.654
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Roger.

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:16.409
<v Speaker 1>We have a number,

00:22:16.809 --> 00:22:17.289
<v Speaker 1>okay.

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:19.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm not familiar with how I would target

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:21.690
<v Speaker 1>that. I guess it's on output. Right? Dash

00:22:21.929 --> 00:22:23.770
<v Speaker 2>I think you need the t not, and

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:25.850
<v Speaker 2>then it's is it dash capital d for

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:27.530
<v Speaker 2>drop, and then the line number?

00:22:28.135 --> 00:22:31.575
<v Speaker 2>If my very rusty memory serves me correctly.

00:22:32.455 --> 00:22:34.455
<v Speaker 1>So t now. Or you could always take

00:22:34.455 --> 00:22:36.695
<v Speaker 0>the sledgehammer approach, which is the

00:22:36.855 --> 00:22:38.294
<v Speaker 0>the Rawkode approved way.

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.380
<v Speaker 0>Wash all the rules. Can I just wipe

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.460
<v Speaker 1>everything and then wait for it to be

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:45.500
<v Speaker 1>rebuilt? You

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:48.780
<v Speaker 0>can. I will also point out this is

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:51.100
<v Speaker 0>a Cilium cluster with no cube proxy using

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.460
<v Speaker 0>e b p f and x t p

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:54.860
<v Speaker 0>for traffic routing. So, I have tables.

00:22:56.125 --> 00:22:57.244
<v Speaker 1>Well,

00:22:58.684 --> 00:23:00.684
<v Speaker 1>I seem there's a couple of Cilium things

00:23:00.684 --> 00:23:01.804
<v Speaker 1>in here. So

00:23:02.365 --> 00:23:04.364
<v Speaker 1>is that just for compatibility?

00:23:04.365 --> 00:23:07.245
<v Speaker 0>So Yeah. Just not work together or I'm

00:23:07.245 --> 00:23:08.765
<v Speaker 0>pretty confident you can make it and this

00:23:08.765 --> 00:23:09.804
<v Speaker 0>this machine will be fine.

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:17.379
<v Speaker 0>Valid suggesting this anyway. Flush it. Yes. Yes.

00:23:17.379 --> 00:23:19.859
<v Speaker 1>Could do. Okay.

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.179
<v Speaker 0>That would be dash capital f to flush

00:23:24.179 --> 00:23:24.740
<v Speaker 0>everything.

00:23:26.554 --> 00:23:27.195
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:23:27.355 --> 00:23:29.595
<v Speaker 1>So should we just wing it? If you

00:23:29.755 --> 00:23:31.035
<v Speaker 2>I have the I think I have the

00:23:31.035 --> 00:23:32.475
<v Speaker 2>command if you just wanted to delete the

00:23:32.475 --> 00:23:34.155
<v Speaker 2>single one. Yeah. Let's let's go with the

00:23:34.155 --> 00:23:37.115
<v Speaker 1>slightly safer option. I don't want the cluster

00:23:37.115 --> 00:23:37.915
<v Speaker 1>to implode.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.120
<v Speaker 2>Then Dash capital d. Definitely run out of

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:41.600
<v Speaker 1>time.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:43.840
<v Speaker 1>Do I need the

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.600
<v Speaker 1>the NAT thing?

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:47.440
<v Speaker 2>Yes.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.320
<v Speaker 2>Was it t NAT or n NAT? Yeah.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:50.800
<v Speaker 2>T NAT.

00:23:51.465 --> 00:23:52.424
<v Speaker 2>Cap d,

00:23:53.065 --> 00:23:54.904
<v Speaker 2>output in caps,

00:23:56.424 --> 00:23:58.504
<v Speaker 2>and then the rule number, which was

00:23:59.385 --> 00:24:01.384
<v Speaker 2>two, was it? Yeah. Yes.

00:24:02.825 --> 00:24:03.544
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:24:03.625 --> 00:24:04.904
<v Speaker 1>Moment of truth.

00:24:06.105 --> 00:24:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Is it gone?

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.360
<v Speaker 1>It is gone. Nice.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Kubectl

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.519
<v Speaker 1>get pods.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:15.759
<v Speaker 1>Tada.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.400
<v Speaker 1>We are in more business than we were

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:18.799
<v Speaker 1>earlier.

00:24:21.025 --> 00:24:22.865
<v Speaker 1>Guess, well, while we're here

00:24:26.385 --> 00:24:29.265
<v Speaker 1>SPEAKER This is a nice tool for anyone

00:24:29.265 --> 00:24:32.225
<v Speaker 1>doing their CCAD. You can look at all

00:24:32.225 --> 00:24:33.424
<v Speaker 1>the short names

00:24:33.585 --> 00:24:35.669
<v Speaker 1>if you want to do the the

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:39.669
<v Speaker 1>shorthand for, like, pods and deployments and whatnot.

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:43.669
<v Speaker 1>Cool. So

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:45.590
<v Speaker 1>we've got the pods

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:46.150
<v Speaker 1>there.

00:24:47.134 --> 00:24:49.054
<v Speaker 1>I guess I should look in teleport to

00:24:49.054 --> 00:24:49.695
<v Speaker 1>see

00:24:50.654 --> 00:24:52.574
<v Speaker 1>if the service is running.

00:24:54.095 --> 00:24:55.455
<v Speaker 1>In fact, let's just get

00:24:57.134 --> 00:24:58.975
<v Speaker 1>can I just curl this?

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:02.450
<v Speaker 0>You

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:04.690
<v Speaker 0>are halfway through. Twenty minutes left.

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:06.929
<v Speaker 1>Okey dokey.

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:09.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:11.410
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be running fine.

00:25:15.554 --> 00:25:19.075
<v Speaker 1>Oh, another thing that's really good is

00:25:19.075 --> 00:25:20.274
<v Speaker 1>remember the

00:25:25.475 --> 00:25:26.274
<v Speaker 1>completion

00:25:26.434 --> 00:25:26.915
<v Speaker 1>stuff.

00:25:29.929 --> 00:25:30.570
<v Speaker 2>Cool.

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:33.530
<v Speaker 2>Do we want to preemptively check for any

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:34.410
<v Speaker 2>admission

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:35.690
<v Speaker 2>controllers potentially?

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:37.450
<v Speaker 2>Or should we just try and

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:39.370
<v Speaker 2>and go ahead and edit the

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:43.450
<v Speaker 1>I think, yeah, going going ahead with an

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:43.850
<v Speaker 1>edit

00:25:45.285 --> 00:25:47.765
<v Speaker 1>sounds fine. I can't I can't see it

00:25:47.925 --> 00:25:49.044
<v Speaker 1>causing any

00:25:49.445 --> 00:25:51.525
<v Speaker 1>issues that are non recoverable.

00:25:55.845 --> 00:25:56.805
<v Speaker 1>Kubectl

00:25:56.805 --> 00:25:58.405
<v Speaker 1>edit, deploy,

00:25:59.445 --> 00:26:01.125
<v Speaker 1>and then cluster.

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Cluster.

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:04.250
<v Speaker 1>Did

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:09.850
<v Speaker 1>I misspell it? There you go.

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:12.010
<v Speaker 1>And then v one,

00:26:15.145 --> 00:26:16.345
<v Speaker 1>v two, please.

00:26:18.825 --> 00:26:20.424
<v Speaker 1>Let me just have a scroll through this,

00:26:20.424 --> 00:26:21.784
<v Speaker 1>see if there's anything that

00:26:22.505 --> 00:26:23.784
<v Speaker 0>What? You don't trust them?

00:26:25.865 --> 00:26:27.705
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember if it was health or

00:26:27.705 --> 00:26:30.740
<v Speaker 1>health z. That's something to Yeah. I can

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:32.739
<v Speaker 0>never remember if it's health or health z.

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:36.820
<v Speaker 1>It's cluster first, which was the nasty one

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:37.859
<v Speaker 1>from last time,

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:41.539
<v Speaker 1>rather than it was on, what was it,

00:26:41.539 --> 00:26:41.860
<v Speaker 1>default?

00:26:42.375 --> 00:26:44.855
<v Speaker 1>I would never have caught that. Yeah. Matt

00:26:44.855 --> 00:26:46.295
<v Speaker 0>tried to stick that one past me, but

00:26:46.295 --> 00:26:47.654
<v Speaker 0>I wasn't letting him have that.

00:26:50.215 --> 00:26:50.934
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:26:57.335 --> 00:26:58.215
<v Speaker 1>Let's get pods.

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:00.990
<v Speaker 0>Alright. You want me to test it? Looks

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:02.350
<v Speaker 1>like it restarting. I think so. Yeah. If

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:03.070
<v Speaker 1>you could.

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:04.989
<v Speaker 1>That would be handy.

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:08.350
<v Speaker 0>Moment of truth.

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:09.789
<v Speaker 0>Salmon looks worried.

00:27:12.225 --> 00:27:14.065
<v Speaker 4>My my worry was over two minutes and

00:27:14.065 --> 00:27:15.505
<v Speaker 4>as soon as you downloaded the tools, was

00:27:15.505 --> 00:27:17.825
<v Speaker 4>like, this is done. This is done.

00:27:18.305 --> 00:27:20.705
<v Speaker 0>You got advanced. Well Good job. Done. Good

00:27:20.705 --> 00:27:21.664
<v Speaker 4>job, John. Done.

00:27:22.305 --> 00:27:23.585
<v Speaker 0>So I can change this. Good job.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:27.640
<v Speaker 4>That's a master master class in forensic debugging.

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.519
<v Speaker 4>That was very good.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.240
<v Speaker 1>Thanks. Yeah. I I would have been completely

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.360
<v Speaker 1>stumped there on on IP tables. I avoid

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.559
<v Speaker 1>that like the plague.

00:27:37.345 --> 00:27:39.025
<v Speaker 0>No. No. You did well. I like the

00:27:39.025 --> 00:27:41.105
<v Speaker 0>approach. You know, you took it slow. You

00:27:41.105 --> 00:27:42.385
<v Speaker 0>just identified

00:27:43.425 --> 00:27:45.025
<v Speaker 0>what you wanted to you wanted to check

00:27:45.025 --> 00:27:46.545
<v Speaker 0>for history. You wanted to check for them

00:27:46.545 --> 00:27:49.105
<v Speaker 0>info. You had you came prepared with backups.

00:27:49.345 --> 00:27:50.705
<v Speaker 0>Like, you know, that's

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.240
<v Speaker 0>a great way to do it. Nicely done.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.840
<v Speaker 4>Very well done.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.919
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Certainly scratching

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.840
<v Speaker 2>the back of my memory on some of

00:27:58.840 --> 00:27:59.720
<v Speaker 2>those commands.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.925
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So this is our first stream of

00:28:04.925 --> 00:28:07.485
<v Speaker 0>ultra ultra low latency on YouTube and the

00:28:07.485 --> 00:28:09.005
<v Speaker 0>chat I want this to run a test

00:28:09.005 --> 00:28:10.845
<v Speaker 0>to see how low that latency is.

00:28:11.245 --> 00:28:13.165
<v Speaker 0>So put your fingers on the one key

00:28:13.165 --> 00:28:15.165
<v Speaker 0>and then I'm gonna say go and you're

00:28:15.165 --> 00:28:17.240
<v Speaker 0>all gonna press 1. And I'm gonna get

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.240
<v Speaker 0>that cluster ready just now while I do

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:19.799
<v Speaker 0>that.

00:28:21.799 --> 00:28:23.879
<v Speaker 0>All right, so control plan.

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:24.999
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:28:26.919 --> 00:28:28.039
<v Speaker 0>All right, go.

00:28:34.205 --> 00:28:35.644
<v Speaker 0>That's some more comments.

00:28:37.245 --> 00:28:39.005
<v Speaker 0>I'm not seeing anyone yet, so it's still

00:28:39.005 --> 00:28:40.364
<v Speaker 0>not all lit and see enough.

00:28:42.125 --> 00:28:43.725
<v Speaker 4>I I can hear you on the stream.

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:46.460
<v Speaker 4>They've got on the TV.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.100
<v Speaker 4>It's it's not that far. Yeah. The late

00:28:49.179 --> 00:28:50.860
<v Speaker 4>there's not much latency to be honest.

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.100
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's not too bad. Alright. Thank you

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:53.739
<v Speaker 0>all.

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:57.179
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's jump back over to our screen

00:28:57.179 --> 00:28:57.580
<v Speaker 0>share.

00:28:58.355 --> 00:29:00.675
<v Speaker 0>So I have the control plane cluster here

00:29:00.675 --> 00:29:03.794
<v Speaker 0>now. So if the learn Kate's team,

00:29:04.595 --> 00:29:06.355
<v Speaker 0>Norman and Chris, if you can jump in

00:29:06.355 --> 00:29:08.355
<v Speaker 0>and join this session, remember to use active

00:29:08.355 --> 00:29:09.635
<v Speaker 0>sessions and join.

00:29:10.115 --> 00:29:12.275
<v Speaker 0>Type echo hello, echo your name, anything you

00:29:12.275 --> 00:29:13.860
<v Speaker 0>wish. Let's make sure they're all on the

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:15.620
<v Speaker 0>same page and then we'll get this thing

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:16.419
<v Speaker 0>started.

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.660
<v Speaker 0>Thank you to everyone who typed a I

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:21.460
<v Speaker 0>think it is a lot better, definitely.

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.100
<v Speaker 0>Of course, Lewis comes in twelve minutes later.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:26.820
<v Speaker 0>Nice one, mate.

00:29:29.095 --> 00:29:30.455
<v Speaker 4>Am I in the right one? I'm not

00:29:30.455 --> 00:29:31.015
<v Speaker 4>sure if I

00:29:32.615 --> 00:29:33.414
<v Speaker 4>see nope.

00:29:34.135 --> 00:29:35.654
<v Speaker 0>Just me and Chris.

00:29:35.975 --> 00:29:36.934
<v Speaker 4>Sessions.

00:29:37.175 --> 00:29:39.255
<v Speaker 4>I'm in active sessions and the only active

00:29:39.255 --> 00:29:40.935
<v Speaker 4>session I see is learn cades.

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:42.980
<v Speaker 0>You're

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:44.580
<v Speaker 0>in the wrong cluster. Join the control plane

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:47.700
<v Speaker 0>cluster. Teleport control plane dot cluster dot Yeah.

00:29:49.539 --> 00:29:50.340
<v Speaker 4>Oh,

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.100
<v Speaker 4>right. There you go. We're good.

00:29:55.065 --> 00:29:56.264
<v Speaker 4>Give a second.

00:29:56.505 --> 00:29:58.184
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna start your timer now, Simon, for

00:29:58.184 --> 00:30:00.825
<v Speaker 0>being so unprepared. That's what's gonna happen. It's

00:30:00.825 --> 00:30:02.985
<v Speaker 3>it's not gonna make any difference. I'll just

00:30:02.985 --> 00:30:04.665
<v Speaker 0>throw it away. I was just like, Jack,

00:30:04.665 --> 00:30:05.624
<v Speaker 4>you got this.

00:30:06.025 --> 00:30:08.265
<v Speaker 4>I gotta do authenticator now real quick.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.040
<v Speaker 3>We're now about to demo how to absolutely

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.200
<v Speaker 3>not prepare for one of these

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.039
<v Speaker 3>and and fail miserably.

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:18.639
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:21.440
<v Speaker 0>You're just gonna do great. Like, I host

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:24.000
<v Speaker 0>the Kubernetes office hours and we share your

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.164
<v Speaker 0>learn case debugging image

00:30:26.325 --> 00:30:28.405
<v Speaker 0>a lot for people. So we we got

00:30:28.405 --> 00:30:29.525
<v Speaker 0>a lot of confidence in you and we're

00:30:29.525 --> 00:30:31.365
<v Speaker 0>looking forward to you fixing this cluster.

00:30:31.765 --> 00:30:33.845
<v Speaker 3>Uh-huh. Because they prepared to be disappointed. I'll

00:30:33.845 --> 00:30:35.365
<v Speaker 3>I'll put that warning out when that

00:30:37.789 --> 00:30:39.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. For some reason, I can't log in

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:41.710
<v Speaker 4>controlplanecluster.live.

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:46.030
<v Speaker 3>Different login. It's your the other one. Did

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:47.309
<v Speaker 0>you register for both?

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:49.230
<v Speaker 4>No. I didn't register for both.

00:30:50.804 --> 00:30:51.445
<v Speaker 0>Anyway.

00:30:51.765 --> 00:30:53.445
<v Speaker 0>Chris is doing the taping. You can do

00:30:53.445 --> 00:30:55.684
<v Speaker 0>the navigating. I'm gonna start your timer now.

00:30:55.684 --> 00:30:56.244
<v Speaker 0>So

00:30:56.565 --> 00:30:58.404
<v Speaker 0>set up your cube config and let's check

00:30:58.404 --> 00:31:00.724
<v Speaker 0>for our control plane and best of luck.

00:31:01.125 --> 00:31:01.605
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:08.659
<v Speaker 3>Where is it?

00:31:09.539 --> 00:31:10.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.

00:31:19.245 --> 00:31:19.885
<v Speaker 3>Just

00:31:23.965 --> 00:31:25.005
<v Speaker 3>no LS.

00:31:25.805 --> 00:31:26.845
<v Speaker 3>Cool. Okay.

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:37.610
<v Speaker 3>So is that no LS or no

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:40.090
<v Speaker 0>Well, that's weird because LS should be a

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:42.730
<v Speaker 0>built in into the shell. So that's that's

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:45.050
<v Speaker 0>a nice Yeah. But I've got no built

00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:45.770
<v Speaker 3>in

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:46.490
<v Speaker 3>things.

00:31:48.425 --> 00:31:49.625
<v Speaker 0>You have echo?

00:31:50.025 --> 00:31:53.465
<v Speaker 3>I have echo. I have a a thing,

00:31:53.465 --> 00:31:55.465
<v Speaker 3>and I can see that I'm maybe in

00:31:55.465 --> 00:31:56.184
<v Speaker 3>bash.

00:31:58.745 --> 00:32:00.265
<v Speaker 3>No. Come on bash.

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:04.809
<v Speaker 3>Docker.

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:06.409
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:09.450
<v Speaker 3>They know. You know, they're not gonna get

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:10.650
<v Speaker 3>cube cut. You're not gonna leave me that,

00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:10.890
<v Speaker 3>are you?

00:32:18.515 --> 00:32:20.515
<v Speaker 0>So it looks like you're missing a lot

00:32:20.515 --> 00:32:22.434
<v Speaker 0>of things. So how how does the shell

00:32:22.434 --> 00:32:23.634
<v Speaker 0>find binaries?

00:32:25.955 --> 00:32:27.154
<v Speaker 3>By path.

00:32:27.235 --> 00:32:28.114
<v Speaker 3>Yes. There

00:32:30.195 --> 00:32:31.875
<v Speaker 3>we go. Ah, fine. Okay. Fine.

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.080
<v Speaker 3>So, yeah, my path messed up. Thanks.

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:39.000
<v Speaker 3>Thank Cool. Thank you. Yeah. Interesting. Okay. So

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.600
<v Speaker 0>You could echo path and fix it. Yeah.

00:32:46.085 --> 00:32:47.605
<v Speaker 3>What would it normally be? Maybe there's something

00:32:47.605 --> 00:32:47.845
<v Speaker 3>like

00:32:49.845 --> 00:32:51.605
<v Speaker 3>just in case there's anything in there.

00:32:52.085 --> 00:32:53.445
<v Speaker 0>You trust what's in there?

00:32:53.925 --> 00:32:55.684
<v Speaker 3>No. I think we're not going.

00:32:56.005 --> 00:32:57.605
<v Speaker 3>Oh, have you done something? Yeah. I trust.

00:32:57.605 --> 00:32:59.525
<v Speaker 1>There you go. Trust pretty much anything in

00:32:59.525 --> 00:33:00.005
<v Speaker 1>the path.

00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:02.750
<v Speaker 1>There's only one thing.

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:05.710
<v Speaker 3>No. The absence of a path. I can

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:08.350
<v Speaker 3>trust that. Cool. You're talking about. Yeah. There

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:08.910
<v Speaker 4>you go.

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:12.590
<v Speaker 1>Guess the other thing you could think about

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:12.910
<v Speaker 1>is,

00:33:14.284 --> 00:33:17.085
<v Speaker 1>like, how would we have removed the path?

00:33:17.965 --> 00:33:19.244
<v Speaker 3>Oh, okay. Fine.

00:33:22.125 --> 00:33:23.724
<v Speaker 3>Of course, fine.

00:33:24.445 --> 00:33:24.924
<v Speaker 3>Ben.

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:31.889
<v Speaker 3>It's bash, isn't it?

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:35.090
<v Speaker 3>Try.

00:33:48.225 --> 00:33:50.305
<v Speaker 3>It's the easiest way to restart the session,

00:33:50.305 --> 00:33:51.664
<v Speaker 3>where I can source this.

00:33:52.145 --> 00:33:54.545
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. You can source It will work, because

00:33:54.545 --> 00:33:56.520
<v Speaker 1>we we put the original path at the

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.760
<v Speaker 1>top of the file as well. Oh, okay.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.360
<v Speaker 3>Cool. You should add it back in.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.200
<v Speaker 3>Great. Fine. Cool. Thank you. Okay. Fine. First

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.840
<v Speaker 3>stumbling block. Okay. So I can now do

00:34:12.925 --> 00:34:15.324
<v Speaker 3>Have I still got my Kube config?

00:34:16.444 --> 00:34:19.645
<v Speaker 3>Yep. Fine. So more, etcetera.

00:34:19.804 --> 00:34:20.205
<v Speaker 3>So

00:34:25.724 --> 00:34:27.484
<v Speaker 3>that looks

00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:31.060
<v Speaker 3>reasonably unsuspect.

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.540
<v Speaker 4>There's there's fixing piece, Lewis. Come on.

00:34:43.125 --> 00:34:43.845
<v Speaker 3>So

00:34:44.725 --> 00:34:47.845
<v Speaker 3>pod's currently in a state where it's got

00:34:48.965 --> 00:34:49.685
<v Speaker 3>many

00:34:51.925 --> 00:34:53.045
<v Speaker 4>Many. Readiness.

00:34:53.844 --> 00:34:56.165
<v Speaker 3>Well, it got elite readiness,

00:34:56.324 --> 00:34:59.540
<v Speaker 3>I guess. Yes. And a terminating state.

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:07.540
<v Speaker 1>So this is the binary I wouldn't trust.

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:10.740
<v Speaker 4>Gonna give you a minute, Jack. CTL.

00:35:11.205 --> 00:35:13.205
<v Speaker 1>I'd say this is the binary I wouldn't

00:35:13.205 --> 00:35:14.965
<v Speaker 1>trust. Keep CTL binary.

00:35:15.525 --> 00:35:16.405
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.

00:35:16.405 --> 00:35:16.965
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

00:35:17.525 --> 00:35:18.405
<v Speaker 3>So

00:35:18.885 --> 00:35:20.965
<v Speaker 3>we had all sorts of aspirations of a

00:35:20.965 --> 00:35:22.965
<v Speaker 3>bad keeping a bad KubeCole

00:35:23.445 --> 00:35:25.605
<v Speaker 3>and never got around to doing it. So

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:28.500
<v Speaker 3>kudos for actually doing the thing that we

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:31.140
<v Speaker 3>planned to do. To be fair, we did

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:33.940
<v Speaker 1>want to do something like changing the code,

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:36.980
<v Speaker 1>but it was way too difficult. So it

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:38.900
<v Speaker 1>did sound very, very crude.

00:35:40.615 --> 00:35:42.135
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. I had to look at changing the

00:35:42.135 --> 00:35:44.135
<v Speaker 4>code. Was like, well, not for the not

00:35:44.135 --> 00:35:46.295
<v Speaker 4>for now. Later on. Should we just get

00:35:46.295 --> 00:35:46.615
<v Speaker 4>a new

00:35:47.255 --> 00:35:49.095
<v Speaker 4>should we just get should we just download

00:35:49.095 --> 00:35:50.055
<v Speaker 4>a new one and

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:54.180
<v Speaker 4>QTTR.

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:55.140
<v Speaker 4>Stick there.

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:57.460
<v Speaker 3>Then

00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:00.100
<v Speaker 3>judging by what, like, just the clue that

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:02.020
<v Speaker 3>we just got, I'm wondering whether that's

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.340
<v Speaker 3>yes. Only smalls is probably a shell script

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:06.795
<v Speaker 3>that's aliasing to it being somewhere else, which

00:36:06.795 --> 00:36:09.115
<v Speaker 3>is what I was gonna do for us,

00:36:09.115 --> 00:36:10.315
<v Speaker 3>and then we didn't even get to do

00:36:10.315 --> 00:36:10.795
<v Speaker 3>that.

00:36:11.435 --> 00:36:13.115
<v Speaker 3>There you go. There you go.

00:36:15.835 --> 00:36:17.915
<v Speaker 3>I'm not so I can

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.520
<v Speaker 4>Just get rid of that.

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:21.960
<v Speaker 4>Right.

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:30.520
<v Speaker 3>Now what does it look?

00:36:34.015 --> 00:36:35.855
<v Speaker 1>So that's a real kubectl

00:36:35.855 --> 00:36:36.815
<v Speaker 1>this time.

00:36:37.855 --> 00:36:38.815
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.

00:36:39.295 --> 00:36:40.255
<v Speaker 3>Cool.

00:36:44.015 --> 00:36:44.815
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

00:36:46.335 --> 00:36:47.855
<v Speaker 3>And it's got zero red.

00:36:49.029 --> 00:36:51.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. Should we just delete this deployment and

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:53.589
<v Speaker 4>create a run first?

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:58.550
<v Speaker 3>We could just do, like, a run.

00:36:59.589 --> 00:37:01.589
<v Speaker 3>I don't know. It's a busy box.

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.789
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.

00:37:03.285 --> 00:37:03.684
<v Speaker 4>Search

00:37:05.525 --> 00:37:06.805
<v Speaker 3>Oh, it's dash dash image.

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Uh-oh. Yeah. This this isn't meant to happen.

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:19.930
<v Speaker 1>This is

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:22.730
<v Speaker 1>me not knowing how JS policy works very

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:23.210
<v Speaker 1>well.

00:37:25.609 --> 00:37:26.650
<v Speaker 1>But

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:29.050
<v Speaker 1>it it would be it would be blocking.

00:37:29.895 --> 00:37:32.055
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. I would have an admit there's there's

00:37:32.055 --> 00:37:34.775
<v Speaker 3>an admission control knocking about. It's called JS

00:37:34.775 --> 00:37:35.975
<v Speaker 3>Poly, so you do something. So

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:44.130
<v Speaker 3>Files look

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:46.050
<v Speaker 3>so if you've changed them, you've moved the

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:46.530
<v Speaker 3>dates back.

00:38:03.345 --> 00:38:05.825
<v Speaker 3>So what was it? JS policy

00:38:05.825 --> 00:38:08.065
<v Speaker 3>is somewhere doing something.

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:18.310
<v Speaker 0>There is no docker on these machines.

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:21.430
<v Speaker 3>That's oh, yeah. Brain fart.

00:38:27.295 --> 00:38:29.695
<v Speaker 3>Right. Okay. So JS policy was the thing

00:38:29.695 --> 00:38:31.535
<v Speaker 3>that you tried to put in, but that's

00:38:31.775 --> 00:38:33.695
<v Speaker 3>gonna crash back a little bit. Yeah. Sometimes

00:38:33.695 --> 00:38:36.575
<v Speaker 1>it works. Sometimes it doesn't. We're

00:38:36.575 --> 00:38:37.535
<v Speaker 1>not sure why.

00:38:38.255 --> 00:38:40.495
<v Speaker 1>Haven't used it enough to to judge.

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:48.520
<v Speaker 1>The fix should be should be the same,

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:49.160
<v Speaker 2>though.

00:38:50.359 --> 00:38:52.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. The the fix in in both

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:53.720
<v Speaker 1>scenarios is the same.

00:38:56.635 --> 00:38:58.315
<v Speaker 3>Can also Brain

00:38:58.555 --> 00:39:00.795
<v Speaker 3>file. I have to look at the mutating

00:39:00.795 --> 00:39:01.915
<v Speaker 3>webhooks.

00:39:03.755 --> 00:39:05.914
<v Speaker 0>You can use API resources to get a

00:39:05.914 --> 00:39:07.434
<v Speaker 0>list of the resources on the cluster.

00:39:27.035 --> 00:39:29.755
<v Speaker 3>I'll do the same source.

00:39:29.755 --> 00:39:30.234
<v Speaker 3>The

00:39:32.315 --> 00:39:34.234
<v Speaker 3>oh, what's that? KeyCastle

00:39:34.234 --> 00:39:36.315
<v Speaker 3>completion

00:39:36.474 --> 00:39:38.315
<v Speaker 3>bash, was that? That's what it was.

00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:43.050
<v Speaker 1>It might be a caret instead of the

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:43.850
<v Speaker 1>dollar.

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:44.570
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:46.890
<v Speaker 0>Less than symbol instead of dollar.

00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:49.930
<v Speaker 3>Oh, okay. Yeah. Oh, yeah. No. Caret.

00:39:53.015 --> 00:39:54.295
<v Speaker 3>You still got the

00:39:55.015 --> 00:39:55.495
<v Speaker 3>Right?

00:39:55.815 --> 00:39:58.215
<v Speaker 1>No space. There's not space at all. Yeah.

00:39:58.215 --> 00:39:59.095
<v Speaker 4>No space.

00:40:00.055 --> 00:40:01.335
<v Speaker 3>Okay. It's fine.

00:40:03.255 --> 00:40:05.495
<v Speaker 3>Kiev gets

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:10.690
<v Speaker 3>it's probably a validating. Right? So validating

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:11.330
<v Speaker 3>web book.

00:40:21.535 --> 00:40:23.055
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you're gonna go for a fire hammer

00:40:23.055 --> 00:40:25.215
<v Speaker 0>approach? Yeah. Delete it.

00:40:25.535 --> 00:40:27.135
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. I mean, why not?

00:40:28.575 --> 00:40:30.175
<v Speaker 3>What's the worst that can happen? Right? Go

00:40:30.175 --> 00:40:32.095
<v Speaker 4>to the mall. Yeah. Give it a go.

00:40:36.589 --> 00:40:38.750
<v Speaker 3>Okay. And I didn't get recreated by some

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:39.470
<v Speaker 3>magic.

00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:41.869
<v Speaker 1>I'm surprised that worked, actually.

00:40:46.125 --> 00:40:48.285
<v Speaker 1>If it was I'll I'll take that better

00:40:48.285 --> 00:40:49.165
<v Speaker 3>luck then.

00:40:49.725 --> 00:40:51.245
<v Speaker 3>That's absolutely fine.

00:40:52.845 --> 00:40:54.205
<v Speaker 3>What was the other one? And it was

00:40:54.205 --> 00:40:55.805
<v Speaker 3>in webtighting webhook.

00:40:56.605 --> 00:40:56.925
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:01.820
<v Speaker 3>If I can type

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:03.100
<v Speaker 3>mutation,

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:06.140
<v Speaker 3>which there isn't any

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:08.620
<v Speaker 3>they're not names based on that. Okay.

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:13.100
<v Speaker 3>So now what have we got?

00:41:16.585 --> 00:41:19.385
<v Speaker 4>Status don't hold. We've now got a Postgres

00:41:19.385 --> 00:41:20.984
<v Speaker 3>that's just come to life.

00:41:22.505 --> 00:41:23.545
<v Speaker 3>What was my desktop?

00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:33.550
<v Speaker 3>So what's the honk? Because I'm guessing

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:36.670
<v Speaker 4>it's a status we're getting honked. So

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:39.310
<v Speaker 4>is there something in writing an HCD?

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:40.750
<v Speaker 4>The status is

00:41:41.325 --> 00:41:42.045
<v Speaker 4>hunk.

00:41:43.484 --> 00:41:46.045
<v Speaker 1>We we haven't bothered with it. We haven't

00:41:46.045 --> 00:41:47.885
<v Speaker 4>bothered with it. Okay. Good. I'm much too

00:41:47.885 --> 00:41:50.125
<v Speaker 1>scared to go in there. API server.

00:41:50.125 --> 00:41:52.445
<v Speaker 4>Perhaps there's some modify the code in the

00:41:52.445 --> 00:41:53.885
<v Speaker 4>API server to return hunk.

00:41:57.590 --> 00:41:59.430
<v Speaker 3>It's back fail restarting

00:41:59.430 --> 00:41:59.990
<v Speaker 3>thing.

00:42:12.295 --> 00:42:14.535
<v Speaker 1>You can have a look at the processes

00:42:14.694 --> 00:42:17.734
<v Speaker 1>to to see if there's anything suggestive.

00:42:18.855 --> 00:42:21.815
<v Speaker 3>But it is but it is actually right?

00:42:21.815 --> 00:42:23.414
<v Speaker 3>So Yeah. That's true.

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:31.970
<v Speaker 3>Alright. Let's just optimistically change the thing and

00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:33.810
<v Speaker 3>then get rid of the readiness probe just

00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:34.370
<v Speaker 3>to

00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:35.890
<v Speaker 3>make it so that it's ready.

00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:53.570
<v Speaker 4>Once you do this, then you wanna should

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:54.930
<v Speaker 4>we have a look at the API server

00:42:54.930 --> 00:42:55.650
<v Speaker 4>config?

00:42:56.050 --> 00:42:58.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. Sure. I'm just gonna I get I'm

00:42:58.290 --> 00:43:00.050
<v Speaker 3>just gonna push in that the thing does

00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:01.970
<v Speaker 3>work. So I'm gonna get rid of the

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:03.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. Readiness and the liveliness

00:43:06.305 --> 00:43:09.265
<v Speaker 3>because I'll assume that we've done an excellent

00:43:09.265 --> 00:43:12.865
<v Speaker 3>job and that that that's that's container's absolutely

00:43:12.865 --> 00:43:14.305
<v Speaker 3>fine, and it never needs to be checked.

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:21.140
<v Speaker 4>Okay. So we've got another one now.

00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:28.339
<v Speaker 0>But what's responsible for writing the status on

00:43:28.339 --> 00:43:29.140
<v Speaker 0>a pod?

00:43:29.859 --> 00:43:30.500
<v Speaker 2>Might

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:34.175
<v Speaker 2>have a bit better luck if you

00:43:34.575 --> 00:43:36.575
<v Speaker 2>watch what's happening to the status.

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.000
<v Speaker 3>Updating

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:57.960
<v Speaker 3>endpoint sizes.

00:44:09.205 --> 00:44:10.085
<v Speaker 4>Node.

00:44:10.085 --> 00:44:11.445
<v Speaker 4>Not. What's that?

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.799
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. James set this one up, and it

00:44:24.799 --> 00:44:26.480
<v Speaker 1>doesn't show up in

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:28.960
<v Speaker 1>events either, which is quite brutal.

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:47.840
<v Speaker 0>What he's looking for in the process list?

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:48.560
<v Speaker 0>Anything?

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:49.920
<v Speaker 2>Are there any

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:53.040
<v Speaker 3>Anything that looks keywords you can think of

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.960
<v Speaker 2>that might be worth grabbing for?

00:44:58.880 --> 00:44:59.840
<v Speaker 4>Grab for a hunk.

00:45:09.685 --> 00:45:11.685
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Lower lowercase might work.

00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:18.980
<v Speaker 4>Hold on. It's very good.

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:22.500
<v Speaker 3>Okay. Very good. That's that's almost a a

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:23.940
<v Speaker 3>hacker's reference. Right?

00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:24.900
<v Speaker 3>What

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:26.740
<v Speaker 3>have you done?

00:45:34.885 --> 00:45:36.885
<v Speaker 3>And where is that? Oh, it's in a

00:45:36.885 --> 00:45:38.325
<v Speaker 3>container somewhere, presumably.

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:47.670
<v Speaker 3>What container is that gonna be in? Presumably

00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:50.230
<v Speaker 3>the API server. Right? Yeah. Probably.

00:45:51.590 --> 00:45:53.110
<v Speaker 4>Or the cubelet,

00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:55.590
<v Speaker 4>maybe. The cubelet on the nodes might be

00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:56.630
<v Speaker 4>sending that back.

00:45:59.945 --> 00:46:02.425
<v Speaker 1>You can also see the the parent of

00:46:02.425 --> 00:46:03.625
<v Speaker 1>the of

00:46:03.625 --> 00:46:04.505
<v Speaker 1>the process.

00:46:10.345 --> 00:46:11.705
<v Speaker 1>How did you do that? I'm trying to

00:46:11.705 --> 00:46:11.945
<v Speaker 3>It's a

00:46:12.665 --> 00:46:13.545
<v Speaker 0>Try e f.

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.480
<v Speaker 3>E f. And then it's the

00:46:16.799 --> 00:46:18.799
<v Speaker 3>what was the thing?

00:46:18.799 --> 00:46:19.520
<v Speaker 3>It's

00:46:21.039 --> 00:46:21.520
<v Speaker 1>that one.

00:46:32.085 --> 00:46:34.164
<v Speaker 3>Oh, there's a funny namespace somewhere.

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:46.720
<v Speaker 3>So that one, and there was a

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:50.240
<v Speaker 3>container's in an angry geese.

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:53.760
<v Speaker 3>Container

00:46:54.825 --> 00:46:57.785
<v Speaker 3>d, but it's not running actually in there.

00:47:04.425 --> 00:47:06.025
<v Speaker 0>So what are you thinking just now?

00:47:07.625 --> 00:47:09.500
<v Speaker 3>I'll try to get rid of that JS

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:11.339
<v Speaker 3>policy thing that's not helping us anyway. But

00:47:11.339 --> 00:47:11.980
<v Speaker 3>the

00:47:13.339 --> 00:47:14.300
<v Speaker 3>there's a

00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:17.420
<v Speaker 3>container namespace of angry geese,

00:47:21.825 --> 00:47:23.665
<v Speaker 3>which seems suspect. I did that p s

00:47:23.665 --> 00:47:25.345
<v Speaker 3>dash e f, but that's giving me, like,

00:47:25.345 --> 00:47:27.265
<v Speaker 3>a load of things, not just the tree.

00:47:29.105 --> 00:47:30.224
<v Speaker 3>I think I did p s dash e

00:47:30.224 --> 00:47:31.105
<v Speaker 3>f, didn't I?

00:47:31.425 --> 00:47:32.145
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

00:47:33.585 --> 00:47:35.345
<v Speaker 3>I think you're doing it with a what

00:47:35.345 --> 00:47:35.984
<v Speaker 0>was the number?

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:39.940
<v Speaker 3>That was the number of the process that

00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:42.740
<v Speaker 3>we cared about. Right? That opts

00:47:43.779 --> 00:47:44.980
<v Speaker 3>honk the planet.

00:47:45.859 --> 00:47:47.380
<v Speaker 3>So I wanted to see the parent of

00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:47.940
<v Speaker 3>that process.

00:47:49.645 --> 00:47:51.085
<v Speaker 3>It was this one. Right?

00:47:53.965 --> 00:47:56.045
<v Speaker 0>Can you just do PSEF on its own?

00:47:56.045 --> 00:47:58.045
<v Speaker 0>You should get a tree. I could be

00:47:58.045 --> 00:47:58.845
<v Speaker 0>mistaken.

00:48:01.485 --> 00:48:02.765
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you need a

00:48:14.329 --> 00:48:16.329
<v Speaker 0>So I think you've got two avenues right

00:48:16.329 --> 00:48:16.569
<v Speaker 0>now.

00:48:17.615 --> 00:48:20.255
<v Speaker 0>You're suspecting that this the file does not

00:48:20.255 --> 00:48:21.855
<v Speaker 0>exist on the host. You're you're pretty much

00:48:21.855 --> 00:48:23.694
<v Speaker 0>looking for a container that's running it. So

00:48:23.694 --> 00:48:25.295
<v Speaker 0>I mean, you can run a QControl get

00:48:25.295 --> 00:48:28.015
<v Speaker 0>pods all and look for random container accounts

00:48:28.015 --> 00:48:30.110
<v Speaker 0>in a pod, or you're gonna have to

00:48:30.110 --> 00:48:32.270
<v Speaker 0>use cry control to list containers that are

00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:33.950
<v Speaker 0>running outside of Kubernetes.

00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:41.470
<v Speaker 0>But if you're happy that that looks normal,

00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:43.310
<v Speaker 0>then you're gonna wanna start looking for containers

00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:45.885
<v Speaker 0>that are not in the Kubernetes namespace.

00:48:46.605 --> 00:48:49.725
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Thanks, Noah. It was p s f

00:48:49.725 --> 00:48:51.485
<v Speaker 0>a u x for the tree.

00:48:52.045 --> 00:48:54.285
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. F a u x is really good.

00:48:56.765 --> 00:48:57.805
<v Speaker 3>So

00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:00.200
<v Speaker 3>it might not help me at all, but

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:00.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm just gonna

00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:03.960
<v Speaker 3>delete all the pods and let everything come

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:05.640
<v Speaker 3>back in case it wasn't set up as

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:07.000
<v Speaker 3>something that was persistent.

00:49:09.079 --> 00:49:10.839
<v Speaker 0>That sounds like a scary thing to do.

00:49:11.515 --> 00:49:12.555
<v Speaker 3>Why not?

00:49:13.675 --> 00:49:15.995
<v Speaker 4>No. I I don't know if you delete

00:49:15.995 --> 00:49:18.235
<v Speaker 4>everything. Don't delete anything from cube system.

00:49:18.715 --> 00:49:19.995
<v Speaker 3>Why not? It's just a pod. It will

00:49:19.995 --> 00:49:20.635
<v Speaker 3>come back.

00:49:21.355 --> 00:49:22.475
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. Yeah.

00:49:22.795 --> 00:49:24.475
<v Speaker 3>I mean, no one's telling me not to,

00:49:24.475 --> 00:49:26.395
<v Speaker 3>that it'll be a really bad idea. What's

00:49:26.395 --> 00:49:28.660
<v Speaker 4>the what's what's the container runtime on this?

00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:30.820
<v Speaker 0>Container d. So you could just crack Should

00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:33.620
<v Speaker 4>we should we check what containers are running?

00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:37.460
<v Speaker 0>We can indeed. There's also Cryo control. I'm

00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:38.260
<v Speaker 4>guessing they're just running.

00:49:39.215 --> 00:49:42.095
<v Speaker 4>I'm guessing you you started that container using

00:49:42.095 --> 00:49:43.375
<v Speaker 4>the the runtime.

00:49:43.535 --> 00:49:45.375
<v Speaker 0>Yes. So let me add the flag for

00:49:45.375 --> 00:49:47.135
<v Speaker 0>you just because I do know it off

00:49:47.135 --> 00:49:47.375
<v Speaker 0>the

00:49:48.015 --> 00:49:50.255
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. I've never used a cryo control.

00:49:50.495 --> 00:49:52.575
<v Speaker 4>Oops. Sorry. Oops. Sorry. Sorry.

00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:57.160
<v Speaker 0>Run.

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.480
<v Speaker 4>Right. Look at that.

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:05.000
<v Speaker 3>Ah, okay. Cool.

00:50:08.195 --> 00:50:10.915
<v Speaker 4>Okay. So can we check what containers are

00:50:10.915 --> 00:50:11.475
<v Speaker 4>running?

00:50:11.795 --> 00:50:13.635
<v Speaker 0>You can also use CTR

00:50:14.595 --> 00:50:15.955
<v Speaker 0>and do a CTRPS

00:50:15.955 --> 00:50:17.475
<v Speaker 0>as well. So it depends whether you want

00:50:17.475 --> 00:50:19.315
<v Speaker 0>look at it from Kubernetes context or from

00:50:19.315 --> 00:50:20.755
<v Speaker 0>a container d context.

00:50:21.155 --> 00:50:22.115
<v Speaker 0>You could do.

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:24.240
<v Speaker 0>It's l s.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:26.640
<v Speaker 0>Is it?

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:29.600
<v Speaker 2>PC l s. So this container PC l

00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:30.320
<v Speaker 4>s. Okay.

00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:31.840
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. L

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:32.880
<v Speaker 0>s. Right.

00:50:35.925 --> 00:50:37.845
<v Speaker 4>So But it's in a

00:50:38.165 --> 00:50:42.405
<v Speaker 3>in that angry geese namespace. Right? So Yes.

00:50:42.405 --> 00:50:43.845
<v Speaker 0>So you can add a dash n to

00:50:43.845 --> 00:50:44.485
<v Speaker 0>that. Yeah.

00:50:44.965 --> 00:50:46.245
<v Speaker 3>What was it? Angry

00:50:46.405 --> 00:50:47.285
<v Speaker 3>geese,

00:50:47.605 --> 00:50:48.325
<v Speaker 3>which we saw.

00:50:49.610 --> 00:50:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You need to put the n before

00:50:51.930 --> 00:50:52.490
<v Speaker 1>Before

00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:55.210
<v Speaker 0>the c, I think. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. It's

00:50:55.210 --> 00:50:56.490
<v Speaker 1>a bit of a pain.

00:51:01.494 --> 00:51:02.695
<v Speaker 0>There we go. Cool.

00:51:03.415 --> 00:51:05.494
<v Speaker 3>Okay. That'll do it. So that's the thing

00:51:05.494 --> 00:51:06.695
<v Speaker 3>I wanna get rid of.

00:51:07.895 --> 00:51:08.535
<v Speaker 3>So

00:51:08.695 --> 00:51:11.255
<v Speaker 3>what was the that's l s. So what's

00:51:11.255 --> 00:51:11.494
<v Speaker 3>the

00:51:12.375 --> 00:51:13.895
<v Speaker 0>You can do a CRM.

00:51:14.215 --> 00:51:15.175
<v Speaker 4>CRM. Okay.

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:19.840
<v Speaker 3>Start by that.

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:22.640
<v Speaker 4>Then It's a spice.

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:26.320
<v Speaker 0>C space r m and then the ID.

00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:26.640
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:51:30.045 --> 00:51:32.685
<v Speaker 2>You must have been the task first.

00:51:33.244 --> 00:51:34.445
<v Speaker 0>Dash dash f.

00:51:36.525 --> 00:51:38.525
<v Speaker 0>Or dash f. Sorry. Or dash dash force.

00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:42.540
<v Speaker 0>No?

00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:49.420
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you might have to We're

00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:51.500
<v Speaker 0>all showing our container d ignorance here.

00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:55.420
<v Speaker 2>You might have to stop the task first.

00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:56.460
<v Speaker 2>So if you do TLS,

00:51:56.915 --> 00:51:58.355
<v Speaker 4>t space l s. Okay.

00:52:00.515 --> 00:52:02.595
<v Speaker 3>So say again. Say t space l s.

00:52:02.675 --> 00:52:03.955
<v Speaker 2>C c t r

00:52:04.435 --> 00:52:06.035
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. T

00:52:06.035 --> 00:52:07.155
<v Speaker 2>for task.

00:52:08.115 --> 00:52:10.835
<v Speaker 0>Like that? Space space l s. Yeah. Yeah.

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:13.980
<v Speaker 4>And then Okay.

00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:16.140
<v Speaker 4>Now we can remove it.

00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:19.180
<v Speaker 2>So you need to RM both the task

00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:20.220
<v Speaker 2>on the container.

00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:21.100
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:23.020
<v Speaker 3>Okay. Fine.

00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:26.940
<v Speaker 2>And you might even need to

00:52:27.465 --> 00:52:29.545
<v Speaker 2>stop the task first sometimes. I have to

00:52:29.545 --> 00:52:30.745
<v Speaker 0>shut down the machine.

00:52:33.545 --> 00:52:35.625
<v Speaker 0>I was just trying to Why Nerd

00:52:35.625 --> 00:52:37.465
<v Speaker 2>CTL is much nicer if you have it,

00:52:37.465 --> 00:52:37.865
<v Speaker 2>but it's

00:52:40.505 --> 00:52:41.865
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Nerd CTL is good.

00:52:44.730 --> 00:52:47.530
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So So what was Stop the task.

00:52:47.530 --> 00:52:48.970
<v Speaker 3>Right. See, task

00:52:49.610 --> 00:52:53.370
<v Speaker 3>syntax for that is, like, kill that task.

00:52:56.184 --> 00:52:57.225
<v Speaker 3>And then

00:52:59.065 --> 00:53:00.744
<v Speaker 3>r m that task.

00:53:03.545 --> 00:53:05.944
<v Speaker 0>I think the killer should hopefully have done

00:53:05.944 --> 00:53:07.385
<v Speaker 0>that. You'll now need to do a container

00:53:07.385 --> 00:53:08.825
<v Speaker 0>l s to see if the container still

00:53:08.825 --> 00:53:10.424
<v Speaker 0>exists, and if so, you'll need to remove

00:53:10.424 --> 00:53:10.825
<v Speaker 0>that too.

00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:13.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

00:53:13.570 --> 00:53:15.570
<v Speaker 3>But my task is still running even though

00:53:15.570 --> 00:53:16.610
<v Speaker 3>I've killed it.

00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:17.970
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So now you should be able to

00:53:17.970 --> 00:53:20.610
<v Speaker 0>remove the container. Oh, wait. It is still

00:53:20.610 --> 00:53:22.450
<v Speaker 3>running. I mean, the task is still running.

00:53:23.010 --> 00:53:25.250
<v Speaker 2>You sometimes have to do kill dash s

00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:25.810
<v Speaker 2>sig kill.

00:53:32.905 --> 00:53:34.185
<v Speaker 2>Then yeah.

00:53:37.385 --> 00:53:38.665
<v Speaker 3>Alright. Okay. Stop.

00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:45.840
<v Speaker 3>It is.

00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:50.240
<v Speaker 3>It's back running again. Fucker.

00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:55.359
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Can you I would try a t

00:53:55.359 --> 00:53:56.880
<v Speaker 0>r m dash

00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:58.905
<v Speaker 0>f. Must be a force flag on that

00:53:58.905 --> 00:54:00.985
<v Speaker 0>task or task delete.

00:54:02.025 --> 00:54:04.185
<v Speaker 3>Well, we saw it stop momentarily. So can

00:54:04.185 --> 00:54:05.945
<v Speaker 3>I just, like, string the commands along each

00:54:05.945 --> 00:54:07.865
<v Speaker 3>other? Is there some delay between them?

00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:11.000
<v Speaker 2>There isn't an extra thing that we made

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.200
<v Speaker 2>you do here, by the way. You should

00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:13.160
<v Speaker 2>just be able to

00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:16.600
<v Speaker 2>kill RM and then RM the container.

00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:20.280
<v Speaker 1>It's a work Always.

00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:21.480
<v Speaker 1>Restarting

00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:24.915
<v Speaker 1>it. You've done some other accidental magic.

00:54:29.155 --> 00:54:31.315
<v Speaker 0>We'll check the parameters on t r m.

00:54:31.315 --> 00:54:32.835
<v Speaker 0>There must be a a way to force

00:54:32.835 --> 00:54:33.795
<v Speaker 0>remove this thing.

00:54:35.019 --> 00:54:35.660
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:54:36.299 --> 00:54:37.020
<v Speaker 3>Fine.

00:54:43.579 --> 00:54:44.779
<v Speaker 0>Would you like me to type for a

00:54:44.779 --> 00:54:45.980
<v Speaker 0>moment? Because

00:54:46.545 --> 00:54:47.905
<v Speaker 0>I'm really curious.

00:54:49.025 --> 00:54:49.585
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

00:54:49.825 --> 00:54:51.025
<v Speaker 3>I was gonna do that or just I

00:54:51.025 --> 00:54:53.265
<v Speaker 3>was gonna exec into it and just stop

00:54:53.265 --> 00:54:54.704
<v Speaker 3>it doing whatever it's doing. I just want

00:54:54.704 --> 00:54:57.265
<v Speaker 0>to do an RN dash f and that's

00:54:57.265 --> 00:54:57.744
<v Speaker 0>gone now.

00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:01.760
<v Speaker 3>What was doing? I'm

00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:03.120
<v Speaker 3>sure that's what I did at some point.

00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:05.200
<v Speaker 0>You need to check for the container.

00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:13.055
<v Speaker 3>So it's c l s, and then I

00:55:13.055 --> 00:55:14.015
<v Speaker 3>want to

00:55:14.894 --> 00:55:15.855
<v Speaker 3>see our

00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:29.100
<v Speaker 0>Stop on that one, I think.

00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:33.260
<v Speaker 3>Because who needs consistent

00:55:33.339 --> 00:55:34.220
<v Speaker 3>contacts?

00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:38.140
<v Speaker 0>No? Yeah. And You can't do CRM, I

00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:38.300
<v Speaker 2>think.

00:55:40.385 --> 00:55:42.385
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. We were doing CRM earlier.

00:55:42.625 --> 00:55:44.145
<v Speaker 3>I did r m. That's how I'm thinking

00:55:44.145 --> 00:55:45.984
<v Speaker 3>because it wasn't stopped. Is there any parameters

00:55:45.984 --> 00:55:46.704
<v Speaker 0>to r m?

00:55:52.809 --> 00:55:54.089
<v Speaker 0>You might need to do a dash dash

00:55:54.089 --> 00:55:55.370
<v Speaker 0>help. Yeah. It

00:55:56.329 --> 00:55:57.530
<v Speaker 0>doesn't look like that.

00:55:57.930 --> 00:56:00.410
<v Speaker 0>No, let's just keep snapshots there. Yeah. You're

00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:01.610
<v Speaker 0>gonna have to do a

00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:05.849
<v Speaker 0>Why is the container still there?

00:56:08.825 --> 00:56:10.425
<v Speaker 0>Is the task still there? Let's do a

00:56:10.425 --> 00:56:11.385
<v Speaker 0>TLS

00:56:11.385 --> 00:56:13.785
<v Speaker 0>because I'm curious if it's magically come back.

00:56:16.425 --> 00:56:17.145
<v Speaker 3>Yes. But

00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:21.880
<v Speaker 3>Right. Okay. If I just exec onto the

00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:24.440
<v Speaker 3>running thing, and then I can do some

00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:26.600
<v Speaker 3>other magic and just stop it doing the

00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:27.560
<v Speaker 3>thing that it's doing,

00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:28.600
<v Speaker 3>maybe.

00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.320
<v Speaker 1>You want to

00:56:31.875 --> 00:56:35.315
<v Speaker 1>use Nerd CTL. It's it's way more comfortable

00:56:35.315 --> 00:56:37.955
<v Speaker 1>to use. It's more more Docker style.

00:56:38.115 --> 00:56:40.115
<v Speaker 0>Also not available on the machine right now,

00:56:40.115 --> 00:56:40.595
<v Speaker 0>though.

00:56:41.395 --> 00:56:43.955
<v Speaker 2>Okay. Unless we downloaded it and put it

00:56:43.955 --> 00:56:45.235
<v Speaker 2>somewhere sneaky

00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:46.400
<v Speaker 2>on the machine.

00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:48.720
<v Speaker 4>You think we're gonna trust your tools?

00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:53.440
<v Speaker 3>Trust them on the mind. Yeah. You you

00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:55.280
<v Speaker 2>type dot n c t l?

00:56:57.775 --> 00:56:59.935
<v Speaker 3>Let's just attach onto the thing and quickly

00:57:00.175 --> 00:57:01.055
<v Speaker 3>if I can see if can do that

00:57:01.055 --> 00:57:02.175
<v Speaker 3>quickly, and then

00:57:04.975 --> 00:57:07.295
<v Speaker 3>what was I gonna say? MS is task

00:57:07.295 --> 00:57:08.255
<v Speaker 3>exec,

00:57:09.375 --> 00:57:12.200
<v Speaker 3>like, onto that. Presumably, I'm gonna guess what

00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:13.480
<v Speaker 3>the syntax is.

00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:16.280
<v Speaker 2>You need a parameter called dash dash exec

00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:17.400
<v Speaker 2>dash pid.

00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:21.160
<v Speaker 2>I sorry. Exec ID

00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:22.680
<v Speaker 2>for reasons I don't understand.

00:57:24.085 --> 00:57:26.085
<v Speaker 0>And who says continue is not easy to

00:57:26.085 --> 00:57:26.885
<v Speaker 0>work with.

00:57:28.885 --> 00:57:30.405
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I'm gonna throw it. Why don't you

00:57:30.405 --> 00:57:32.245
<v Speaker 0>try a task pause? Like, we don't actually

00:57:32.245 --> 00:57:33.205
<v Speaker 0>need to get rid of it. We just

00:57:33.205 --> 00:57:35.045
<v Speaker 0>want to stop it doing its naughty things.

00:57:35.045 --> 00:57:36.805
<v Speaker 0>Right? Correct. Let's try a t pause.

00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:38.780
<v Speaker 4>No. That's a good shot.

00:57:50.795 --> 00:57:51.435
<v Speaker 3>Oh,

00:57:51.914 --> 00:57:52.795
<v Speaker 3>that board.

00:57:58.795 --> 00:58:00.635
<v Speaker 0>And then confirm with a

00:58:00.875 --> 00:58:01.194
<v Speaker 0>yeah.

00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:03.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't know. Still running.

00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:06.660
<v Speaker 3>That's that's not fair.

00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:09.060
<v Speaker 4>Is there is there a process that's starting

00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:09.700
<v Speaker 4>to or

00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:12.500
<v Speaker 2>That that failing, yeah, you can

00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:15.300
<v Speaker 2>see if you can identify a process that

00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:16.655
<v Speaker 2>you might be able to kill. Yeah. There's

00:58:16.655 --> 00:58:19.055
<v Speaker 4>a process that's probably running this. Let me

00:58:19.055 --> 00:58:19.615
<v Speaker 4>check.

00:58:20.415 --> 00:58:21.695
<v Speaker 4>Any other processes?

00:58:22.815 --> 00:58:26.015
<v Speaker 4>Grep for maybe angry or geese or hunk.

00:58:32.869 --> 00:58:34.470
<v Speaker 4>That's the one, isn't it?

00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:38.470
<v Speaker 4>Container edition one c.

00:58:38.869 --> 00:58:39.910
<v Speaker 4>Mainstream.

00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:43.829
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't help.

00:58:44.835 --> 00:58:47.395
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. The shim was always gonna be recreated.

00:58:47.715 --> 00:58:48.675
<v Speaker 0>Just

00:58:48.675 --> 00:58:50.035
<v Speaker 0>in the interest of time,

00:58:50.355 --> 00:58:52.115
<v Speaker 0>how did you just create this task? Because

00:58:52.115 --> 00:58:54.595
<v Speaker 0>I'm really surprised task RN didn't get rid

00:58:54.595 --> 00:58:56.755
<v Speaker 0>of it. You got a system deep process

00:58:56.755 --> 00:58:58.275
<v Speaker 0>running or a rogue script?

00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:02.080
<v Speaker 2>Node CTL with always restart.

00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:03.840
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:07.120
<v Speaker 0>So if you type dot dot n CTL,

00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:08.800
<v Speaker 2>you'll get Node CTL.

00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:12.320
<v Speaker 1>And it might be a few fix the

00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:14.095
<v Speaker 1>problem. Problem. You should be able to kill

00:59:14.095 --> 00:59:15.055
<v Speaker 2>it from that

00:59:15.455 --> 00:59:16.575
<v Speaker 2>a bit more easily.

00:59:18.335 --> 00:59:18.895
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:59:21.535 --> 00:59:23.935
<v Speaker 1>It looks like the always kind of thing

00:59:24.015 --> 00:59:25.455
<v Speaker 1>isn't an official

00:59:25.615 --> 00:59:26.815
<v Speaker 1>container d feature.

00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:29.180
<v Speaker 1>So I think it does some magic to

00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:30.460
<v Speaker 1>keep itself alive.

00:59:32.059 --> 00:59:34.140
<v Speaker 0>Sneaky sneaky. Good to know.

00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:37.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we even expected it to

00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:40.540
<v Speaker 1>stay alive this long. Stay

00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:42.540
<v Speaker 1>around for a bit.

00:59:43.845 --> 00:59:45.205
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Is it gone?

00:59:45.685 --> 00:59:47.045
<v Speaker 0>Is it actually gone?

00:59:48.965 --> 00:59:51.045
<v Speaker 4>Chris is doing everything. Stop. Kill our end.

00:59:51.045 --> 00:59:52.165
<v Speaker 4>Just to make sure.

00:59:52.485 --> 00:59:54.485
<v Speaker 3>Great. Bye. Bye.

00:59:59.670 --> 01:00:01.990
<v Speaker 4>Okay. Not a terminate. Oh, you've been terminated

01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:03.830
<v Speaker 4>for a while, aren't you? So I'm assuming

01:00:03.830 --> 01:00:06.550
<v Speaker 0>your anger, Geese, was constantly updating the status

01:00:06.550 --> 01:00:07.430
<v Speaker 0>of those

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:08.630
<v Speaker 0>pods.

01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:09.990
<v Speaker 2>Mhmm.

01:00:11.295 --> 01:00:12.015
<v Speaker 2>So

01:00:12.575 --> 01:00:13.615
<v Speaker 2>run a world through loop.

01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:29.820
<v Speaker 0>You have

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:34.220
<v Speaker 0>that's not good considering you deleted that namespace.

01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:37.260
<v Speaker 4>JS policy.

01:00:41.035 --> 01:00:41.915
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:00:42.395 --> 01:00:44.155
<v Speaker 0>You're gonna have to check for those still

01:00:44.155 --> 01:00:45.675
<v Speaker 1>coming. Like, mission controllers.

01:00:46.715 --> 01:00:47.115
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:57.869
<v Speaker 1>The original intention with the policy engine

01:00:58.190 --> 01:01:00.349
<v Speaker 1>was to have the admission controller get in

01:01:00.349 --> 01:01:00.990
<v Speaker 1>the way,

01:01:01.710 --> 01:01:04.510
<v Speaker 1>but also protect itself from removal.

01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:06.349
<v Speaker 1>But but that didn't quite work.

01:01:08.195 --> 01:01:11.075
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Ten minutes that you'd have to remove

01:01:11.475 --> 01:01:13.875
<v Speaker 1>the admission Yep. At all.

01:01:15.395 --> 01:01:17.155
<v Speaker 4>I think delete them both

01:01:17.555 --> 01:01:18.275
<v Speaker 4>webhooks.

01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:24.660
<v Speaker 2>Maybe

01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:27.220
<v Speaker 2>the dash dash all didn't actually work in

01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:28.100
<v Speaker 2>the back end.

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.020
<v Speaker 0>It did appear to work.

01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:32.980
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:01:35.555 --> 01:01:38.755
<v Speaker 4>Alright. I'll just do your busy bots again.

01:01:39.955 --> 01:01:42.435
<v Speaker 1>And just make sure that JS policy is

01:01:42.435 --> 01:01:45.235
<v Speaker 1>gone because it it might be recreating this.

01:01:45.235 --> 01:01:46.915
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. Definitely. It will will be.

01:01:49.089 --> 01:01:50.610
<v Speaker 3>But that that doesn't matter.

01:01:51.810 --> 01:01:52.530
<v Speaker 3>Alright.

01:01:55.650 --> 01:01:56.930
<v Speaker 3>So now I've got a

01:01:57.410 --> 01:01:59.250
<v Speaker 3>thing that looks like it's gonna start.

01:02:00.690 --> 01:02:03.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I think the creation is because your

01:02:03.815 --> 01:02:05.175
<v Speaker 1>you know, tag change.

01:02:21.299 --> 01:02:23.060
<v Speaker 4>Yes. The clustered is up.

01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:25.380
<v Speaker 4>Postgres, is it coming up?

01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:27.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:29.299
<v Speaker 3>That's good. No. Let's check it. I think

01:02:29.299 --> 01:02:31.140
<v Speaker 4>it's checked. It was up and running, both

01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:33.380
<v Speaker 4>of them, and just to get bugs. K.

01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:34.339
<v Speaker 3>Alright. Yeah. Cool.

01:02:35.845 --> 01:02:37.525
<v Speaker 3>I mean, I could optimistically

01:02:37.525 --> 01:02:39.285
<v Speaker 3>ask you to check it, but I'm

01:02:39.765 --> 01:02:41.845
<v Speaker 3>That's still version one. Right?

01:02:42.085 --> 01:02:43.685
<v Speaker 4>That do you wanna No. We changed it.

01:02:43.685 --> 01:02:45.365
<v Speaker 3>I think, don't we? We changed it already?

01:02:45.765 --> 01:02:46.085
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:48.180
<v Speaker 0>Well, let's check. Let's

01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:50.180
<v Speaker 4>check. Let's check. Yeah. Go on then. Go

01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:52.420
<v Speaker 3>for it. It's definitely not that.

01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:54.740
<v Speaker 3>That's gonna be something else.

01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:58.100
<v Speaker 0>Oh, failed to connect the database.

01:02:58.734 --> 01:02:59.615
<v Speaker 0>Authentication

01:02:59.615 --> 01:03:00.095
<v Speaker 0>failed. Okay.

01:03:01.615 --> 01:03:03.295
<v Speaker 3>But it that's it's got that far. So

01:03:03.295 --> 01:03:05.454
<v Speaker 3>the thing works, so I just now can't

01:03:05.454 --> 01:03:08.255
<v Speaker 3>connect to the database. Well, the database credentials

01:03:08.255 --> 01:03:11.135
<v Speaker 0>are all hard coded and configured in the

01:03:11.135 --> 01:03:12.494
<v Speaker 0>postgres stateful set.

01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:15.110
<v Speaker 4>Okay. But it was an old failure. That's

01:03:15.110 --> 01:03:16.390
<v Speaker 3>what you said. Right? Was an old failure.

01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:18.310
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Connectivity looked good.

01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:21.670
<v Speaker 4>So just the password then?

01:03:23.830 --> 01:03:25.350
<v Speaker 3>K. You've got all

01:03:25.830 --> 01:03:26.550
<v Speaker 3>edits

01:03:28.215 --> 01:03:29.815
<v Speaker 3>a stateful set.

01:03:36.295 --> 01:03:38.455
<v Speaker 0>Yep. The password has been changed.

01:03:38.855 --> 01:03:39.895
<v Speaker 3>Ah, okay.

01:03:41.335 --> 01:03:42.855
<v Speaker 3>Where is the password?

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:45.160
<v Speaker 0>I believe it's postgres

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.080
<v Speaker 0>one two three,

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:49.320
<v Speaker 0>but I will confirm for you now.

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:52.920
<v Speaker 0>I really should know this. Is there anywhere

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:54.360
<v Speaker 3>that I would have been able to find

01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:54.920
<v Speaker 3>it?

01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:56.200
<v Speaker 0>It's in that

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:57.880
<v Speaker 0>text. On the workload. Yeah.

01:03:59.615 --> 01:04:01.455
<v Speaker 0>So the password should be

01:04:04.175 --> 01:04:05.855
<v Speaker 0>Postgres PostgresQL

01:04:05.855 --> 01:04:07.135
<v Speaker 0>one two three. Yep.

01:04:07.615 --> 01:04:09.214
<v Speaker 3>Okay. So I just had an extra few

01:04:09.214 --> 01:04:11.695
<v Speaker 3>characters thrown on the end. Oh, your machine

01:04:11.695 --> 01:04:13.535
<v Speaker 0>controllers are back. Back.

01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:15.670
<v Speaker 3>Fine. Machine controller.

01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:21.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm

01:04:21.350 --> 01:04:23.430
<v Speaker 3>not gonna care about trying to fix them

01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:25.670
<v Speaker 3>and change the things that kicks. Obviously, it

01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:27.190
<v Speaker 3>lets me get away with that quickly before

01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:27.910
<v Speaker 3>it respawns.

01:04:34.615 --> 01:04:37.255
<v Speaker 0>You're gonna have to delete GS policy pod

01:04:37.335 --> 01:04:38.855
<v Speaker 0>add deployment, sorry,

01:04:39.255 --> 01:04:41.575
<v Speaker 0>and the GS policy namespace. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:04:41.575 --> 01:04:43.175
<v Speaker 3>If I could delete that namespace, didn't I?

01:04:43.530 --> 01:04:45.530
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. But there's probably a finalizer on the

01:04:45.530 --> 01:04:46.890
<v Speaker 0>GS policy part.

01:04:49.450 --> 01:04:51.770
<v Speaker 0>I just delete the deployment and hope for

01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:54.010
<v Speaker 0>the best rather than namespace.

01:05:03.595 --> 01:05:05.115
<v Speaker 3>No. I'm gonna bother looking at what it

01:05:05.115 --> 01:05:05.675
<v Speaker 3>is.

01:05:10.795 --> 01:05:13.915
<v Speaker 3>Alright. And then

01:05:12.759 --> 01:05:15.240
<v Speaker 3>one more thing. Three, two, one.

01:05:18.519 --> 01:05:19.160
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

01:05:22.359 --> 01:05:23.720
<v Speaker 4>Okay. Give me a sec.

01:05:30.385 --> 01:05:31.665
<v Speaker 0>Not healthy yet.

01:05:32.065 --> 01:05:34.225
<v Speaker 0>Alright. There we go. Let's try refresh.

01:05:35.905 --> 01:05:37.905
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Yeah. You got the dash. Oh, it's

01:05:37.905 --> 01:05:38.145
<v Speaker 3>right.

01:05:38.910 --> 01:05:39.869
<v Speaker 4>Nice work.

01:05:41.950 --> 01:05:42.590
<v Speaker 4>Work.

01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:43.470
<v Speaker 4>Good work.

01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:46.350
<v Speaker 0>Five minutes to spare. Loads of time.

01:05:47.790 --> 01:05:48.750
<v Speaker 3>Well done.

01:05:49.630 --> 01:05:50.510
<v Speaker 4>Well done.

01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:52.750
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Nice clusters there. Well done, everyone.

01:05:54.935 --> 01:05:56.215
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Good job, guys.

01:05:56.935 --> 01:05:58.615
<v Speaker 4>Good job. Yeah. Was really good.

01:05:59.015 --> 01:06:00.775
<v Speaker 0>So that's a really I I think the

01:06:00.775 --> 01:06:02.775
<v Speaker 0>takeaway there for me, I had no idea

01:06:02.775 --> 01:06:05.335
<v Speaker 0>that nets nerds control offered that always restart.

01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:07.829
<v Speaker 0>Like, that's that's not behavior I expected to

01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:10.950
<v Speaker 0>see from continuity there. So, like, does NerdControl

01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:13.829
<v Speaker 0>have a long running process that was instigating

01:06:13.829 --> 01:06:15.110
<v Speaker 0>that? I'm not sure.

01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:16.710
<v Speaker 2>So we were

01:06:18.815 --> 01:06:20.335
<v Speaker 2>were Go on, Jack. Sorry.

01:06:21.375 --> 01:06:22.974
<v Speaker 1>I was gonna say, yeah, when you when

01:06:22.974 --> 01:06:24.895
<v Speaker 1>you add the dash dash always,

01:06:25.375 --> 01:06:27.855
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure how exactly it works. But

01:06:27.855 --> 01:06:31.220
<v Speaker 1>we noticed, like, it injects itself in to

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:34.099
<v Speaker 1>the container to like capture logs and stuff.

01:06:34.099 --> 01:06:34.580
<v Speaker 1>So

01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:36.020
<v Speaker 1>it must do

01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:38.740
<v Speaker 1>do some injection where it like adds itself

01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:39.859
<v Speaker 1>in so it can

01:06:40.099 --> 01:06:41.940
<v Speaker 1>re add containers or

01:06:42.579 --> 01:06:42.980
<v Speaker 1>something.

01:06:43.385 --> 01:06:45.065
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. A sneaky

01:06:45.065 --> 01:06:45.545
<v Speaker 0>one.

01:06:46.025 --> 01:06:48.665
<v Speaker 0>Then Magic. Basically. Magic. That's what I was

01:06:48.665 --> 01:06:49.385
<v Speaker 3>describing.

01:06:50.025 --> 01:06:52.345
<v Speaker 0>And I also love that the you never

01:06:52.345 --> 01:06:54.425
<v Speaker 0>really got the GS policy thing doing exactly

01:06:54.425 --> 01:06:55.944
<v Speaker 0>what you wanted, but it was still causing

01:06:55.944 --> 01:06:58.345
<v Speaker 0>absolute havoc through the entire thing as well.

01:06:59.319 --> 01:07:02.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I'm not sure if it can cause

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:04.920
<v Speaker 1>kinda more hassle that way or not.

01:07:05.319 --> 01:07:06.200
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:08.440
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well,

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:10.200
<v Speaker 0>yeah.

01:07:10.359 --> 01:07:12.440
<v Speaker 0>Those those are great. Well done, both teams.
