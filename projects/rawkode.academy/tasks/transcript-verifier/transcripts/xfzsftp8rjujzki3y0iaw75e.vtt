00:01:17.534 --> 00:01:18.335
<v Speaker 0>Hello,

00:01:18.415 --> 00:01:21.854
<v Speaker 0>everyone, and welcome back to the Rawkode Academy.

00:01:21.935 --> 00:01:24.255
<v Speaker 0>Happy New Year. I hope you all enjoyed

00:01:24.255 --> 00:01:26.735
<v Speaker 0>your vacation time off, family time, or whatever

00:01:26.735 --> 00:01:28.015
<v Speaker 0>you got up to over the last few

00:01:28.015 --> 00:01:28.255
<v Speaker 0>weeks.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.820
<v Speaker 0>My name is David Flanagan. I'm the host

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.580
<v Speaker 0>here, and this is an episode of Rawkode

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.340
<v Speaker 0>live. Rawkode live is a show where we

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.180
<v Speaker 0>take a look at the latest and greatest

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.260
<v Speaker 0>open source tools within the cloud native and

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.300
<v Speaker 0>adjacent spaces.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.980
<v Speaker 0>And today, we are doing a bit of

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.980
<v Speaker 0>a follow-up where we previously took a look

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:43.540
<v Speaker 0>at Gitea,

00:01:44.035 --> 00:01:47.395
<v Speaker 0>an open source alternative to using GitHub, GitLab,

00:01:47.395 --> 00:01:49.795
<v Speaker 0>etcetera. And today, we're gonna see what's new

00:01:49.795 --> 00:01:51.875
<v Speaker 0>and take a look at Gitea

00:01:51.955 --> 00:01:52.674
<v Speaker 0>actions.

00:01:53.075 --> 00:01:54.915
<v Speaker 0>Same as last time, we're gonna be joined

00:01:54.995 --> 00:01:57.235
<v Speaker 0>by Matthew from the Gitea team. Hey, man.

00:01:57.235 --> 00:01:59.210
<v Speaker 0>How's it going? Hey. It's going well. Thanks.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.930
<v Speaker 1>So just a brief, rundown on me.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Not much has changed last time. I'm still

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.290
<v Speaker 1>a project lead of Gitea. We

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.570
<v Speaker 1>just celebrated

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.050
<v Speaker 1>our, eighth year birthday,

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.170
<v Speaker 1>just in no

00:02:12.915 --> 00:02:15.314
<v Speaker 1>sorry. We're going into our eighth year starting

00:02:15.314 --> 00:02:17.474
<v Speaker 1>in November, so I think it's seventh birthday,

00:02:17.474 --> 00:02:18.275
<v Speaker 1>how that works.

00:02:18.594 --> 00:02:20.515
<v Speaker 1>2016 was when we started.

00:02:21.635 --> 00:02:22.195
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:02:23.234 --> 00:02:26.754
<v Speaker 1>So lots of exciting new developments with Gitea

00:02:26.754 --> 00:02:28.114
<v Speaker 1>since last time we chatted.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.500
<v Speaker 1>In 2022,

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.460
<v Speaker 1>we launched

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.220
<v Speaker 1>the alpha of

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.660
<v Speaker 1>Giteactions,

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.140
<v Speaker 1>the built in CICD solution. And

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.755
<v Speaker 1>with this latest major release this past fall,

00:02:41.755 --> 00:02:42.315
<v Speaker 1>we

00:02:44.715 --> 00:02:45.675
<v Speaker 1>it's now

00:02:47.035 --> 00:02:49.595
<v Speaker 1>fully released, and everyone can use it. It's

00:02:49.915 --> 00:02:53.515
<v Speaker 1>compatible with GitHub actions, and I'm excited to

00:02:53.515 --> 00:02:55.275
<v Speaker 1>be here to talk with you about it

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:56.715
<v Speaker 1>and walk through

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.030
<v Speaker 1>getting it set up and using it.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:00.710
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.270
<v Speaker 0>Well, it's been about a year, and you've

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.950
<v Speaker 0>covered most of the things that have changed,

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.590
<v Speaker 0>which is cool. But, like, I'm curious about

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.350
<v Speaker 0>you know, new features are amazing. Like, we

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.030
<v Speaker 0>love open source and new features that get

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.470
<v Speaker 0>involved and contributing. Right?

00:03:13.405 --> 00:03:15.965
<v Speaker 0>But you're now starting I've seen Gitea Cloud

00:03:15.965 --> 00:03:19.004
<v Speaker 0>is emerging. There's now the company coming up

00:03:19.004 --> 00:03:21.325
<v Speaker 0>behind it to support that open source contribution.

00:03:21.485 --> 00:03:22.685
<v Speaker 0>Maybe you wanna share a little bit a

00:03:22.685 --> 00:03:23.805
<v Speaker 0>bit more of that and how that's all

00:03:23.805 --> 00:03:25.485
<v Speaker 0>gone as well. Yeah. Definitely.

00:03:25.724 --> 00:03:27.485
<v Speaker 1>So Commico was

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.440
<v Speaker 1>founded by some of the members of the

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 1>oversight committee and

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.040
<v Speaker 1>as a way of being able to support

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.480
<v Speaker 1>the project itself.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.319
<v Speaker 1>And so

00:03:40.694 --> 00:03:42.135
<v Speaker 1>we've been able to

00:03:42.775 --> 00:03:43.894
<v Speaker 1>in 2023

00:03:44.135 --> 00:03:45.974
<v Speaker 1>or sorry. In 2022, we were doing about

00:03:45.974 --> 00:03:47.974
<v Speaker 1>a hundred pull requests merged,

00:03:47.974 --> 00:03:51.254
<v Speaker 1>reviewed, etcetera, a month. And after the founding

00:03:51.254 --> 00:03:51.815
<v Speaker 1>of the company,

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.090
<v Speaker 1>we went up to 400 a month. Woah.

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:56.210
<v Speaker 1>And

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:57.410
<v Speaker 1>so

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.250
<v Speaker 1>lots of

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.290
<v Speaker 1>refactoring to ensure it's stable, lots of new

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.290
<v Speaker 1>features, lots of bug fixes,

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:05.730
<v Speaker 1>lots of

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.569
<v Speaker 1>a lot more

00:04:08.565 --> 00:04:10.165
<v Speaker 1>new maintainers,

00:04:10.165 --> 00:04:11.525
<v Speaker 1>community contributors.

00:04:12.805 --> 00:04:15.045
<v Speaker 1>We just hit 40,000

00:04:15.045 --> 00:04:16.404
<v Speaker 1>stars on GitHub.

00:04:17.445 --> 00:04:18.325
<v Speaker 1>And so

00:04:18.964 --> 00:04:22.805
<v Speaker 1>it's been very exciting, and Gitea Cloud is

00:04:23.365 --> 00:04:24.245
<v Speaker 1>a way of

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.940
<v Speaker 1>letting people most familiar with Gitea being able

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.020
<v Speaker 1>to run your instance for you and being

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.740
<v Speaker 1>able to

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.740
<v Speaker 1>support the project back through that.

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.060
<v Speaker 1>So even, like, through

00:04:37.645 --> 00:04:39.805
<v Speaker 1>building it out, there's

00:04:39.805 --> 00:04:41.325
<v Speaker 1>features that we needed,

00:04:41.805 --> 00:04:44.045
<v Speaker 1>bug fixes that we've been able to

00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:47.965
<v Speaker 1>from dog booting your project, being able to

00:04:47.965 --> 00:04:49.085
<v Speaker 1>put it back in.

00:04:49.645 --> 00:04:50.125
<v Speaker 1>And so,

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.770
<v Speaker 1>yeah, it's yeah.

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:55.410
<v Speaker 1>All very exciting.

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:57.490
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I was actually

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.650
<v Speaker 0>exploring a new home from, like, the Rawkode

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.729
<v Speaker 0>Academy source, and, you know, I think Gitea

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:03.490
<v Speaker 0>is pretty much where I'm gonna end up.

00:05:03.735 --> 00:05:05.335
<v Speaker 0>And one of the things that swayed me,

00:05:05.335 --> 00:05:07.414
<v Speaker 0>and it's so superficial and I feel ashamed

00:05:07.414 --> 00:05:09.014
<v Speaker 0>of myself. Right? But it wasn't like any

00:05:09.014 --> 00:05:10.215
<v Speaker 0>of the amazing features.

00:05:10.534 --> 00:05:12.535
<v Speaker 0>It was like the design

00:05:12.694 --> 00:05:14.455
<v Speaker 0>of the exclusive labels.

00:05:14.775 --> 00:05:16.134
<v Speaker 0>Just like it's such a nice touch.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.520
<v Speaker 0>Because I like to do semantic labeling on

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.840
<v Speaker 0>GitHub and GitLab and everywhere else. And it

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.520
<v Speaker 0>always looks really janky because I have, like,

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.760
<v Speaker 0>colons or slashes. And and the way that

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.200
<v Speaker 0>it works on Gitea, I said, oh, yeah.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.800
<v Speaker 0>What that? And that was the the secret

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.680
<v Speaker 0>feature. So Oh, this Gitea, that was

00:05:32.455 --> 00:05:35.735
<v Speaker 1>contributed from the Blender Foundation, the three d

00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:36.375
<v Speaker 1>open

00:05:36.855 --> 00:05:38.375
<v Speaker 1>modeling software.

00:05:39.095 --> 00:05:39.735
<v Speaker 1>And

00:05:40.135 --> 00:05:40.935
<v Speaker 1>because

00:05:41.335 --> 00:05:44.055
<v Speaker 1>we supported them through their migration from fabricator

00:05:44.055 --> 00:05:44.775
<v Speaker 1>to Gitea.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Nice.

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.190
<v Speaker 1>And so

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.510
<v Speaker 1>so they contributed stuff, and we did stuff

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.990
<v Speaker 1>for the project for them as well. And

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.430
<v Speaker 1>so, yeah, that was

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 1>Brecht specifically

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:58.630
<v Speaker 1>from

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.505
<v Speaker 1>the Blender Foundation who contributed that as well

00:06:01.505 --> 00:06:01.985
<v Speaker 1>as

00:06:02.625 --> 00:06:04.465
<v Speaker 1>many other things as well. So we're very

00:06:04.465 --> 00:06:05.425
<v Speaker 1>thankful for

00:06:05.745 --> 00:06:08.225
<v Speaker 1>them, the community, and yeah.

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:11.425
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's just those those subtle touches and

00:06:11.425 --> 00:06:13.500
<v Speaker 0>attention to detail that just make it more

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.819
<v Speaker 0>pleasant. And I I like the responsiveness of

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:18.139
<v Speaker 0>all the issues and people contributing as well.

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:20.540
<v Speaker 0>It gives me confidence when I'm adopting something.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.379
<v Speaker 0>But, yeah. I mean, I'm not here just

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:23.580
<v Speaker 0>to sit and sing the praises of the

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 0>project. No. I just I'll I'll just say

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.340
<v Speaker 0>I was very, very happy and very impressed

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.115
<v Speaker 0>when I was looking at it just literally

00:06:29.115 --> 00:06:31.515
<v Speaker 0>two months ago. So, anyway, let's get back

00:06:31.515 --> 00:06:33.355
<v Speaker 0>on track. Oh, no. Definitely.

00:06:33.755 --> 00:06:35.595
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's just do a quick I know

00:06:35.595 --> 00:06:37.115
<v Speaker 0>you didn't say it to hear some of

00:06:37.115 --> 00:06:39.275
<v Speaker 0>your stuff, but is there anything in the

00:06:39.275 --> 00:06:41.915
<v Speaker 0>like it's been fifteen, sixteen months, I think,

00:06:41.915 --> 00:06:43.650
<v Speaker 0>since we we did our stream together. So

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.650
<v Speaker 0>what's happened in that time? And if you

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.650
<v Speaker 0>wanna talk about besides actions, we will get

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.770
<v Speaker 0>to Oh, definitely. Yeah. Actually, I think one

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.250
<v Speaker 1>of the things that launched just after

00:06:56.085 --> 00:06:56.805
<v Speaker 1>our

00:06:57.205 --> 00:07:02.005
<v Speaker 1>last livestream was we introduced Gitea packages where

00:07:04.645 --> 00:07:07.285
<v Speaker 1>it's we're now supporting, like, 20 different types

00:07:07.285 --> 00:07:10.320
<v Speaker 1>of packages, docker images, helm charts,

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.280
<v Speaker 1>Ruby gems, Rust cargo,

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Python, PyPI, Alpine,

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Debian devs, RPMs,

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.240
<v Speaker 1>and, like,

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.000
<v Speaker 1>a whole bunch more. So being able to

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.000
<v Speaker 1>store your artifacts

00:07:24.525 --> 00:07:25.965
<v Speaker 1>inside the application,

00:07:26.525 --> 00:07:28.925
<v Speaker 1>and link it to your, source control and

00:07:28.925 --> 00:07:30.685
<v Speaker 1>releases if need be.

00:07:30.925 --> 00:07:32.845
<v Speaker 1>So that's very exciting, and,

00:07:33.725 --> 00:07:34.285
<v Speaker 1>that's,

00:07:34.925 --> 00:07:37.960
<v Speaker 1>definitely ties in with, actions because you can

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.880
<v Speaker 1>use actions to build your Docker container and

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.640
<v Speaker 1>push it just into your,

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.160
<v Speaker 1>instance as well and keep it all self

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:45.880
<v Speaker 1>contained,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.200
<v Speaker 1>have that,

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.800
<v Speaker 1>data ownership, data sovereignty over your own stuff

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.200
<v Speaker 1>so,

00:07:53.045 --> 00:07:55.045
<v Speaker 1>you can sure it doesn't go away.

00:07:55.925 --> 00:07:56.805
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:07:58.405 --> 00:07:59.045
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:07:59.285 --> 00:08:02.405
<v Speaker 0>I actually which again, it's it's I feel

00:08:02.405 --> 00:08:04.165
<v Speaker 0>like I'm just saying these things because you're

00:08:04.165 --> 00:08:05.925
<v Speaker 0>on the stream, but, honestly, I was exploding

00:08:05.925 --> 00:08:07.445
<v Speaker 0>and playing with this just, like, two months

00:08:07.445 --> 00:08:07.685
<v Speaker 0>ago.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.220
<v Speaker 0>And the package stuff is what I was

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.900
<v Speaker 0>looking at because I have a a mono

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:12.780
<v Speaker 0>repository

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.020
<v Speaker 0>with, you know, dozens of services, and it's

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.780
<v Speaker 0>going to be hundreds of services eventually.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.380
<v Speaker 0>They all have their own container image, and

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.060
<v Speaker 0>the registry was a big part of, like,

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.260
<v Speaker 0>what was interesting there as well.

00:08:22.175 --> 00:08:23.615
<v Speaker 0>But I did notice, and I have opened

00:08:23.615 --> 00:08:24.815
<v Speaker 0>an issue for this. I'm not gonna just

00:08:24.815 --> 00:08:26.175
<v Speaker 0>run at you as someone who's on my

00:08:26.175 --> 00:08:27.935
<v Speaker 0>screen. Right? But Giteapp

00:08:27.935 --> 00:08:30.415
<v Speaker 0>and GitLab also have this problem where

00:08:30.655 --> 00:08:32.575
<v Speaker 0>when you have a mono repository, the releases

00:08:32.575 --> 00:08:34.334
<v Speaker 0>always assume it's like a single artifact. And

00:08:34.334 --> 00:08:36.895
<v Speaker 0>although they can have names, it's very difficult

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:39.440
<v Speaker 0>to browse and navigate and segment that page.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.000
<v Speaker 0>I I'd love to try and, you know,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.760
<v Speaker 0>raise the priority of that issue and fix

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.360
<v Speaker 0>it live right now. We're not looking at

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.240
<v Speaker 0>actions. Let's

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.040
<v Speaker 0>yeah. So that's just my own little wish

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.440
<v Speaker 0>list, but awesome. The package stuff is very,

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:51.760
<v Speaker 0>very cool.

00:08:53.305 --> 00:08:55.545
<v Speaker 0>Right. Anything else besides that you wanna cover?

00:08:56.105 --> 00:08:56.825
<v Speaker 1>No.

00:08:57.305 --> 00:08:59.785
<v Speaker 1>Let's see. Yeah. Packages, actions.

00:09:00.745 --> 00:09:02.425
<v Speaker 1>We did project boards last time we were

00:09:02.425 --> 00:09:04.425
<v Speaker 1>here, I think. That was already in.

00:09:04.904 --> 00:09:08.829
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's great. Let's just dive right in.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:10.670
<v Speaker 0>Well, I'm I'm gonna ask you a slightly

00:09:10.829 --> 00:09:13.310
<v Speaker 0>Oh, sure. Controversial question, not to put you

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:14.829
<v Speaker 0>against the water f on that. Right? But

00:09:14.829 --> 00:09:15.470
<v Speaker 0>the

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.389
<v Speaker 0>the trend so far from what I see

00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:19.310
<v Speaker 0>with what we have discussed on the stream

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:21.245
<v Speaker 0>and what I see on the project is

00:09:21.245 --> 00:09:22.285
<v Speaker 0>Gitea's

00:09:22.285 --> 00:09:24.285
<v Speaker 0>adopting and implementing a lot of things that

00:09:24.285 --> 00:09:26.605
<v Speaker 0>provide a backwards compatibility. And therefore, may be

00:09:26.605 --> 00:09:27.965
<v Speaker 0>coming from GitHub.

00:09:28.445 --> 00:09:30.605
<v Speaker 0>And as as we're gonna see with actions,

00:09:30.605 --> 00:09:32.125
<v Speaker 0>right, you you talked about how it's compatible

00:09:32.125 --> 00:09:34.205
<v Speaker 0>with that. How do you use a a

00:09:34.205 --> 00:09:34.925
<v Speaker 0>TOC

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.120
<v Speaker 0>decide

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.399
<v Speaker 0>when it's

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.120
<v Speaker 0>better to just support people coming in versus

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.199
<v Speaker 0>innovation? Like, or can you do both? Like,

00:09:42.199 --> 00:09:43.880
<v Speaker 0>I wonder how those conversations work.

00:09:44.279 --> 00:09:46.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. No. That's definitely something.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.079
<v Speaker 1>And in fact, with actions,

00:09:49.505 --> 00:09:51.105
<v Speaker 1>we did deviate

00:09:51.185 --> 00:09:54.865
<v Speaker 1>just ever so slightly from the GitHub standards

00:09:54.865 --> 00:09:55.905
<v Speaker 1>not to

00:09:57.185 --> 00:09:58.545
<v Speaker 1>make a breaking change,

00:09:58.705 --> 00:10:01.505
<v Speaker 1>but just to add upon it. With

00:10:01.985 --> 00:10:03.105
<v Speaker 1>GitHub actions,

00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:06.320
<v Speaker 1>it's very tied into the GitHub ecosystem.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.160
<v Speaker 1>It's user slash repo

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.279
<v Speaker 1>at, git tag, and that's your actions.

00:10:11.759 --> 00:10:13.839
<v Speaker 1>But because we wanted to be able to

00:10:13.839 --> 00:10:15.920
<v Speaker 1>have actions hosted elsewhere,

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.279
<v Speaker 1>we actually

00:10:17.545 --> 00:10:19.465
<v Speaker 1>introduced a a new URL,

00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:22.665
<v Speaker 1>schema for being able to define your actions

00:10:22.665 --> 00:10:26.585
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere. So instead of GitHub username, GitHub repo,

00:10:26.585 --> 00:10:27.545
<v Speaker 1>Git tag,

00:10:27.945 --> 00:10:30.105
<v Speaker 1>you can actually pass in a full URL

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.960
<v Speaker 1>of a Git repo elsewhere. So if

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.560
<v Speaker 1>you wanna use

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.640
<v Speaker 1>an actions hosted on Gitea.com,

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.200
<v Speaker 1>Gitea Com / user / repo.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:42.720
<v Speaker 1>And

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.144
<v Speaker 1>but we keep it backwards compatible with GitHub.

00:10:46.144 --> 00:10:47.904
<v Speaker 1>So if you do have that username slash

00:10:47.904 --> 00:10:48.704
<v Speaker 1>repo

00:10:48.944 --> 00:10:49.824
<v Speaker 1>format,

00:10:49.985 --> 00:10:52.144
<v Speaker 1>it will fetch it from GitHub directly.

00:10:52.944 --> 00:10:55.105
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Alright. I look forward to seeing that

00:10:55.105 --> 00:10:57.425
<v Speaker 0>as we explore actions as we move into

00:10:57.425 --> 00:10:58.305
<v Speaker 0>the hands on component.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.760
<v Speaker 0>What I'll say for the people watching, if

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.680
<v Speaker 0>you do have any questions, please drop them

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.440
<v Speaker 0>into the comment section. Matti and I would

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.360
<v Speaker 0>be happy to chat about them and hopefully

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.040
<v Speaker 0>get you some answers at the same time

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:08.680
<v Speaker 0>too.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.960
<v Speaker 0>Alright, Matti. Are you ready to get a

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.320
<v Speaker 0>terminal and start playing with some stuff?

00:11:14.515 --> 00:11:15.235
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:11:15.395 --> 00:11:17.475
<v Speaker 0>Fingers crossed. I'm I'm sure you're confident it's

00:11:17.475 --> 00:11:18.915
<v Speaker 0>gonna work. Right? Come on.

00:11:20.515 --> 00:11:21.395
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:11:21.395 --> 00:11:23.075
<v Speaker 0>Where's my screen share?

00:11:23.155 --> 00:11:24.115
<v Speaker 0>Disappeared.

00:11:25.795 --> 00:11:27.315
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I'm not sharing my screen. That's the

00:11:27.315 --> 00:11:28.640
<v Speaker 0>problem. Alright.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.480
<v Speaker 0>I swear I've done this before.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.720
<v Speaker 0>Alright. And then pop back here for a

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.040
<v Speaker 0>second.

00:11:42.975 --> 00:11:45.295
<v Speaker 0>I made the terrible mistake of trying to

00:11:45.295 --> 00:11:47.214
<v Speaker 0>have Microsoft Edge, and now I need to

00:11:47.214 --> 00:11:49.135
<v Speaker 0>give it the permission to share my screen.

00:11:50.975 --> 00:11:53.295
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And sometimes you need to restart the

00:11:53.295 --> 00:11:53.935
<v Speaker 1>browser.

00:11:54.975 --> 00:11:57.420
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Usually, I'm quite good at tracking it.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.260
<v Speaker 0>I don't wanna count my check-in as I

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.100
<v Speaker 0>am. But normally,

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.380
<v Speaker 0>I can just say, sure. Later. And then

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.060
<v Speaker 0>do the thing anyway, and it

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.380
<v Speaker 0>lets me away with it. Let's see.

00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:11.905
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:12:14.785 --> 00:12:15.825
<v Speaker 0>What

00:12:17.025 --> 00:12:19.025
<v Speaker 0>happens if I leave the stream? Shall we

00:12:19.025 --> 00:12:19.825
<v Speaker 0>find out?

00:12:20.465 --> 00:12:21.105
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:23.745
<v Speaker 1>I think because it's a YouTube,

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:27.290
<v Speaker 1>they'll keep it open so you can

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:29.610
<v Speaker 1>rejoin. People may need to refresh

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:32.090
<v Speaker 1>at the worst case.

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:35.050
<v Speaker 0>Right. Fingers crossed. I will see you in

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:36.650
<v Speaker 0>ten seconds or quicker.

00:12:43.764 --> 00:12:45.605
<v Speaker 1>Alright. If you're in chat,

00:12:45.925 --> 00:12:46.725
<v Speaker 1>just,

00:12:47.524 --> 00:12:49.605
<v Speaker 1>make sure to say something to,

00:12:50.165 --> 00:12:51.285
<v Speaker 1>show that

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:53.090
<v Speaker 1>we're still going.

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:55.010
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.170
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We're good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That that

00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.090
<v Speaker 0>was that was painless. I just said, this

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:00.770
<v Speaker 0>show is already alive. Do you wanna join?

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:02.130
<v Speaker 0>And I was like, yes, please. I don't

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.130
<v Speaker 0>wanna leave him hanging for too long. I

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:07.250
<v Speaker 0>don't know. I'm sure you were telling some

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:08.985
<v Speaker 0>awesome jokes. It's all good.

00:13:10.185 --> 00:13:11.385
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So

00:13:13.944 --> 00:13:15.305
<v Speaker 0>if we pop over here,

00:13:15.625 --> 00:13:17.065
<v Speaker 0>I have a terminal.

00:13:17.065 --> 00:13:19.785
<v Speaker 0>Let me reopen that tab that I had

00:13:19.785 --> 00:13:20.185
<v Speaker 0>too.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.520
<v Speaker 0>And we have the Gitea website.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.320
<v Speaker 0>So

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.720
<v Speaker 0>as always on Rawkode live, we're gonna do

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.200
<v Speaker 0>our best to use the documentation. That means

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.800
<v Speaker 0>that anything that we do, you can follow

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.805
<v Speaker 0>along at home in your own time. And

00:13:32.805 --> 00:13:34.405
<v Speaker 0>if we run any problems,

00:13:34.485 --> 00:13:36.965
<v Speaker 0>then fear not. We have someone on the

00:13:36.965 --> 00:13:39.525
<v Speaker 0>call who's gonna fix everything live for us.

00:13:39.525 --> 00:13:40.725
<v Speaker 0>No pressure, Matthew.

00:13:41.365 --> 00:13:41.925
<v Speaker 0>But

00:13:42.325 --> 00:13:44.085
<v Speaker 0>let's go. I take it we're just going

00:13:44.085 --> 00:13:45.125
<v Speaker 0>straight to documentation.

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Alright.

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:51.590
<v Speaker 0>No. I haven't looked at the action stuff

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:53.270
<v Speaker 0>in advance, but I'll use the nice search

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:55.430
<v Speaker 0>bar and here we go. So

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:58.150
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming this is gonna be relatively straightforward

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:01.215
<v Speaker 0>because of, you know, I'm assuming that I

00:14:01.215 --> 00:14:03.295
<v Speaker 0>definitely have experience with GitHub actions. I'm assuming

00:14:03.295 --> 00:14:06.495
<v Speaker 0>that people watching this probably have some exposure

00:14:06.495 --> 00:14:08.815
<v Speaker 0>or experience there too and it should be

00:14:11.055 --> 00:14:12.815
<v Speaker 0>plain sailing. I know that's a brave word

00:14:12.815 --> 00:14:14.015
<v Speaker 0>to throw out there at the start of

00:14:14.015 --> 00:14:16.550
<v Speaker 0>the stream. Right? But what I'm curious about

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:17.510
<v Speaker 0>now is we

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:18.310
<v Speaker 0>could

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:20.870
<v Speaker 0>take a project that doesn't have any sort

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:23.589
<v Speaker 0>of pipelines and start to build stuff together.

00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:25.509
<v Speaker 0>But based on what you've told me, I'm

00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:27.110
<v Speaker 0>assuming I could take any project that has

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:29.110
<v Speaker 0>a working pipeline just now and it should

00:14:30.154 --> 00:14:31.755
<v Speaker 0>work out the box. Right?

00:14:32.555 --> 00:14:33.355
<v Speaker 1>Mostly.

00:14:33.595 --> 00:14:34.154
<v Speaker 1>There,

00:14:34.875 --> 00:14:35.435
<v Speaker 1>it's,

00:14:35.834 --> 00:14:38.074
<v Speaker 1>that's why I say mostly GitHub actions compatible.

00:14:38.074 --> 00:14:39.915
<v Speaker 1>There are, some type of,

00:14:40.555 --> 00:14:41.195
<v Speaker 1>actions,

00:14:41.435 --> 00:14:43.595
<v Speaker 1>the composite actions in GitHub,

00:14:43.755 --> 00:14:45.035
<v Speaker 1>that aren't supported yet.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Whereas bundling of a bunch of different type

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.600
<v Speaker 1>of actions into one.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:51.720
<v Speaker 1>But

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.880
<v Speaker 1>we could start off with a blank project

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.600
<v Speaker 1>and then move on to being able to

00:14:59.264 --> 00:15:00.705
<v Speaker 1>do an existing one.

00:15:01.584 --> 00:15:02.145
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:15:03.105 --> 00:15:05.264
<v Speaker 0>So I'll ask one question, and then I'll

00:15:05.264 --> 00:15:06.785
<v Speaker 0>I'll we'll we'll just do the, like, a

00:15:06.785 --> 00:15:08.625
<v Speaker 0>cargo new or something and get a simple

00:15:08.625 --> 00:15:10.385
<v Speaker 0>Rust project on the go. But

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:13.690
<v Speaker 0>can I run Gitea actions locally? I know

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:15.530
<v Speaker 0>that's one of the main frustrations, right, when

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:17.610
<v Speaker 0>people are like, I mean, I've done this

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:19.690
<v Speaker 0>myself. You push 14 times to the main

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:21.930
<v Speaker 0>branch, Trist, like, I, fix I, fix I.

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:23.050
<v Speaker 0>And it's all because we don't have that

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:24.650
<v Speaker 0>ability just to run the damn thing locally.

00:15:24.954 --> 00:15:26.955
<v Speaker 0>Is that something that Gitea

00:15:27.355 --> 00:15:29.675
<v Speaker 0>actions has cloned, or have you fixed that?

00:15:29.915 --> 00:15:30.795
<v Speaker 1>So

00:15:31.834 --> 00:15:34.714
<v Speaker 1>so, actually so Gitea actions is based

00:15:35.595 --> 00:15:36.315
<v Speaker 1>our

00:15:36.714 --> 00:15:37.995
<v Speaker 1>engine is

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:41.290
<v Speaker 1>a fork of a project called Nekto slash

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:42.010
<v Speaker 1>Act,

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:44.650
<v Speaker 1>where it was exactly that problem that trying

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:46.570
<v Speaker 1>to solve of, like,

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:47.930
<v Speaker 1>debugging,

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:49.610
<v Speaker 1>updating your actions

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:52.235
<v Speaker 1>without having to push all the time. And

00:15:52.235 --> 00:15:54.394
<v Speaker 1>one of our maintainers is actually a maintainer

00:15:54.394 --> 00:15:56.075
<v Speaker 1>over there, and there's lots of

00:15:56.315 --> 00:15:57.274
<v Speaker 1>contributions

00:15:57.274 --> 00:15:58.875
<v Speaker 1>between the two projects.

00:15:59.435 --> 00:16:01.834
<v Speaker 1>And I was actually talking with

00:16:03.355 --> 00:16:05.195
<v Speaker 1>one of the folks over at

00:16:05.595 --> 00:16:07.274
<v Speaker 1>Dager recently, and one of

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.620
<v Speaker 1>the employees over at Dagger actually have

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.540
<v Speaker 1>a similar project

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:14.700
<v Speaker 1>that

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm completely blanking on the name,

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:18.620
<v Speaker 1>but

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.385
<v Speaker 1>it's a similar thing. And I believe they're

00:16:22.385 --> 00:16:24.225
<v Speaker 1>also using it in Dagger to be able

00:16:24.225 --> 00:16:24.945
<v Speaker 1>to support,

00:16:25.105 --> 00:16:27.105
<v Speaker 1>some of their, CI stuff.

00:16:27.425 --> 00:16:28.065
<v Speaker 1>So

00:16:30.785 --> 00:16:32.705
<v Speaker 1>your pain point has been solved for GitHub

00:16:32.705 --> 00:16:34.945
<v Speaker 1>as well, but

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:37.510
<v Speaker 1>you can do you can use the CI,

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:41.190
<v Speaker 1>this, act runner binary to run it, your

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:43.190
<v Speaker 1>workflows locally as well as,

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:46.230
<v Speaker 1>it's the same binary to run your

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:49.565
<v Speaker 1>workflows locally as on a server.

00:16:50.525 --> 00:16:53.805
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Cool. Yeah. You're right. The the tech

00:16:53.805 --> 00:16:55.565
<v Speaker 0>team do have a code name for a

00:16:55.565 --> 00:16:57.245
<v Speaker 0>project that runs those pipelines, but I can't

00:16:57.245 --> 00:16:58.925
<v Speaker 0>remember what the name of that is either.

00:16:58.925 --> 00:16:59.485
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:17:00.125 --> 00:17:02.045
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna clarify this again, and I think

00:17:02.045 --> 00:17:03.405
<v Speaker 0>we've done this on the first stream. I

00:17:03.405 --> 00:17:05.140
<v Speaker 0>keep saying Gitea, and I think you're saying

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:06.019
<v Speaker 0>Gitea.

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:06.659
<v Speaker 0>Am

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.659
<v Speaker 1>I wrong? Is it Gitea? Or just I

00:17:11.619 --> 00:17:12.980
<v Speaker 1>say Gitea.

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:15.220
<v Speaker 1>Other members of the team say it differently.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.780
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much everyone I talk to says it

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:18.500
<v Speaker 1>differently. It's

00:17:19.605 --> 00:17:20.964
<v Speaker 0>I'm pretty sure you could run a livestream

00:17:20.964 --> 00:17:22.244
<v Speaker 0>where all you do is pick up random

00:17:22.244 --> 00:17:24.244
<v Speaker 0>projects and talk about the naming because everybody

00:17:24.244 --> 00:17:26.244
<v Speaker 0>seems to get this stuff wildly different. Anyway,

00:17:27.445 --> 00:17:28.484
<v Speaker 0>not that important.

00:17:28.645 --> 00:17:30.565
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So you you we're gonna create a

00:17:30.565 --> 00:17:32.885
<v Speaker 0>new project. We're gonna build a Gitea pipeline,

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:35.630
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm. I'm just gonna do cargo new. Unless,

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:37.710
<v Speaker 0>do you have a preferred runtime or language

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:39.470
<v Speaker 0>that you wanna use for this demo?

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:41.950
<v Speaker 1>Generally,

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:45.070
<v Speaker 1>like, we do everything in Go, so

00:17:46.075 --> 00:17:48.875
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'd be most familiar with.

00:17:49.675 --> 00:17:52.315
<v Speaker 1>But for extra challenges, we could do Rust.

00:17:52.315 --> 00:17:54.475
<v Speaker 1>I just I'm not familiar with the GitHub

00:17:54.475 --> 00:17:55.755
<v Speaker 1>actions for Rust,

00:17:55.915 --> 00:17:57.915
<v Speaker 1>which is what we'd likely use.

00:17:58.875 --> 00:18:00.555
<v Speaker 0>No problem. I can do Go.

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.669
<v Speaker 0>Well, I can write enough Go or remember

00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:05.190
<v Speaker 0>enough Go that I can do hello world

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:06.629
<v Speaker 0>at least anyway. So

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:15.510
<v Speaker 0>I'll go in.

00:18:23.985 --> 00:18:25.345
<v Speaker 0>Main dot whole. I was trying to work

00:18:25.345 --> 00:18:27.105
<v Speaker 0>it while I was against syntax highlighting. I

00:18:27.105 --> 00:18:29.185
<v Speaker 0>was like, have I forgotten go? Alright.

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:35.150
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I have forgotten. And your package definition

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:37.550
<v Speaker 1>as well. Oh, your package page. Thank you.

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:38.030
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:41.950
<v Speaker 0>That's why I couldn't import. Okay. Thank you.

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:44.750
<v Speaker 0>So let's just check. If we do go

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:47.070
<v Speaker 0>run main, we should get hello world. Nice

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:48.110
<v Speaker 0>and simple. Alright.

00:18:48.655 --> 00:18:50.975
<v Speaker 0>So I'm a go developer. I've ran a

00:18:50.975 --> 00:18:53.295
<v Speaker 0>million dollar program. I wanna put together some

00:18:53.295 --> 00:18:55.375
<v Speaker 0>sort of pipeline to start shipping.

00:18:55.535 --> 00:18:57.215
<v Speaker 0>Let's just say a container image.

00:18:57.615 --> 00:19:00.255
<v Speaker 0>What's what's my first step then with Giteactions?

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.710
<v Speaker 1>So,

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:04.310
<v Speaker 1>first step is,

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:07.350
<v Speaker 1>we assume you have a Gitea instance,

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.270
<v Speaker 1>set up already, and I saw that you

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:11.029
<v Speaker 1>signed up for Gitea.com,

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:12.870
<v Speaker 1>within the past week.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:15.110
<v Speaker 1>So we can push, the repos there,

00:19:15.865 --> 00:19:17.705
<v Speaker 1>and you can hook up your runner,

00:19:18.025 --> 00:19:19.864
<v Speaker 1>to your user over there as well.

00:19:21.065 --> 00:19:21.784
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:19:22.184 --> 00:19:22.904
<v Speaker 1>So

00:19:24.904 --> 00:19:26.985
<v Speaker 1>I believe this is just an overview, and

00:19:26.985 --> 00:19:29.065
<v Speaker 1>we can pop over to quick start. Fingers

00:19:29.065 --> 00:19:30.825
<v Speaker 1>crossed. That's where our

00:19:31.559 --> 00:19:32.999
<v Speaker 1>documentation is.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:33.799
<v Speaker 1>So

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.839
<v Speaker 1>it's already enabled on the instance.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.039
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.480
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So the first thing I need to

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.679
<v Speaker 0>do is just make sure I have access

00:19:44.679 --> 00:19:46.294
<v Speaker 0>to to act then.

00:19:46.535 --> 00:19:48.695
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So there's

00:19:49.415 --> 00:19:53.175
<v Speaker 1>you can download the binary from the release

00:19:53.175 --> 00:19:53.975
<v Speaker 1>page.

00:19:54.775 --> 00:19:57.575
<v Speaker 1>There's also the docker image,

00:19:58.135 --> 00:19:59.335
<v Speaker 1>which does make it

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:02.930
<v Speaker 1>you do need to do,

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:05.650
<v Speaker 1>some stuff, to expose,

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:08.690
<v Speaker 1>the Docker socket if you're running the

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:09.970
<v Speaker 1>runner

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:12.770
<v Speaker 1>inside of Docker for Docker and Docker.

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:13.730
<v Speaker 1>So

00:20:15.925 --> 00:20:17.845
<v Speaker 1>the binary might be easiest

00:20:18.405 --> 00:20:21.845
<v Speaker 1>because it's just download that executable and run

00:20:21.845 --> 00:20:22.405
<v Speaker 1>it.

00:20:24.245 --> 00:20:27.285
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, I am gonna try something slightly

00:20:27.285 --> 00:20:27.605
<v Speaker 0>different.

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.940
<v Speaker 0>Just because I've been playing have you heard

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.059
<v Speaker 0>of Package X?

00:20:34.179 --> 00:20:36.100
<v Speaker 1>I haven't. No. Have you done a livestream

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:36.979
<v Speaker 1>on that yet?

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:39.380
<v Speaker 0>No. I I I should reach out. So

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:40.820
<v Speaker 0>it's well, you may have heard of it

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.260
<v Speaker 0>as t, but they renamed it because I

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:43.860
<v Speaker 0>think people were getting a bit confused with

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.325
<v Speaker 0>the blockchain or tea protocol stuff. And I

00:20:46.325 --> 00:20:47.844
<v Speaker 0>guess I'm sorry. It's essentially

00:20:48.644 --> 00:20:50.884
<v Speaker 0>a successor to Homebrew by the original author

00:20:50.884 --> 00:20:51.844
<v Speaker 0>of Homebrew.

00:20:51.924 --> 00:20:52.964
<v Speaker 1>Oh, exciting.

00:20:53.445 --> 00:20:53.764
<v Speaker 0>And

00:20:54.404 --> 00:20:54.964
<v Speaker 0>yeah.

00:20:55.684 --> 00:20:57.605
<v Speaker 0>I can remember what the first line of

00:20:57.605 --> 00:20:59.524
<v Speaker 0>this fail is. You just need a list

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:00.730
<v Speaker 0>of packages.

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:02.249
<v Speaker 0>But I can just do this

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:05.289
<v Speaker 0>and it will give me act.

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.450
<v Speaker 0>And I think it's just dependencies.

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:10.409
<v Speaker 0>And from here,

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:13.210
<v Speaker 0>if we run dev,

00:21:14.675 --> 00:21:16.274
<v Speaker 0>it resolves the graft.

00:21:16.675 --> 00:21:17.075
<v Speaker 0>And

00:21:17.555 --> 00:21:18.274
<v Speaker 0>now,

00:21:19.235 --> 00:21:20.274
<v Speaker 0>we have act.

00:21:20.435 --> 00:21:20.995
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:21:21.795 --> 00:21:24.595
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty neat. Yeah. So that's act,

00:21:24.755 --> 00:21:25.955
<v Speaker 1>but we'll need

00:21:26.539 --> 00:21:28.219
<v Speaker 1>the act runner. So

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:32.700
<v Speaker 0>You have to throw that in the works.

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.380
<v Speaker 0>I didn't know we needed something else. That's

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:35.820
<v Speaker 1>alright. It's

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:37.979
<v Speaker 1>it's just a different URL, but

00:21:38.539 --> 00:21:39.340
<v Speaker 1>it's

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.220
<v Speaker 1>pretty much the same.

00:21:41.245 --> 00:21:41.965
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:21:42.684 --> 00:21:45.005
<v Speaker 0>The package x has something called a pantry,

00:21:45.005 --> 00:21:46.285
<v Speaker 0>and if it doesn't exist or not, it

00:21:46.285 --> 00:21:48.205
<v Speaker 0>doesn't exist. So I guess we're gonna have

00:21:48.205 --> 00:21:50.284
<v Speaker 0>to go the other route then. So Mm-mm.

00:21:51.325 --> 00:21:52.845
<v Speaker 0>That was a nice idea while it ran.

00:21:52.845 --> 00:21:54.605
<v Speaker 0>I'm just gonna go to the download page.

00:21:54.605 --> 00:21:55.485
<v Speaker 0>Let's keep it simple.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:21:59.179
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.460
<v Speaker 0>Let's look like the latest.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.419
<v Speaker 0>And we want

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.179
<v Speaker 0>Arm 64.

00:22:07.419 --> 00:22:07.740
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm.

00:22:10.315 --> 00:22:12.715
<v Speaker 0>And what I'll do is just

00:22:12.875 --> 00:22:14.955
<v Speaker 0>move it from downloads

00:22:16.315 --> 00:22:17.754
<v Speaker 0>to ActRunner,

00:22:18.875 --> 00:22:20.075
<v Speaker 0>two month plus x,

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:22.090
<v Speaker 0>And schedule move.

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:26.409
<v Speaker 0>What is it on that m one Mac?

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:27.290
<v Speaker 0>Opt.

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:52.510
<v Speaker 0>Okay. We have act and act runner. Any

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:53.710
<v Speaker 0>other prerequisites?

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:54.910
<v Speaker 0>I can jump back over to the docs

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:56.669
<v Speaker 0>if there's a list.

00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:58.429
<v Speaker 1>Just

00:22:58.830 --> 00:22:59.870
<v Speaker 1>docker and the binary.

00:23:00.285 --> 00:23:02.525
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Then I think So we're good to

00:23:02.525 --> 00:23:05.245
<v Speaker 1>go. Sweet. So now we can run that

00:23:05.245 --> 00:23:06.044
<v Speaker 1>command.

00:23:06.925 --> 00:23:08.605
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we need an instance and a

00:23:08.605 --> 00:23:10.285
<v Speaker 0>token. Right? Yeah.

00:23:10.525 --> 00:23:12.925
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So just use git2.com?

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:13.930
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:16.330
<v Speaker 1>And you can pop over to your

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:18.330
<v Speaker 1>user settings.

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:20.010
<v Speaker 1>And

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:22.250
<v Speaker 1>there are scopes on

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:23.610
<v Speaker 1>the runners,

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:26.330
<v Speaker 1>you can either scope your runner to a

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:27.210
<v Speaker 1>repo

00:23:28.525 --> 00:23:29.245
<v Speaker 1>to

00:23:29.885 --> 00:23:30.925
<v Speaker 1>an organization,

00:23:30.925 --> 00:23:33.085
<v Speaker 1>or if you control the instance entirely, you

00:23:33.085 --> 00:23:34.524
<v Speaker 1>can scope it to

00:23:34.845 --> 00:23:36.205
<v Speaker 1>the entire instance.

00:23:37.805 --> 00:23:39.725
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I haven't imported any of my

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.220
<v Speaker 0>things yet. So let's just create a new

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:46.059
<v Speaker 0>repository. We'll call this go hello world

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.700
<v Speaker 0>and then go. There we go.

00:23:55.045 --> 00:23:56.165
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Edit.

00:23:56.405 --> 00:23:57.605
<v Speaker 0>Get remote.

00:23:57.845 --> 00:24:00.725
<v Speaker 0>Add origin. Oh, wait. It does that. Okay.

00:24:00.725 --> 00:24:01.845
<v Speaker 0>Branch.

00:24:02.485 --> 00:24:03.365
<v Speaker 0>Main.

00:24:04.325 --> 00:24:06.165
<v Speaker 0>Add git at

00:24:06.725 --> 00:24:07.605
<v Speaker 0>and commit.

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:12.070
<v Speaker 0>Horrible commit message. Punch it to me.

00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:14.229
<v Speaker 0>Push origin.

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:18.549
<v Speaker 0>I'm not adding my

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:19.029
<v Speaker 0>key.

00:24:23.865 --> 00:24:26.265
<v Speaker 1>Oh, you added, your origin as,

00:24:26.505 --> 00:24:27.705
<v Speaker 1>the HTTP

00:24:27.705 --> 00:24:28.664
<v Speaker 1>endpoints.

00:24:29.065 --> 00:24:29.784
<v Speaker 1>So

00:24:30.025 --> 00:24:31.785
<v Speaker 1>you'll have to swap your origin to the

00:24:31.785 --> 00:24:32.585
<v Speaker 1>SSH one.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:41.360
<v Speaker 0>Git.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:42.799
<v Speaker 0>Oh, okay.

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.160
<v Speaker 0>Git config.

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:04.149
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We're in business.

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:06.389
<v Speaker 0>So now

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:08.869
<v Speaker 0>if we come to

00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:11.750
<v Speaker 0>the repository,

00:25:15.615 --> 00:25:17.695
<v Speaker 0>We have our million dollar application.

00:25:18.815 --> 00:25:19.455
<v Speaker 0>Perfect.

00:25:21.535 --> 00:25:24.815
<v Speaker 0>So now is where we want to register

00:25:24.975 --> 00:25:26.655
<v Speaker 0>a runner, which is just going to be

00:25:26.655 --> 00:25:28.655
<v Speaker 0>a local runner on my machine. Right?

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:29.880
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.400
<v Speaker 0>So this instance,

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:34.120
<v Speaker 0>is this just gitea.com?

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:37.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Htpsgitea.com.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.120
<v Speaker 0>Alright. And the token, I'm assuming I'm gonna

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.520
<v Speaker 0>have to create some sort of access token.

00:25:44.715 --> 00:25:45.835
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Okay.

00:25:46.155 --> 00:25:48.795
<v Speaker 1>And so it's, this is gonna be, exposed

00:25:48.795 --> 00:25:50.955
<v Speaker 1>to the world. It's fine, because,

00:25:51.355 --> 00:25:53.355
<v Speaker 1>they rotate, once they're used.

00:25:54.715 --> 00:25:56.955
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, you can't see the entire of

00:25:56.955 --> 00:26:00.140
<v Speaker 1>it entirety of it right now. And once

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:01.980
<v Speaker 1>you use it, it can't be used again.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:02.460
<v Speaker 1>So

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:04.379
<v Speaker 0>Oh. There

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:07.179
<v Speaker 1>we go. Oh, so every time you use

00:26:07.179 --> 00:26:09.100
<v Speaker 0>a registration token, it gets rotated?

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:13.065
<v Speaker 1>Yes. Yeah. Nice. Very cool. So these are

00:26:13.065 --> 00:26:14.664
<v Speaker 1>all, one time use.

00:26:14.905 --> 00:26:16.985
<v Speaker 1>There is a capability to,

00:26:18.185 --> 00:26:19.225
<v Speaker 1>reuse them,

00:26:20.425 --> 00:26:23.065
<v Speaker 1>in if you change some settings, but by

00:26:23.065 --> 00:26:23.784
<v Speaker 1>default,

00:26:24.185 --> 00:26:25.705
<v Speaker 1>one time use only.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:27.840
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:30.880
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, looks like we we potentially have

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.960
<v Speaker 0>a runner. So let's jump back to our

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:33.360
<v Speaker 0>quick start So

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.480
<v Speaker 0>we did this.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.960
<v Speaker 0>In fact, can I now oh, not visualize

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.455
<v Speaker 0>it, but you know what? See it as

00:26:40.455 --> 00:26:43.015
<v Speaker 0>a registered runner? Refresh this page. You'll see

00:26:43.015 --> 00:26:46.215
<v Speaker 1>it there. Okay. Nice. So it's been registered.

00:26:47.015 --> 00:26:47.575
<v Speaker 1>And

00:26:48.135 --> 00:26:49.015
<v Speaker 1>the

00:26:49.015 --> 00:26:50.934
<v Speaker 1>next step is to start the daemon, and

00:26:50.934 --> 00:26:52.774
<v Speaker 1>that should be in the documentation as well.

00:26:53.335 --> 00:26:53.575
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:56.380
<v Speaker 0>Before we do that, I'll ask you a

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:57.100
<v Speaker 0>quick question.

00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.940
<v Speaker 0>This is for me to run and host

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:00.860
<v Speaker 0>my own runners. Is there a plan for

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:02.620
<v Speaker 0>the Gitea project to provide any sort of

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:04.380
<v Speaker 0>shared runners, or do you just want people

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:05.740
<v Speaker 0>to to go run their own?

00:27:06.625 --> 00:27:09.664
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So, with, Gitea Cloud,

00:27:09.904 --> 00:27:11.585
<v Speaker 1>you can, purchase,

00:27:11.745 --> 00:27:12.544
<v Speaker 1>minutes.

00:27:15.025 --> 00:27:17.585
<v Speaker 1>But due to, like, crypto mining and such,

00:27:17.825 --> 00:27:19.904
<v Speaker 1>we can't, just offer

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:21.610
<v Speaker 1>much for free.

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:24.010
<v Speaker 0>Man, those crypto miners are in everything. They

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:25.850
<v Speaker 0>jack up the prices of GPUs.

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:27.930
<v Speaker 0>Now AI's doing that too, and now we

00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:29.370
<v Speaker 0>don't even get free build.

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:33.930
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So let's go back

00:27:34.835 --> 00:27:37.235
<v Speaker 0>pop down. So we're gonna run this.

00:27:38.595 --> 00:27:39.475
<v Speaker 0>Damn it.

00:27:43.155 --> 00:27:45.155
<v Speaker 0>There you go. I'm not familiar with the

00:27:45.155 --> 00:27:47.155
<v Speaker 0>act project

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:48.190
<v Speaker 0>based on only I only know what base

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:49.390
<v Speaker 0>that you've told me at the start of

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:51.150
<v Speaker 0>the session. I'm assuming this is just gonna

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:52.990
<v Speaker 0>manage and run a whole bunch of containers

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:54.990
<v Speaker 0>on my machine for each of the pipeline

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:57.630
<v Speaker 0>steps within the the workflow file. Is that

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:00.095
<v Speaker 0>close enough? That's exactly it. Yeah. And,

00:28:00.575 --> 00:28:03.054
<v Speaker 1>so this will, run-in the foreground.

00:28:04.095 --> 00:28:06.095
<v Speaker 1>Based on configuration, you can change it, but

00:28:06.095 --> 00:28:06.895
<v Speaker 1>for now,

00:28:07.215 --> 00:28:08.575
<v Speaker 1>run it in foreground.

00:28:08.895 --> 00:28:09.855
<v Speaker 1>There's some

00:28:10.495 --> 00:28:11.295
<v Speaker 1>documentation

00:28:11.295 --> 00:28:11.935
<v Speaker 1>on

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:14.890
<v Speaker 1>running it with system d and other such

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:15.849
<v Speaker 1>ways. But

00:28:17.049 --> 00:28:18.970
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Well, just talking. Split that in half,

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:20.009
<v Speaker 0>and we're good to go.

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:23.289
<v Speaker 0>So I'm assuming now we just write

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:24.890
<v Speaker 0>our workflow file.

00:28:25.684 --> 00:28:27.124
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly it.

00:28:27.765 --> 00:28:28.565
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:28:32.804 --> 00:28:34.885
<v Speaker 0>Do you support dot GitHub just to make

00:28:34.885 --> 00:28:36.645
<v Speaker 0>the the migration for people easier, or do

00:28:36.645 --> 00:28:38.325
<v Speaker 0>you expect them to redeem the directory?

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:40.739
<v Speaker 1>I I

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:44.019
<v Speaker 1>believe we support dot GitHub,

00:28:46.019 --> 00:28:46.659
<v Speaker 1>but

00:28:49.539 --> 00:28:51.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm I can't remember off the top of

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:51.860
<v Speaker 1>my head.

00:28:52.475 --> 00:28:53.195
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:28:53.355 --> 00:28:56.075
<v Speaker 0>See, one of my biggest complaints about GitHub

00:28:56.075 --> 00:28:56.794
<v Speaker 0>actions

00:28:56.955 --> 00:28:58.955
<v Speaker 0>again, it's just such a mono repo thing,

00:28:58.955 --> 00:29:00.635
<v Speaker 0>and I always feel like a niche person

00:29:00.635 --> 00:29:02.075
<v Speaker 0>when I talk about it. But there has

00:29:02.075 --> 00:29:04.075
<v Speaker 0>to be more people doing mono repos. Right?

00:29:04.075 --> 00:29:06.075
<v Speaker 0>But they expect all of these build definitions

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:07.770
<v Speaker 0>to live at the root of my repository,

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:09.370
<v Speaker 0>and I actually want my build definition to

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:10.809
<v Speaker 0>live next to each service.

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:12.010
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm. You know, if you wanna make it

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:14.090
<v Speaker 0>so that I can have a dot Gitea

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:16.169
<v Speaker 0>workflows everywhere in my repository, I'd be a

00:29:16.169 --> 00:29:17.210
<v Speaker 0>very happy person.

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:18.730
<v Speaker 0>But not for today.

00:29:21.575 --> 00:29:23.175
<v Speaker 0>I'm just gonna copy this one just now

00:29:23.175 --> 00:29:25.335
<v Speaker 0>and we can tweak as required.

00:29:27.095 --> 00:29:27.975
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:29:28.935 --> 00:29:31.015
<v Speaker 0>So we we give it a name,

00:29:32.855 --> 00:29:34.490
<v Speaker 0>some sort of run name. I I don't

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:35.610
<v Speaker 0>know. I haven't seen I haven't seen that

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:36.730
<v Speaker 0>before. We got have actions. I don't know

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:38.250
<v Speaker 0>what that does. We tell it to run

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:39.130
<v Speaker 0>on push

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:41.050
<v Speaker 0>and then it has a job. The job

00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:43.130
<v Speaker 0>has a name. We're just seeing run on

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:45.130
<v Speaker 0>Ubuntu and then do all the things.

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:48.810
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna add one more job then, which

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:50.995
<v Speaker 0>is called go build.

00:29:52.035 --> 00:29:53.554
<v Speaker 0>And this runs

00:29:54.035 --> 00:29:54.674
<v Speaker 0>on

00:29:55.955 --> 00:29:58.195
<v Speaker 0>this could be any container image. Right? So

00:29:58.915 --> 00:29:59.554
<v Speaker 1>So

00:29:59.795 --> 00:30:01.315
<v Speaker 1>what it does is

00:30:01.555 --> 00:30:02.675
<v Speaker 1>the runs on

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:03.850
<v Speaker 1>is,

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:07.129
<v Speaker 1>like, a label for the runner itself.

00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:10.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh, okay. And as in chat that just

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:12.889
<v Speaker 1>popped up, it's actually not Ubuntu.

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:16.675
<v Speaker 1>We're by default, the act project

00:30:16.675 --> 00:30:17.795
<v Speaker 1>defines

00:30:19.155 --> 00:30:21.075
<v Speaker 1>the default image to be

00:30:21.395 --> 00:30:22.835
<v Speaker 1>the node

00:30:22.835 --> 00:30:24.595
<v Speaker 1>18 Docker image,

00:30:24.915 --> 00:30:27.235
<v Speaker 1>which is based on Debian.

00:30:28.275 --> 00:30:28.915
<v Speaker 1>So

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:29.980
<v Speaker 1>using

00:30:30.059 --> 00:30:32.299
<v Speaker 1>Ubuntu is a bit of a misnomer.

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:36.619
<v Speaker 1>And in

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.659
<v Speaker 1>GitHub actions, I believe it's

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.740
<v Speaker 1>the runs on wouldn't be where you put

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:43.820
<v Speaker 1>the image. It's in the container

00:30:44.445 --> 00:30:45.245
<v Speaker 1>key,

00:30:45.245 --> 00:30:45.884
<v Speaker 1>I believe.

00:30:46.445 --> 00:30:48.924
<v Speaker 0>Right. Okay. Yeah. So this would be a

00:30:48.924 --> 00:30:51.565
<v Speaker 0>runs on where we then add steps. So

00:30:51.565 --> 00:30:53.565
<v Speaker 0>this is where we'd have go

00:30:53.565 --> 00:30:56.845
<v Speaker 0>blah blah blah. Yeah. Setup action slash setup

00:30:56.845 --> 00:30:57.245
<v Speaker 1>go.

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:03.690
<v Speaker 0>And we need to check out, actually. So

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:05.210
<v Speaker 0>let's just copy that from

00:31:06.169 --> 00:31:06.889
<v Speaker 0>here.

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:13.690
<v Speaker 0>Go. And then

00:31:13.125 --> 00:31:15.125
<v Speaker 0>we'd have a container with everything we need,

00:31:15.125 --> 00:31:17.284
<v Speaker 0>and we could just say go run

00:31:17.845 --> 00:31:20.325
<v Speaker 0>main dot go. That seem okay? Yep.

00:31:20.965 --> 00:31:21.764
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:31:24.245 --> 00:31:24.565
<v Speaker 0>So

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.840
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming I'm just pushing this because we

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:29.400
<v Speaker 0>have

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.320
<v Speaker 0>a runner running, which is registered with gitea.com.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:34.440
<v Speaker 0>So provided

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:35.640
<v Speaker 0>we do a

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.240
<v Speaker 0>commit

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:38.840
<v Speaker 0>feature

00:31:38.375 --> 00:31:40.135
<v Speaker 0>new CI system.

00:31:40.615 --> 00:31:41.255
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:31:41.495 --> 00:31:42.215
<v Speaker 0>We

00:31:43.735 --> 00:31:44.615
<v Speaker 0>can do a push.

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.720
<v Speaker 0>Let's pop back over here.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.200
<v Speaker 0>And if we

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.160
<v Speaker 0>go to Rawkode,

00:32:04.674 --> 00:32:06.034
<v Speaker 0>We have one action.

00:32:08.115 --> 00:32:08.914
<v Speaker 0>Hey.

00:32:09.315 --> 00:32:11.075
<v Speaker 0>Hey. It's running. Nice.

00:32:12.595 --> 00:32:14.515
<v Speaker 0>Well, if they pop to my machine yeah.

00:32:14.515 --> 00:32:16.034
<v Speaker 0>We're starting to alright. There we go. There's

00:32:16.034 --> 00:32:18.355
<v Speaker 0>all the log outputs from our new CI.

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:26.970
<v Speaker 0>And go build. Oh, we got a fail

00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:28.410
<v Speaker 0>on the go build. Oh,

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:29.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna see what happened.

00:32:45.025 --> 00:32:47.200
<v Speaker 0>Input string was not in the correct format.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.000
<v Speaker 0>Action setup go. Did I need a version?

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. Possibly.

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:53.520
<v Speaker 1>I

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:57.280
<v Speaker 1>think it's v four might be the latest

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.120
<v Speaker 1>because

00:33:01.535 --> 00:33:03.054
<v Speaker 1>GitHub actions recently

00:33:03.055 --> 00:33:04.655
<v Speaker 1>bumped everything to

00:33:05.055 --> 00:33:06.895
<v Speaker 1>use node 20 as their base.

00:33:09.135 --> 00:33:10.015
<v Speaker 1>And so

00:33:10.255 --> 00:33:12.255
<v Speaker 1>that's the difference between v three and v

00:33:12.255 --> 00:33:12.495
<v Speaker 1>four.

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:16.050
<v Speaker 0>Well, nobody's build passes the first time.

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:20.450
<v Speaker 0>I'll give that just a moment.

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:25.890
<v Speaker 0>That was pretty fast, that first one there.

00:33:26.425 --> 00:33:28.265
<v Speaker 0>Mean, I know it's only doing echoes, but

00:33:28.265 --> 00:33:30.505
<v Speaker 0>five seconds was was bad.

00:33:30.745 --> 00:33:32.345
<v Speaker 1>And I guess so why pulled the images

00:33:32.345 --> 00:33:34.345
<v Speaker 0>there. Right? It's cached locally.

00:33:34.665 --> 00:33:37.385
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So we'll cache, the actions locally.

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:45.190
<v Speaker 1>I guess you need to define

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:47.190
<v Speaker 1>a specific version.

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:49.670
<v Speaker 0>Five.

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.750
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:54.070
<v Speaker 0>no. Before.

00:34:00.905 --> 00:34:03.465
<v Speaker 0>Oh, okay. It might require that. Yeah. Okay.

00:34:03.545 --> 00:34:04.745
<v Speaker 0>Is that what you were just saying that

00:34:04.745 --> 00:34:05.705
<v Speaker 0>I wasn't listening?

00:34:07.385 --> 00:34:08.185
<v Speaker 1>That might be

00:34:08.824 --> 00:34:10.265
<v Speaker 1>yeah. That might require it.

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:19.660
<v Speaker 0>With

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:21.020
<v Speaker 0>go

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:23.260
<v Speaker 0>one twenty one.

00:34:27.605 --> 00:34:29.605
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So, I mean, we are already doing

00:34:29.605 --> 00:34:31.445
<v Speaker 0>that thing that I said I hate. Right?

00:34:31.445 --> 00:34:33.925
<v Speaker 0>Like, fix the eye. Yeah. Yeah. Can I

00:34:33.925 --> 00:34:35.285
<v Speaker 0>test this locally first?

00:34:35.445 --> 00:34:36.805
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. So

00:34:37.445 --> 00:34:40.085
<v Speaker 1>so because you have the act runner

00:34:40.699 --> 00:34:44.139
<v Speaker 1>binary locally, you can run act underscore runner

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:45.580
<v Speaker 1>space exec,

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:47.980
<v Speaker 1>and it will

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:49.580
<v Speaker 1>and you just enter,

00:34:49.819 --> 00:34:50.619
<v Speaker 1>and then

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:52.859
<v Speaker 1>it's running it right now.

00:34:57.785 --> 00:35:00.984
<v Speaker 1>So it's fetching the go binary in the

00:35:00.984 --> 00:35:02.825
<v Speaker 1>setup go step right now.

00:35:03.065 --> 00:35:04.265
<v Speaker 1>It fetched it.

00:35:06.905 --> 00:35:09.145
<v Speaker 1>And if you scroll up at

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.980
<v Speaker 1>sec Okay. There should be the hello world.

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:12.460
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:14.619
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So let's

00:35:15.339 --> 00:35:16.220
<v Speaker 0>break it

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:19.980
<v Speaker 0>because I had it broken, so I'm gonna

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:20.860
<v Speaker 0>say broken.

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:24.700
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Perfect. K.

00:35:26.525 --> 00:35:27.245
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:35:28.285 --> 00:35:31.325
<v Speaker 0>And we'll fix that back up. And random

00:35:32.285 --> 00:35:34.125
<v Speaker 0>question, but it's something I I I use

00:35:34.125 --> 00:35:35.805
<v Speaker 0>a lot is the

00:35:36.365 --> 00:35:37.965
<v Speaker 0>be able to click the button to execute

00:35:37.965 --> 00:35:39.485
<v Speaker 0>it on the UI. I can't remember what

00:35:39.485 --> 00:35:41.190
<v Speaker 0>it's called, but it's push or it's like

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:42.950
<v Speaker 0>something else. Can I can I do that?

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:44.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. On

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:45.750
<v Speaker 1>workflow, I believe,

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:47.349
<v Speaker 1>that's not

00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:48.630
<v Speaker 1>supported yet.

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:51.830
<v Speaker 1>There's a Yeah. On dispatch or something. Yeah.

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:54.310
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Yeah. There's a

00:35:55.545 --> 00:35:57.224
<v Speaker 1>a pull request in progress for that right

00:35:57.224 --> 00:35:57.705
<v Speaker 1>now.

00:35:58.425 --> 00:35:59.305
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:35:59.545 --> 00:36:00.585
<v Speaker 1>But we

00:36:01.145 --> 00:36:02.105
<v Speaker 1>recently

00:36:02.105 --> 00:36:02.985
<v Speaker 1>launched

00:36:03.545 --> 00:36:04.265
<v Speaker 1>so

00:36:04.744 --> 00:36:06.025
<v Speaker 1>in addition to

00:36:07.305 --> 00:36:08.985
<v Speaker 1>going fully stable

00:36:09.065 --> 00:36:12.880
<v Speaker 1>with this latest major release, we also, support

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.160
<v Speaker 1>scheduled

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:16.400
<v Speaker 1>actions, so Cron as well. So that was,

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:21.840
<v Speaker 1>one of the compatibility things with GitHub actions

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.760
<v Speaker 1>that we, added as well.

00:36:24.365 --> 00:36:25.964
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Very cool. So I could just set

00:36:25.964 --> 00:36:27.565
<v Speaker 0>up a a cron run to run every

00:36:27.565 --> 00:36:29.244
<v Speaker 0>night at 3AM or whatever

00:36:29.484 --> 00:36:31.165
<v Speaker 0>and push out images.

00:36:32.365 --> 00:36:34.845
<v Speaker 1>And with same with GitHub actions you can

00:36:34.845 --> 00:36:36.204
<v Speaker 1>do on pull request. So

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:39.150
<v Speaker 1>it will only run on a pull request

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:39.870
<v Speaker 1>or

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:42.030
<v Speaker 1>push to a specific branch

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:45.470
<v Speaker 1>on tags. So if you take something,

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:47.790
<v Speaker 1>you'd have a Go release or go

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:51.070
<v Speaker 1>build your project and actually

00:36:51.444 --> 00:36:53.845
<v Speaker 1>upload the artifacts wherever you wish.

00:36:54.885 --> 00:36:55.685
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:36:55.845 --> 00:36:56.645
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:36:57.365 --> 00:36:59.605
<v Speaker 0>I mean, it's it seems to be the,

00:36:59.605 --> 00:37:01.204
<v Speaker 0>you know, the quick demo we've done pretty

00:37:01.204 --> 00:37:02.724
<v Speaker 0>much on a par with what we would

00:37:02.724 --> 00:37:04.485
<v Speaker 0>expect from GitHub actions.

00:37:04.645 --> 00:37:06.565
<v Speaker 0>And how far into the

00:37:07.269 --> 00:37:10.230
<v Speaker 0>Gitea subsystem does this go? And by that,

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:11.510
<v Speaker 0>I mean, like, you know, if I do

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:14.310
<v Speaker 0>have external contributors and pull requests

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:17.430
<v Speaker 0>and I wanna have, like, blocking merge until

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:18.150
<v Speaker 0>passing,

00:37:18.309 --> 00:37:20.470
<v Speaker 0>is this something in motion? Is this something

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:23.029
<v Speaker 0>that already exists? Like, where are we with

00:37:22.405 --> 00:37:23.845
<v Speaker 0>with that kind of migration?

00:37:24.405 --> 00:37:26.085
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So Gitea

00:37:26.245 --> 00:37:29.605
<v Speaker 1>already has, like, branch protection for pull requests,

00:37:29.605 --> 00:37:33.365
<v Speaker 1>so ensure that, like, certain statuses pass.

00:37:34.565 --> 00:37:35.125
<v Speaker 1>And

00:37:35.845 --> 00:37:38.085
<v Speaker 1>that's for external

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:39.940
<v Speaker 1>integrations,

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:41.780
<v Speaker 1>external CI,

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:43.380
<v Speaker 1>or, like, if you're

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:47.220
<v Speaker 1>if you have, like, Jira or something you

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:48.260
<v Speaker 1>need to hook up,

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:49.540
<v Speaker 1>like,

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:52.100
<v Speaker 1>some sign up in Jira and send over

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:53.540
<v Speaker 1>webhook somewhere, you can do that.

00:37:54.665 --> 00:37:55.545
<v Speaker 1>But then

00:37:56.985 --> 00:37:59.145
<v Speaker 1>in the branch protection as well,

00:38:00.905 --> 00:38:03.145
<v Speaker 1>GitHub actions come in as statuses

00:38:03.145 --> 00:38:04.425
<v Speaker 1>as well. So you can say

00:38:04.665 --> 00:38:05.465
<v Speaker 1>it requires

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.800
<v Speaker 1>these specific statuses to pass before you can

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.480
<v Speaker 1>even click the merge button.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.720
<v Speaker 1>And that would be under, branch protection. Yeah.

00:38:18.174 --> 00:38:20.175
<v Speaker 1>And you can white list who,

00:38:21.295 --> 00:38:22.575
<v Speaker 1>is able to merge,

00:38:22.815 --> 00:38:25.215
<v Speaker 1>based on, like, a team or a

00:38:26.575 --> 00:38:27.535
<v Speaker 1>user group,

00:38:27.855 --> 00:38:29.375
<v Speaker 1>or a specific user,

00:38:29.775 --> 00:38:30.895
<v Speaker 1>the number of,

00:38:31.135 --> 00:38:31.855
<v Speaker 1>approvals.

00:38:32.859 --> 00:38:35.100
<v Speaker 1>So not just, status checks,

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:38.780
<v Speaker 1>but also, like, number of approvals from a

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:40.060
<v Speaker 1>specific team. So

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:41.580
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah.

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:43.260
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:38:45.099 --> 00:38:45.740
<v Speaker 0>Very nice.

00:38:46.644 --> 00:38:47.445
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah.

00:38:52.484 --> 00:38:53.205
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:38:53.525 --> 00:38:55.845
<v Speaker 0>So I'm liking what I'm seeing.

00:38:56.404 --> 00:38:57.365
<v Speaker 0>It's very familiar.

00:38:58.859 --> 00:39:00.779
<v Speaker 0>The Ubuntu is not Ubuntu. That's me that's

00:39:00.779 --> 00:39:02.140
<v Speaker 0>gonna be the one takeaway thing that I

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:03.819
<v Speaker 0>remember for the next twelve months. Like, when

00:39:03.819 --> 00:39:05.099
<v Speaker 0>you get back to me and say, I

00:39:05.099 --> 00:39:06.700
<v Speaker 0>remember that stream of it. I remember Ubuntu

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:08.619
<v Speaker 0>is not Ubuntu. Yeah.

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:11.099
<v Speaker 1>So you can actually change it to the

00:39:11.099 --> 00:39:14.025
<v Speaker 1>Ubuntu image if you wish. We skipped a

00:39:14.025 --> 00:39:15.225
<v Speaker 1>few steps when

00:39:15.545 --> 00:39:16.745
<v Speaker 1>registering,

00:39:16.984 --> 00:39:17.785
<v Speaker 1>your runner.

00:39:18.025 --> 00:39:18.985
<v Speaker 1>If you go

00:39:19.464 --> 00:39:21.145
<v Speaker 1>if you scroll back in your terminal,

00:39:21.464 --> 00:39:23.145
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that it says,

00:39:24.025 --> 00:39:26.025
<v Speaker 1>it registered with a certain

00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:28.220
<v Speaker 1>labels

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:29.020
<v Speaker 1>of

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Ubuntu latest, Ubuntu 20, Ubuntu 18, I believe.

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:37.420
<v Speaker 1>Where are we?

00:39:39.339 --> 00:39:41.415
<v Speaker 1>And here we go. Yeah. So

00:39:41.815 --> 00:39:43.735
<v Speaker 1>I'm running with

00:39:44.215 --> 00:39:45.735
<v Speaker 1>the certain labels

00:39:47.895 --> 00:39:49.815
<v Speaker 1>a couple lines down from where your cursor

00:39:49.815 --> 00:39:50.695
<v Speaker 1>is right now

00:39:51.015 --> 00:39:53.335
<v Speaker 1>under act run daemon at the top there,

00:39:53.335 --> 00:39:54.135
<v Speaker 1>the longest line.

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:56.110
<v Speaker 1>There

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:58.430
<v Speaker 1>we go. Yep. Up.

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:00.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So running

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:03.150
<v Speaker 1>You'll see the several labels

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:05.390
<v Speaker 1>defined above, and then

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:10.030
<v Speaker 1>those actually do alias to that specific Docker

00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:10.350
<v Speaker 1>image.

00:40:11.035 --> 00:40:12.235
<v Speaker 0>But you can also

00:40:13.755 --> 00:40:15.515
<v Speaker 1>you don't need to run inside of a

00:40:15.515 --> 00:40:16.315
<v Speaker 1>Docker.

00:40:17.835 --> 00:40:20.395
<v Speaker 1>You'd not necessarily use this for if you're

00:40:20.395 --> 00:40:22.795
<v Speaker 1>accepting, like, open contributions because

00:40:23.079 --> 00:40:23.800
<v Speaker 1>then,

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:27.320
<v Speaker 1>people can run, code as the

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:30.040
<v Speaker 1>runner on whichever machine you use.

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.160
<v Speaker 1>Right now, that's the only way to run,

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:36.520
<v Speaker 1>like, if you're building an iOS application

00:40:35.895 --> 00:40:37.655
<v Speaker 1>or whatnot. If you wanna run,

00:40:38.375 --> 00:40:40.535
<v Speaker 1>like, Xcode, compile, and stuff,

00:40:41.095 --> 00:40:43.495
<v Speaker 1>you would have to have, the host mode,

00:40:43.895 --> 00:40:45.815
<v Speaker 1>so it wouldn't be isolated inside of a

00:40:45.815 --> 00:40:46.535
<v Speaker 1>container,

00:40:47.095 --> 00:40:49.015
<v Speaker 1>so people could potentially browse your

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:51.030
<v Speaker 1>file system.

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:51.990
<v Speaker 1>But again,

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:55.430
<v Speaker 1>that's not for, untrusted environments.

00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:58.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:01.190
<v Speaker 1>And you can change, the labels you want.

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:03.270
<v Speaker 1>You can change the default images.

00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:04.470
<v Speaker 1>So

00:41:05.555 --> 00:41:06.675
<v Speaker 1>yeah.

00:41:06.675 --> 00:41:07.395
<v Speaker 1>And

00:41:07.795 --> 00:41:09.795
<v Speaker 1>in fact, for the Gitea project,

00:41:10.515 --> 00:41:11.635
<v Speaker 1>we actually use,

00:41:12.115 --> 00:41:14.115
<v Speaker 1>one of the act contributors,

00:41:14.435 --> 00:41:16.035
<v Speaker 1>has built an image,

00:41:17.075 --> 00:41:19.395
<v Speaker 1>a docker image that's quite hefty,

00:41:19.795 --> 00:41:21.795
<v Speaker 1>but it's

00:41:21.339 --> 00:41:25.099
<v Speaker 1>very comparable to the virtual machine that GitHub

00:41:25.099 --> 00:41:27.020
<v Speaker 1>runners have access to. So all of the

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:27.740
<v Speaker 1>tools

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:30.859
<v Speaker 1>that are installed there,

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:33.020
<v Speaker 1>would be available to you because

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:35.339
<v Speaker 1>this docker image doesn't have things like j

00:41:35.339 --> 00:41:35.740
<v Speaker 1>q.

00:41:37.905 --> 00:41:41.585
<v Speaker 1>It's it's literally just the node docker image.

00:41:42.705 --> 00:41:44.785
<v Speaker 1>So and that's one of the ways that

00:41:46.145 --> 00:41:48.465
<v Speaker 1>existing actions might fail is they might assume

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:50.380
<v Speaker 1>that a tool is available,

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:53.020
<v Speaker 1>that isn't necessarily available in the image that

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:53.900
<v Speaker 1>you're running with.

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:56.380
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Nice.

00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:59.980
<v Speaker 0>Is there anything else from the action stuff

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:01.420
<v Speaker 0>that we haven't covered yet that you want

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:03.515
<v Speaker 0>me to to go peek into?

00:42:03.835 --> 00:42:06.555
<v Speaker 1>No. I think that was a great example

00:42:06.555 --> 00:42:07.195
<v Speaker 1>of,

00:42:08.635 --> 00:42:11.275
<v Speaker 1>I think, showing pulling an image,

00:42:12.155 --> 00:42:13.755
<v Speaker 1>like, I use as

00:42:14.155 --> 00:42:17.755
<v Speaker 1>action slash setup go. That's pulling from github.com.

00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:20.630
<v Speaker 1>And

00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:25.029
<v Speaker 0>yeah. What's the the syntax if we were

00:42:25.029 --> 00:42:25.910
<v Speaker 0>gonna use

00:42:26.069 --> 00:42:28.309
<v Speaker 0>the new thing. Right? Yeah. So it'd be

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:29.270
<v Speaker 1>instead of

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:36.485
<v Speaker 1>just actions slash checkout, it'd be htpscolon//yeety.com/actions,

00:42:36.725 --> 00:42:38.005
<v Speaker 1>/checkout,

00:42:38.885 --> 00:42:40.885
<v Speaker 1>and then add v three.

00:42:42.805 --> 00:42:43.125
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:45.530
<v Speaker 1>And, this works because,

00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:48.330
<v Speaker 1>we have the code mirrored,

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:50.170
<v Speaker 1>from Giteap.com.

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:51.690
<v Speaker 1>So if you're pulling from,

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:52.810
<v Speaker 1>giteap.com

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:54.490
<v Speaker 1>for this specific action,

00:42:54.970 --> 00:42:56.090
<v Speaker 1>it's what you'd expect.

00:42:57.954 --> 00:43:00.355
<v Speaker 0>Does this work for any arbitrary, like, Gitea

00:43:00.355 --> 00:43:01.075
<v Speaker 0>instance?

00:43:01.875 --> 00:43:03.475
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So if you wanna

00:43:03.795 --> 00:43:04.755
<v Speaker 0>Like,

00:43:05.075 --> 00:43:07.235
<v Speaker 0>code.Rawkode.academy,

00:43:07.315 --> 00:43:09.075
<v Speaker 0>like, something like that, that Yeah. That would

00:43:09.075 --> 00:43:10.115
<v Speaker 0>just work out the box. Right?

00:43:11.859 --> 00:43:13.619
<v Speaker 1>It works out of the box with a

00:43:13.619 --> 00:43:14.660
<v Speaker 1>little asterisk

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:15.380
<v Speaker 1>of

00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:18.820
<v Speaker 1>you potentially may need

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:21.380
<v Speaker 1>to set up authentication

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:24.099
<v Speaker 1>if it's, a private repository or whatnot.

00:43:26.755 --> 00:43:29.795
<v Speaker 1>GitHub actions oh, sorry. Gitea actions handles a

00:43:29.795 --> 00:43:31.315
<v Speaker 1>lot of that out of the box. When

00:43:31.315 --> 00:43:34.035
<v Speaker 1>you're cloning, it creates a temporary access,

00:43:34.275 --> 00:43:36.435
<v Speaker 1>key to be able to pull the repository.

00:43:36.755 --> 00:43:38.675
<v Speaker 1>But for, like, actions, you also need to

00:43:38.675 --> 00:43:42.000
<v Speaker 1>define saying, hey. This is a protected repository.

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.960
<v Speaker 1>You'll need to, like, be aware of that.

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:49.360
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Cool. Yeah. That's a cool little feature,

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:51.040
<v Speaker 0>especially as we

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:53.360
<v Speaker 0>try and encourage people, right, to have their

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:55.600
<v Speaker 0>Git hosting a little bit more decentralized than

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:57.145
<v Speaker 0>that than it is at the moment.

00:43:57.545 --> 00:43:58.825
<v Speaker 0>I like that approach.

00:44:00.905 --> 00:44:01.705
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:44:02.105 --> 00:44:03.704
<v Speaker 0>Let me pop this back over. We can

00:44:03.704 --> 00:44:04.905
<v Speaker 0>go always go back to the demo if

00:44:04.905 --> 00:44:05.944
<v Speaker 0>we think of something else that we wanna

00:44:05.944 --> 00:44:07.625
<v Speaker 0>show there, but I wanna kinda chat about

00:44:07.625 --> 00:44:11.070
<v Speaker 0>what was covered already. Yeah. Definitely. And so

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:13.550
<v Speaker 0>I think the the familiarity aspect of it,

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:14.670
<v Speaker 0>the fact that people don't really need to

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:16.590
<v Speaker 0>change anything when they're coming from GitHub is

00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:16.750
<v Speaker 0>just

00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:19.150
<v Speaker 0>that that's the way it probably should be.

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:21.070
<v Speaker 0>Right? You wanna make it the path of

00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:23.470
<v Speaker 0>least resistance, otherwise, developers are lazy. We're not

00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:25.155
<v Speaker 0>gonna do that. And I like that. But

00:44:25.155 --> 00:44:27.795
<v Speaker 0>you're also not unwilling to make changes, like

00:44:27.795 --> 00:44:29.875
<v Speaker 0>with the URL construct, which is also very

00:44:29.875 --> 00:44:31.955
<v Speaker 0>cool. I hope that more stuff kind of

00:44:31.955 --> 00:44:35.075
<v Speaker 0>comes along there. I like that the an

00:44:35.075 --> 00:44:37.155
<v Speaker 0>act maintainer is also working on this. That

00:44:37.155 --> 00:44:39.235
<v Speaker 0>means that that support is only gonna get

00:44:39.235 --> 00:44:41.750
<v Speaker 0>better, especially when it comes to debugging actions

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:43.030
<v Speaker 0>and stuff like that. I think that's gonna

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:44.390
<v Speaker 0>provide paramount

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:47.270
<v Speaker 0>better developer experience than what we have today.

00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:49.030
<v Speaker 0>And this is all very, very exciting.

00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:51.910
<v Speaker 0>But you are on the TOC. You're close

00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:53.965
<v Speaker 0>to oh. Oh. Damn it.

00:44:55.565 --> 00:44:57.005
<v Speaker 0>Computer hits me.

00:44:58.605 --> 00:45:00.205
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I'm just gonna talk for a second,

00:45:00.205 --> 00:45:01.885
<v Speaker 0>and then I'll fix this. That's quite alright.

00:45:01.885 --> 00:45:03.725
<v Speaker 0>You're on the you're on the the TOC,

00:45:03.725 --> 00:45:05.540
<v Speaker 0>and you're close to the project. So why

00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:07.619
<v Speaker 0>don't you tell me what's coming on next?

00:45:07.619 --> 00:45:09.780
<v Speaker 0>What you just wanna change? What's what are

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:11.859
<v Speaker 0>people asking for? What is the future of

00:45:11.859 --> 00:45:12.740
<v Speaker 0>Giteactions?

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:14.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Definitely.

00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:15.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:21.060
<v Speaker 1>the short term road map is increase that

00:45:20.175 --> 00:45:21.135
<v Speaker 1>compatibility

00:45:21.135 --> 00:45:23.055
<v Speaker 1>with GitHub actions that

00:45:23.615 --> 00:45:25.055
<v Speaker 1>the on workflow

00:45:25.055 --> 00:45:27.695
<v Speaker 1>dispatch step that you brought up,

00:45:28.175 --> 00:45:28.895
<v Speaker 1>the

00:45:30.495 --> 00:45:32.255
<v Speaker 1>composite action support. So

00:45:33.609 --> 00:45:35.290
<v Speaker 1>they're not widely used,

00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:37.930
<v Speaker 1>but they're used enough that

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:40.090
<v Speaker 1>it should be supported

00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:44.330
<v Speaker 1>as well as creating different types of runners.

00:45:44.330 --> 00:45:47.335
<v Speaker 1>So right now, there's the two modes. There's

00:45:47.335 --> 00:45:49.974
<v Speaker 1>the running in Docker container or running in

00:45:49.974 --> 00:45:50.855
<v Speaker 1>host mode.

00:45:51.095 --> 00:45:51.895
<v Speaker 1>But

00:45:52.295 --> 00:45:54.855
<v Speaker 1>as we've seen from, like, other projects

00:45:55.095 --> 00:45:55.815
<v Speaker 1>of,

00:45:56.694 --> 00:45:57.494
<v Speaker 1>CRCI,

00:45:57.494 --> 00:45:58.134
<v Speaker 1>they have their

00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Tarte dot dev project where you can actually

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:02.660
<v Speaker 1>run, like,

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:04.980
<v Speaker 1>macOS virtual machines,

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:09.380
<v Speaker 1>as, like, Docker containers kind of somewhat,

00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:11.780
<v Speaker 1>being able to just support,

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:13.540
<v Speaker 1>various different back ends.

00:46:15.445 --> 00:46:18.085
<v Speaker 1>So, like, ephemeral Windows images as well for

00:46:18.085 --> 00:46:19.445
<v Speaker 1>your Windows developers,

00:46:19.765 --> 00:46:22.085
<v Speaker 1>building those, dot net projects,

00:46:22.805 --> 00:46:24.165
<v Speaker 1>iOS devs,

00:46:24.165 --> 00:46:24.724
<v Speaker 1>and

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:29.080
<v Speaker 1>and just bringing the project forward that way.

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:29.560
<v Speaker 1>And

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:31.320
<v Speaker 1>yeah.

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.280
<v Speaker 0>Alright. And what about the

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:37.480
<v Speaker 0>Gitea project beyond actions? Like, do you have

00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:39.320
<v Speaker 0>a a road map of other new things

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:40.680
<v Speaker 0>that are gonna be coming to this table

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:41.320
<v Speaker 0>and

00:46:42.255 --> 00:46:43.455
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So

00:46:45.775 --> 00:46:48.655
<v Speaker 1>this upcoming release, we're working on,

00:46:49.694 --> 00:46:50.255
<v Speaker 1>like,

00:46:51.214 --> 00:46:51.935
<v Speaker 1>stability

00:46:52.095 --> 00:46:52.734
<v Speaker 1>and

00:46:53.855 --> 00:46:56.090
<v Speaker 1>so it's not a big feature release sales.

00:46:56.090 --> 00:46:59.050
<v Speaker 1>It's just a lot of, refactoring. There's there's

00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:00.970
<v Speaker 1>plenty of, features coming in.

00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:03.130
<v Speaker 1>We're at a few hundred,

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:06.970
<v Speaker 1>pull requests,

00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:10.525
<v Speaker 1>already for it, so it's not in insignificant.

00:47:11.565 --> 00:47:12.685
<v Speaker 1>But that's

00:47:13.005 --> 00:47:14.285
<v Speaker 1>always with

00:47:14.365 --> 00:47:17.485
<v Speaker 1>every big thing you need to go back,

00:47:17.485 --> 00:47:19.405
<v Speaker 1>ensure stability of the project, as well as

00:47:19.405 --> 00:47:20.445
<v Speaker 1>we're working forward

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:24.220
<v Speaker 1>towards a long term support version. So

00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:27.020
<v Speaker 1>understanding that not everyone is able to,

00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:29.579
<v Speaker 1>upgrade to the latest and greatest,

00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:30.780
<v Speaker 1>but still,

00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:34.540
<v Speaker 1>need to have those bug fixes, security fixes

00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:35.339
<v Speaker 1>as well

00:47:35.905 --> 00:47:36.625
<v Speaker 1>and

00:47:36.705 --> 00:47:38.065
<v Speaker 1>just create that,

00:47:38.305 --> 00:47:40.305
<v Speaker 1>reliable and understandable,

00:47:40.625 --> 00:47:41.745
<v Speaker 1>upgrade cadence.

00:47:41.985 --> 00:47:42.625
<v Speaker 1>So

00:47:43.345 --> 00:47:45.505
<v Speaker 1>they stay on an LTS for a year.

00:47:46.545 --> 00:47:49.750
<v Speaker 1>They're able to keep those small updates.

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:51.109
<v Speaker 1>And then if

00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:54.150
<v Speaker 1>then in their upgrade cycle, if they're able

00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:56.869
<v Speaker 1>to, like, evaluate, like, potential breaking changes,

00:47:57.029 --> 00:47:58.950
<v Speaker 1>then they can do that with going to,

00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:00.069
<v Speaker 1>like, the next version and whatnot.

00:48:02.934 --> 00:48:06.055
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Kind of tangential then or adjacent to

00:48:06.055 --> 00:48:07.974
<v Speaker 0>what we're talking about, not really directly, but,

00:48:07.974 --> 00:48:10.135
<v Speaker 0>you know, I'm curious if you see people,

00:48:11.335 --> 00:48:13.095
<v Speaker 0>matter in like, you said you matter all

00:48:13.095 --> 00:48:14.694
<v Speaker 0>of the Giteaub action stuff, right, to the

00:48:14.694 --> 00:48:15.810
<v Speaker 0>gitea.com?

00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:18.050
<v Speaker 1>We sorry. A lot of it, not A

00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:19.810
<v Speaker 0>lot of it. Yeah. Yeah. I should be

00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:21.490
<v Speaker 0>careful with my wording there for sure.

00:48:21.810 --> 00:48:23.250
<v Speaker 0>Do you see people doing that for a

00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:25.650
<v Speaker 0>redundancy thing as well? Like, just pulling in

00:48:25.650 --> 00:48:28.450
<v Speaker 0>their vendor dependencies from Yeah. GitHub. I mean,

00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:30.325
<v Speaker 0>let's face it. GitHub and GitLab. There's been

00:48:30.325 --> 00:48:31.365
<v Speaker 0>a lot of downtime.

00:48:31.845 --> 00:48:32.725
<v Speaker 1>Entirely.

00:48:32.965 --> 00:48:33.525
<v Speaker 1>So,

00:48:33.765 --> 00:48:34.325
<v Speaker 1>actually,

00:48:34.725 --> 00:48:36.565
<v Speaker 1>on my NASA home, I have my own

00:48:36.565 --> 00:48:38.725
<v Speaker 1>instance, and it's mirroring a few thousand

00:48:38.965 --> 00:48:40.245
<v Speaker 1>repositories

00:48:41.125 --> 00:48:42.325
<v Speaker 1>because, like,

00:48:42.725 --> 00:48:45.100
<v Speaker 1>just like if my Internet goes down, if

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:47.260
<v Speaker 1>GitHub goes down, GitLab goes down, what have

00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:50.460
<v Speaker 1>you, it's all there. Or repository is deleted,

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:52.860
<v Speaker 1>you'll you'll have the famous left pad instance

00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:54.060
<v Speaker 1>or incident.

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:56.060
<v Speaker 1>Yep. And so

00:48:56.975 --> 00:48:58.655
<v Speaker 1>even though, like, with,

00:48:59.215 --> 00:49:00.575
<v Speaker 1>like, Go modules,

00:49:00.735 --> 00:49:02.655
<v Speaker 1>Google has their

00:49:02.735 --> 00:49:03.695
<v Speaker 1>package

00:49:03.935 --> 00:49:04.815
<v Speaker 1>mirror.

00:49:05.215 --> 00:49:06.175
<v Speaker 1>It's available.

00:49:06.335 --> 00:49:08.735
<v Speaker 1>So if things do go away, it's still

00:49:08.735 --> 00:49:09.855
<v Speaker 1>kind of available,

00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:12.890
<v Speaker 1>but, that cash is purged,

00:49:13.290 --> 00:49:14.490
<v Speaker 1>on whatever,

00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:15.530
<v Speaker 1>basis.

00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:16.810
<v Speaker 1>So it's just,

00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:21.369
<v Speaker 1>having a copy of your code is integral,

00:49:21.369 --> 00:49:23.369
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're in an enterprise

00:49:25.175 --> 00:49:26.055
<v Speaker 1>building,

00:49:26.295 --> 00:49:28.295
<v Speaker 1>like, whatever project and,

00:49:28.455 --> 00:49:31.575
<v Speaker 1>like, just having a copy for insurance sake

00:49:31.575 --> 00:49:33.335
<v Speaker 1>is, incredibly important.

00:49:34.135 --> 00:49:35.015
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:49:35.575 --> 00:49:36.295
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:49:36.535 --> 00:49:38.295
<v Speaker 0>Is there anything else you wanna cover before

00:49:38.295 --> 00:49:39.095
<v Speaker 0>we wrap this thing up?

00:49:39.970 --> 00:49:40.690
<v Speaker 1>No.

00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:42.530
<v Speaker 1>I think yeah. No.

00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:44.530
<v Speaker 1>It's no big

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:47.410
<v Speaker 1>showstoppers with Gitea action setting up, which is

00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:48.930
<v Speaker 1>always exciting, same

00:49:49.170 --> 00:49:49.890
<v Speaker 1>as

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:52.690
<v Speaker 1>our last livestream, living up to that

00:49:52.930 --> 00:49:53.650
<v Speaker 1>painless

00:49:54.785 --> 00:49:55.585
<v Speaker 1>tagline.

00:49:55.585 --> 00:49:56.145
<v Speaker 1>And

00:49:56.945 --> 00:49:58.705
<v Speaker 1>yeah. No. Thanks again for

00:49:59.505 --> 00:50:02.225
<v Speaker 1>having me on. It was great to see

00:50:02.225 --> 00:50:03.585
<v Speaker 1>you again. And

00:50:04.545 --> 00:50:07.840
<v Speaker 1>yeah. Awesome. Thanks. Alright. Well, couple of things,

00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:09.680
<v Speaker 0>and then we'll say goodbye. One, your green

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:12.240
<v Speaker 0>screen setup is awesome. Like, Thanks. Very little

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:13.120
<v Speaker 0>artifacts

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:15.280
<v Speaker 0>around your your face and shoulders. I'm really

00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:16.640
<v Speaker 0>impressed. Mhmm. I'm gonna ask you about that

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:17.200
<v Speaker 0>later.

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:19.440
<v Speaker 0>And the second one is just, like, Gitea

00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:21.365
<v Speaker 0>is such a cruel project. You know, there's

00:50:21.365 --> 00:50:22.565
<v Speaker 0>a lot of things we take for granted

00:50:22.565 --> 00:50:24.325
<v Speaker 0>as developers and operators,

00:50:24.325 --> 00:50:26.565
<v Speaker 0>you know, access to GitHub.com and and GitLab

00:50:26.565 --> 00:50:28.645
<v Speaker 0>and stuff like that. But there needs to

00:50:28.645 --> 00:50:30.325
<v Speaker 0>be a better decentralized

00:50:30.325 --> 00:50:32.165
<v Speaker 0>model moving forward. I think it's gonna be

00:50:32.165 --> 00:50:34.970
<v Speaker 0>so important. And the fact, you know, Gitea,

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:38.329
<v Speaker 0>it's it's not shiny and exciting. It's essential.

00:50:38.329 --> 00:50:40.490
<v Speaker 0>It's plumbing. It's what it's foundational, right, to

00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:42.810
<v Speaker 0>what we need for our developer teams and

00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:45.050
<v Speaker 0>and organizations. So, you know, thank you to

00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:46.650
<v Speaker 0>you and everyone else working on the Gitea

00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:47.770
<v Speaker 0>project, all the contributors.

00:50:48.225 --> 00:50:50.145
<v Speaker 0>It's always exciting to see the updates, and

00:50:50.145 --> 00:50:51.425
<v Speaker 0>thank you for taking time to join me

00:50:51.425 --> 00:50:53.185
<v Speaker 0>today. No. Of course. Thank you for having

00:50:53.185 --> 00:50:53.265
<v Speaker 1>me.

00:50:54.087 --> 00:50:54.807
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:50:55.207 --> 00:50:56.967
<v Speaker 0>Thank you all for watching. Have a wonderful

00:50:56.967 --> 00:50:58.567
<v Speaker 0>day. We'll be back again on Friday with
