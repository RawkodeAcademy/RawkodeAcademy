00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.930
<v Speaker 0>Hello,

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.810
<v Speaker 0>and welcome back to the Rawkode Academy.

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.850
<v Speaker 0>Today is Thursday, which means it is clustered

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.049
<v Speaker 0>day. We have teams from Adobe and Zapier

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.929
<v Speaker 0>who have broken two clusters with forty eight

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.014
<v Speaker 0>hours notice and will attempt to fix them

00:02:08.014 --> 00:02:10.254
<v Speaker 0>or at least fix each others in forty

00:02:10.254 --> 00:02:11.455
<v Speaker 0>minutes or less.

00:02:11.775 --> 00:02:13.055
<v Speaker 0>We'll see how they get on in just

00:02:13.055 --> 00:02:14.894
<v Speaker 0>a minute. Before that, I do have some

00:02:14.894 --> 00:02:17.375
<v Speaker 0>housekeeping and sponsors to say thank you to.

00:02:18.095 --> 00:02:20.420
<v Speaker 0>So thank you to Teleport. I've been using

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.459
<v Speaker 0>Teleport Unclustered since almost the very beginning. It

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.620
<v Speaker 0>is a fantastic tool that allows me to

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.140
<v Speaker 0>share access to these clusters via GitHub single

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.940
<v Speaker 0>sign on. Not only that, we use their

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:32.420
<v Speaker 0>wonderful

00:02:32.845 --> 00:02:34.685
<v Speaker 0>web terminal editor

00:02:34.685 --> 00:02:36.125
<v Speaker 0>so that we can all type in the

00:02:36.125 --> 00:02:38.845
<v Speaker 0>same session. This makes pairing and debugging,

00:02:38.845 --> 00:02:41.724
<v Speaker 0>especially broken clusters a little bit easier, although

00:02:41.724 --> 00:02:43.325
<v Speaker 0>I won't be as bold enough to say

00:02:43.325 --> 00:02:43.965
<v Speaker 0>easy.

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:45.965
<v Speaker 0>So thank you to Teleport. If you wanna

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:48.450
<v Speaker 0>learn more, go to Rawkode.liveteleport.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.530
<v Speaker 0>That supports the show, keep the sponsor happy.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.209
<v Speaker 0>It means that we can keep doing Clustered

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.970
<v Speaker 0>and giving away t shirts, which we'll be

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:54.930
<v Speaker 0>doing in a minute.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.890
<v Speaker 0>I also wanna say thank you to Equinix

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.970
<v Speaker 0>Metal. They have provided the hardware for every

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.375
<v Speaker 0>single episode of Clustered, and these are not

00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:05.095
<v Speaker 0>small machines. I'm not using VMs with virtual

00:03:05.095 --> 00:03:07.335
<v Speaker 0>CPUs. I'm using big machines

00:03:07.495 --> 00:03:09.255
<v Speaker 0>with 48 plus

00:03:09.335 --> 00:03:11.815
<v Speaker 0>cores and a whole ton of RAM. Why?

00:03:11.815 --> 00:03:13.255
<v Speaker 0>Because it just makes it a little bit

00:03:13.255 --> 00:03:15.095
<v Speaker 0>more fun. So thank you to Equinix Metal.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.120
<v Speaker 0>You can also check out Equinix Medal by

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.960
<v Speaker 0>using the quote Rawkode. This will get you

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.920
<v Speaker 0>200 US dollars in credits. Learn more at

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.600

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.120
<v Speaker 0>So thank you, Equinix.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.920
<v Speaker 0>We are also doing t shirt giveaways. Thank

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.665
<v Speaker 0>you to our sponsors. So if you wanna

00:03:29.665 --> 00:03:32.785
<v Speaker 0>win a t shirt today, go to Rawkode.live/win.

00:03:33.105 --> 00:03:35.825
<v Speaker 0>You can tweet or follow accounts. These will

00:03:35.825 --> 00:03:38.144
<v Speaker 0>get you additional entries. I forgot to draw

00:03:38.144 --> 00:03:39.504
<v Speaker 0>the winners last week, so we're going to

00:03:39.504 --> 00:03:41.345
<v Speaker 0>do two winners from the last week's competition,

00:03:41.345 --> 00:03:43.185
<v Speaker 0>and we'll do two winners from today's competition

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.650
<v Speaker 0>at the end of the episode. Don't let

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.890
<v Speaker 0>me forget audience. This is on you now.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.050
<v Speaker 0>That's not a very nice thing to say

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.130
<v Speaker 0>actually, is it? Like just blame the audience.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 0>All right.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.450
<v Speaker 0>Let's introduce

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:55.330
<v Speaker 0>our first team.

00:03:58.015 --> 00:03:59.935
<v Speaker 0>Hello. How are you all doing?

00:04:01.055 --> 00:04:02.255
<v Speaker 1>Hey. Hey.

00:04:02.735 --> 00:04:04.815
<v Speaker 1>Doing good. How about you? Yeah.

00:04:05.855 --> 00:04:06.975
<v Speaker 0>I did alright.

00:04:08.175 --> 00:04:10.655
<v Speaker 0>I I I always have, like, this existential

00:04:10.655 --> 00:04:12.890
<v Speaker 0>fear before Cluster, but then I settle into

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.650
<v Speaker 0>it and have a bit more fun. How

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.410
<v Speaker 0>do are you are you sharing the fear

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.930
<v Speaker 0>with me a little bit here? I hope

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:18.490
<v Speaker 0>so.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.130
<v Speaker 0>Little bit. Alright. Well, team z alright.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.010
<v Speaker 0>Team z, period, can you please introduce yourselves?

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.290
<v Speaker 0>Tell us a little bit about you, and

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.655
<v Speaker 0>then we'll we'll have some fun with our

00:04:28.655 --> 00:04:29.375
<v Speaker 0>customers.

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:32.975
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So I'm John Anderson.

00:04:33.055 --> 00:04:36.255
<v Speaker 1>I'm the engineering manager for the SRE team

00:04:36.255 --> 00:04:39.134
<v Speaker 1>at Zapier. So I mostly create Jira tickets,

00:04:39.134 --> 00:04:41.854
<v Speaker 1>but luckily, Adam wrote a CLI and Rust

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.210
<v Speaker 1>for interacting with Jira. So I at least

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.290
<v Speaker 1>stay sharp in the terminal.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.970
<v Speaker 2>Hey. I'm Joe,

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.090
<v Speaker 2>and,

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.970
<v Speaker 2>I used to perform live, in a Pink

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.650
<v Speaker 2>Floyd tribute band in front of hundreds of

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.170
<v Speaker 2>people, and somehow this is a little bit

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.185
<v Speaker 2>more nerve wracking.

00:05:00.824 --> 00:05:03.465
<v Speaker 3>And, hey, I'm Adam. I'm an SRE on

00:05:03.465 --> 00:05:05.784
<v Speaker 3>the team, and, apparently, I'm famous for writing

00:05:05.784 --> 00:05:08.585
<v Speaker 4>some CLI that I guess I use a

00:05:08.585 --> 00:05:10.425
<v Speaker 3>little bit, but, yeah, it's nice.

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:13.840
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Thank you all for sharing.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.040
<v Speaker 0>And I feel like I've just been told

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.760
<v Speaker 0>that I've been pronouncing zapier man wrong my

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.080
<v Speaker 0>entire life. So thank you for correcting me

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.565
<v Speaker 0>live in front of our audience, John. Anyway

00:05:24.805 --> 00:05:27.365
<v Speaker 1>You will not be the first. That's probably

00:05:27.365 --> 00:05:28.245
<v Speaker 1>the biggest

00:05:28.724 --> 00:05:30.485
<v Speaker 1>probably I have. What if I don't even

00:05:30.485 --> 00:05:33.525
<v Speaker 0>know if Zapier or Zapier? Like, say it

00:05:33.525 --> 00:05:34.085
<v Speaker 0>again?

00:05:35.284 --> 00:05:37.525
<v Speaker 3>It rhymes with happier. Happier. That's how you

00:05:37.525 --> 00:05:39.850
<v Speaker 3>remember. Yeah. Zapier happier. Zapier happier. Alright.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.130
<v Speaker 0>Well, thank you all for the introductions. We're

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.130
<v Speaker 0>all excited to see how you get on

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.450
<v Speaker 0>with this cluster. So I am gonna share

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.930
<v Speaker 0>my screen,

00:05:50.535 --> 00:05:52.375
<v Speaker 0>and we have forty two minutes. Those two

00:05:52.375 --> 00:05:54.535
<v Speaker 0>minutes are used as bonus minutes for me

00:05:54.535 --> 00:05:56.695
<v Speaker 0>to give you access to the cluster. So

00:05:56.695 --> 00:05:58.775
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna come in and modify

00:05:58.775 --> 00:05:59.735
<v Speaker 0>your role.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.190
<v Speaker 0>You have not been able to see the

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.070
<v Speaker 0>other cluster, which I love about Teleport.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.229
<v Speaker 0>And now you can.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 0>So

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:15.110
<v Speaker 0>I will open a session on our control

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 0>plan,

00:06:16.585 --> 00:06:18.425

<v Speaker 0>some command to let me know that you're

00:06:27.544 --> 00:06:28.985
<v Speaker 0>in it and then we'll get things kicked

00:06:28.985 --> 00:06:29.625
<v Speaker 0>off for today.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.550
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We got one.

00:06:44.655 --> 00:06:46.254

<v Speaker 2>same session and not in the same one

00:06:47.534 --> 00:06:49.935
<v Speaker 2>as you guys are. Yeah. Please go to

00:06:49.935 --> 00:06:51.455

<v Speaker 0>Find this one, click the join button, and

00:06:54.495 --> 00:06:55.615
<v Speaker 0>then we'll all be I mean, the audience

00:06:55.615 --> 00:06:57.055
<v Speaker 0>can see everything that we type, which we

00:06:57.055 --> 00:06:59.110
<v Speaker 0>found to be quite important on clustered. So

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.430
<v Speaker 3>If it's just me then, I only I'm

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.110
<v Speaker 3>the only one that found the the correct

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.910
<v Speaker 3>cluster.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.910
<v Speaker 0>Alright. It looks like you're all in. So

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.310
<v Speaker 0>set up your cube config. Set up any

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.910
<v Speaker 0>aliases that you need. Best of luck.

00:07:15.895 --> 00:07:18.375
<v Speaker 0>Oh, we got we got a special script.

00:07:18.935 --> 00:07:20.615
<v Speaker 3>We've got it. We're ready. We're ready to

00:07:20.615 --> 00:07:21.095
<v Speaker 3>go.

00:07:21.655 --> 00:07:24.935
<v Speaker 0>Cube control, g a q, etcd, helm. Oh,

00:07:24.935 --> 00:07:26.775
<v Speaker 0>yeah. Even setting up an alias. Alright.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.570
<v Speaker 2>Oh, yeah. So for this. Although I think

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:30.610
<v Speaker 0>your tab completion

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:31.810
<v Speaker 0>may have failed.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:32.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So let's see. So, yeah, so what

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.730
<v Speaker 1>that did, if you look we didn't trust

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:38.610
<v Speaker 1>Adobe.

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:39.010
<v Speaker 1>So

00:07:40.305 --> 00:07:43.025
<v Speaker 1>we we have our own cube control now.

00:07:43.824 --> 00:07:45.425
<v Speaker 1>So let's check.

00:07:47.505 --> 00:07:48.385
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.

00:07:48.544 --> 00:07:51.425
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what we want. Okay. It's fun.

00:07:51.425 --> 00:07:51.824
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. We we don't need you. You go

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:55.430
<v Speaker 1>away since you're not ready.

00:08:04.625 --> 00:08:05.825
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.

00:08:06.065 --> 00:08:08.145
<v Speaker 1>I would have expected that to Cartoon Creek

00:08:08.145 --> 00:08:08.705
<v Speaker 1>live.

00:08:09.425 --> 00:08:10.705
<v Speaker 0>So you're going Can we check

00:08:11.345 --> 00:08:12.785
<v Speaker 0>sorry. I was gonna say, can we check

00:08:12.785 --> 00:08:15.345
<v Speaker 3>the status of the like, all the pods,

00:08:15.345 --> 00:08:17.265
<v Speaker 3>like, especially cube system?

00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:19.345
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:25.789
<v Speaker 3>That's sorry. That's okay. Yeah. That's

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:28.270
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.669
<v Speaker 0>So That's fine. We got a lot of

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:34.350
<v Speaker 1>pending pods here. Yeah.

00:08:35.554 --> 00:08:37.315
<v Speaker 1>All those terminating, we're not gonna worry about

00:08:37.315 --> 00:08:37.875
<v Speaker 1>those.

00:08:38.194 --> 00:08:40.034
<v Speaker 1>Here. So let's see. Where are those? So

00:08:40.034 --> 00:08:41.635
<v Speaker 1>those are probably oh.

00:08:43.235 --> 00:08:46.035
<v Speaker 3>All on the worker. Yeah. Makes sense. Yeah.

00:08:46.035 --> 00:08:47.154
<v Speaker 1>Those are on the workers. So

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:53.730
<v Speaker 1>okay. So let's see. Git node. So we

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:55.570
<v Speaker 1>want to get rid of this, but that

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:57.730
<v Speaker 1>won't actually go away right now. Right? So

00:08:58.610 --> 00:08:59.890
<v Speaker 1>so we're gonna have to figure out why

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:00.930
<v Speaker 1>that won't drain.

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:03.170
<v Speaker 3>So

00:09:03.584 --> 00:09:06.064
<v Speaker 3>can we Yeah. Do something simple like That's

00:09:06.064 --> 00:09:06.545
<v Speaker 3>good.

00:09:07.985 --> 00:09:09.745
<v Speaker 3>No. I'm not sure.

00:09:10.384 --> 00:09:11.425
<v Speaker 3>We should check

00:09:12.064 --> 00:09:14.704
<v Speaker 3>check API server logs for that one.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna take a look at the logs

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.090
<v Speaker 2>on the worker itself, see if anything interesting

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:22.210
<v Speaker 2>is going on there. Alright. The API server

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:22.770
<v Speaker 1>is out.

00:09:33.885 --> 00:09:35.964
<v Speaker 1>Unable to authenticate request.

00:09:35.964 --> 00:09:37.964
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So this token is Uh-oh.

00:09:39.005 --> 00:09:39.964
<v Speaker 1>The

00:09:39.964 --> 00:09:41.245
<v Speaker 1>one thing we didn't want him to do.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.760
<v Speaker 0>Invalid better token, service account token has been

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.040
<v Speaker 0>invalidated.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:49.800
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.760
<v Speaker 0>Well, we've not seen that before on clustered.

00:09:54.115 --> 00:09:55.075
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So they

00:09:55.635 --> 00:09:58.515
<v Speaker 1>so we're gonna have to reissue that. Right?

00:09:58.755 --> 00:09:59.715
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.

00:10:00.195 --> 00:10:01.155
<v Speaker 1>Right.

00:10:05.715 --> 00:10:08.035
<v Speaker 1>I got a little jiggle problem. I can't

00:10:08.035 --> 00:10:08.915
<v Speaker 1>see half the screen.

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:12.130
<v Speaker 0>Try typing reset. Hopefully, that'll

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:13.490
<v Speaker 0>kick it back.

00:10:18.529 --> 00:10:19.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:21.970
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So how do you guys wanna fix

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:23.810
<v Speaker 1>the fact that we don't actually oh, well,

00:10:24.885 --> 00:10:26.245
<v Speaker 1>it's actually not.

00:10:26.485 --> 00:10:27.205
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:10:28.245 --> 00:10:28.805
<v Speaker 1>So

00:10:29.925 --> 00:10:31.445
<v Speaker 1>the cube API server

00:10:31.845 --> 00:10:34.085
<v Speaker 1>can't talk to stuff right now.

00:10:35.205 --> 00:10:37.285
<v Speaker 1>Unable to authenticate the request and valid token.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.160
<v Speaker 1>So that means it's talking to and

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.480
<v Speaker 1>it can't talk to it. Right? Oh, and

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.560
<v Speaker 3>then there's also some sort of webhook. Check

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.880
<v Speaker 3>the admission.cluster.live.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. I don't think there needs to be

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.480
<v Speaker 3>a a admission webhook. That could be part

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.280
<v Speaker 3>of it as well.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.440
<v Speaker 3>We should probably if we can

00:10:54.775 --> 00:10:57.815
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. Let's see. We'll do get all.

00:10:57.815 --> 00:10:59.335
<v Speaker 1>What do we got in here? Yeah.

00:11:04.055 --> 00:11:06.135
<v Speaker 1>Alright. I'll put it into less so that

00:11:06.135 --> 00:11:07.495
<v Speaker 1>we can scroll. Let's see.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:15.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't see an admission webhook in there.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.390
<v Speaker 0>You get all doesn't return The dev ticket.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:22.315
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. That's Oh, yeah. Get

00:11:23.995 --> 00:11:26.075
<v Speaker 0>All is not all. Just to confuse you

00:11:26.075 --> 00:11:26.635
<v Speaker 0>more.

00:11:26.955 --> 00:11:28.075
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. There we go.

00:11:29.675 --> 00:11:31.915
<v Speaker 3>And not in it's not mutating. It was

00:11:31.915 --> 00:11:32.714
<v Speaker 3>admission.

00:11:33.195 --> 00:11:35.435
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. But Out whoops. Yeah. There we go.

00:11:35.435 --> 00:11:38.029
<v Speaker 3>There we go. That one. That one. Yeah.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:43.630
<v Speaker 0>Straight in with the delete.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.149
<v Speaker 1>Get out of here. Get out of here.

00:11:47.149 --> 00:11:48.350
<v Speaker 1>We don't want you.

00:11:49.149 --> 00:11:52.670
<v Speaker 0>Someone spent time handcrafting that, validating admission wiper

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.525
<v Speaker 0>configuration. They just deleted it without even looking.

00:11:55.525 --> 00:11:57.845
<v Speaker 2>Some somebody. Come back.

00:12:02.965 --> 00:12:04.565
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That's good. Yeah.

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:13.070
<v Speaker 1>So now we need,

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:17.710
<v Speaker 6>yeah. So now we need to fix that

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:19.710
<v Speaker 1>bear token issue. Right? Because we still have

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:22.325
<v Speaker 1>that. Yes. Yes. Or was that the hook

00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:23.925
<v Speaker 1>that was giving us the problem? Could have

00:12:23.925 --> 00:12:25.925
<v Speaker 3>been. Check the yeah. Check double check the

00:12:25.925 --> 00:12:27.365
<v Speaker 3>API server logs.

00:12:29.125 --> 00:12:30.485
<v Speaker 1>Right. I've

00:12:30.725 --> 00:12:31.525
<v Speaker 1>there you go.

00:12:32.245 --> 00:12:33.925
<v Speaker 0>If your screen has given you a headache,

00:12:33.925 --> 00:12:36.130
<v Speaker 0>just resize your window by pixel. It it

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:36.930
<v Speaker 0>does help.

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:39.650
<v Speaker 3>Alright. So we still get the Yeah. Reset

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:40.770
<v Speaker 3>issues. Yeah.

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:46.050
<v Speaker 1>And I'm assuming that's talking to ETCD. Right?

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:46.690
<v Speaker 1>So

00:12:49.465 --> 00:12:52.185
<v Speaker 1>but a bearer token. It shouldn't be using

00:12:52.185 --> 00:12:54.905
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Bearer oh, let's

00:12:54.905 --> 00:12:55.465
<v Speaker 1>see.

00:12:56.745 --> 00:12:59.305
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. Check. What is that? Endpoint.

00:12:59.465 --> 00:13:00.425
<v Speaker 1>Check if was up.

00:13:01.065 --> 00:13:02.825
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is? Don't forget.

00:13:03.399 --> 00:13:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Health.

00:13:04.279 --> 00:13:05.400
<v Speaker 3>Health? Yeah.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.360
<v Speaker 1>And then I think

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.360
<v Speaker 3>endpoint health. Yeah. Yep.

00:13:17.904 --> 00:13:19.345
<v Speaker 6>Okay. Okay.

00:13:21.665 --> 00:13:23.985
<v Speaker 0>Alright. There's also an endpoint status, which might

00:13:23.985 --> 00:13:26.064
<v Speaker 0>be useful depending on what you're trying to

00:13:26.064 --> 00:13:26.384
<v Speaker 0>check.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:30.260
<v Speaker 1>K.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:31.860
<v Speaker 0>That looks okay.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.260
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Yeah. So I think we're good there.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.860
<v Speaker 1>That means it can authenticate. So what would

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.700
<v Speaker 1>it be using a token for?

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:39.940
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't be using a token for anything.

00:13:42.875 --> 00:13:45.035
<v Speaker 3>Right. And we should probably check the

00:13:45.355 --> 00:13:47.035
<v Speaker 3>the API server.

00:13:47.275 --> 00:13:49.115
<v Speaker 3>There are other config files. Yeah?

00:13:51.755 --> 00:13:53.915
<v Speaker 0>So which log was giving you the Veritone?

00:13:53.915 --> 00:13:54.235
<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

00:13:56.129 --> 00:13:58.130
<v Speaker 1>The API server. So

00:14:03.089 --> 00:14:05.570
<v Speaker 1>the API server is making a request.

00:14:06.129 --> 00:14:07.810
<v Speaker 0>Or is this is this a request coming

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:09.089
<v Speaker 0>to the API server?

00:14:11.395 --> 00:14:12.995
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah.

00:14:12.995 --> 00:14:13.955
<v Speaker 3>Probably.

00:14:14.355 --> 00:14:16.275
<v Speaker 3>I mean, it could be the worker. We

00:14:16.275 --> 00:14:19.395
<v Speaker 3>know the worker's not. Yeah. Check check yeah.

00:14:19.395 --> 00:14:21.075
<v Speaker 3>We can check that because if, like, the

00:14:21.075 --> 00:14:22.515
<v Speaker 3>rest of the control plane can access,

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.690
<v Speaker 3>that's fine. We also might get more information

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:27.850
<v Speaker 3>from the other control plane components.

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:29.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:33.450
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I will open a session on Adobe

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:35.370
<v Speaker 0>Worker one. Feel free to join that if

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:36.970
<v Speaker 0>you wanna do some debugging over there.

00:14:40.565 --> 00:14:41.685
<v Speaker 0>Let's

00:14:41.685 --> 00:14:43.205
<v Speaker 0>open that. Alright.

00:14:44.885 --> 00:14:46.165
<v Speaker 1>So before I do that,

00:14:46.725 --> 00:14:47.445
<v Speaker 1>so

00:14:47.925 --> 00:14:49.845
<v Speaker 1>I've heard of this famous

00:14:50.405 --> 00:14:52.005
<v Speaker 1>Rawkode scheduler.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.360
<v Speaker 0>I think Infamous probably more than famous, but

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:57.920
<v Speaker 0>yeah.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.640
<v Speaker 1>So that goes on the spec. Right? So

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.040
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.640
<v Speaker 0>Oh, check at the bottom as well. OneNote

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.040
<v Speaker 3>had attained unreachable, so that's probably the network.

00:15:12.455 --> 00:15:13.495
<v Speaker 1>Which one did?

00:15:14.455 --> 00:15:17.415
<v Speaker 3>The worker, I assume. Unless it is it

00:15:17.415 --> 00:15:19.575
<v Speaker 0>could be that the controller is also unreachable,

00:15:19.575 --> 00:15:20.295
<v Speaker 3>but that

00:15:21.815 --> 00:15:23.095
<v Speaker 1>makes sense. Well

00:15:23.975 --> 00:15:24.375
<v Speaker 1>yeah.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.720
<v Speaker 1>So we probably want yeah. We need to

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.639
<v Speaker 1>remove the taint off the master anyways if

00:15:30.639 --> 00:15:32.720
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna do that. Right? Yeah. If we

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.480
<v Speaker 3>want anything scheduled there. If we can do

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.000
<v Speaker 3>that now, that would

00:15:36.319 --> 00:15:38.240
<v Speaker 3>maybe get the network scheduling.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.319
<v Speaker 3>Probably, there's something else wrong with the network.

00:15:48.375 --> 00:15:51.095
<v Speaker 3>Oh, the worker is configured wrong. When I

00:15:51.095 --> 00:15:53.575
<v Speaker 3>did kubectl get pods, at least that was

00:15:53.575 --> 00:15:56.130
<v Speaker 3>pointed to local host eighty eighty.

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:57.890
<v Speaker 0>There is no

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:00.610
<v Speaker 0>authentication on the worker for you to be

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:02.930
<v Speaker 0>able to run kubectl. Yeah. Right. That makes

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:04.050
<v Speaker 3>sense. Alright.

00:16:11.455 --> 00:16:14.575
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So I just unpainted the

00:16:15.215 --> 00:16:16.495
<v Speaker 1>master.

00:16:17.375 --> 00:16:18.495
<v Speaker 1>That would be a look now.

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:25.770
<v Speaker 1>So this is unpainted now.

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh, sorry.

00:16:36.135 --> 00:16:36.855
<v Speaker 1>Oh,

00:16:37.015 --> 00:16:38.055
<v Speaker 1>it's still there.

00:16:38.695 --> 00:16:40.135
<v Speaker 1>Oh, so, yeah, I think we're gonna have

00:16:40.135 --> 00:16:42.135
<v Speaker 1>to fix that API server first because

00:16:43.415 --> 00:16:45.255
<v Speaker 1>when I

00:16:50.279 --> 00:16:52.200
<v Speaker 1>When I did that, that should've the server

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.440
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have a node resource. Oh, whoops.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.680
<v Speaker 1>That's my bad. That's why it didn't work.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.640
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So that's untainted now.

00:17:00.839 --> 00:17:01.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:17:03.235 --> 00:17:05.875
<v Speaker 3>So we can there's no sorry. Go ahead.

00:17:06.195 --> 00:17:07.315
<v Speaker 1>Nope. Go ahead.

00:17:08.035 --> 00:17:09.554
<v Speaker 3>I know that on

00:17:10.275 --> 00:17:11.395
<v Speaker 3>the worker

00:17:11.395 --> 00:17:12.914
<v Speaker 3>general control

00:17:12.915 --> 00:17:16.115
<v Speaker 3>says there are no logs for Kubelet, so

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:18.930
<v Speaker 3>that might be part of why it's not

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:19.730
<v Speaker 3>there too.

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:22.369
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. And it doesn't seem to be running

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:23.169
<v Speaker 2>at all.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:25.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. Or interested in a worker?

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:28.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. I'm gonna check. Yeah.

00:17:32.255 --> 00:17:33.215
<v Speaker 3>Where is it?

00:17:36.175 --> 00:17:38.175
<v Speaker 1>Says that I'm on never pull policy as

00:17:38.175 --> 00:17:38.735
<v Speaker 1>well.

00:17:40.495 --> 00:17:40.815
<v Speaker 3>Connected.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:43.620
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:45.940
<v Speaker 1>So

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:47.780
<v Speaker 1>there we go.

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:52.020
<v Speaker 3>Okay. KubeLit is back on the worker.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.965
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So sorry, David. We're it sounds like

00:17:57.965 --> 00:17:59.245
<v Speaker 1>we're splitting up. I I don't know what

00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:01.565
<v Speaker 1>what you're watching. But I'm on a working

00:18:01.565 --> 00:18:03.485
<v Speaker 0>note right now looking at the journal control

00:18:03.485 --> 00:18:05.965
<v Speaker 0>logs for the Qbook, which doesn't look too

00:18:05.965 --> 00:18:06.524
<v Speaker 0>bad.

00:18:07.085 --> 00:18:09.164
<v Speaker 3>No. It doesn't, honestly. Better than I expected.

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:12.610
<v Speaker 1>And I see we don't have a launch.

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Back to the master.

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:17.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I cordoned the worker and drained it,

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:18.770
<v Speaker 1>and so now I'm moving everything to the

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:21.649
<v Speaker 1>control plane for now, at least. K.

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:24.130
<v Speaker 2>The worker does say it's ready, though.

00:18:25.024 --> 00:18:26.544
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. I think it was just card

00:18:26.544 --> 00:18:28.945
<v Speaker 0>and then triplet shut down. Right? It kinda

00:18:28.945 --> 00:18:30.784
<v Speaker 0>looks like maybe what happened there.

00:18:31.264 --> 00:18:33.664
<v Speaker 3>Are we still seeing tons of API server

00:18:33.664 --> 00:18:34.625
<v Speaker 3>errors or

00:18:36.144 --> 00:18:38.384
<v Speaker 3>oh, error image never pulled.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. But that's fine. So

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:42.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:18:52.845 --> 00:18:54.205
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So

00:18:55.165 --> 00:18:57.325
<v Speaker 1>that should make a new one. Right?

00:18:58.845 --> 00:18:59.565
<v Speaker 4>Hopefully.

00:19:02.285 --> 00:19:03.485
<v Speaker 0>Delete the bug?

00:19:03.885 --> 00:19:04.285
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.679
<v Speaker 3>Still. Still.

00:19:13.159 --> 00:19:13.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:19:14.679 --> 00:19:15.879
<v Speaker 2>Oh, there it is.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.240
<v Speaker 2>Well, there's a remove.

00:19:21.175 --> 00:19:22.215
<v Speaker 1>Out of this?

00:19:26.215 --> 00:19:28.534
<v Speaker 2>So it's just as a Yeah. See error.

00:19:29.335 --> 00:19:31.095
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Yep. Let's

00:19:32.535 --> 00:19:35.174
<v Speaker 1>so that means my save didn't actually work.

00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:38.240
<v Speaker 1>Let's see. That's annoying. Oh, I am.

00:19:38.559 --> 00:19:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Because I have the all oh, let's

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.919
<v Speaker 1>see. Let's see. Pull. Oh, I think I

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.720
<v Speaker 1>where is it? I think I edited the

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.720
<v Speaker 1>wrong thing. Nope. Right there. Image. Yeah. It

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:51.280
<v Speaker 3>should be there.

00:19:57.015 --> 00:19:57.815
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:19:58.215 --> 00:19:59.654
<v Speaker 1>So let's

00:20:01.575 --> 00:20:02.054
<v Speaker 6>woah.

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:05.530
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:10.090
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So let's see what this is actually

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:11.690
<v Speaker 1>doing in here. Yeah.

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:18.730
<v Speaker 1>It's not present with an policy. Okay. So

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:19.370
<v Speaker 1>let's see.

00:20:21.044 --> 00:20:21.765
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of

00:20:22.405 --> 00:20:24.804
<v Speaker 3>I'm back on the worker. There's a bunch

00:20:24.804 --> 00:20:26.565
<v Speaker 3>of law I checked the Kubelet logs again.

00:20:26.565 --> 00:20:28.725
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of logs that it's struggling

00:20:28.725 --> 00:20:29.364
<v Speaker 3>to,

00:20:29.605 --> 00:20:30.325
<v Speaker 3>I think,

00:20:31.365 --> 00:20:33.525
<v Speaker 3>destroy network. So it doesn't seem it can't

00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:34.485
<v Speaker 3>create networks either.

00:20:38.659 --> 00:20:40.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm not very good with crack control. We're

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.500
<v Speaker 1>still on a Docker control plane. So is

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.580
<v Speaker 1>crack control pull supposed to be what I'm

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:45.059
<v Speaker 1>doing?

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:51.005
<v Speaker 3>CTR is the container d one, or or

00:20:51.005 --> 00:20:52.365
<v Speaker 3>wait. Yeah. There's

00:20:53.005 --> 00:20:54.525
<v Speaker 0>You can do it with both commands, I

00:20:54.525 --> 00:20:55.005
<v Speaker 0>believe.

00:20:56.605 --> 00:20:57.885
<v Speaker 3>Oh, yeah. You should do with the one

00:20:57.885 --> 00:20:58.765
<v Speaker 1>that has a

00:20:59.725 --> 00:21:01.325
<v Speaker 1>but how do I pull?

00:21:02.445 --> 00:21:04.685
<v Speaker 6>Yeah. Can get the list. You were right.

00:21:04.685 --> 00:21:05.885
<v Speaker 0>Great. It's awful. Okay.

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:08.549
<v Speaker 1>So

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:10.710
<v Speaker 1>that didn't seem like it was doing anything.

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Let's do

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:17.350
<v Speaker 1>phcr.io.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:19.990
<v Speaker 1>Alright. It's there. So it should be fallen.

00:21:20.815 --> 00:21:22.735
<v Speaker 0>And it appears to be GitHub, which is

00:21:22.735 --> 00:21:23.455
<v Speaker 0>good.

00:21:26.575 --> 00:21:28.575
<v Speaker 1>That better than we could have hoped for.

00:21:29.295 --> 00:21:30.415
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.

00:21:31.135 --> 00:21:31.775
<v Speaker 1>V one.

00:21:33.649 --> 00:21:35.490
<v Speaker 2>Alright. We did get we we just got

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:37.889
<v Speaker 2>a lot of errors from on the worker.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:40.289
<v Speaker 2>And, yeah, they're what Adam said. It's a

00:21:40.289 --> 00:21:43.169
<v Speaker 2>bunch of Cilium failure of run network stuffs.

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:47.330
<v Speaker 2>So I'm guessing Cilium is broken. Alright. So

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:47.809
<v Speaker 1>yeah.

00:21:50.895 --> 00:21:52.655
<v Speaker 3>Well, I think those pods are just not

00:21:52.895 --> 00:21:54.174
<v Speaker 0>sorry. Yeah. Look at

00:21:55.695 --> 00:21:57.535
<v Speaker 3>we got one pending on the worker. Yeah.

00:21:57.535 --> 00:21:58.095
<v Speaker 3>That Cilium

00:22:00.895 --> 00:22:02.335
<v Speaker 1>Oh, but on the worker, don't care. I

00:22:02.335 --> 00:22:04.740
<v Speaker 1>cordoned the worker for now. So we only

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.260
<v Speaker 1>care about the control plane right now.

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.140
<v Speaker 6>Right.

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:10.740
<v Speaker 1>So

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:13.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah. So we have one that's there. That's

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:13.620
<v Speaker 1>fine.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.780
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm thinking is there's some configuration

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.780
<v Speaker 1>that's preventing us from pulling

00:22:19.755 --> 00:22:20.555
<v Speaker 1>that's

00:22:20.555 --> 00:22:22.875
<v Speaker 1>not the deploy. Like, the deploy is saying

00:22:22.875 --> 00:22:23.514
<v Speaker 1>pull.

00:22:23.995 --> 00:22:25.995
<v Speaker 1>So what else would be saying don't pull

00:22:25.995 --> 00:22:26.715
<v Speaker 1>images?

00:22:26.795 --> 00:22:28.154
<v Speaker 0>So if you do a

00:22:28.395 --> 00:22:31.195
<v Speaker 0>get deploy cluster dash o yaml and grep

00:22:31.195 --> 00:22:33.355
<v Speaker 0>for pull policy, it it does say always?

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:35.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Oops. Wrong cluster.

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:44.049
<v Speaker 0>It

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:45.090
<v Speaker 0>does indeed.

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:48.049
<v Speaker 0>Cool. Yeah. So it updated,

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:50.130
<v Speaker 1>but then if you check here

00:22:51.105 --> 00:22:54.545
<v Speaker 1>it's

00:22:54.545 --> 00:22:55.904
<v Speaker 1>still erroring out there.

00:22:56.145 --> 00:22:57.985
<v Speaker 1>And so if I delete that,

00:22:59.025 --> 00:23:01.505
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna make a new one. Oh, actually,

00:23:01.505 --> 00:23:02.865
<v Speaker 1>it does. Yeah. So it does delete.

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh. Oh, it's green.

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:08.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh, that's not a problem.

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:12.549
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Alright. And that's definitely scheduled on the

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:13.749
<v Speaker 0>control plan?

00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:15.909
<v Speaker 1>Oh, it's good to go.

00:23:20.915 --> 00:23:22.115
<v Speaker 0>Yep. Interesting.

00:23:23.635 --> 00:23:26.995
<v Speaker 1>Oh, but Postgres never moved. Well, let's just

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:32.710
<v Speaker 0>That was bold.

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:34.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. That one's bold.

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:37.110
<v Speaker 1>What were they?

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:42.070
<v Speaker 3>Could've started with the pod.

00:23:45.285 --> 00:23:47.124
<v Speaker 3>K. We should restore that.

00:23:47.924 --> 00:23:50.325
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I'll I'll restart it. So but, like,

00:23:50.325 --> 00:23:52.085
<v Speaker 1>what I wanted to do is actually

00:23:54.885 --> 00:23:57.205
<v Speaker 1>that. Okay. There we go. That sounds fine.

00:23:57.205 --> 00:23:57.845
<v Speaker 3>That sounds fine.

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:02.309
<v Speaker 3>Still terminated. That part, you you probably wanna

00:24:02.309 --> 00:24:04.230
<v Speaker 3>gonna have to for because it can't clean

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:06.070
<v Speaker 3>up the it's it's Oh, yeah. Trying to

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:07.350
<v Speaker 3>clean up the network. Right? So it's not

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:08.710
<v Speaker 3>gonna do that. It's not gonna remove it

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:10.389
<v Speaker 3>until network goes there

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:12.470
<v Speaker 3>or the the network is fixed. So I

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:15.315
<v Speaker 3>think we should probably fix figure out the

00:24:15.315 --> 00:24:16.355
<v Speaker 3>network problem.

00:24:17.555 --> 00:24:18.674
<v Speaker 3>We should check.

00:24:19.155 --> 00:24:20.355
<v Speaker 3>We've got different,

00:24:20.675 --> 00:24:22.434
<v Speaker 3>probably, config maps first.

00:24:23.635 --> 00:24:25.315
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Do you wanna run drive it for

00:24:25.315 --> 00:24:25.715
<v Speaker 1>a little bit?

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.960
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. The audience is wanting to see the

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.360
<v Speaker 0>container d config. They think something's

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.000
<v Speaker 0>gonna be funny there. Container d config? Alright.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.680
<v Speaker 3>That's worth checking.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:38.360
<v Speaker 3>Get,

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:39.880
<v Speaker 3>what am I looking for?

00:24:41.605 --> 00:24:44.245
<v Speaker 1>You would just drop config dump from container

00:24:44.245 --> 00:24:46.485
<v Speaker 1>d. It's like I think it's container d

00:24:46.485 --> 00:24:48.645
<v Speaker 1>config dump or cry control config dump. I

00:24:48.645 --> 00:24:51.284
<v Speaker 1>forget. Container d config dump problem link.

00:24:51.765 --> 00:24:52.085
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.240
<v Speaker 2>There there is no config.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.240
<v Speaker 0>Container

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.399
<v Speaker 0>d config dump doesn't show anything

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.960
<v Speaker 0>on the It says that con container d

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.480
<v Speaker 2>slash config dot toml doesn't exist.

00:25:10.105 --> 00:25:11.864
<v Speaker 0>One way default, I guess.

00:25:12.585 --> 00:25:15.304
<v Speaker 2>Control plane? You're in your own session.

00:25:16.265 --> 00:25:18.424
<v Speaker 2>Oh, yeah. Sorry. I was letting you guys

00:25:18.424 --> 00:25:20.585
<v Speaker 2>do your thing while just poke around stuff.

00:25:20.585 --> 00:25:21.865
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Yeah. Let me join up.

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.460
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So if container d has no config,

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:26.740
<v Speaker 0>it's unlikely

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:30.419
<v Speaker 0>container d is responsible for the full policy,

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:32.820
<v Speaker 0>which is the

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:35.060
<v Speaker 0>makes it more interesting.

00:25:36.125 --> 00:25:36.845
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:25:37.005 --> 00:25:39.165
<v Speaker 2>In fact, if we sorry. I'm just taking

00:25:39.165 --> 00:25:40.925
<v Speaker 2>over a little bit. But if we do

00:25:40.925 --> 00:25:44.125
<v Speaker 2>that, there's there's nothing interesting there at all.

00:25:44.445 --> 00:25:45.965
<v Speaker 2>At least nothing that I see.

00:25:48.765 --> 00:25:49.565
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:54.750
<v Speaker 1>So Not a good way. What else

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:56.190
<v Speaker 1>yeah.

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:59.230
<v Speaker 1>What else controls image pull policies

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:00.510
<v Speaker 1>outside of

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:03.790
<v Speaker 1>the image itself or outside the spec itself?

00:26:05.445 --> 00:26:07.924
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question. Like, maybe that cubelet

00:26:07.924 --> 00:26:10.325
<v Speaker 1>now because it'd be on Well, The oh,

00:26:10.325 --> 00:26:11.684
<v Speaker 3>cubelet is coordinating.

00:26:12.164 --> 00:26:14.085
<v Speaker 3>So it would at it might have logs.

00:26:14.085 --> 00:26:16.164
<v Speaker 3>If we if we terminate the pod, get

00:26:16.164 --> 00:26:18.005
<v Speaker 3>it to reschedule, and then check the recent

00:26:18.005 --> 00:26:20.645
<v Speaker 3>cubelet logs, we might see more information about

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:23.830
<v Speaker 3>why it's choosing not to, possibly.

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:27.830
<v Speaker 3>I find that interesting that this data and

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:30.150
<v Speaker 0>the events show another pool.

00:26:37.335 --> 00:26:39.975
<v Speaker 1>The status also, like, if you did So

00:26:39.975 --> 00:26:41.975
<v Speaker 0>you described the the deploy. What if you

00:26:41.975 --> 00:26:43.975
<v Speaker 0>described the pod itself? Does it have a

00:26:43.975 --> 00:26:44.535
<v Speaker 0>pull policy?

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:47.669
<v Speaker 0>Did we check that? That's a good question.

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:49.350
<v Speaker 1>Oops. Sorry.

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:51.990
<v Speaker 1>We can do it for now. Oh,

00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:58.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm lagging. Can someone type real quick? Put

00:26:58.790 --> 00:26:59.830
<v Speaker 1>pod in there for me. It.

00:27:01.794 --> 00:27:02.514
<v Speaker 6>Oh.

00:27:05.315 --> 00:27:06.354
<v Speaker 2>That's

00:27:08.115 --> 00:27:08.834
<v Speaker 1>there you go.

00:27:11.235 --> 00:27:13.075
<v Speaker 0>I think we need to add dash or

00:27:13.075 --> 00:27:15.154
<v Speaker 0>YAML to see if it's policy. Oh, no.

00:27:15.154 --> 00:27:15.634
<v Speaker 1>That's true.

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:19.450
<v Speaker 0>Dash I on the oh, you did the

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:22.410
<v Speaker 0>dash I. Before the Gitpod, not describe pod.

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:24.090
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. Oops. Thank

00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:25.450
<v Speaker 1>you.

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:30.970
<v Speaker 0>Never. Oh. That's interesting. Getting mutated.

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:27:32.785 --> 00:27:33.985
<v Speaker 1>But we got rid of all that. Did

00:27:33.985 --> 00:27:34.785
<v Speaker 1>we check mutating

00:27:35.825 --> 00:27:38.545
<v Speaker 3>go ahead. Yeah. Did we check all namespaces

00:27:38.545 --> 00:27:41.184
<v Speaker 3>for mutating admission controllers?

00:27:41.185 --> 00:27:42.784
<v Speaker 0>Or I believe you did. Yeah.

00:27:43.025 --> 00:27:44.945
<v Speaker 0>I I sure I remember a dash cap

00:27:44.945 --> 00:27:46.785
<v Speaker 0>at Lee on that, but it doesn't hurt

00:27:46.785 --> 00:27:47.585
<v Speaker 0>to double check things.

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:51.340
<v Speaker 0>We're halfway through. Twenty minutes left.

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:54.220
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So here, let's

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:55.980
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead. Yeah.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.900
<v Speaker 1>So it it went away. What are the

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.565
<v Speaker 1>other ones? Validating? Validating. And that was actually

00:28:02.565 --> 00:28:04.725
<v Speaker 1>what we had was the validating. Yeah. We

00:28:04.725 --> 00:28:05.924
<v Speaker 3>removed the validating.

00:28:08.325 --> 00:28:09.924
<v Speaker 1>And we don't have, like, or

00:28:10.165 --> 00:28:11.845
<v Speaker 1>anything in here? No?

00:28:12.245 --> 00:28:14.805
<v Speaker 0>That would also register a mutating webhook.

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:17.270
<v Speaker 0>So it's unlikely to be kybernal.

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:18.710
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:21.270
<v Speaker 1>What else could be mutating our pod?

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:25.590
<v Speaker 3>Controller manager would be responsible for creating did

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:26.630
<v Speaker 3>we check the replica set?

00:28:27.205 --> 00:28:30.085
<v Speaker 3>The replica set never. That's a good idea.

00:28:31.925 --> 00:28:32.565
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:28:33.285 --> 00:28:35.285
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That's a good idea. So

00:28:35.765 --> 00:28:37.125
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna edit the pod as well

00:28:37.125 --> 00:28:39.045
<v Speaker 1>to see what happens. It's immutable. Rep rep

00:28:39.125 --> 00:28:41.365
<v Speaker 3>yeah. Replica sets are immutable. Yeah. It's immutable,

00:28:41.365 --> 00:28:42.165
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately. Yeah.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:43.840
<v Speaker 3>Nice try, though.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:49.440
<v Speaker 1>here. I no. No. I I will not

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.080
<v Speaker 1>be fooled.

00:28:56.575 --> 00:28:58.735
<v Speaker 0>I I like that this is the multifaceted

00:28:58.735 --> 00:29:01.934
<v Speaker 0>break because you've got something modifying the spec

00:29:01.934 --> 00:29:04.335
<v Speaker 0>to never pull, and you're actually unable to

00:29:04.335 --> 00:29:07.615
<v Speaker 0>do a cry control pull as well. So

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:08.330
<v Speaker 0>I think you can fix either one of

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:10.570
<v Speaker 0>these and you might be alright. But Right.

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:12.730
<v Speaker 0>I'm definitely curious about both breaks.

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:14.970
<v Speaker 1>So look at this.

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:18.010
<v Speaker 1>So so ready. So let's just describe.

00:29:22.315 --> 00:29:23.115
<v Speaker 1>K.

00:29:23.275 --> 00:29:23.995
<v Speaker 1>So

00:29:24.075 --> 00:29:27.355
<v Speaker 1>here, Adam, take over if you wanna, like,

00:29:28.235 --> 00:29:29.675
<v Speaker 1>get the rep with us at YAML and

00:29:29.675 --> 00:29:30.715
<v Speaker 1>look at what it's doing.

00:29:32.155 --> 00:29:32.795
<v Speaker 3>Do we have

00:29:33.435 --> 00:29:35.115
<v Speaker 0>There's that. Oh, look at that. It's for

00:29:35.115 --> 00:29:36.875
<v Speaker 1>bidding. Yeah. We got some resources.

00:29:38.059 --> 00:29:39.659
<v Speaker 1>Exceeded quota limits.

00:29:40.059 --> 00:29:41.419
<v Speaker 3>Oh, yes.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:49.179
<v Speaker 0>Sneaky.

00:29:50.059 --> 00:29:50.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:29:52.544 --> 00:29:52.705
<v Speaker 0>Into

00:29:53.505 --> 00:29:55.424
<v Speaker 0>Dash dash all. On you go.

00:29:58.065 --> 00:29:59.825
<v Speaker 1>It's like Get get the spirit of things

00:29:59.825 --> 00:30:00.465
<v Speaker 3>here.

00:30:01.505 --> 00:30:02.384
<v Speaker 3>Alright.

00:30:02.385 --> 00:30:03.504
<v Speaker 3>That was

00:30:05.899 --> 00:30:07.580
<v Speaker 1>Check for limit ranges as well just to

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:08.299
<v Speaker 1>be safe.

00:30:10.539 --> 00:30:12.700
<v Speaker 0>The obscure one that no one ever remembers,

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:13.739
<v Speaker 0>then there you go.

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:14.779
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:30:15.419 --> 00:30:16.059
<v Speaker 1>Somebody did.

00:30:24.434 --> 00:30:26.274
<v Speaker 3>Oh, yeah. There we go. Gone.

00:30:27.235 --> 00:30:28.034
<v Speaker 3>Alright. Alright.

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:32.950
<v Speaker 0>You will have to delete that pod to

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:35.350
<v Speaker 0>kick start the replica set switchover.

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:37.670
<v Speaker 0>That's a really cool effect. Like, because the

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:40.230
<v Speaker 0>resource quota was there, we thought we were

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:41.910
<v Speaker 0>getting a new pod, but we're actually getting

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:43.750
<v Speaker 0>an old pod for an old replica set.

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:46.615
<v Speaker 0>That was cool. Yep. Yeah. That was clever.

00:30:46.615 --> 00:30:47.415
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That

00:30:48.775 --> 00:30:50.855
<v Speaker 1>was yeah. That's an effect you wanna expect.

00:30:51.095 --> 00:30:52.775
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Delete pod. Yeah.

00:30:54.455 --> 00:30:55.255
<v Speaker 1>Adobe.

00:30:55.895 --> 00:30:57.335
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Hopefully, we are evil enough.

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.359
<v Speaker 1>That that I didn't expect.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.159
<v Speaker 1>Oh.

00:31:01.799 --> 00:31:03.559
<v Speaker 1>Oh. We still have it.

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.840
<v Speaker 6>Okay. There so there's three replica sets.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.320
<v Speaker 2>Can we get rid of two of them

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.559
<v Speaker 2>so we can know which one we're, modifying?

00:31:11.559 --> 00:31:12.440
<v Speaker 0>I don't know how to do it.

00:31:15.635 --> 00:31:17.395
<v Speaker 1>Good work. Someone's

00:31:17.395 --> 00:31:19.154
<v Speaker 2>enthusiastic with the band hammer.

00:31:20.675 --> 00:31:22.355
<v Speaker 0>Oh, are we gonna get a container? We

00:31:22.355 --> 00:31:24.675
<v Speaker 0>are. It's pulling an image. Oh, it's pulling

00:31:24.675 --> 00:31:26.034
<v Speaker 1>an image. Nice.

00:31:26.195 --> 00:31:26.595
<v Speaker 1>Oh, buddy.

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:30.010
<v Speaker 1>We still need to fix the Postgres one

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:30.570
<v Speaker 1>too.

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:32.650
<v Speaker 3>Running. We got that. Well,

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:34.970
<v Speaker 3>k delete

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:36.890
<v Speaker 3>Postgres SQL.

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:39.930
<v Speaker 3>This is risky if it doesn't The pod?

00:31:40.985 --> 00:31:42.184
<v Speaker 3>Or Right.

00:31:42.745 --> 00:31:44.345
<v Speaker 0>So even though you reapplied

00:31:44.345 --> 00:31:47.225
<v Speaker 0>the stateful set, because it's a stateful set,

00:31:47.225 --> 00:31:49.465
<v Speaker 0>that postgres zero means it'll never spin up

00:31:49.465 --> 00:31:50.664
<v Speaker 0>a new one. Right?

00:31:51.785 --> 00:31:53.385
<v Speaker 0>Even though it's an old stateful So we

00:31:53.385 --> 00:31:56.025
<v Speaker 1>had to force it. Yeah. Like, graceful,

00:31:56.105 --> 00:31:58.529
<v Speaker 1>whatever. Yeah. Because it does the Yeah. Yeah.

00:31:58.929 --> 00:32:01.330
<v Speaker 0>Ordered rollout. I just wanna I wanna I

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:02.049
<v Speaker 3>wanna check for

00:32:02.929 --> 00:32:03.649
<v Speaker 3>what

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:07.090
<v Speaker 3>did I type wrong? Post

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:07.890
<v Speaker 3>risk.

00:32:12.425 --> 00:32:13.225
<v Speaker 1>Is it

00:32:17.385 --> 00:32:19.305
<v Speaker 1>post guys go Oh, did it actually delete?

00:32:19.305 --> 00:32:20.585
<v Speaker 3>Oh, it might have deleted.

00:32:20.825 --> 00:32:22.985
<v Speaker 3>I didn't check afterwards. Yeah. It's gone. Okay.

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:29.240
<v Speaker 1>There you go.

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:30.840
<v Speaker 1>Describe that.

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Forbidden.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.440
<v Speaker 1>We got more.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.720
<v Speaker 3>Alright. It's the same. It just needs

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:40.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

00:32:48.164 --> 00:32:49.284
<v Speaker 3>Any change will do. Yeah.

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:56.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm just adding add an invitation.

00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:59.590
<v Speaker 3>Wait. Now I need to add it on

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:01.270
<v Speaker 3>the pod. Right?

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:05.270
<v Speaker 3>Oh, okay. This is easy.

00:33:17.725 --> 00:33:19.165
<v Speaker 1>Great pod. Yep.

00:33:19.565 --> 00:33:22.125
<v Speaker 1>Boom. Alright. Nope. Still over at zero.

00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:24.309
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. Because I think you There you

00:33:24.309 --> 00:33:25.989
<v Speaker 1>go. There. Oh, there we go.

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:28.390
<v Speaker 1>Curl local host 30000.

00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:30.070
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what it's doing now.

00:33:35.164 --> 00:33:36.844
<v Speaker 1>Check for network policies.

00:33:40.605 --> 00:33:41.325
<v Speaker 1>You,

00:33:41.725 --> 00:33:42.524
<v Speaker 1>Adobe.

00:33:47.804 --> 00:33:49.804
<v Speaker 3>As with everything else.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.480
<v Speaker 2>What's the point in knowing all the things

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.919
<v Speaker 2>if you don't use all the things?

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.560
<v Speaker 0>Eventually, we're gonna have an episode where someone

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:00.040
<v Speaker 0>brings us stress that just deletes all webhooks,

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:00.920
<v Speaker 0>all network policies.

00:34:04.375 --> 00:34:06.215
<v Speaker 0>K. Oh, get the service.

00:34:07.015 --> 00:34:08.535
<v Speaker 1>Check what endpoints we have.

00:34:12.295 --> 00:34:13.335
<v Speaker 3>Well, I should have

00:34:14.455 --> 00:34:15.574
<v Speaker 3>filtered then.

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:19.630
<v Speaker 3>It's API server. We'll just Okay. I'm gonna

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:20.430
<v Speaker 0>filter that.

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. What do we got? We've got those.

00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:23.950
<v Speaker 3>Check

00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:26.670
<v Speaker 1>the endpoints too.

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:28.510
<v Speaker 3>Okay. Yep.

00:34:31.155 --> 00:34:33.074
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That looks good. So I'll do k

00:34:33.074 --> 00:34:35.235
<v Speaker 1>get e p. Let's see what e p's

00:34:35.235 --> 00:34:36.835
<v Speaker 1>we have. Right.

00:34:40.435 --> 00:34:42.675
<v Speaker 3>At the right one, it looks like that's

00:34:42.755 --> 00:34:45.395
<v Speaker 3>wait. Node name control plane. Yeah. That's right.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean, it's

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.480
<v Speaker 3>no. Yeah.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.640
<v Speaker 3>It looks right.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.520
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I tried it from a browser, and

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.960
<v Speaker 0>I I don't think we can. Yeah.

00:35:01.974 --> 00:35:04.535
<v Speaker 1>Here. One second. I'll get back. Yeah. Go

00:35:04.535 --> 00:35:04.615
<v Speaker 0>ahead.

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:19.030
<v Speaker 3>You're not in the pod.

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:20.470
<v Speaker 0>Oh, what?

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:24.550
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So people don't know what's in the

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:26.470
<v Speaker 0>port has changed. That is my fault

00:35:28.835 --> 00:35:31.155
<v Speaker 0>From a special eBPF episode we're doing at

00:35:31.155 --> 00:35:33.635
<v Speaker 0>KubeCon, I did change the port to a

00:35:33.635 --> 00:35:35.635
<v Speaker 0>privileged port for reasons.

00:35:36.515 --> 00:35:38.355
<v Speaker 0>So, yeah, this looks like it's look suspicious,

00:35:38.355 --> 00:35:38.915
<v Speaker 0>but it's okay.

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:42.910
<v Speaker 1>But she's running,

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:46.350
<v Speaker 1>but she's not responding.

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:51.070
<v Speaker 4>It's p d. So why would she be

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:52.510
<v Speaker 3>Are are we still on v one? We

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:53.790
<v Speaker 3>should just change it to v two in

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:54.750
<v Speaker 3>case

00:35:55.045 --> 00:35:57.125
<v Speaker 3>we did anything we is v two.

00:35:57.445 --> 00:35:58.805
<v Speaker 3>Is it v two? Okay.

00:35:59.205 --> 00:36:02.085
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. So is oh, is v two does

00:36:02.085 --> 00:36:03.525
<v Speaker 2>v two still have the old part port

00:36:03.525 --> 00:36:04.485
<v Speaker 2>number, or is it the new one?

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.280
<v Speaker 0>They should both be compiled and pushed with

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:10.880
<v Speaker 0>666 as a port.

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.560
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Okay.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.880
<v Speaker 2>Dumb question. We're on v 2 now.

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay. If that container doesn't have the port

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.160
<v Speaker 2>exposed specifically,

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.405
<v Speaker 2>can you still hit a new service? You

00:36:22.405 --> 00:36:24.805
<v Speaker 0>can. I believe they're just they're just hints.

00:36:25.045 --> 00:36:26.165
<v Speaker 3>Yep. Okay.

00:36:27.045 --> 00:36:27.765
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:36:28.405 --> 00:36:30.965
<v Speaker 1>So, like, the problem right now is

00:36:32.085 --> 00:36:32.805
<v Speaker 1>this.

00:36:33.045 --> 00:36:33.365
<v Speaker 1>Right?

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:38.720
<v Speaker 1>That's not actually listening to anything. Oh, that

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:39.760
<v Speaker 0>should definitely work.

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.560
<v Speaker 3>Is is Cilium still down?

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:43.680
<v Speaker 3>Because

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.560
<v Speaker 3>it could be messing with the routing. We

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:48.640
<v Speaker 3>probably wanna get it at least try restarting

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:50.240
<v Speaker 3>those pods and see if it comes back.

00:36:51.595 --> 00:36:53.115
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you were in the container when you

00:36:53.115 --> 00:36:54.795
<v Speaker 0>ran that curl. Yeah. That should work.

00:36:55.195 --> 00:36:57.435
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That should've worked. Yeah. That should've

00:36:57.435 --> 00:36:57.915
<v Speaker 0>worked.

00:36:58.395 --> 00:36:59.995
<v Speaker 1>We have a problem in there. So we're

00:37:00.235 --> 00:37:01.515
<v Speaker 0>Just in case I am the I am

00:37:01.515 --> 00:37:03.195
<v Speaker 0>the the reason this is broken, can you

00:37:03.195 --> 00:37:05.115
<v Speaker 0>try curl an eighty eighty? I mean,

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:07.170
<v Speaker 0>just in case. Okay. Yeah.

00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:11.810
<v Speaker 1>Makes sense. May maybe I'm the bad actor

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:12.770
<v Speaker 0>in this one.

00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:16.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh, good. We'll multiple people to that for

00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:18.210
<v Speaker 1>us. Nope. So

00:37:18.474 --> 00:37:20.715
<v Speaker 1>the 666, it's in there. It's just hanging.

00:37:23.595 --> 00:37:25.355
<v Speaker 0>It could be trying to reach Postgres and

00:37:25.355 --> 00:37:27.194
<v Speaker 0>failing. Oh, you're not Right. Yeah. Exactly. It

00:37:27.194 --> 00:37:29.675
<v Speaker 3>still could be the network. So Yeah.

00:37:29.915 --> 00:37:30.315
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:35.180
<v Speaker 2>What's the emissary and ambassador pods? You can

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:37.020
<v Speaker 0>disregard those. Those are

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.820
<v Speaker 0>a load balancer or an ingress controller that

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:40.940
<v Speaker 0>we're not using. So

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:43.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay. So even though they don't work, it's

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.500
<v Speaker 0>It's alright. Yeah. You're all good.

00:37:48.825 --> 00:37:50.585
<v Speaker 1>Resolve conflict's good in there.

00:37:51.545 --> 00:37:54.585
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Adam, you can take over again. Yeah.

00:37:55.065 --> 00:37:57.145
<v Speaker 0>So Choco in the comments says, could it

00:37:57.145 --> 00:37:58.825
<v Speaker 0>be a silly of network policy?

00:37:58.985 --> 00:38:01.079
<v Speaker 0>I mean, it definitely could be, but the

00:38:01.079 --> 00:38:03.240
<v Speaker 0>local and local host, I'm sorry, the container

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.240
<v Speaker 0>can't be affected by network policies because it

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.240
<v Speaker 0>never touches the network. So

00:38:08.119 --> 00:38:09.720
<v Speaker 0>there's definitely something else.

00:38:10.119 --> 00:38:11.559
<v Speaker 0>It could be Unless it's trying to get

00:38:11.559 --> 00:38:13.480
<v Speaker 2>to Postgres. Yes. Like it's saying because it

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.325
<v Speaker 2>can't get to Postgres. So I do set

00:38:15.325 --> 00:38:16.765
<v Speaker 0>the time out on a container of five

00:38:16.765 --> 00:38:18.685
<v Speaker 0>seconds. You should see a GIF come back

00:38:18.685 --> 00:38:19.565
<v Speaker 0>regardless,

00:38:19.645 --> 00:38:21.325
<v Speaker 0>which I don't think we were seeing.

00:38:26.765 --> 00:38:27.725
<v Speaker 1>Describe that part.

00:38:28.619 --> 00:38:29.339
<v Speaker 2>Oh.

00:38:30.539 --> 00:38:31.820
<v Speaker 0>Got ten minutes.

00:38:32.539 --> 00:38:33.339
<v Speaker 1>K.

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:38.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Let's see why Cilium's not coming up.

00:38:40.395 --> 00:38:42.955
<v Speaker 1>Zero nodes are available. Insufficient CPU. Okay. More

00:38:42.955 --> 00:38:45.435
<v Speaker 1>specs. So edit edit Cilium.

00:38:47.595 --> 00:38:49.355
<v Speaker 0>I mean, you can run an LS CPU.

00:38:49.355 --> 00:38:51.515
<v Speaker 0>There's definitely sufficient CPU in these machines.

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.840
<v Speaker 0>Looking at h top is always quite funny.

00:38:58.680 --> 00:38:59.800
<v Speaker 6>Oh, good lord.

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:01.720
<v Speaker 5>Not not a lot.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:05.400
<v Speaker 3>See, one

00:39:06.945 --> 00:39:09.505
<v Speaker 3>one didn't match the pod's nodes affinity

00:39:09.585 --> 00:39:11.025
<v Speaker 3>slash selector.

00:39:17.425 --> 00:39:19.105
<v Speaker 1>One node didn't match. Okay.

00:39:19.985 --> 00:39:21.665
<v Speaker 1>So edit the

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:25.710
<v Speaker 1>oh, yeah. Edit the daemon set or deploy.

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:28.110
<v Speaker 0>Well, you deploy the stateful set cleanly from

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:29.230
<v Speaker 0>remote. Right?

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:33.470
<v Speaker 0>Oh, is this Cilium? Yeah. You're okay. This

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:35.470
<v Speaker 1>is Cilium, not Postgres. This is yeah. So

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:36.590
<v Speaker 1>they modified Cilium.

00:39:38.615 --> 00:39:40.934
<v Speaker 0>A reminder that there are hints from Jake

00:39:40.934 --> 00:39:41.895
<v Speaker 0>in the chat.

00:39:42.055 --> 00:39:42.214
<v Speaker 0>So

00:39:43.175 --> 00:39:45.655
<v Speaker 1>K. Oh, there are hints. Oh, cat.

00:39:45.974 --> 00:39:47.655
<v Speaker 1>No. Don't do it. Don't do it.

00:39:48.775 --> 00:39:51.095
<v Speaker 3>We got ten minutes. This is Alright.

00:39:51.869 --> 00:39:53.309
<v Speaker 1>Well, let's set up the deploy first, and

00:39:53.309 --> 00:39:54.910
<v Speaker 1>then we'll look at them with the deploy.

00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:57.470
<v Speaker 1>Because we can see, you know, zero, two

00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:58.990
<v Speaker 1>nodes are available, one is a vision of

00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:00.829
<v Speaker 0>the CPU. They have confirmed that Cilium was

00:40:00.829 --> 00:40:02.430
<v Speaker 1>not modified. Fix the affinity.

00:40:02.589 --> 00:40:04.925
<v Speaker 3>Cilium was not modified. Okay. Well Thank you,

00:40:04.925 --> 00:40:06.605
<v Speaker 3>Jake. Then why is it failing to schedule?

00:40:06.605 --> 00:40:08.685
<v Speaker 1>Right. Oh, well, then that means keep schedule

00:40:08.685 --> 00:40:10.765
<v Speaker 1>or something like that. Mike forgot to see

00:40:10.765 --> 00:40:12.445
<v Speaker 0>if the hint fails, so you're hintless. But

00:40:12.445 --> 00:40:13.885
<v Speaker 0>they are in the chat and active if

00:40:13.885 --> 00:40:14.845
<v Speaker 0>you need hints.

00:40:14.925 --> 00:40:16.365
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Yeah. No worries.

00:40:19.329 --> 00:40:20.210
<v Speaker 1>So

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:24.290
<v Speaker 1>let's see. Warning failed scheduling. Default schedule. Is

00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:25.650
<v Speaker 1>there multiple schedulers running?

00:40:30.995 --> 00:40:33.235
<v Speaker 1>Like, check just edit the daemon site and

00:40:33.235 --> 00:40:35.315
<v Speaker 1>check what its scheduler it's set to work

00:40:35.315 --> 00:40:35.875
<v Speaker 1>with.

00:40:36.435 --> 00:40:38.515
<v Speaker 0>But you you have a running Cilium on

00:40:38.515 --> 00:40:40.515
<v Speaker 0>the control plane. Right? Are you debugging the

00:40:40.515 --> 00:40:41.315
<v Speaker 0>worker or not Cilium?

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:45.410
<v Speaker 1>Well, we called in the worker, so it

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:46.849
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be trying to put one over there.

00:40:46.849 --> 00:40:48.290
<v Speaker 0>Oh, it's a daemon set. So it would

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:49.970
<v Speaker 0>still be scheduled even though the worker comes

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:51.410
<v Speaker 1>out of phone. Yeah. So that's probably the

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:53.329
<v Speaker 1>worker one. So we're probably okay. So let's

00:40:53.329 --> 00:40:53.569
<v Speaker 1>keep

00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:56.210
<v Speaker 1>let's figure out why

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:58.050
<v Speaker 1>the pod can't talk to Postgres.

00:41:00.974 --> 00:41:02.095
<v Speaker 1>Right. Right.

00:41:02.895 --> 00:41:04.895
<v Speaker 0>I think network policies are the good So

00:41:05.055 --> 00:41:05.855
<v Speaker 0>build up.

00:41:08.575 --> 00:41:09.214
<v Speaker 1>CNPs.

00:41:12.839 --> 00:41:13.720
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.

00:41:14.519 --> 00:41:16.599
<v Speaker 1>So I forget what the Sicilian ones are.

00:41:16.599 --> 00:41:18.280
<v Speaker 0>CMP and CCMP.

00:41:18.359 --> 00:41:20.839
<v Speaker 1>That's the wide. Oh, look at that.

00:41:22.119 --> 00:41:22.839
<v Speaker 0>Adobe.

00:41:24.599 --> 00:41:26.760
<v Speaker 0>Now be careful with this delete because there's

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:27.160
<v Speaker 0>two there.

00:41:27.915 --> 00:41:30.155
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. Don't delete it at fault until we

00:41:30.235 --> 00:41:32.395
<v Speaker 3>at least store it if you delete it.

00:41:34.955 --> 00:41:37.275
<v Speaker 1>So I assume we You may wanna look

00:41:37.275 --> 00:41:38.955
<v Speaker 0>at these. Is the one we like. Yeah.

00:41:38.955 --> 00:41:40.555
<v Speaker 2>We should let's let's look at these.

00:41:47.059 --> 00:41:47.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

00:41:48.099 --> 00:41:49.780
<v Speaker 3>That one's You guys 85.

00:41:51.539 --> 00:41:52.420
<v Speaker 1>And then

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:53.940
<v Speaker 1>let's look at the other one.

00:42:01.375 --> 00:42:03.215
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Those are naughty. Seems really

00:42:03.855 --> 00:42:05.535
<v Speaker 1>five four three two. Yeah. I think we

00:42:05.535 --> 00:42:07.295
<v Speaker 1>get rid of both of those. Yep.

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:14.080
<v Speaker 0>Sometimes it is it's better to check. Right?

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.960
<v Speaker 1>Yep. What did I miss? You got a

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.000
<v Speaker 0>clustered extra.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. There we go.

00:42:24.065 --> 00:42:25.665
<v Speaker 6>Alright. Let's check.

00:42:27.345 --> 00:42:28.464
<v Speaker 0>CMPs? Pearl.

00:42:29.825 --> 00:42:32.305
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yes. CMPs. But you said that CMPs

00:42:32.305 --> 00:42:33.185
<v Speaker 1>and then Yeah.

00:42:34.144 --> 00:42:37.345
<v Speaker 1>Large ones with their policies, man. Like, they

00:42:37.424 --> 00:42:40.305
<v Speaker 1>they they're

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:41.240
<v Speaker 1>really

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:42.280
<v Speaker 6>see

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.280
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Five minutes. I feel you're close. Well,

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.240
<v Speaker 3>I have a guy and a delete in

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:47.720
<v Speaker 1>there.

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.280
<v Speaker 1>K. Yeah. Alright.

00:42:57.735 --> 00:42:59.895
<v Speaker 3>Okay. That's text. That says me too. Do

00:42:59.895 --> 00:43:01.335
<v Speaker 1>you want to put it in the browser?

00:43:01.735 --> 00:43:02.055
<v Speaker 0>Well

00:43:02.535 --> 00:43:03.815
<v Speaker 1>Can you open it in the browser for

00:43:03.815 --> 00:43:05.480
<v Speaker 1>us so we can see the video? And

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:08.200
<v Speaker 2>try There's nothing listening there's nothing listening on

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.320
<v Speaker 2>port 30,000

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:11.240
<v Speaker 2>on the control plane.

00:43:12.119 --> 00:43:14.119
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. So I think there's still The node

00:43:14.119 --> 00:43:15.960
<v Speaker 0>port. Yeah. There's a node. Can we move

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.720
<v Speaker 3>it back to the worker? Let's just revert

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:19.240
<v Speaker 3>that. I think we're good from

00:43:20.225 --> 00:43:22.625
<v Speaker 0>but your current local host, it doesn't work.

00:43:23.665 --> 00:43:25.585
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. The end Yeah. It works. We're fixed,

00:43:25.585 --> 00:43:26.545
<v Speaker 1>but we'd like to see it in the

00:43:26.545 --> 00:43:28.225
<v Speaker 1>browser because the video's fine. Yeah.

00:43:28.625 --> 00:43:30.465
<v Speaker 2>But right. That's the point is the there's

00:43:30.465 --> 00:43:33.665
<v Speaker 2>no external IP for that for that clustered

00:43:33.665 --> 00:43:35.185
<v Speaker 2>node port, and there's no

00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:37.870
<v Speaker 2>it's not listening on port 30,000 on the

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:39.150
<v Speaker 2>machine itself, so it's not gonna be able

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:40.590
<v Speaker 2>to get out to the outside world.

00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:43.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why it's not.

00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:46.110
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I can't get to it through a

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:46.830
<v Speaker 0>browser.

00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:48.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. If you

00:43:49.475 --> 00:43:50.835
<v Speaker 2>So, like, it's

00:43:51.075 --> 00:43:53.315
<v Speaker 2>there is a node port, but if you

00:43:53.315 --> 00:43:53.875
<v Speaker 2>do

00:43:56.675 --> 00:43:58.595
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing there. Well, this is because, sadly,

00:43:58.595 --> 00:44:00.035
<v Speaker 0>I'm using eBPF.

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:04.880
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:06.240
<v Speaker 0>I

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.640
<v Speaker 0>don't know. Adobe,

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.360
<v Speaker 0>confirm whether this is you or accidental,

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.800
<v Speaker 1>and we'll decide if we need to spend

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:16.125
<v Speaker 0>time. Because I I mean, we've got the

00:44:16.125 --> 00:44:17.885
<v Speaker 0>Carl. I can see the v two asset

00:44:17.885 --> 00:44:19.805
<v Speaker 0>web m. I'm kind of happy. I would

00:44:19.805 --> 00:44:21.725
<v Speaker 0>love to see the dance, of course, but

00:44:21.725 --> 00:44:24.045
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if this is intended or

00:44:24.045 --> 00:44:24.845
<v Speaker 0>collateral

00:44:25.085 --> 00:44:26.205
<v Speaker 0>damage. So

00:44:27.325 --> 00:44:29.430
<v Speaker 1>I think this was you, David. Yeah. It

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:31.110
<v Speaker 0>it it could very much be me.

00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:35.990
<v Speaker 0>But accidental.

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:38.630
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Then we'll consider this fixed. Well done.

00:44:38.869 --> 00:44:40.070
<v Speaker 0>Well, well done.

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:41.830
<v Speaker 0>And you had a whole three minutes to

00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:42.150
<v Speaker 0>spare.

00:44:42.935 --> 00:44:44.215
<v Speaker 0>Perfect.

00:44:45.335 --> 00:44:46.055
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:44:46.695 --> 00:44:49.015
<v Speaker 1>Oh, nice work. Yeah. Zach is a little

00:44:49.015 --> 00:44:51.255
<v Speaker 1>smaller, so we don't use all those policies.

00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:57.349
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. There were there was a lot to

00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:59.510
<v Speaker 0>to debug there. The resource quotas and the

00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:01.990
<v Speaker 0>limit ranges were were were great because those

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:03.829
<v Speaker 0>are so esoteric. Well, I mean, resource quotas

00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:05.829
<v Speaker 0>people probably do use. But limit ranges, I've

00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:07.109
<v Speaker 0>never seen them used in the wild, not

00:45:07.109 --> 00:45:08.470
<v Speaker 0>for a long time. So

00:45:09.755 --> 00:45:11.835
<v Speaker 0>alright. Good job. Well, thank you for joining

00:45:11.835 --> 00:45:13.515
<v Speaker 0>me. Feel free to

00:45:13.915 --> 00:45:15.035

<v Speaker 0>invite team Adobe to come on and take

00:45:22.475 --> 00:45:25.310
<v Speaker 0>a look at your cluster. Oh, we're definitely

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:26.990
<v Speaker 1>gonna be in there trolling them after that

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:27.790

<v Speaker 0>job. Yeah. Bye. Bye. Thank you.

00:45:36.135 --> 00:45:38.135
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I'll pop over here just now. Team

00:45:38.135 --> 00:45:39.095
<v Speaker 0>Adobe,

00:45:39.175 --> 00:45:40.695
<v Speaker 0>come and join us.

00:45:41.335 --> 00:45:43.335
<v Speaker 0>I will get the session ready.

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:55.750
<v Speaker 0>Alrighty.

00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:57.030
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:59.190
<v Speaker 0>We got Mike,

00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:00.870
<v Speaker 0>Jacob,

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:03.670
<v Speaker 0>Carlos.

00:46:07.555 --> 00:46:09.315
<v Speaker 0>I'll just give that one more minute.

00:46:10.434 --> 00:46:12.275
<v Speaker 0>So how's that? Are you enjoying watching someone

00:46:12.275 --> 00:46:13.795
<v Speaker 0>else work through your twister?

00:46:14.434 --> 00:46:15.714
<v Speaker 5>Oh, I thought they were gonna have it

00:46:15.714 --> 00:46:17.154
<v Speaker 5>in the first couple minutes for a second.

00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:21.070
<v Speaker 0>That's it. It never seems to go that

00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:21.550
<v Speaker 0>way.

00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:25.710
<v Speaker 0>But those were some some sneaky breaks.

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:29.310
<v Speaker 0>And Yeah. The A lot of repetition network

00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:31.230
<v Speaker 0>policies, cluster wide network policies.

00:46:31.645 --> 00:46:33.645
<v Speaker 0>Just making sure your blast radius.

00:46:35.565 --> 00:46:37.485
<v Speaker 5>We thought for the validating webhook, we had

00:46:37.485 --> 00:46:38.605
<v Speaker 5>tested it so they'd have to go to

00:46:38.605 --> 00:46:41.165
<v Speaker 5>FCD for the admission controller.

00:46:41.805 --> 00:46:42.445
<v Speaker 1>But

00:46:43.005 --> 00:46:44.845
<v Speaker 1>I allowed them to just delete it. We

00:46:44.845 --> 00:46:45.565
<v Speaker 1>must have missed something.

00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:49.270
<v Speaker 0>So that that happens a lot as well.

00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:51.190
<v Speaker 0>I wouldn't worry about it. And then the

00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:52.950
<v Speaker 0>only three minutes to spare, so you definitely

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:54.230
<v Speaker 0>kept them busy for that.

00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:55.430
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Well,

00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:57.910
<v Speaker 0>thank you for joining us. We're now gonna

00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:59.829
<v Speaker 0>attempt another cluster, but if we could start

00:46:59.829 --> 00:47:01.885
<v Speaker 0>with some introductions, We'll start with you, Mike.

00:47:01.885 --> 00:47:04.045
<v Speaker 0>Just work our way around clockwise. Feel free

00:47:04.045 --> 00:47:05.565
<v Speaker 0>to say hello, share anything you want to

00:47:05.565 --> 00:47:07.244
<v Speaker 0>share, and then we'll we'll hand you over

00:47:07.244 --> 00:47:08.125
<v Speaker 0>to a cluster.

00:47:08.765 --> 00:47:11.484
<v Speaker 5>Yeah. I'm Mike Tujaran. I'm one of Adobe's

00:47:11.484 --> 00:47:13.885
<v Speaker 5>engineers on what we call our Ethos platform.

00:47:13.885 --> 00:47:16.319
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of our bespoke Kubernetes install that

00:47:16.319 --> 00:47:19.280
<v Speaker 5>runs the vast majority of Adobe's

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:20.319
<v Speaker 5>containerized

00:47:20.319 --> 00:47:21.200
<v Speaker 5>workflows.

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:26.960
<v Speaker 0>Adrian?

00:47:29.515 --> 00:47:32.155
<v Speaker 4>Hey, guys. I'm Adrian. I'm a cloud software

00:47:32.155 --> 00:47:34.715
<v Speaker 4>engineer at Adobe, and I'm also,

00:47:35.195 --> 00:47:38.155
<v Speaker 4>working together with Mike and Jacob

00:47:38.395 --> 00:47:40.795
<v Speaker 4>on the Adobe Kubernetes platform.

00:47:40.875 --> 00:47:43.510
<v Speaker 4>And I am very happy and hope

00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:44.710
<v Speaker 4>we'll get

00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:46.790
<v Speaker 4>to to

00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:50.390
<v Speaker 4>clean up the cluster today. Thank you. Thank

00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:52.230
<v Speaker 0>you.

00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.869
<v Speaker 0>Carlos?

00:47:56.545 --> 00:47:59.345
<v Speaker 7>Hey. I'm Carlos Sanchez. I work at Adobe

00:47:59.345 --> 00:48:02.385
<v Speaker 7>Experience Manager. We use the clusters,

00:48:02.385 --> 00:48:04.705
<v Speaker 7>the Kubernetes clusters that these guys build for

00:48:04.705 --> 00:48:06.545
<v Speaker 7>us. We

00:48:07.025 --> 00:48:09.265
<v Speaker 7>break them a lot, so maybe they got

00:48:09.265 --> 00:48:10.465
<v Speaker 7>some experience from this.

00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:14.530
<v Speaker 7>And now I'm scared about what's what's in

00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:15.650
<v Speaker 7>here for us.

00:48:17.090 --> 00:48:19.010
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Thank you, Jacob.

00:48:19.890 --> 00:48:21.410

<v Speaker 6>Hello. Hello.

00:48:27.255 --> 00:48:29.975
<v Speaker 6>Sorry. I was having some connectivity issues there.

00:48:30.214 --> 00:48:32.214
<v Speaker 6>But, yes, I am Jacob from Adobe. I'm

00:48:32.214 --> 00:48:33.095
<v Speaker 6>a lead engineer.

00:48:33.335 --> 00:48:35.095
<v Speaker 6>I've been working with Kubernetes for,

00:48:35.494 --> 00:48:37.415
<v Speaker 6>five years now. It's it's been a wild

00:48:37.415 --> 00:48:39.815
<v Speaker 6>ride. Have a lot of war stories, so

00:48:39.815 --> 00:48:40.935
<v Speaker 6>some fun stuff here.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.560
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Thank you all for sharing. So I

00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:46.800
<v Speaker 0>am gonna pop over to the screen share,

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:49.280
<v Speaker 0>give you access to your other cluster, and

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:50.800
<v Speaker 0>then I'll give you a minute to get

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:51.600
<v Speaker 0>set up.

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:54.560
<v Speaker 0>You have to export your kube config, configure

00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:56.960
<v Speaker 0>any aliases, and you'll be good from there.

00:49:01.465 --> 00:49:02.265
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:49:06.585 --> 00:49:07.305
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:49:07.465 --> 00:49:09.145
<v Speaker 0>And just a moment, this session to the

00:49:09.145 --> 00:49:10.825
<v Speaker 0>control plane will be open. From there, you

00:49:10.825 --> 00:49:13.065
<v Speaker 0>can use active sessions and join.

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:15.760
<v Speaker 0>Oh, we have a wee hello as well

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:17.120
<v Speaker 0>for you. Look at that.

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:19.920
<v Speaker 0>Come and join the session. Let me know

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:21.680
<v Speaker 0>that you're there and best of luck.

00:49:36.984 --> 00:49:38.424
<v Speaker 5>Alright. This is where I get nervous.

00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:43.160
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We got one in. Good. I'm gonna

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:44.840
<v Speaker 0>join myself just in case we have a

00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:46.760
<v Speaker 0>Vim, which of course we always have Vim.

00:49:57.275 --> 00:50:00.555
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Four people. Awesome. Alright. Take it away.

00:50:00.555 --> 00:50:01.275
<v Speaker 0>Good luck.

00:50:02.474 --> 00:50:03.275
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:50:05.035 --> 00:50:06.875
<v Speaker 5>Jacob, you you still typing?

00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:11.030
<v Speaker 6>Yeah. So first things first. Let's go get

00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:13.670
<v Speaker 6>a script that, Zapier

00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:14.790
<v Speaker 6>team just used,

00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:16.870
<v Speaker 6>and let's go ahead and, you know, execute

00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:17.430
<v Speaker 6>that.

00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:18.550
<v Speaker 6>I

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:20.710
<v Speaker 6>thought it was great that they just made

00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:23.025
<v Speaker 6>that a a public gist that I could

00:50:23.025 --> 00:50:25.505
<v Speaker 6>just go, you know, download and run. So,

00:50:25.505 --> 00:50:27.345
<v Speaker 6>you know, thank you. I really appreciate you

00:50:27.345 --> 00:50:30.145
<v Speaker 6>giving us our group CTL and our CTL

00:50:30.145 --> 00:50:31.905
<v Speaker 6>and a couple of things there.

00:50:32.545 --> 00:50:34.865
<v Speaker 6>And now that that's done, now let's go

00:50:34.865 --> 00:50:36.545
<v Speaker 6>add our own

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:41.080
<v Speaker 6>and add a couple of things there and

00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:42.280
<v Speaker 6>source that.

00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:44.840
<v Speaker 6>Okay.

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:46.120
<v Speaker 6>So now

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.520
<v Speaker 6>let's see what we got.

00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:50.680
<v Speaker 0>There is no such thing as cheating on

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:53.684
<v Speaker 0>clustered, although teams up here are trying to

00:50:53.684 --> 00:50:54.565
<v Speaker 0>claim otherwise.

00:50:57.125 --> 00:50:58.724
<v Speaker 5>There goes the admin.com.

00:50:59.684 --> 00:51:00.405
<v Speaker 6>Okay.

00:51:01.765 --> 00:51:03.444
<v Speaker 6>Well, let's go ahead and look at the

00:51:03.444 --> 00:51:04.244
<v Speaker 6>API server.

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:07.500
<v Speaker 6>Nothing. Let's go look for a crew.

00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:10.220
<v Speaker 6>Your manager, had a controller manager, and a

00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:11.100
<v Speaker 6>scheduler.

00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:14.620
<v Speaker 6>K. Let's

00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:15.180
<v Speaker 6>see.

00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:18.940
<v Speaker 6>From here, let's let's take a look at

00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:19.660
<v Speaker 6>the manifest

00:51:22.365 --> 00:51:23.165
<v Speaker 6>and

00:51:23.165 --> 00:51:24.525
<v Speaker 6>see what we have.

00:51:25.245 --> 00:51:26.925
<v Speaker 6>Actually, let's first look at the Kubla to

00:51:26.925 --> 00:51:28.525
<v Speaker 6>see if that's actually running stuff.

00:51:31.725 --> 00:51:32.285
<v Speaker 6>Exited.

00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:33.960
<v Speaker 6>Exec.

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:34.680
<v Speaker 6>K.

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:41.000
<v Speaker 6>Permission denied.

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:42.120
<v Speaker 0>Uh-oh.

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:46.120
<v Speaker 6>Did you swap out the Kubelet?

00:51:52.695 --> 00:51:54.215
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. I guess it depends how

00:51:54.215 --> 00:51:55.895
<v Speaker 0>much you trust the timestamp on a binary

00:51:55.895 --> 00:51:57.815
<v Speaker 0>on a random Linux machine you've been given.

00:51:57.815 --> 00:51:57.975
<v Speaker 0>Right?

00:51:59.650 --> 00:52:01.650
<v Speaker 6>What is today's date? Yeah.

00:52:01.650 --> 00:52:03.490
<v Speaker 6>The date is correct. It was it was

00:52:03.490 --> 00:52:05.090
<v Speaker 6>correct. Yeah. It's the twenty eighth.

00:52:05.890 --> 00:52:06.530
<v Speaker 6>That

00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:08.050
<v Speaker 6>looks okay.

00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:11.650
<v Speaker 6>So problem spawning the Kubelet.

00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:12.290
<v Speaker 6>Let's see.

00:52:14.375 --> 00:52:16.695
<v Speaker 6>Thoughts here, team? What are you what are

00:52:16.695 --> 00:52:17.415
<v Speaker 6>you thinking?

00:52:17.974 --> 00:52:19.015
<v Speaker 6>Where should we go next?

00:52:19.575 --> 00:52:20.375
<v Speaker 1>What permissions

00:52:21.335 --> 00:52:22.615
<v Speaker 5>on the Kubelet are?

00:52:23.734 --> 00:52:25.895
<v Speaker 7>Yep. The config is not set.

00:52:26.455 --> 00:52:28.295
<v Speaker 0>That's right. Yeah. Where's the wee x?

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:30.560
<v Speaker 6>Yes.

00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:35.520
<v Speaker 6>That one's simple. Let's see what journal is

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:37.760
<v Speaker 6>doing now. We might need to restart it.

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:39.600
<v Speaker 6>K.

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:44.080
<v Speaker 6>True version. Oh, starting stuff.

00:52:46.214 --> 00:52:47.335
<v Speaker 0>That looks healthy.

00:52:48.615 --> 00:52:49.335
<v Speaker 6>K.

00:52:51.335 --> 00:52:53.095
<v Speaker 6>No. It's not found, so there might be

00:52:53.095 --> 00:52:54.935
<v Speaker 6>a problem with joining the cluster.

00:52:56.135 --> 00:52:58.775
<v Speaker 6>Let's go see now if

00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:02.810
<v Speaker 6>got an API server running

00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:05.290
<v Speaker 6>to scheduler controller manager.

00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:08.490
<v Speaker 6>Not seeing oh, the API's are. Yeah. K.

00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:11.050
<v Speaker 6>K. So let's see what happens.

00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:12.650
<v Speaker 6>Nothing.

00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:13.690
<v Speaker 6>Nothing.

00:53:15.035 --> 00:53:16.075
<v Speaker 6>Wonderful.

00:53:16.555 --> 00:53:18.555
<v Speaker 6>So let's go look at ports.

00:53:19.915 --> 00:53:21.115
<v Speaker 1>Hold on. Right

00:53:21.595 --> 00:53:23.435
<v Speaker 5>there. Do I go back to what you

00:53:23.435 --> 00:53:24.395
<v Speaker 5>were just looking at?

00:53:24.795 --> 00:53:26.075
<v Speaker 6>I can't scroll through.

00:53:26.395 --> 00:53:26.715
<v Speaker 1>Oh,

00:53:27.849 --> 00:53:29.530
<v Speaker 1>looks like there was a mismatch.

00:53:30.010 --> 00:53:32.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean, sorry, an IP mismatch between what

00:53:32.570 --> 00:53:34.650
<v Speaker 5>IP it was trying to connect to and

00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:36.090
<v Speaker 5>what the advertised

00:53:36.890 --> 00:53:38.330
<v Speaker 5>IP was for the API server.

00:53:41.355 --> 00:53:41.995
<v Speaker 0>K.

00:53:43.995 --> 00:53:45.995
<v Speaker 6>Should those IP should that IP be just

00:53:45.995 --> 00:53:46.875
<v Speaker 6>something different?

00:53:47.675 --> 00:53:48.715
<v Speaker 5>What is the

00:53:49.115 --> 00:53:50.155
<v Speaker 4>API server?

00:53:51.755 --> 00:53:52.795
<v Speaker 4>KubeConfig

00:53:52.795 --> 00:53:53.675
<v Speaker 4>KubeConfig

00:53:53.675 --> 00:53:54.795
<v Speaker 4>settings.

00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:03.090
<v Speaker 6>For five,

00:54:03.569 --> 00:54:04.849
<v Speaker 6>should that be it, or should can we

00:54:04.849 --> 00:54:05.970
<v Speaker 6>just change it to local host?

00:54:09.035 --> 00:54:10.875
<v Speaker 0>You can. Yeah. Are you sure it's local

00:54:10.875 --> 00:54:13.355
<v Speaker 6>host? That'd be fine. So I show

00:54:14.475 --> 00:54:17.195
<v Speaker 5>the Not sure. It depends. The it should

00:54:17.195 --> 00:54:19.675
<v Speaker 4>match. The CT scan is 145.

00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:24.910
<v Speaker 5>It'd be 1454103121.

00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:27.150
<v Speaker 0>Yep. That's what it's set.

00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:29.470
<v Speaker 1>Right. So

00:54:29.869 --> 00:54:31.230
<v Speaker 5>let's take a look at what the API

00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:32.510
<v Speaker 1>server's advertising has.

00:54:33.365 --> 00:54:35.125
<v Speaker 1>I thought I saw a difference between the

00:54:35.125 --> 00:54:35.685
<v Speaker 5>two.

00:54:36.885 --> 00:54:38.565
<v Speaker 6>In the manufacturer's name?

00:54:38.964 --> 00:54:39.444
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.

00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:51.610
<v Speaker 6>Advertise address, it's the 10.network.

00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:55.930
<v Speaker 6>Should that be set to the public? I'm

00:54:55.930 --> 00:54:56.970
<v Speaker 6>not positive on that.

00:55:01.065 --> 00:55:03.865
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. Please also check the pre AL IP

00:55:03.865 --> 00:55:05.465
<v Speaker 4>of the masternode

00:55:06.505 --> 00:55:08.505
<v Speaker 4>just to make sure that is not a

00:55:09.145 --> 00:55:09.945
<v Speaker 4>misconfiguration

00:55:09.945 --> 00:55:10.345
<v Speaker 4>here.

00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:14.770
<v Speaker 5>So it probably should be advertising to the

00:55:14.770 --> 00:55:17.170
<v Speaker 5>the private IP or not. So if it's

00:55:17.170 --> 00:55:19.570
<v Speaker 5>advertising the private IP, the cube config should

00:55:19.570 --> 00:55:21.010
<v Speaker 5>probably be pointing to the

00:55:21.490 --> 00:55:22.609
<v Speaker 5>private IP as well.

00:55:24.795 --> 00:55:25.515
<v Speaker 6>K.

00:55:26.875 --> 00:55:29.275
<v Speaker 6>Let's see. I'm pulling up some other resources

00:55:29.275 --> 00:55:30.875
<v Speaker 6>right now. Mike, do you wanna you wanna

00:55:30.875 --> 00:55:32.475
<v Speaker 6>take over and start doing that?

00:55:32.954 --> 00:55:34.795
<v Speaker 6>Sure. I'm looking at something else really quick.

00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Scroll on me.

00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:45.040
<v Speaker 0>If you have a scrolling issues, you can

00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:46.000
<v Speaker 0>just drag

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.320
<v Speaker 0>your window one pixel or type reset, and

00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:49.280
<v Speaker 0>it should help.

00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:50.800
<v Speaker 5>Type reset? Okay.

00:55:54.595 --> 00:55:55.395
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:56:06.275 --> 00:56:08.835
<v Speaker 1>I can type new API server.

00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:17.570
<v Speaker 0>You should be able to just copy that

00:56:17.570 --> 00:56:19.650
<v Speaker 0>address, which I'm assuming you're doing, enter the

00:56:19.650 --> 00:56:20.530
<v Speaker 0>admin.com.

00:56:34.755 --> 00:56:35.635
<v Speaker 0>Nope.

00:56:36.115 --> 00:56:38.035
<v Speaker 0>I find it interesting that you're getting the

00:56:38.035 --> 00:56:40.995
<v Speaker 0>correct error message, but you're also getting

00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:42.110
<v Speaker 0>something else on the output.

00:56:44.110 --> 00:56:44.910
<v Speaker 5>Oh, yeah.

00:56:46.590 --> 00:56:48.990
<v Speaker 5>So keep And even weirder that you used

00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:51.150
<v Speaker 0>their script to switch

00:56:51.150 --> 00:56:52.190
<v Speaker 0>out the cube control.

00:57:00.465 --> 00:57:02.465
<v Speaker 0>That's not the one the script downloaded, I

00:57:02.465 --> 00:57:03.185
<v Speaker 0>don't think.

00:57:07.585 --> 00:57:08.785
<v Speaker 0>Where's Espin.

00:57:09.505 --> 00:57:10.705
<v Speaker 0>It's our local Espin.

00:57:25.135 --> 00:57:28.095
<v Speaker 5>What one twenty three dot what do we

00:57:28.095 --> 00:57:29.695
<v Speaker 5>remember? Three. That's a month.

00:57:52.515 --> 00:57:54.195
<v Speaker 1>It's our local S. Ben.

00:57:56.115 --> 00:57:56.835
<v Speaker 1>Oops.

00:57:58.435 --> 00:57:59.475
<v Speaker 1>BUSR

00:57:59.475 --> 00:58:00.995
<v Speaker 1>local Ben

00:58:01.635 --> 00:58:02.995
<v Speaker 1>UCTL.

00:58:03.235 --> 00:58:03.875
<v Speaker 1>UCTL.

00:58:10.970 --> 00:58:12.330
<v Speaker 1>There we go. Now we're on a more

00:58:12.330 --> 00:58:13.530
<v Speaker 1>normal cube CTL.

00:58:21.785 --> 00:58:22.985
<v Speaker 5>So Kathy,

00:58:27.225 --> 00:58:28.905
<v Speaker 1>wrap API server.

00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:34.840
<v Speaker 1>API server is not

00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:42.520
<v Speaker 5>sorry, John.

00:58:50.134 --> 00:58:51.255
<v Speaker 6>Let's

00:58:51.255 --> 00:58:53.494
<v Speaker 6>look at what's

00:58:53.494 --> 00:58:54.855
<v Speaker 5>doing here real quick.

00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:02.290
<v Speaker 6>So that's there.

00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:11.250
<v Speaker 5>Cryo CTL.

00:59:12.770 --> 00:59:14.290
<v Speaker 5>Also not used to Cryo yet.

00:59:15.144 --> 00:59:16.744
<v Speaker 5>I think it's container

00:59:17.464 --> 00:59:18.265
<v Speaker 6>list.

00:59:19.144 --> 00:59:19.945
<v Speaker 6>No.

00:59:21.385 --> 00:59:22.744
<v Speaker 1>I see the list.

00:59:24.105 --> 00:59:26.265
<v Speaker 0>Cryo control PS, I think.

00:59:28.010 --> 00:59:28.810
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:59:28.810 --> 00:59:31.770
<v Speaker 0>Or pods list or yeah. Yes.

00:59:32.650 --> 00:59:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So the UPS server still isn't running.

00:59:36.250 --> 00:59:36.970
<v Speaker 5>So

00:59:40.650 --> 00:59:42.250
<v Speaker 1>what's it like, Rawkode with the dash a?

00:59:44.204 --> 00:59:46.045
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. Let's check the static.

00:59:46.045 --> 00:59:46.525
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.

00:59:48.125 --> 00:59:49.085
<v Speaker 5>CD isn't running.

01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:05.910
<v Speaker 1>351.

01:00:11.865 --> 01:00:14.345
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I see something's getting in there. There

01:00:14.345 --> 01:00:14.905
<v Speaker 6>is

01:00:19.305 --> 01:00:21.225
<v Speaker 5>anything jump out at anybody real quick off

01:00:21.225 --> 01:00:22.425
<v Speaker 5>of that? If not

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:26.119
<v Speaker 6>This the queue replic replicative manager, that's not

01:00:26.119 --> 01:00:27.080
<v Speaker 6>supposed to be there.

01:00:27.799 --> 01:00:31.079
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That sounds fishy. And our SCD config

01:00:31.079 --> 01:00:33.480
<v Speaker 0>has peer URLs when these are set up

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:34.920
<v Speaker 0>as single SCD instances.

01:00:37.515 --> 01:00:39.915
<v Speaker 6>So this is one thing. I'm just gonna

01:00:39.915 --> 01:00:42.555
<v Speaker 6>remove this this replica manager.

01:00:42.714 --> 01:00:44.475
<v Speaker 6>We need to Yeah. Oh, wow.

01:00:45.275 --> 01:00:47.115
<v Speaker 6>Damn. There's a whole bunch of.

01:00:49.595 --> 01:00:50.395
<v Speaker 6>Oh, man.

01:00:51.050 --> 01:00:52.170
<v Speaker 6>This happened.

01:00:53.210 --> 01:00:55.530
<v Speaker 0>I think someone pasted it into the terminal.

01:00:56.090 --> 01:00:58.330
<v Speaker 6>I just pasted the junk into the terminal.

01:00:58.330 --> 01:00:59.770
<v Speaker 6>Sorry. Did you look at the replica set

01:00:59.770 --> 01:01:01.050
<v Speaker 0>manager? What was it?

01:01:01.609 --> 01:01:04.570
<v Speaker 6>I did. Yes. It is the Rawkode

01:01:04.745 --> 01:01:06.905
<v Speaker 6>Academy cluster d. You can scroll up and

01:01:06.905 --> 01:01:07.545
<v Speaker 6>see it.

01:01:08.505 --> 01:01:11.385
<v Speaker 6>Just selecting the image for Rawkode Academy clustered.

01:01:12.825 --> 01:01:13.465
<v Speaker 6>So

01:01:14.345 --> 01:01:15.945
<v Speaker 6>apologies. I just pasted all that.

01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:19.460
<v Speaker 6>Okay.

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:21.220
<v Speaker 6>So let's see.

01:01:24.819 --> 01:01:26.900
<v Speaker 6>What was this before? See if it clean

01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:28.580
<v Speaker 6>up any of those files that are excluded.

01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:32.900
<v Speaker 6>K.

01:01:34.515 --> 01:01:35.955
<v Speaker 6>Anyway, those

01:01:36.914 --> 01:01:38.595
<v Speaker 6>thing actions is the method. Folks are doing

01:01:38.595 --> 01:01:40.035
<v Speaker 6>the clean stuff. So I think the admin

01:01:40.035 --> 01:01:42.355
<v Speaker 6>one and the controller manager one are the

01:01:42.355 --> 01:01:44.035
<v Speaker 6>ones that I just created.

01:01:44.595 --> 01:01:45.635
<v Speaker 6>Now that looks

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:49.980
<v Speaker 6>that looks similar to the case just above.

01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:50.859
<v Speaker 6>That's good.

01:01:51.099 --> 01:01:52.300
<v Speaker 6>Okay. So

01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:55.099
<v Speaker 5>let's see. So let's

01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:57.820
<v Speaker 5>so that CD isn't starting.

01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:00.299
<v Speaker 5>Right. I was wanting to think about the

01:02:00.299 --> 01:02:02.805
<v Speaker 1>containers, so we should probably take a look

01:02:02.805 --> 01:02:04.005
<v Speaker 1>at the logs.

01:02:05.045 --> 01:02:06.405
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's a good idea.

01:02:11.765 --> 01:02:13.925
<v Speaker 6>Let's see. Actually, three minutes ago.

01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.

01:02:18.809 --> 01:02:19.609
<v Speaker 6>I

01:02:19.609 --> 01:02:21.930
<v Speaker 6>know what it is. I use iTerm, and

01:02:21.930 --> 01:02:24.170
<v Speaker 1>when I have it, something copies it.

01:02:24.970 --> 01:02:26.570
<v Speaker 6>Jeez. It's not doing it.

01:02:26.890 --> 01:02:28.650
<v Speaker 1>Sorry. Oh my goodness.

01:02:30.915 --> 01:02:32.995
<v Speaker 0>You're sabotaging yourselves now.

01:02:33.235 --> 01:02:35.235
<v Speaker 6>This is all just for everyone's enjoyment. You're

01:02:35.235 --> 01:02:36.595
<v Speaker 6>welcome. Okay.

01:02:36.755 --> 01:02:37.955
<v Speaker 6>Removing that.

01:02:39.475 --> 01:02:42.595
<v Speaker 6>Removing that. Oh my goodness. That's gonna trip

01:02:42.595 --> 01:02:43.795
<v Speaker 6>me up so many times. I just did

01:02:43.795 --> 01:02:44.355
<v Speaker 6>it again.

01:02:45.030 --> 01:02:45.750
<v Speaker 6>K.

01:02:47.830 --> 01:02:50.390
<v Speaker 6>Hey. Everything's going there. So your best bet

01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:53.110
<v Speaker 0>would just be to go to varlog containers

01:02:53.110 --> 01:02:55.350
<v Speaker 0>or pods, varlog pods, and you'll get the

01:02:55.350 --> 01:02:56.870
<v Speaker 0>logs from there. You can just tell them,

01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:57.990
<v Speaker 0>or you can just create control.

01:03:05.005 --> 01:03:06.765
<v Speaker 6>One. Expecting IP for.

01:03:11.644 --> 01:03:12.045
<v Speaker 6>K.

01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:16.100
<v Speaker 1>Is there a config file for SDU somewhere

01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:18.020
<v Speaker 6>that's not in the manifest folder?

01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:20.740
<v Speaker 0>Nope.

01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:23.380
<v Speaker 0>All inside of here?

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:24.420
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:28.820
<v Speaker 5>Wait. It's listing two peer URLs there.

01:03:29.755 --> 01:03:31.755
<v Speaker 5>There's only one in the FCD.

01:03:32.955 --> 01:03:33.915
<v Speaker 5>Hopefully.

01:03:41.355 --> 01:03:42.715
<v Speaker 5>I'm

01:03:42.715 --> 01:03:44.155
<v Speaker 5>not sure which one should be the right

01:03:44.155 --> 01:03:44.474
<v Speaker 5>one.

01:03:50.270 --> 01:03:51.710
<v Speaker 6>Where am I looking here? I'm in the

01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:54.350
<v Speaker 6>wrong place. You're in the right Up

01:03:55.789 --> 01:03:56.589
<v Speaker 5>five lines.

01:04:03.135 --> 01:04:05.295
<v Speaker 6>Mike, do you I'm really blanking on how

01:04:05.295 --> 01:04:07.694
<v Speaker 6>say this. Okay. So listen. Pure URL is

01:04:07.694 --> 01:04:08.255
<v Speaker 6>here.

01:04:08.974 --> 01:04:10.815
<v Speaker 5>Yeah. So it's got two IPs there where

01:04:10.815 --> 01:04:12.950
<v Speaker 5>there's only one control point node. So I

01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:15.029
<v Speaker 5>don't know what that 1337420

01:04:15.029 --> 01:04:15.670
<v Speaker 5>is.

01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:20.869
<v Speaker 6>Good

01:04:21.269 --> 01:04:22.070
<v Speaker 6>question.

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:23.509
<v Speaker 6>So let's get rid of that.

01:04:26.204 --> 01:04:26.925
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.

01:04:27.005 --> 01:04:27.885
<v Speaker 6>Let's

01:04:28.125 --> 01:04:29.484
<v Speaker 6>remove that.

01:04:30.285 --> 01:04:31.724
<v Speaker 5>And then we gotta do this

01:04:32.525 --> 01:04:34.285
<v Speaker 5>client URL should only have one of them

01:04:34.285 --> 01:04:34.765
<v Speaker 5>as well.

01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:42.900
<v Speaker 6>So

01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:45.300
<v Speaker 6>local host

01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:47.860
<v Speaker 6>in this case. Now I'm guessing it's gonna

01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:48.420
<v Speaker 6>be

01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:51.220
<v Speaker 0>I think that that line's okay, to be

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:52.180
<v Speaker 0>honest. To compare that against one.

01:04:56.785 --> 01:04:58.065
<v Speaker 6>K. Let's see

01:05:00.625 --> 01:05:01.985
<v Speaker 6>what happens here.

01:05:02.865 --> 01:05:03.985
<v Speaker 6>Not

01:05:03.985 --> 01:05:05.425
<v Speaker 6>showing it there. We might need to restart

01:05:05.425 --> 01:05:07.185
<v Speaker 6>the Kubelet in order to

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:14.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:18.360
<v Speaker 1>just find out that would be good enough.

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:22.920
<v Speaker 6>Oh, did somebody else talk to you?

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:26.175
<v Speaker 5>Oh, sorry. I tried to reset my thing,

01:05:26.175 --> 01:05:27.775
<v Speaker 5>and it screwed it up. Sorry.

01:05:29.855 --> 01:05:32.015
<v Speaker 6>So let's restart the Kubelets

01:05:36.415 --> 01:05:39.535
<v Speaker 6>to force it to pick up its

01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:40.190
<v Speaker 6>manifest. Again, I know there's I know there's

01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:41.310
<v Speaker 6>a timer there, but

01:05:42.270 --> 01:05:42.829
<v Speaker 6>to

01:05:45.869 --> 01:05:46.590
<v Speaker 6>k.

01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:48.430
<v Speaker 6>Running two seconds ago.

01:05:49.309 --> 01:05:50.990
<v Speaker 6>Still running. That's good.

01:05:55.835 --> 01:05:58.555
<v Speaker 6>K. Much better. Running.

01:05:58.555 --> 01:05:59.835
<v Speaker 6>Serving traffic.

01:05:59.915 --> 01:06:00.795
<v Speaker 6>K.

01:06:02.715 --> 01:06:03.835
<v Speaker 6>Let's see.

01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:09.510
<v Speaker 6>Balance. We have API server. Hasn't restarted a

01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:10.550
<v Speaker 6>bunch of times.

01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:13.510
<v Speaker 6>Three eight forty four seconds ago.

01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:17.190
<v Speaker 6>See if not that one.

01:06:21.704 --> 01:06:23.385
<v Speaker 6>Let's see what's in here. Oh,

01:06:26.744 --> 01:06:29.065
<v Speaker 6>Let's

01:06:29.065 --> 01:06:29.545
<v Speaker 6>see.

01:06:30.905 --> 01:06:31.704
<v Speaker 6>Oh, okay.

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:34.680
<v Speaker 6>We have our control plane up. Awesome.

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:37.720
<v Speaker 6>See what's running on this.

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:40.760
<v Speaker 6>So, Liam, operator,

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:41.960
<v Speaker 6>necessary,

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:43.640
<v Speaker 6>etcd,

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:44.840
<v Speaker 6>clustered app,

01:06:46.315 --> 01:06:47.355
<v Speaker 6>miscrease.

01:06:47.435 --> 01:06:49.755
<v Speaker 6>Cool. All that is

01:06:49.755 --> 01:06:51.035
<v Speaker 6>looking okay.

01:06:53.435 --> 01:06:55.675
<v Speaker 6>That means we hit yeah. Yeah. And now

01:06:55.675 --> 01:06:57.515
<v Speaker 4>and now it looks like

01:06:59.609 --> 01:07:02.010
<v Speaker 4>we should also have the KubeCTL.

01:07:03.769 --> 01:07:05.930
<v Speaker 5>So what's interesting there is

01:07:06.970 --> 01:07:08.890
<v Speaker 5>Cilium operator, the one that's in crash loop

01:07:08.890 --> 01:07:11.210
<v Speaker 5>back off, has a public IP, not a

01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:11.930
<v Speaker 5>private IP

01:07:12.375 --> 01:07:13.975
<v Speaker 5>for one trying to get on to the

01:07:13.975 --> 01:07:14.855
<v Speaker 5>worker.

01:07:16.215 --> 01:07:17.415
<v Speaker 5>And

01:07:18.135 --> 01:07:21.095
<v Speaker 5>so does Cilium with 203 restarts.

01:07:22.535 --> 01:07:23.895
<v Speaker 1>So let's take a look at those.

01:07:30.650 --> 01:07:32.170
<v Speaker 6>Same operator.

01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:35.930
<v Speaker 6>Nope. Not.

01:07:47.845 --> 01:07:50.005
<v Speaker 6>Part of me just wants to rekick it

01:07:50.005 --> 01:07:51.525
<v Speaker 6>and let it come up again.

01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:55.030
<v Speaker 6>But oh, yep. Kubernetes service host is a

01:07:55.030 --> 01:07:57.510
<v Speaker 6>public IP address in the in the spec.

01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.550
<v Speaker 6>So

01:07:59.030 --> 01:08:00.470
<v Speaker 6>let's look at

01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:04.230
<v Speaker 6>the one that is running that doesn't have

01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:04.550
<v Speaker 6>that.

01:08:07.285 --> 01:08:08.485
<v Speaker 6>See what it's

01:08:09.605 --> 01:08:10.325
<v Speaker 6>oh,

01:08:11.445 --> 01:08:14.245
<v Speaker 6>dang it. It's highlighting here. Copy paste again?

01:08:14.245 --> 01:08:14.725
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.

01:08:15.205 --> 01:08:15.845
<v Speaker 6>Seriously.

01:08:17.604 --> 01:08:19.604
<v Speaker 6>Goodness gracious. Should I even be driving?

01:08:21.170 --> 01:08:23.090
<v Speaker 6>K. So let's run up here.

01:08:23.490 --> 01:08:25.649
<v Speaker 6>Kubernetes service host is a public IP address

01:08:25.649 --> 01:08:27.090
<v Speaker 6>for that pod too.

01:08:27.570 --> 01:08:28.290
<v Speaker 6>Interesting.

01:08:29.170 --> 01:08:31.649
<v Speaker 5>Let's take a look at previous, replica sets

01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:33.410
<v Speaker 5>to see what an older one looks like

01:08:33.895 --> 01:08:35.094
<v Speaker 5>and see if they

01:08:35.734 --> 01:08:37.974
<v Speaker 5>nicely left us the older ones or not.

01:08:40.215 --> 01:08:40.854
<v Speaker 6>No.

01:08:44.455 --> 01:08:45.654
<v Speaker 6>That's do we have?

01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:49.670
<v Speaker 0>So does run as a privileged

01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:52.390
<v Speaker 0>host namespace, so at least for network on

01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:54.710
<v Speaker 0>each node. So I think the public IP

01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:56.149
<v Speaker 0>and I'm I could be wrong. I think

01:08:56.149 --> 01:08:56.950
<v Speaker 0>that's a red heading.

01:08:58.955 --> 01:09:01.354
<v Speaker 6>Okay. Then let's look at

01:09:03.035 --> 01:09:05.755
<v Speaker 6>this container and see what's up.

01:09:09.595 --> 01:09:11.435
<v Speaker 5>Yeah. So the API server, remember, we have

01:09:11.435 --> 01:09:13.035
<v Speaker 5>running on the the private IP,

01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:14.990
<v Speaker 5>not the public IP.

01:09:15.070 --> 01:09:15.790
<v Speaker 6>Right.

01:09:16.670 --> 01:09:18.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. Let's check the deployment spec.

01:09:19.710 --> 01:09:23.229
<v Speaker 4>I saw some interesting environment variables in the

01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:24.510
<v Speaker 6>I'm for the

01:09:29.085 --> 01:09:29.965
<v Speaker 6>You're thinking

01:09:32.045 --> 01:09:35.405
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. Let's edit the deployment. Yeah. Or Yeah.

01:09:36.765 --> 01:09:38.125
<v Speaker 6>Do you wanna look through that?

01:09:38.765 --> 01:09:41.050
<v Speaker 4>No. Go ahead. I just opened it. But

01:09:41.050 --> 01:09:43.050
<v Speaker 4>I I think it's very obvious. There is

01:09:43.050 --> 01:09:45.130
<v Speaker 4>a a variable environment,

01:09:45.929 --> 01:09:49.609
<v Speaker 4>setting the API server to a public, IP

01:09:49.609 --> 01:09:50.249
<v Speaker 4>address.

01:09:50.890 --> 01:09:52.729
<v Speaker 4>Right. That might be the culprit here.

01:09:54.045 --> 01:09:55.645
<v Speaker 5>Yeah. Let's set that back to the the

01:09:55.645 --> 01:09:56.605
<v Speaker 5>private one.

01:09:59.005 --> 01:10:00.205
<v Speaker 6>Is it 127?

01:10:02.205 --> 01:10:04.685
<v Speaker 5>No. It would be the the 10 dot.

01:10:06.525 --> 01:10:07.805
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember that off the top of

01:10:07.805 --> 01:10:09.960
<v Speaker 5>your head? Well, if it's in the public

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.360
<v Speaker 6>it it is in host network. That's the

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:13.320
<v Speaker 6>same operator.

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:14.199
<v Speaker 6>Right.

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:17.000
<v Speaker 5>But it won't be able to get one

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.600
<v Speaker 1>from the worker node. If it runs on

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:19.560
<v Speaker 1>there, it won't be able to get to

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:20.120
<v Speaker 1>local host.

01:10:21.045 --> 01:10:23.205
<v Speaker 6>Oh, you're right. K.

01:10:23.365 --> 01:10:24.885
<v Speaker 6>Then let's get

01:10:26.645 --> 01:10:27.525
<v Speaker 6>where it says

01:10:29.525 --> 01:10:31.205
<v Speaker 6>believe this is what it should be looking

01:10:31.205 --> 01:10:32.805
<v Speaker 6>at, the 109601.

01:10:32.805 --> 01:10:34.965
<v Speaker 6>That's where the Kubernetes API server should be.

01:10:35.285 --> 01:10:35.605
<v Speaker 6>Actually,

01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:38.139
<v Speaker 6>so then config wise

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:40.060
<v Speaker 6>well, we can try it and see what

01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:42.380
<v Speaker 6>happens. So let's let's edit this.

01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:46.940
<v Speaker 6>Actually, by editing, are we going to cause

01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:48.940
<v Speaker 6>any problems with the pod that is currently

01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:49.260
<v Speaker 6>running?

01:10:53.755 --> 01:10:55.435
<v Speaker 6>Because we have one that is

01:10:55.835 --> 01:10:57.594
<v Speaker 6>actually, both are running right now.

01:11:00.075 --> 01:11:00.795
<v Speaker 6>Curious.

01:11:02.155 --> 01:11:04.075
<v Speaker 6>K. Maybe that's just maybe that's not something

01:11:04.075 --> 01:11:05.435
<v Speaker 6>we should pursue

01:11:05.435 --> 01:11:07.420
<v Speaker 6>at this point. Let's actually

01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:09.020
<v Speaker 6>I think it's probably now we have the

01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:10.380
<v Speaker 6>API server up, it's

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:12.619
<v Speaker 6>probably a good time to go look for

01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:14.380
<v Speaker 6>errand policies.

01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:17.180
<v Speaker 6>Let's see what might those be.

01:11:19.175 --> 01:11:21.255
<v Speaker 6>Part of the list during the the

01:11:21.575 --> 01:11:22.615
<v Speaker 6>other call.

01:11:23.895 --> 01:11:24.775
<v Speaker 7>The little.

01:11:29.575 --> 01:11:31.815
<v Speaker 6>K. So let's get NetPole.

01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:33.580
<v Speaker 1>You

01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:35.820
<v Speaker 1>see that in there.

01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:36.699
<v Speaker 6>Good.

01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:39.179
<v Speaker 6>CNPs.

01:11:39.739 --> 01:11:41.260
<v Speaker 6>CNP, CNPs.

01:11:42.699 --> 01:11:45.739
<v Speaker 6>The range. Oh, wonderful. How about we just,

01:11:45.739 --> 01:11:47.500
<v Speaker 6>you know, nuke that? Nobody needs a net

01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:50.125
<v Speaker 6>limit range. Called unlimited, though. Clearly, that's a

01:11:50.125 --> 01:11:50.765
<v Speaker 0>good one.

01:11:57.005 --> 01:11:57.645
<v Speaker 6>Unlimited.

01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:03.280
<v Speaker 6>Look at it. Oh, thank you. You guys

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:04.800
<v Speaker 6>are so wonderful.

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.560
<v Speaker 0>I can't believe the name lies. It was

01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:07.920
<v Speaker 1>more than that.

01:12:13.855 --> 01:12:16.334
<v Speaker 0>Wow. Two level ranges and two clusters.

01:12:16.974 --> 01:12:17.774
<v Speaker 6>No.

01:12:18.574 --> 01:12:19.934
<v Speaker 6>That's

01:12:23.935 --> 01:12:25.294
<v Speaker 7>Webhooks.

01:12:25.935 --> 01:12:26.895
<v Speaker 6>Webhooks. Yeah.

01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:29.379
<v Speaker 6>None of those.

01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:31.219
<v Speaker 6>None of those.

01:12:32.579 --> 01:12:35.300
<v Speaker 6>Resource quotas net polls. K.

01:12:37.619 --> 01:12:38.579
<v Speaker 6>That's all looking

01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:40.500
<v Speaker 6>all the pods are running.

01:12:41.284 --> 01:12:41.764
<v Speaker 6>So

01:12:42.085 --> 01:12:44.244
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. Let's check the services,

01:12:45.205 --> 01:12:47.364
<v Speaker 4>objects too in the default namespace.

01:12:48.085 --> 01:12:49.044
<v Speaker 4>I also saw

01:12:51.205 --> 01:12:52.405
<v Speaker 4>something interesting,

01:12:52.645 --> 01:12:54.965
<v Speaker 4>like, the port is six six seven instead

01:12:54.965 --> 01:12:57.080
<v Speaker 4>of six six six.

01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:58.840
<v Speaker 6>Better than that.

01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:01.719
<v Speaker 0>Table. Must have been accidental.

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:03.159
<v Speaker 5>Yes.

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:07.639
<v Speaker 6>K.

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:10.120
<v Speaker 6>So we know that's Let's confirm that,

01:13:10.725 --> 01:13:13.605
<v Speaker 4>yeah, let's first let's first confirm that our

01:13:13.605 --> 01:13:15.925
<v Speaker 4>deployment is listening on 666.

01:13:16.885 --> 01:13:19.124
<v Speaker 5>Yeah. It should be the same one as

01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:27.640
<v Speaker 4>Normally, but who knows what Zapier team prepared

01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:28.280
<v Speaker 4>us.

01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:31.640
<v Speaker 7>Yeah. It it is there.

01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:33.400
<v Speaker 7>Should we update it?

01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:37.320
<v Speaker 6>Let's change this. Yeah. The server should be

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:38.040
<v Speaker 5>666.

01:13:39.034 --> 01:13:41.355
<v Speaker 6>But it's confirmed it is listening on 666

01:13:41.355 --> 01:13:42.795
<v Speaker 6>inside of the

01:13:43.275 --> 01:13:44.155
<v Speaker 6>pod.

01:13:44.875 --> 01:13:45.594
<v Speaker 6>K.

01:13:45.915 --> 01:13:46.554
<v Speaker 6>So

01:13:48.155 --> 01:13:50.554
<v Speaker 6>that part should be looking good. Now let's

01:13:50.554 --> 01:13:50.955
<v Speaker 6>see.

01:13:55.010 --> 01:13:56.450
<v Speaker 6>Okay. So the last thing we got, though,

01:13:56.450 --> 01:13:58.050
<v Speaker 6>was failed to connect database. So there might

01:13:58.050 --> 01:13:58.770
<v Speaker 6>be some

01:13:59.170 --> 01:14:00.050
<v Speaker 6>interesting

01:14:00.450 --> 01:14:03.330
<v Speaker 6>name or not known. Okay. Well,

01:14:03.650 --> 01:14:06.050
<v Speaker 6>let's then get our deployment

01:14:06.815 --> 01:14:10.014
<v Speaker 6>and look at that and see what our

01:14:11.855 --> 01:14:13.775
<v Speaker 6>DNS config is.

01:14:16.494 --> 01:14:18.014
<v Speaker 6>Edit this so people can

01:14:18.574 --> 01:14:19.534
<v Speaker 6>scroll with me here.

01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:24.630
<v Speaker 6>That's her first. Okay.

01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:28.630
<v Speaker 6>Might as well change the we

01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:30.790
<v Speaker 5>might as well change the image while we're

01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:31.110
<v Speaker 1>at it.

01:14:39.415 --> 01:14:41.735
<v Speaker 6>Here's that image. I just wanna avoid DNS

01:14:41.735 --> 01:14:42.614
<v Speaker 6>entirely.

01:14:42.615 --> 01:14:44.695
<v Speaker 6>Do you know remember what the the other

01:14:44.695 --> 01:14:45.574
<v Speaker 6>values are

01:14:46.695 --> 01:14:48.935
<v Speaker 6>for this so we don't have to use

01:14:48.935 --> 01:14:50.840
<v Speaker 6>cluster first? Because, I mean, we can go

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:52.360
<v Speaker 6>look at the the worker node and see

01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:54.360
<v Speaker 6>what its DNS policy is set to.

01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:57.960
<v Speaker 5>Let me Google it real quick.

01:15:04.225 --> 01:15:07.665
<v Speaker 0>K. Just for the records, Rust application

01:15:07.745 --> 01:15:10.224
<v Speaker 0>has a hard coded lookup of Postgres.

01:15:12.865 --> 01:15:15.025
<v Speaker 0>So a a well a well need cluster

01:15:15.025 --> 01:15:15.425
<v Speaker 0>DNS.

01:15:16.490 --> 01:15:17.290
<v Speaker 6>K.

01:15:17.610 --> 01:15:19.370
<v Speaker 6>So I found a limit in here. We

01:15:19.370 --> 01:15:20.330
<v Speaker 6>don't need that.

01:15:20.650 --> 01:15:23.130
<v Speaker 6>We have plenty of resources available.

01:15:23.370 --> 01:15:25.210
<v Speaker 6>It's the only app on the cluster.

01:15:26.730 --> 01:15:27.450
<v Speaker 6>So

01:15:28.010 --> 01:15:28.810
<v Speaker 6>let's see.

01:15:32.824 --> 01:15:35.465
<v Speaker 6>You know, it's interesting. So not We we

01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:37.144
<v Speaker 5>could just look at the

01:15:38.025 --> 01:15:39.625
<v Speaker 5>like, what we were messing around with on

01:15:39.625 --> 01:15:40.344
<v Speaker 1>the worker.

01:15:40.745 --> 01:15:42.744
<v Speaker 5>Check the the cubelets

01:15:42.905 --> 01:15:43.304
<v Speaker 5>config.

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:46.640
<v Speaker 6>I'll put this back to your cluster first.

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:47.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:49.840
<v Speaker 5>Cluster first with host net is the other

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:51.120
<v Speaker 5>one you were thinking of.

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.840
<v Speaker 5>K. But I don't think we need that.

01:15:58.725 --> 01:15:59.445
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

01:16:09.925 --> 01:16:12.005
<v Speaker 0>Six six six and then next.

01:16:14.190 --> 01:16:16.750
<v Speaker 6>K. Build lookup still. So let's go look

01:16:16.750 --> 01:16:18.670
<v Speaker 6>at on

01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:21.710
<v Speaker 6>this host on these.

01:16:23.310 --> 01:16:25.630
<v Speaker 6>It might have messed with config.

01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:28.110
<v Speaker 6>Is that a config map here?

01:16:30.075 --> 01:16:30.954
<v Speaker 5>Yes.

01:16:31.995 --> 01:16:34.474
<v Speaker 5>K. Or at least usually is.

01:16:35.915 --> 01:16:37.355
<v Speaker 6>K. So we're seeing

01:16:38.395 --> 01:16:39.355
<v Speaker 6>health.

01:16:42.075 --> 01:16:43.595
<v Speaker 6>Is that not an r?

01:16:45.030 --> 01:16:46.790
<v Speaker 0>Doesn't look like an r, does it?

01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:48.630
<v Speaker 6>No. It doesn't.

01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:51.110
<v Speaker 6>Let's go play with that.

01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:53.670
<v Speaker 6>That's

01:16:54.230 --> 01:16:56.950
<v Speaker 6>fun little typo. That's breaking an unofficial custard

01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:58.710
<v Speaker 0>rule of no unique with characters.

01:17:00.145 --> 01:17:02.305
<v Speaker 0>Naughty naughty team. Naughty team.

01:17:04.705 --> 01:17:06.945
<v Speaker 6>K. Forwarding that to resolve conf as it's

01:17:06.945 --> 01:17:07.745
<v Speaker 6>upstream.

01:17:08.465 --> 01:17:10.225
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if this Prometheus is necessary

01:17:10.225 --> 01:17:12.225
<v Speaker 6>in here. There's obviously not on this cluster,

01:17:12.225 --> 01:17:14.040
<v Speaker 6>but that might just be something default. I

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:15.880
<v Speaker 6>don't think it should mess with the filter

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:16.679
<v Speaker 6>pane of.

01:17:17.559 --> 01:17:18.599
<v Speaker 6>So let's

01:17:18.679 --> 01:17:21.159
<v Speaker 6>let's do that. And I know that will

01:17:21.159 --> 01:17:22.760
<v Speaker 6>live reload, but

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:26.439
<v Speaker 6>And we should also check the

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:28.599
<v Speaker 4>the result comp file.

01:17:30.105 --> 01:17:30.824
<v Speaker 4>Yes.

01:17:34.025 --> 01:17:36.664
<v Speaker 0>That is very polite using a rollout restart.

01:17:39.385 --> 01:17:42.184
<v Speaker 6>That is five years of

01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:43.270
<v Speaker 6>a whole lot of other tenants on our

01:17:43.270 --> 01:17:44.790
<v Speaker 6>clusters. Could have at least added a wee

01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:46.550
<v Speaker 0>message just to log why you were restarting

01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:47.350
<v Speaker 0>it as well.

01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:52.470
<v Speaker 6>Yeah. If you don't know, at Adobe, Kubernetes,

01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:54.790
<v Speaker 6>we are a we're ethos team. We are

01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:56.310
<v Speaker 6>a platform team for all of Adobe.

01:17:57.045 --> 01:17:58.085
<v Speaker 6>So we

01:17:58.405 --> 01:18:00.005
<v Speaker 6>there are certain things that are baked into

01:18:00.005 --> 01:18:01.525
<v Speaker 6>our how we do things.

01:18:02.325 --> 01:18:03.845
<v Speaker 0>I I think those are good good things

01:18:03.845 --> 01:18:04.965
<v Speaker 0>to be baked in.

01:18:07.445 --> 01:18:10.645
<v Speaker 6>So I'm gonna go actually, we can

01:18:11.045 --> 01:18:12.805
<v Speaker 6>we can just do this from local hosts.

01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:16.939
<v Speaker 5>Yeah. We're still getting DNS issues.

01:18:17.739 --> 01:18:18.379
<v Speaker 6>Okay.

01:18:19.739 --> 01:18:20.379
<v Speaker 6>So

01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:23.340
<v Speaker 6>DNS. It's the wonderful thing that it's gonna

01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:24.860
<v Speaker 6>be broken even when you don't think it's

01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:25.099
<v Speaker 6>broken.

01:18:25.665 --> 01:18:27.665
<v Speaker 6>So let's go look at

01:18:29.265 --> 01:18:31.744
<v Speaker 6>let's look at ic.com on this host.

01:18:32.385 --> 01:18:34.145
<v Speaker 6>K. It says pointing to resolve

01:18:35.185 --> 01:18:35.985
<v Speaker 6>the

01:18:38.945 --> 01:18:40.065
<v Speaker 6>DNS server,

01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:42.440
<v Speaker 6>a 14775

01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:43.160
<v Speaker 6>address.

01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:46.040
<v Speaker 6>David, what is DNS supposed to be set

01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:47.320
<v Speaker 6>to on these hosts?

01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:51.880
<v Speaker 0>That is an Equinix IP, so I think

01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:52.360
<v Speaker 0>they're okay.

01:18:53.824 --> 01:18:54.784
<v Speaker 6>14700

01:18:54.784 --> 01:18:55.985
<v Speaker 6>out of this? Yes.

01:18:56.945 --> 01:18:57.824
<v Speaker 1>Let's check the

01:19:00.705 --> 01:19:02.304
<v Speaker 5>Let's check the bar list.

01:19:03.264 --> 01:19:04.385
<v Speaker 0>14775

01:19:04.385 --> 01:19:06.465
<v Speaker 0>is an Equinix IP, which will be the

01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:09.170
<v Speaker 0>which as the region for this cluster, you'll

01:19:09.170 --> 01:19:11.090
<v Speaker 0>be hitting our local DNS server.

01:19:12.290 --> 01:19:14.530
<v Speaker 6>Yeah. Okay. So 14775

01:19:14.530 --> 01:19:14.610
<v Speaker 6>is

01:19:15.810 --> 01:19:17.570
<v Speaker 5>At farlibkubeletconfig.

01:19:20.025 --> 01:19:20.985
<v Speaker 6>Look at it.

01:19:21.465 --> 01:19:23.305
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. There's some interest in DNS settings on

01:19:23.305 --> 01:19:24.505
<v Speaker 0>there. That's a good idea.

01:19:27.145 --> 01:19:28.665
<v Speaker 1>That should be config.YAML,

01:19:28.665 --> 01:19:28.985
<v Speaker 1>I believe.

01:19:31.650 --> 01:19:32.610
<v Speaker 6>That's

01:19:32.610 --> 01:19:34.610
<v Speaker 6>126010?

01:19:35.650 --> 01:19:36.690
<v Speaker 0>That is correct.

01:19:38.370 --> 01:19:40.929
<v Speaker 5>Then what's the service? Is the service set

01:19:40.929 --> 01:19:41.330
<v Speaker 5>to that?

01:19:44.795 --> 01:19:45.434
<v Speaker 6>The

01:19:46.395 --> 01:19:47.834
<v Speaker 6>you're saying the Kate service?

01:19:48.235 --> 01:19:48.874
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.

01:19:50.875 --> 01:19:52.235
<v Speaker 6>So, yeah, so the it is set to

01:19:52.235 --> 01:19:54.235
<v Speaker 6>that. I confirmed it just above system.

01:19:54.795 --> 01:19:55.994
<v Speaker 5>Okay. Can we

01:19:56.395 --> 01:19:57.755
<v Speaker 5>hop over to one of the workers?

01:19:59.139 --> 01:20:00.739
<v Speaker 6>Actually, I wanna look at that file.

01:20:02.579 --> 01:20:03.539
<v Speaker 6>Me look at that

01:20:05.059 --> 01:20:05.699
<v Speaker 6>search

01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:07.619
<v Speaker 6>object really quick just to make sure nothing

01:20:07.619 --> 01:20:09.380
<v Speaker 6>is messed up in there. I have also

01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:11.699
<v Speaker 0>opened a session on Zapier worker one if

01:20:11.699 --> 01:20:13.460
<v Speaker 0>you wanna join that session too.

01:20:15.225 --> 01:20:17.305
<v Speaker 5>Yeah. While Jake's looking at the other thing,

01:20:17.305 --> 01:20:18.905
<v Speaker 5>I'll hop over to that and

01:20:22.185 --> 01:20:24.185
<v Speaker 1>Zapier worker

01:20:25.865 --> 01:20:26.345
<v Speaker 1>one.

01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:32.220
<v Speaker 6>K. I'm I'm just going to exec into

01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:34.060
<v Speaker 6>just describe what I'm doing. I'm gonna exec

01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:36.860
<v Speaker 6>into the pod and try DNS queries and

01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:37.420
<v Speaker 6>see what happens.

01:20:47.255 --> 01:20:49.575
<v Speaker 5>The cluster DNS in the config is fine,

01:20:49.575 --> 01:20:50.054
<v Speaker 5>but

01:20:50.935 --> 01:20:53.175
<v Speaker 5>there is that live reload that could happen

01:20:53.175 --> 01:20:54.855
<v Speaker 5>with the config file on cluster.

01:21:05.099 --> 01:21:07.420
<v Speaker 0>You can do an app install DNS utils,

01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:09.099
<v Speaker 0>I think, if you need access to take

01:21:11.175 --> 01:21:13.094
<v Speaker 1>I was I wasn't I was actually just

01:21:13.094 --> 01:21:15.974
<v Speaker 6>gonna skip it because curl did it correctly.

01:21:16.375 --> 01:21:19.735
<v Speaker 6>But what we should do is dig postgres.

01:21:20.695 --> 01:21:22.454
<v Speaker 6>What is the It doesn't resolve.

01:21:24.490 --> 01:21:26.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. What is it supposed to be, though?

01:21:26.090 --> 01:21:26.970
<v Speaker 0>Postgres

01:21:26.970 --> 01:21:27.770
<v Speaker 0>dot

01:21:28.650 --> 01:21:31.449
<v Speaker 0>default DotService dot Cluster dot local.

01:21:37.130 --> 01:21:38.410
<v Speaker 6>K. So

01:21:39.784 --> 01:21:41.465
<v Speaker 0>Does it work for Kubernetes?

01:21:45.465 --> 01:21:47.304
<v Speaker 6>If you dig against the

01:21:47.545 --> 01:21:49.304
<v Speaker 0>I mean, if you do it yeah. If

01:21:49.304 --> 01:21:50.665
<v Speaker 0>you jump back into that container and try

01:21:50.665 --> 01:21:52.985
<v Speaker 0>to get the Kubernetes.default.service

01:21:52.985 --> 01:21:54.344
<v Speaker 0>dot local, does that resolve?

01:21:58.389 --> 01:21:59.510
<v Speaker 6>And use

01:22:04.150 --> 01:22:06.469
<v Speaker 1>Cluster Never remember what the actual DNS name

01:22:06.469 --> 01:22:08.949
<v Speaker 6>is, so I'm not positive. Actually If cluster

01:22:08.949 --> 01:22:09.429
<v Speaker 0>dot local.

01:22:11.635 --> 01:22:13.075
<v Speaker 6>Oh, okay. Sorry. The

01:22:13.795 --> 01:22:15.875
<v Speaker 0>I mean, n dot should mean oh, service

01:22:15.875 --> 01:22:17.315
<v Speaker 0>dot customer dot local. But you should be

01:22:17.315 --> 01:22:18.995
<v Speaker 0>able to detect Kubernetes on this one as

01:22:18.995 --> 01:22:19.395
<v Speaker 0>well.

01:22:20.515 --> 01:22:22.515
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So it's it's not resolved. I'm wondering

01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:25.389
<v Speaker 1>I'm wondering if they

01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:29.310
<v Speaker 6>removed in the cluster the Kubernetes config if

01:22:29.310 --> 01:22:31.469
<v Speaker 6>they removed the service

01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:32.590
<v Speaker 6>pieces.

01:22:32.670 --> 01:22:33.630
<v Speaker 0>We got eight minutes.

01:22:47.195 --> 01:22:48.554
<v Speaker 6>It got changed back.

01:22:49.515 --> 01:22:50.395
<v Speaker 6>What's up with that?

01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:53.619
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting.

01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:54.820
<v Speaker 0>That's sneaky.

01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:59.140
<v Speaker 4>They're keeping you back. A a job or

01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:00.739
<v Speaker 4>a cron job. So

01:23:02.260 --> 01:23:03.460
<v Speaker 6>Yeah. That

01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:05.300
<v Speaker 0>was a bit fast to a cron job,

01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:05.780
<v Speaker 0>but maybe.

01:23:13.815 --> 01:23:15.735
<v Speaker 6>K. None of those. But what we can

01:23:15.735 --> 01:23:18.055
<v Speaker 6>do is just reconfigure it, create our own

01:23:18.055 --> 01:23:18.775
<v Speaker 6>config map.

01:23:22.519 --> 01:23:24.119
<v Speaker 6>That's all of that. Or maybe there is

01:23:24.119 --> 01:23:27.880
<v Speaker 4>a a crumbly a crumbly job running at

01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:29.559
<v Speaker 4>the. There

01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:31.079
<v Speaker 6>definitely could be a crumb job on the

01:23:31.079 --> 01:23:32.920
<v Speaker 6>host itself, but we only have seven minutes.

01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:35.000
<v Speaker 6>So I'm just going to copy this really

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:35.239
<v Speaker 6>quick.

01:23:47.745 --> 01:23:49.264
<v Speaker 6>Let's see. I need to be able to

01:23:49.264 --> 01:23:50.784
<v Speaker 6>create

01:23:53.699 --> 01:23:55.619
<v Speaker 6>Okay. So I can

01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:03.619
<v Speaker 6>the profile look okay?

01:24:04.975 --> 01:24:05.535
<v Speaker 6>Just

01:24:06.015 --> 01:24:08.095
<v Speaker 0>It does. You fixed the r? I need

01:24:08.095 --> 01:24:09.375
<v Speaker 6>to change I need to change the name

01:24:09.375 --> 01:24:10.015
<v Speaker 6>to something else.

01:24:26.949 --> 01:24:27.989
<v Speaker 1>It was there.

01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:31.429
<v Speaker 6>It's better to deploy.

01:24:34.655 --> 01:24:36.895
<v Speaker 7>Using the IP seems to be working.

01:24:38.335 --> 01:24:40.094
<v Speaker 7>Maybe it's just a DNS now.

01:24:42.575 --> 01:24:43.535
<v Speaker 6>Where is my volume?

01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:53.079
<v Speaker 6>Oh, terminal is getting messed up.

01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:57.000
<v Speaker 6>Where's the volume

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.120
<v Speaker 6>from config map there?

01:25:03.325 --> 01:25:05.565
<v Speaker 1>K.

01:25:13.965 --> 01:25:14.445
<v Speaker 6>K.

01:25:15.645 --> 01:25:16.525
<v Speaker 6>Let's see what you got.

01:25:20.130 --> 01:25:21.570
<v Speaker 5>Hey. Hey, Rawkode.

01:25:26.290 --> 01:25:28.290
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's working. Up your limits.

01:25:29.010 --> 01:25:29.970
<v Speaker 6>Is that what we needed?

01:25:30.925 --> 01:25:32.525
<v Speaker 0>I believe so. I'm gonna try and have

01:25:32.525 --> 01:25:33.805
<v Speaker 0>it anyway. So

01:25:35.165 --> 01:25:36.605
<v Speaker 7>Yeah. It looks working.

01:25:40.765 --> 01:25:42.125
<v Speaker 0>You got the Thanos. Hey.

01:25:42.685 --> 01:25:45.325
<v Speaker 5>Welcome to the one. That's awesome.

01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:48.099
<v Speaker 0>Well Well done. Your team. I don't know

01:25:48.099 --> 01:25:49.300
<v Speaker 3>what was changing that.

01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:52.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what was changing that the

01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:53.300
<v Speaker 6>DreamUp file.

01:25:53.699 --> 01:25:54.659
<v Speaker 6>So was fun.

01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:56.500
<v Speaker 0>Well, we never change our current jobs on

01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:57.219
<v Speaker 0>the host,

01:25:57.460 --> 01:25:58.099
<v Speaker 0>and

01:25:58.739 --> 01:26:00.659
<v Speaker 0>I guess that could have been one way.

01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:01.059
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:26:01.695 --> 01:26:03.855
<v Speaker 0>If it changes so fast, there's something I

01:26:03.855 --> 01:26:05.534
<v Speaker 0>think it was something in cluster.

01:26:06.255 --> 01:26:07.454
<v Speaker 0>I I'm not sure.

01:26:07.935 --> 01:26:09.215
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure what. Maybe they'll drop it

01:26:09.215 --> 01:26:11.054
