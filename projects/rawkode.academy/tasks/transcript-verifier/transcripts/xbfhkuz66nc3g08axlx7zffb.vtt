00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.509
<v Speaker 0>Hello and welcome to today's episode of Rawkode

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.735
<v Speaker 0>live. I'm your host Rawkode.

00:01:27.975 --> 00:01:30.295
<v Speaker 0>Today, we are taking a look at Snyk,

00:01:30.295 --> 00:01:32.215
<v Speaker 0>a set of tools to help you develop

00:01:32.215 --> 00:01:33.655
<v Speaker 0>fast and stay secure.

00:01:33.975 --> 00:01:35.495
<v Speaker 0>Before we begin, there's just a little bit

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:38.135
<v Speaker 0>of housekeeping. If you're not already subscribed to

00:01:38.135 --> 00:01:39.815
<v Speaker 0>the YouTube, I would encourage you to do

00:01:39.815 --> 00:01:40.215
<v Speaker 0>so now.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.619
<v Speaker 0>Click the subscribe button, tick that bell, and

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.380
<v Speaker 0>you will get notifications for all the new

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.939
<v Speaker 0>episodes of Rawkode Live at the Rawkode Academy.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.780
<v Speaker 0>We will do our best to provide the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.180
<v Speaker 0>best cloud native resources across the vast cloud

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.740
<v Speaker 0>native landscape. It's scary to not walk the

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:54.140
<v Speaker 0>path alone.

00:01:55.055 --> 00:01:56.415
<v Speaker 0>Also, if you wanna be able to chat

00:01:56.415 --> 00:01:58.494
<v Speaker 0>afterwards or even just now, jump into the

00:01:58.494 --> 00:02:00.095
<v Speaker 0>Discord at Rawkode.chat.

00:02:00.095 --> 00:02:02.095
<v Speaker 0>We've got over 400 members there talking all

00:02:02.095 --> 00:02:04.575
<v Speaker 0>things cloud native, security, Kubernetes,

00:02:04.655 --> 00:02:06.575
<v Speaker 0>and even rock music. Very cool.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.380
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Now to catch us on our Snyk

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.140
<v Speaker 0>joining us today, I am joined

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.860
<v Speaker 0>by Matt Jarvis. Hey, How are you?

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.140
<v Speaker 1>Hey, David. I'm good. I'm hot here. I

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.500
<v Speaker 1>don't know what it's like in Scotland at

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.500
<v Speaker 1>the minute, in the Lake District it's boiling.

00:02:20.825 --> 00:02:23.385
<v Speaker 0>You know what? It has been rather hot

00:02:23.385 --> 00:02:25.705
<v Speaker 0>the last few days, which I know a

00:02:25.705 --> 00:02:27.065
<v Speaker 0>lot of people say is a good problem

00:02:27.065 --> 00:02:28.985
<v Speaker 0>to have, but when you don't have AC,

00:02:28.985 --> 00:02:31.145
<v Speaker 0>it gets pretty toasty in the house. Right?

00:02:31.784 --> 00:02:33.705
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. We're not quite out to Portland kind

00:02:33.705 --> 00:02:35.560
<v Speaker 1>of temperatures at the minute. True. Yeah. You

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.080
<v Speaker 1>know what it's like though in the North,

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.160
<v Speaker 1>like if it gets above about 12 degrees,

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.000
<v Speaker 1>it's like, well, this is shorts weather.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.520
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm unlucky or lucky

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.920
<v Speaker 0>to have a window right here and anything

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.625
<v Speaker 0>above 12 degrees and it's called Tataph in

00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:50.745
<v Speaker 0>Scotland where

00:02:50.984 --> 00:02:52.665
<v Speaker 0>all of our local youths like to rip

00:02:52.665 --> 00:02:54.584
<v Speaker 0>off their tops and walk around Shirtland which

00:02:54.584 --> 00:02:56.105
<v Speaker 0>is Quality.

00:02:56.185 --> 00:02:57.625
<v Speaker 0>Wonderful. Yeah.

00:02:58.665 --> 00:03:00.985
<v Speaker 0>But yeah, definitely been enjoying the weather.

00:03:02.424 --> 00:03:04.025
<v Speaker 0>It's been a nice change for Scotland.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.120
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, thanks for joining me today. I'm

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.440
<v Speaker 0>excited. Do you wanna for anyone that's not

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.600
<v Speaker 0>familiar with you, give us the the TLDR

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.040
<v Speaker 0>on you and tell us a little bit

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.040
<v Speaker 0>about you. Sure. So so

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah. I'm

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.360
<v Speaker 1>a senior developer advocate at Snyk.

00:03:21.645 --> 00:03:22.205
<v Speaker 1>So

00:03:23.165 --> 00:03:24.925
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure a lot of folks will be

00:03:24.925 --> 00:03:27.005
<v Speaker 1>familiar with what developer advocates do, but we

00:03:27.005 --> 00:03:29.165
<v Speaker 1>spend most of our time going around and

00:03:29.165 --> 00:03:32.205
<v Speaker 1>talking to people about technology. Right? And waving

00:03:32.205 --> 00:03:33.245
<v Speaker 1>our hands a lot. And

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.700
<v Speaker 1>so

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.579
<v Speaker 1>I've kind of been around the cloud native

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.819
<v Speaker 1>space for a pretty long time, I guess,

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.459
<v Speaker 1>kind of five, six years. And before that,

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 1>I was in OpenStack, you know, around the

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.540
<v Speaker 1>OpenStack community. So been doing a lot of

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 1>stuff with a lot of clouds for a

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.260
<v Speaker 1>lot of time. So

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:49.739
<v Speaker 1>yeah.

00:03:50.915 --> 00:03:51.715
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:03:52.355 --> 00:03:52.995
<v Speaker 0>Well,

00:03:53.155 --> 00:03:56.515
<v Speaker 0>you've already said it now, it's Snyk. The

00:03:56.515 --> 00:03:58.275
<v Speaker 0>pronunciation is something that always threw me at

00:03:58.275 --> 00:03:59.635
<v Speaker 0>the start and I think that was actually

00:03:59.635 --> 00:04:01.315
<v Speaker 0>maybe watching one of your talks where I

00:04:01.315 --> 00:04:03.155
<v Speaker 0>fairly clicked. Was like, oh, that makes so

00:04:03.155 --> 00:04:04.930
<v Speaker 0>much sense. Why have I been saying Snyk

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.090
<v Speaker 0>all this time? So Well, it doesn't help

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.410
<v Speaker 1>that there are various people in inside Snyk

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.650
<v Speaker 1>who pronounce it differently as well, but

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.489
<v Speaker 1>the official pronunciation is Snyk. Yeah. And for

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.570
<v Speaker 0>a security company, when that penny drops, you're

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.245
<v Speaker 0>like, that's a really name. I'm like, I

00:04:19.245 --> 00:04:21.165
<v Speaker 0>get it now. So I like it. Yeah.

00:04:21.165 --> 00:04:23.725
<v Speaker 1>It's actually an acronym for so now you

00:04:23.725 --> 00:04:24.285
<v Speaker 1>know.

00:04:25.085 --> 00:04:27.405
<v Speaker 1>Really? It's kinda where it came from. Yeah.

00:04:27.565 --> 00:04:29.805
<v Speaker 0>Okay. That I did not know. So there's

00:04:29.805 --> 00:04:31.805
<v Speaker 0>the first knowledge bomb already. What are we?

00:04:31.805 --> 00:04:33.085
<v Speaker 0>One one and a half minutes to imagine.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.640
<v Speaker 0>Do you wanna then

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.360
<v Speaker 0>if our audience, let's assume they're not familiar

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.960
<v Speaker 0>with Snyk and the set of tools that

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.080
<v Speaker 0>they offer. Do you wanna give us the

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.080
<v Speaker 0>high level overview and then we'll jump into

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.160
<v Speaker 0>the hands on component of our show? Yeah.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.920
<v Speaker 1>Of course. So Snyk

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.120
<v Speaker 1>are a

00:04:49.255 --> 00:04:51.735
<v Speaker 1>security company, but, you know, kind of a

00:04:51.735 --> 00:04:54.615
<v Speaker 1>new kind of security company. You know, we're

00:04:54.615 --> 00:04:57.015
<v Speaker 1>really focused on developer

00:04:57.015 --> 00:04:58.615
<v Speaker 1>first security

00:04:58.935 --> 00:04:59.655
<v Speaker 1>and

00:05:00.455 --> 00:05:04.340
<v Speaker 1>on building a kind of cloud native platform

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.500
<v Speaker 1>for for for security

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.220
<v Speaker 1>in

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.900
<v Speaker 1>the modern world.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.220
<v Speaker 1>And so we have

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.020
<v Speaker 1>a set of tools that kind of all

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.780
<v Speaker 1>work together that do everything from

00:05:18.445 --> 00:05:21.645
<v Speaker 1>software composition analysis. So where you look at

00:05:26.044 --> 00:05:28.445
<v Speaker 1>software where you're using open source modules, open

00:05:28.445 --> 00:05:30.604
<v Speaker 1>source packages, and look for vulnerabilities in those

00:05:30.604 --> 00:05:31.324
<v Speaker 1>packages

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.510
<v Speaker 1>through to container image scanning,

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:35.710
<v Speaker 1>through to

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.230
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure code, so things like Terraform and and

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.590
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes YAML.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:42.190
<v Speaker 1>And then

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.510
<v Speaker 1>we also have just released a product called

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.150
<v Speaker 1>Snykode,

00:05:47.605 --> 00:05:48.965
<v Speaker 1>which does

00:05:50.165 --> 00:05:53.445
<v Speaker 1>static application security testing. So looking at homegrown

00:05:53.445 --> 00:05:55.445
<v Speaker 1>code that you've written and looking for

00:05:58.805 --> 00:06:01.205
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable pathways in in that code.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.910
<v Speaker 1>And

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.910
<v Speaker 1>but the all of these tools are really

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:05.790
<v Speaker 1>aimed at

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.070
<v Speaker 1>at developers using them. And I think that's

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.230
<v Speaker 1>what one of the fundamental things has changed

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:12.350
<v Speaker 1>in terms of

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.190
<v Speaker 1>of of security,

00:06:15.485 --> 00:06:17.645
<v Speaker 1>you know, over the last few years is,

00:06:17.645 --> 00:06:19.725
<v Speaker 1>you know, we've got these these two kind

00:06:19.725 --> 00:06:21.805
<v Speaker 1>of things going on. The first is that,

00:06:21.805 --> 00:06:23.965
<v Speaker 1>you know, the the the velocity that we're

00:06:23.965 --> 00:06:26.605
<v Speaker 1>deploying software at is is dramatically

00:06:26.605 --> 00:06:28.605
<v Speaker 1>increased. Right? I mean, when I started out,

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.710
<v Speaker 1>you know, you the aim in in in

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:32.350
<v Speaker 1>most

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.390
<v Speaker 1>kind of IT environments was to deploy things

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.590
<v Speaker 1>as as as little as possible. Right? Just

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:39.950
<v Speaker 1>don't change anything.

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:41.150
<v Speaker 1>And

00:06:41.435 --> 00:06:43.675
<v Speaker 1>and now we're really all about speed and

00:06:43.675 --> 00:06:45.915
<v Speaker 1>deploying things super fast. So Yeah. You know,

00:06:45.915 --> 00:06:47.915
<v Speaker 1>you can't you can no longer have this

00:06:47.915 --> 00:06:49.755
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing where you stick security at

00:06:49.755 --> 00:06:51.595
<v Speaker 1>the end and say, you know, here's this

00:06:51.595 --> 00:06:54.235
<v Speaker 1>final step that we're gonna do before we

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.010
<v Speaker 1>deploy something to production because, ideally, you wanna

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.690
<v Speaker 1>be deployed to production all the time.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.330
<v Speaker 1>And then I suppose the second big thing

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.050
<v Speaker 1>that's driving these changes in security is the

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.690
<v Speaker 1>fact that developers are responsible for much more

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.530
<v Speaker 1>of the stack than they than they used

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:08.810
<v Speaker 1>to be. You know, if we look at

00:07:09.315 --> 00:07:11.155
<v Speaker 1>I mean, you know, you may as well

00:07:11.155 --> 00:07:13.475
<v Speaker 1>consider the container and your application the same

00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:15.555
<v Speaker 1>thing. Right? Because when do you ever deploy

00:07:15.555 --> 00:07:16.515
<v Speaker 1>the application

00:07:16.595 --> 00:07:19.315
<v Speaker 1>outside of the container? You know, never.

00:07:19.475 --> 00:07:21.315
<v Speaker 1>And quite often, it's the same team building

00:07:21.315 --> 00:07:24.400
<v Speaker 1>the container image that might even be creating

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.200
<v Speaker 1>the Kubernetes YAML to deploy it into Kubernetes.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.120
<v Speaker 1>And, you know, all that stuff used to

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.440
<v Speaker 1>be some other team's, you know, kind of

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.480
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.800
<v Speaker 1>And so, you know, when we consider those

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.680
<v Speaker 1>two things together,

00:07:36.275 --> 00:07:38.275
<v Speaker 1>you kinda need to have a look at

00:07:38.275 --> 00:07:40.755
<v Speaker 1>security in a different way because, you know,

00:07:40.755 --> 00:07:42.755
<v Speaker 1>developers are really the people who need to

00:07:42.755 --> 00:07:43.235
<v Speaker 1>be

00:07:45.075 --> 00:07:48.479
<v Speaker 1>aware of the implications of of of the

00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:50.479
<v Speaker 1>stuff that they're doing in in all of

00:07:50.479 --> 00:07:53.199
<v Speaker 1>those spaces. So that's the kind of 10,000

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:54.720
<v Speaker 1>foot view, I guess. And I I think

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.120
<v Speaker 1>we'll probably get discuss this a bit more

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.240
<v Speaker 1>as we kind of explore how Snyk works

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.280
<v Speaker 1>and and,

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.795
<v Speaker 1>you know, how it's how it you'll see

00:08:03.795 --> 00:08:05.475
<v Speaker 1>what the focus is when you look at

00:08:05.475 --> 00:08:05.955
<v Speaker 1>it.

00:08:06.915 --> 00:08:09.635
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Definitely. I think there's some really great

00:08:09.635 --> 00:08:11.715
<v Speaker 0>points in there. And, it kinda made me

00:08:11.715 --> 00:08:13.155
<v Speaker 0>pause for thought for a minute, I was

00:08:13.155 --> 00:08:15.155
<v Speaker 0>thinking back about my career and all that

00:08:15.155 --> 00:08:16.755
<v Speaker 0>code that I've shipped to production.

00:08:16.995 --> 00:08:18.180
<v Speaker 0>And if you'd asked me if it was

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.860
<v Speaker 0>secure, the answer would be I

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.180
<v Speaker 0>don't know. I don't think I've ever really

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.580
<v Speaker 0>considered that with the code that I write.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.260
<v Speaker 0>I mean, if I if I had I

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.700
<v Speaker 0>mean, if I think back to ten years,

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.140
<v Speaker 0>and I'm gonna try and correlate this to

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:30.820
<v Speaker 0>what you said about the way that things

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.340
<v Speaker 0>have changed lately is that

00:08:32.825 --> 00:08:34.345
<v Speaker 0>ten years ago if I was shutting something

00:08:34.345 --> 00:08:35.544
<v Speaker 0>to production, I would write it in a

00:08:35.544 --> 00:08:37.784
<v Speaker 0>single language, you know, would have been PHP

00:08:37.784 --> 00:08:40.424
<v Speaker 0>or Perl or whatever. There's no single framework.

00:08:40.424 --> 00:08:42.505
<v Speaker 0>It'd be a monolithic application. I would deploy

00:08:42.505 --> 00:08:44.025
<v Speaker 0>it once every three months probably.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.520
<v Speaker 0>And if I was working for a company

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.000
<v Speaker 0>that was particularly risk averse, we'd maybe get

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:49.720
<v Speaker 0>an audit

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.040
<v Speaker 0>every other year or something like that.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.800
<v Speaker 0>And that was And they do they do

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.480
<v Speaker 1>a scan of the yeah. Yeah. Exactly. I

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.404
<v Speaker 1>mean, was the same same for me. But

00:08:57.404 --> 00:08:59.565
<v Speaker 1>I mean, you know, presumably, was somebody else

00:08:59.565 --> 00:09:02.365
<v Speaker 1>creating the virtual machine image that you deployed

00:09:02.365 --> 00:09:05.084
<v Speaker 1>it onto. Right? And somebody else was organizing

00:09:05.084 --> 00:09:07.884
<v Speaker 1>the network connectivity for it and they probably

00:09:07.884 --> 00:09:10.285
<v Speaker 1>somebody else created the storage land that it,

00:09:10.285 --> 00:09:10.925
<v Speaker 1>like, sat on.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.120
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Yeah. Definitely a a very

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.160
<v Speaker 0>a lot of segmentation on the different parts

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.000
<v Speaker 0>of the life cycle and the deployment and

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.080
<v Speaker 0>all of that. Now I'm looking at how

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.800
<v Speaker 0>we do software today and micro service environments,

00:09:23.775 --> 00:09:26.895
<v Speaker 0>polyglot languages or, you know, multiple languages across

00:09:26.895 --> 00:09:28.415
<v Speaker 0>micro service architectures,

00:09:28.575 --> 00:09:30.895
<v Speaker 0>deploying daily or even more than daily.

00:09:31.055 --> 00:09:33.695
<v Speaker 0>And then just thinking about the security concerns

00:09:33.695 --> 00:09:36.015
<v Speaker 0>that we have and how those are essentially

00:09:36.015 --> 00:09:38.495
<v Speaker 0>multiplied or exponential, maybe even at the worst

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:41.470
<v Speaker 0>case and that kind of environment is scary.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:42.910
<v Speaker 0>So

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:44.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And I mean, I I think if

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.270
<v Speaker 1>you look at the real world of kind

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.150
<v Speaker 1>of of

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.270
<v Speaker 1>when people get owned, right, there's a there's

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.950
<v Speaker 1>it's almost always in in this era, a

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:56.885
<v Speaker 1>combination of application level vulnerability.

00:09:56.885 --> 00:09:59.605
<v Speaker 1>But what really causes this, the massive blast

00:09:59.605 --> 00:10:02.085
<v Speaker 1>radius is you've misconfigured the environment.

00:10:02.325 --> 00:10:04.405
<v Speaker 1>And that might be, you know, Kubernetes.

00:10:04.485 --> 00:10:06.565
<v Speaker 1>That might be, you know, how you've done

00:10:06.565 --> 00:10:08.405
<v Speaker 1>Terraform into AWS,

00:10:08.405 --> 00:10:09.445
<v Speaker 1>you know, and once.

00:10:09.839 --> 00:10:12.399
<v Speaker 1>So, you know, this it's interesting to see

00:10:12.399 --> 00:10:13.040
<v Speaker 1>how,

00:10:13.839 --> 00:10:16.319
<v Speaker 1>you know an attacker isn't really likely to

00:10:16.319 --> 00:10:19.600
<v Speaker 1>get much from from owning one container,

00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:21.440
<v Speaker 1>but once you get to, like you know,

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.120
<v Speaker 1>you get in there, you can expand the

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.675
<v Speaker 1>blast radius because somebody hasn't misconfigured something, they've

00:10:26.675 --> 00:10:28.835
<v Speaker 1>exposed some secrets somewhere, you know, then you're

00:10:28.835 --> 00:10:30.035
<v Speaker 1>into a whole different game.

00:10:30.355 --> 00:10:32.835
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Definitely. Yeah. I can see that especially,

00:10:32.835 --> 00:10:34.995
<v Speaker 0>you know, as our applications are distributed now,

00:10:34.995 --> 00:10:36.435
<v Speaker 0>they all have their own APIs

00:10:36.515 --> 00:10:39.235
<v Speaker 0>misconfigured any of those, getting authentication wrong in

00:10:39.235 --> 00:10:41.189
<v Speaker 0>any of those, and you're just leaving doors

00:10:41.189 --> 00:10:44.230
<v Speaker 0>open for nefarious people to jump in sneak

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:47.350
<v Speaker 0>in and then start moving laterally. So yeah.

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:49.350
<v Speaker 0>And now we never wanna write software again

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:50.149
<v Speaker 0>unless

00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:52.310
<v Speaker 0>there's a tool chain Yeah. It's all about

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:53.910
<v Speaker 1>notebook now. Don't write anything.

00:10:54.904 --> 00:10:57.225
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Unless we've got tools out there to

00:10:57.225 --> 00:10:59.384
<v Speaker 0>help us remove some of these common pain

00:10:59.384 --> 00:11:01.545
<v Speaker 0>points and make ourselves worse. I think that's

00:11:01.545 --> 00:11:04.024
<v Speaker 0>why I'm really excited for today's lesson. Because

00:11:04.024 --> 00:11:05.464
<v Speaker 0>I don't wanna stop writing code. I just

00:11:05.625 --> 00:11:07.464
<v Speaker 0>I want a better confidence that my code

00:11:07.464 --> 00:11:09.970
<v Speaker 0>is potentially secure. I mean, in fact, I

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:11.730
<v Speaker 0>even think in the last twelve months, like

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.890
<v Speaker 0>every major hack I think I've read about

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:15.250
<v Speaker 0>has been supply chain.

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.810
<v Speaker 0>And I think that's a growing concern for

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.810
<v Speaker 0>everyone now, especially as open source is a

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:23.035
<v Speaker 0>major component of everything that we're doing and

00:11:23.035 --> 00:11:24.555
<v Speaker 0>been able to make sure that not only

00:11:24.555 --> 00:11:26.475
<v Speaker 0>our code that we write is secure,

00:11:26.555 --> 00:11:28.795
<v Speaker 0>but the code of the upstream dependencies that

00:11:28.795 --> 00:11:29.675
<v Speaker 0>we have as well.

00:11:30.715 --> 00:11:31.995
<v Speaker 1>I mean, I think if you look at

00:11:31.995 --> 00:11:33.435
<v Speaker 1>most applications these days,

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.820
<v Speaker 1>it's it's extremely rare to not see this

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.300
<v Speaker 1>pattern, which is like a tiny amount of,

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.140
<v Speaker 1>like, code that you've actually written in the

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.820
<v Speaker 1>context of the entire application.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.860
<v Speaker 1>And then, you know, I mean, god, you

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.020
<v Speaker 1>know, hundreds of thousands of lines of code

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.365
<v Speaker 1>that you've just pulled in from from

00:11:51.005 --> 00:11:53.965
<v Speaker 1>NPM or from PyPI or from where I

00:11:53.965 --> 00:11:56.285
<v Speaker 1>mean, that's how we write applications now. Right?

00:11:56.285 --> 00:11:58.365
<v Speaker 1>I mean, it's it's great because we're not

00:11:58.365 --> 00:12:00.445
<v Speaker 1>reinventing the wheel. I mean, you know, who

00:12:00.445 --> 00:12:02.205
<v Speaker 1>would go out and write their own

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.000
<v Speaker 1>HTTP library or something like that? You know,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.680
<v Speaker 1>you just wouldn't now, would you? You just,

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.480
<v Speaker 1>you know, include whatever. Yeah. But,

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.320
<v Speaker 1>you know, there is the

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:13.760
<v Speaker 1>it's,

00:12:15.935 --> 00:12:17.935
<v Speaker 1>you know, it can be a place where

00:12:17.935 --> 00:12:20.575
<v Speaker 1>where you introduce vulnerability. So I think being

00:12:20.575 --> 00:12:23.375
<v Speaker 1>aware of that and and having the mechanisms

00:12:23.375 --> 00:12:25.375
<v Speaker 1>to to scan that stuff.

00:12:26.335 --> 00:12:27.535
<v Speaker 1>I mean, you know, I came from the

00:12:27.535 --> 00:12:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Python world where it's a bit simpler, I

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:30.890
<v Speaker 1>think. I I think if you look at

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:32.970
<v Speaker 1>a lot of a lot of of of

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.610
<v Speaker 1>ecosystems now, especially things like JavaScript,

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:38.410
<v Speaker 1>there's like a million different packages to do

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:40.730
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of stuff. And then you've got

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:42.970
<v Speaker 1>the typo squatting stuff, right, where people will

00:12:43.205 --> 00:12:45.205
<v Speaker 1>push a push a package with a tiny

00:12:45.205 --> 00:12:48.005
<v Speaker 1>typo in it to to catch people from

00:12:48.005 --> 00:12:49.605
<v Speaker 1>the repository. So it's a bit of a

00:12:49.605 --> 00:12:51.845
<v Speaker 1>minefield just in just in that sense.

00:12:52.565 --> 00:12:53.845
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Definitely.

00:12:54.005 --> 00:12:56.700
<v Speaker 0>Well, it's rare on this show but I'm

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.860
<v Speaker 0>I'm sold. I'm convinced. I now wanna see

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.300
<v Speaker 0>all the goodies. So

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.500
<v Speaker 0>so why don't I get my screen share

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.380
<v Speaker 0>up here?

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.660
<v Speaker 0>There we go. We are floating heads. We

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.020
<v Speaker 0>have the Snyk website

00:13:09.715 --> 00:13:11.235
<v Speaker 0>and we're gonna try and do a few

00:13:11.235 --> 00:13:14.915
<v Speaker 0>things today. We're gonna take a JavaScript project.

00:13:15.075 --> 00:13:16.755
<v Speaker 0>We are gonna add it to the Snyk

00:13:16.755 --> 00:13:18.115
<v Speaker 0>UI. We're gonna do a little bit of

00:13:18.115 --> 00:13:19.955
<v Speaker 0>exploration there first and then we're gonna get

00:13:19.955 --> 00:13:21.875
<v Speaker 0>hands on with some of the developer tools

00:13:21.875 --> 00:13:22.355
<v Speaker 0>as well.

00:13:23.639 --> 00:13:28.040
<v Speaker 0>So let's see. I need to log in.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.199
<v Speaker 0>Oh, the beach ball, that's always a good

00:13:30.199 --> 00:13:30.760
<v Speaker 0>sign.

00:13:36.759 --> 00:13:37.240
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:13:38.745 --> 00:13:40.265
<v Speaker 0>I hope I used GitHub. Did you ever

00:13:40.265 --> 00:13:41.465
<v Speaker 0>get that? When you go to a website

00:13:41.465 --> 00:13:42.505
<v Speaker 0>and you're like, I can't remember what I

00:13:42.505 --> 00:13:43.625
<v Speaker 0>used. All time.

00:13:46.345 --> 00:13:48.505
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So this is the

00:13:48.505 --> 00:13:51.225
<v Speaker 0>Snyk UI. I logged in with GitHub. I've

00:13:51.225 --> 00:13:53.920
<v Speaker 0>got my organization here. We're gonna add a

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:54.880
<v Speaker 0>project. Now,

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.760
<v Speaker 0>I'm not gonna say I I've cheated, but

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.440
<v Speaker 0>I've just farted on another project. I think

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.960
<v Speaker 0>it would be cool to analyze and and

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.320
<v Speaker 0>see all the things that are coming on

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.280
<v Speaker 0>here. So

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.840
<v Speaker 0>oh, I guess I could have used all

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.440
<v Speaker 0>our economic stuff. I'll just hide that.

00:14:08.665 --> 00:14:10.745
<v Speaker 0>I fought n a n. Are you familiar

00:14:10.745 --> 00:14:12.665
<v Speaker 0>with the the project at all? I

00:14:13.385 --> 00:14:16.345
<v Speaker 1>don't think I am actually. It's a workflow

00:14:16.345 --> 00:14:19.545
<v Speaker 0>automation tool written in JavaScript and TypeScript

00:14:19.545 --> 00:14:22.265
<v Speaker 0>that has a really nice kinda UI

00:14:22.265 --> 00:14:23.705
<v Speaker 0>for doing your workflows.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.000
<v Speaker 0>I'm just gonna tick this here

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.160
<v Speaker 0>and hit go.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.360
<v Speaker 0>And I'll give that a few seconds and

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.800
<v Speaker 0>I'll just jump over to here and show

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.800
<v Speaker 0>you this. Really cool tool. I I keep

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.160
<v Speaker 0>like I try to automate as much of

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.075
<v Speaker 0>this show as possible and this gives you

00:14:38.075 --> 00:14:40.475
<v Speaker 0>like this nice drag and drop node collection

00:14:40.475 --> 00:14:42.155
<v Speaker 0>thing where you just say like, oh Oh,

00:14:42.155 --> 00:14:44.315
<v Speaker 1>that looks shiny. I mean, GitHub fires an

00:14:44.315 --> 00:14:46.315
<v Speaker 0>event going to this thing. So I figured

00:14:46.315 --> 00:14:48.075
<v Speaker 0>let's let's play with that.

00:14:49.115 --> 00:14:50.395
<v Speaker 0>In order Check out.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.070
<v Speaker 0>Because Docker image scans,

00:14:54.709 --> 00:14:57.190
<v Speaker 0>Docker image building is particularly slow,

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:59.830
<v Speaker 0>upfront I did do a build of the

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:01.750
<v Speaker 0>container image and push it just so that

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:02.950
<v Speaker 0>we don't need to do that on my

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:04.230
<v Speaker 0>machine and watch that

00:15:04.885 --> 00:15:06.805
<v Speaker 0>watch the build. That's that's just not fun.

00:15:06.885 --> 00:15:08.565
<v Speaker 0>So I figured I'd save as that.

00:15:09.845 --> 00:15:11.445
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So I guess I guess, you know,

00:15:11.445 --> 00:15:13.125
<v Speaker 1>looking at this looking at this view, one

00:15:13.125 --> 00:15:14.805
<v Speaker 1>of the key things, you know, like I

00:15:15.365 --> 00:15:18.165
<v Speaker 1>was saying about this focus on on these

00:15:18.165 --> 00:15:20.779
<v Speaker 1>are tools for developers to use, you know,

00:15:20.779 --> 00:15:22.699
<v Speaker 1>to make it as easy as possible for

00:15:22.699 --> 00:15:25.500
<v Speaker 1>you to to import stuff into

00:15:26.379 --> 00:15:27.180
<v Speaker 1>your

00:15:27.819 --> 00:15:30.459
<v Speaker 1>into into Snyk and have it scanned. So

00:15:30.459 --> 00:15:32.620
<v Speaker 1>it's all really about frictionless.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:33.899
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at the amount of

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:36.455
<v Speaker 1>integrations there are, you know, you can you

00:15:36.455 --> 00:15:38.535
<v Speaker 1>can, like, plug Snyk into,

00:15:38.695 --> 00:15:40.695
<v Speaker 1>like, a ton of different source code management

00:15:40.695 --> 00:15:41.415
<v Speaker 1>systems,

00:15:41.735 --> 00:15:43.495
<v Speaker 1>ton of different CI tools,

00:15:44.774 --> 00:15:46.855
<v Speaker 1>and and all sorts of thing all all

00:15:46.855 --> 00:15:49.095
<v Speaker 1>sorts of container registries. And, you know, it's

00:15:49.095 --> 00:15:50.774
<v Speaker 1>as simple as as you just showed their

00:15:50.774 --> 00:15:53.070
<v Speaker 1>way. You just click the button and, you

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:55.550
<v Speaker 1>know, it's there. It's been scanned already. Right?

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:57.230
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:00.270
<v Speaker 0>It is imported already. I can see it

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:00.830
<v Speaker 0>here.

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:05.095
<v Speaker 0>Wow. It's done quite a lot. So it's

00:16:05.095 --> 00:16:05.575
<v Speaker 0>done

00:16:05.975 --> 00:16:07.415
<v Speaker 0>a code analysis.

00:16:07.815 --> 00:16:09.975
<v Speaker 0>It has scanned all of the Docker files

00:16:09.975 --> 00:16:12.055
<v Speaker 0>from all the different so Debian one, Red

00:16:12.055 --> 00:16:13.975
<v Speaker 0>Hat one, I guess the scratch or custom

00:16:13.975 --> 00:16:14.615
<v Speaker 0>one,

00:16:15.175 --> 00:16:18.055
<v Speaker 0>and it's found a package dot JSON. So

00:16:18.055 --> 00:16:19.895
<v Speaker 0>at least I didn't know this before today,

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:21.750
<v Speaker 0>but NAN appears to be some sort of

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:23.670
<v Speaker 0>mono repository with a whole bunch of packages

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:25.430
<v Speaker 0>and it has scanned all of their JSON

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.030
<v Speaker 0>package dot JSON file.

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:29.030
<v Speaker 0>That's pretty nice right off the bat. I

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.750
<v Speaker 0>like that.

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:31.750
<v Speaker 0>What I don't like is the big scary

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:32.710
<v Speaker 0>numbers I've now seen.

00:16:34.045 --> 00:16:35.405
<v Speaker 0>Let me see. Can you see that? Oh,

00:16:35.405 --> 00:16:36.445
<v Speaker 0>I should probably zoom in a little bit

00:16:36.445 --> 00:16:37.885
<v Speaker 0>right. There you go.

00:16:39.485 --> 00:16:42.605
<v Speaker 0>Is this h, I guess, high severity?

00:16:43.245 --> 00:16:45.485
<v Speaker 0>Like a hundred h is high severity. So

00:16:45.485 --> 00:16:47.485
<v Speaker 1>if you I mean, perhaps if you click

00:16:47.485 --> 00:16:49.290
<v Speaker 1>on one of those package dot jsons, we

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:51.370
<v Speaker 1>can kinda see what what

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.970
<v Speaker 1>what's going on there. Yeah. One that's actually

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:57.290
<v Speaker 1>got some some vulnerabilities in it.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:59.769
<v Speaker 1>So what what the first thing to to

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:02.649
<v Speaker 1>note here is this dependencies tab. Right? So

00:17:02.649 --> 00:17:04.569
<v Speaker 1>if you click on the dependencies tab,

00:17:10.595 --> 00:17:12.434
<v Speaker 1>so what you're gonna see there is that

00:17:12.434 --> 00:17:13.154
<v Speaker 1>that

00:17:14.035 --> 00:17:16.675
<v Speaker 1>Snyk's not just analyzed, like, what packages you

00:17:16.675 --> 00:17:19.830
<v Speaker 1>included, but it's built the entire dependency tree

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:22.790
<v Speaker 1>and analyzed all of them. And so you

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:25.190
<v Speaker 1>may have things that are I mean, actually,

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:26.790
<v Speaker 1>it looks like at the top level, there

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:28.230
<v Speaker 1>aren't any vulnerabilities

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:30.150
<v Speaker 1>in those in those top level ones. So

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:32.470
<v Speaker 1>presumably, the phones there are all in the

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.174
<v Speaker 1>tree. Yeah. Okay.

00:17:34.735 --> 00:17:36.415
<v Speaker 1>So and and this is where lots of

00:17:36.415 --> 00:17:38.895
<v Speaker 1>vulnerabilities can hide, right, is in these indirect

00:17:38.895 --> 00:17:41.535
<v Speaker 1>dependencies that you didn't actually know you're including.

00:17:41.535 --> 00:17:43.615
<v Speaker 1>Right? And, I mean, I'm sure you're familiar

00:17:43.615 --> 00:17:46.510
<v Speaker 1>particularly with node, where sometimes you can just

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:48.750
<v Speaker 1>get a ridiculous amount of packages all of

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:51.390
<v Speaker 1>a sudden get like get get included there.

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:52.830
<v Speaker 1>But it's built the it's built the whole

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:55.390
<v Speaker 1>tree and looked at the looked at the

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:59.230
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability database for for every package, every version

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.995
<v Speaker 1>of every package that's that's been included there.

00:18:03.275 --> 00:18:05.675
<v Speaker 0>So I'm I'm curious. Right? Like,

00:18:06.315 --> 00:18:08.395
<v Speaker 0>it says we've got high, medium, and low

00:18:08.395 --> 00:18:09.195
<v Speaker 0>severity.

00:18:09.195 --> 00:18:11.275
<v Speaker 0>Like, is there a a one liner description

00:18:11.275 --> 00:18:12.715
<v Speaker 0>for what that actually means to me as

00:18:12.715 --> 00:18:14.930
<v Speaker 0>as a developer? Like, can I ignore? Or

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:16.370
<v Speaker 1>would you go back to if you go

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:17.970
<v Speaker 1>if you go back to issues, right, and

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:20.050
<v Speaker 1>we can talk through a bit about what

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:22.530
<v Speaker 1>about what that means. So what

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:23.090
<v Speaker 1>what

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:27.570
<v Speaker 1>so security vulnerabilities typically are are

00:18:28.155 --> 00:18:30.235
<v Speaker 1>are there is an industry standard for how

00:18:30.235 --> 00:18:33.035
<v Speaker 1>things are scored. Right? The CVSS score. And

00:18:33.035 --> 00:18:34.715
<v Speaker 1>the CVSS score is made up of a

00:18:34.715 --> 00:18:37.835
<v Speaker 1>bunch of of sort of different elements that

00:18:37.835 --> 00:18:39.915
<v Speaker 1>altogether add up to an overall score

00:18:40.399 --> 00:18:42.799
<v Speaker 1>that says how severe that thing is. And,

00:18:42.799 --> 00:18:44.480
<v Speaker 1>you know, those if I think if you

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.239
<v Speaker 1>click on that CVSS,

00:18:46.399 --> 00:18:48.240
<v Speaker 1>you know, in that in that vulnerability we're

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.799
<v Speaker 1>looking at there, the CVSS thing, which is

00:18:50.799 --> 00:18:52.079
<v Speaker 1>that that one there,

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.720
<v Speaker 1>will actually take you to the, yeah, to

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.605
<v Speaker 1>the c v so you can see all

00:18:56.605 --> 00:18:58.924
<v Speaker 1>these different things like the attack vectors, the

00:18:58.924 --> 00:19:00.445
<v Speaker 1>complexity required

00:19:00.445 --> 00:19:02.765
<v Speaker 1>for the attack, what privileges you need. You

00:19:02.765 --> 00:19:04.285
<v Speaker 1>know, this is this is the kind of

00:19:04.285 --> 00:19:05.804
<v Speaker 1>stuff that security folks

00:19:06.125 --> 00:19:09.080
<v Speaker 1>are into. Right? And so the for for

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.160
<v Speaker 1>maybe people who aren't so familiar with how

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.320
<v Speaker 1>these things get get rated,

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.120
<v Speaker 1>CVSS is the kind of the basis for

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:16.600
<v Speaker 1>it.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.560
<v Speaker 1>But what we do at Snyk is kind

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.935
<v Speaker 1>of enrich that as well. So, you know,

00:19:21.935 --> 00:19:24.495
<v Speaker 1>from a developer perspective

00:19:25.775 --> 00:19:28.495
<v Speaker 1>yeah. That's very true, Russell. Love that shows

00:19:28.495 --> 00:19:29.855
<v Speaker 1>is is

00:19:30.335 --> 00:19:31.935
<v Speaker 1>has a history of

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:34.910
<v Speaker 1>but if we if we go back to

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:38.030
<v Speaker 1>Snyk, David, and and you can see that

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:41.150
<v Speaker 1>that we also have this this priority

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:41.789
<v Speaker 1>score.

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:43.870
<v Speaker 1>The see that low that that one we

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:45.070
<v Speaker 1>were just looking at there, it's got that

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:46.350
<v Speaker 1>score of four nine seven.

00:19:46.945 --> 00:19:48.625
<v Speaker 1>And that's

00:19:48.625 --> 00:19:51.345
<v Speaker 1>based on not just the CVSS score, but

00:19:51.345 --> 00:19:53.265
<v Speaker 1>it's based on how

00:19:54.065 --> 00:19:57.585
<v Speaker 1>how mature is the are the exploits available

00:19:57.585 --> 00:19:59.185
<v Speaker 1>for it. So is there code out there

00:19:59.185 --> 00:20:01.665
<v Speaker 1>that's real that somebody could use against it?

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:03.909
<v Speaker 1>But most importantly, and this is the kind

00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:06.470
<v Speaker 1>of critical thing for for this idea of

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:07.830
<v Speaker 1>developer first security,

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:10.789
<v Speaker 1>is is there a fix? Right? Because when

00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:12.870
<v Speaker 1>you look at these lists of vulnerabilities,

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:14.390
<v Speaker 1>and we'll see when we come to container

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:16.345
<v Speaker 1>images, that sometimes you can just get these

00:20:16.345 --> 00:20:18.985
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of vulnerabilities. And it's like, I'm a

00:20:18.985 --> 00:20:21.145
<v Speaker 1>developer. What do I do about this? None

00:20:21.145 --> 00:20:22.985
<v Speaker 1>of these things mean anything to me. Right?

00:20:22.985 --> 00:20:24.825
<v Speaker 1>So am I gonna, like, go through all

00:20:24.825 --> 00:20:27.385
<v Speaker 1>these things and see whether they are applicable

00:20:27.385 --> 00:20:30.100
<v Speaker 1>in my environment? Blah blah blah. But, you

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.179
<v Speaker 1>know so you have to prioritize,

00:20:32.179 --> 00:20:33.940
<v Speaker 1>and you have to just make a strategic

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.179
<v Speaker 1>decision to say which ones you're gonna fix.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.739
<v Speaker 1>And so stuff that has a fix

00:20:39.059 --> 00:20:41.380
<v Speaker 1>and it's severe and it's got exploit, that's

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.220
<v Speaker 1>clearly a no brainer. Right? Just fix it.

00:20:43.534 --> 00:20:46.094
<v Speaker 1>Because if it just means upgrading that package,

00:20:46.495 --> 00:20:49.135
<v Speaker 1>then, obviously, you don't really need to dig

00:20:49.135 --> 00:20:52.095
<v Speaker 1>into what the actual vulnerability is. Just fix

00:20:52.095 --> 00:20:54.735
<v Speaker 1>it. Because, you know, at some point, you're

00:20:54.735 --> 00:20:56.894
<v Speaker 1>gonna have to make these trade offs between

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:02.050
<v Speaker 1>how much effort is it to understand all

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:03.650
<v Speaker 1>these things versus,

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:06.450
<v Speaker 1>you know, the the the effort to fix

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:08.770
<v Speaker 1>it. And so this prioritization

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:10.610
<v Speaker 1>is really important for

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:14.155
<v Speaker 1>us in terms of the how actionable things

00:21:14.155 --> 00:21:16.635
<v Speaker 1>are from a developer perspective. Right? Because me

00:21:16.635 --> 00:21:17.675
<v Speaker 1>as the developer,

00:21:17.835 --> 00:21:19.355
<v Speaker 1>I just wanna fix things and move on.

00:21:19.355 --> 00:21:21.995
<v Speaker 1>Right? Because this is the security stuff is

00:21:21.995 --> 00:21:24.315
<v Speaker 1>just, you know, is just taking up resource

00:21:24.315 --> 00:21:26.955
<v Speaker 1>in my team, which could be better spent

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:31.030
<v Speaker 1>developing new features, shipping new software. Exactly. I've

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:32.630
<v Speaker 0>got bugs to introduce to my software. I

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:33.750
<v Speaker 0>don't have time to be fixing those issues.

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.230
<v Speaker 1>You've got new vulnerabilities to introduce.

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:39.990
<v Speaker 1>So that's it. So yeah. So so that

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:41.830
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of I think the question was

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.710
<v Speaker 1>I slightly went

00:21:43.565 --> 00:21:45.645
<v Speaker 1>off around the piece there, but the question

00:21:45.645 --> 00:21:47.085
<v Speaker 1>was about about

00:21:48.125 --> 00:21:50.445
<v Speaker 1>sort of scoring of these things. So it's

00:21:50.445 --> 00:21:53.245
<v Speaker 1>a combination of the CVSS score, and in

00:21:53.245 --> 00:21:55.565
<v Speaker 1>the Snyk world, we kind of enrich that

00:21:55.565 --> 00:21:56.125
<v Speaker 1>by saying,

00:21:56.779 --> 00:21:59.500
<v Speaker 1>you know, if there's a fix available, we're

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:02.220
<v Speaker 1>gonna highlight that because it's much it it's

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:03.419
<v Speaker 1>the kind of thing that you ought to

00:22:03.419 --> 00:22:04.700
<v Speaker 1>be dealing with first.

00:22:05.899 --> 00:22:06.539
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:08.539
<v Speaker 0>So I've been kind of peeking at the

00:22:08.539 --> 00:22:10.539
<v Speaker 0>UI as as well as you've been explaining

00:22:10.539 --> 00:22:12.985
<v Speaker 0>that to me. There's just a lot of

00:22:12.985 --> 00:22:15.304
<v Speaker 0>information here as well to really understand each

00:22:15.304 --> 00:22:16.505
<v Speaker 0>of these which I think is great. The

00:22:16.505 --> 00:22:17.705
<v Speaker 0>fact that it tells me how it was

00:22:17.705 --> 00:22:18.424
<v Speaker 0>introduced,

00:22:18.985 --> 00:22:20.745
<v Speaker 0>think is really nice. This one just tell

00:22:20.745 --> 00:22:22.264
<v Speaker 0>me even where it's fixed.

00:22:23.304 --> 00:22:25.225
<v Speaker 0>And then I like these toggles over here

00:22:25.225 --> 00:22:25.544
<v Speaker 0>as well.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:27.960
<v Speaker 0>Not fixable,

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.480
<v Speaker 0>which is probably not the best way for

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:30.200
<v Speaker 0>me to

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.200
<v Speaker 0>like I guess with those I'm just hoping

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.480
<v Speaker 0>that they're still in the proof of concept

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.160
<v Speaker 0>stage and then the ones that are fixable

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.519
<v Speaker 0>are here. So nice

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:38.920
<v Speaker 0>presentation

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.440
<v Speaker 0>of just all of the things that I

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.025
<v Speaker 0>need to be concerned about without attracting too

00:22:43.025 --> 00:22:45.184
<v Speaker 0>much of my time, which I I like.

00:22:45.905 --> 00:22:46.465
<v Speaker 0>So

00:22:47.985 --> 00:22:50.145
<v Speaker 0>let's let's see what else we had on

00:22:50.145 --> 00:22:50.705
<v Speaker 0>this.

00:22:52.225 --> 00:22:53.745
<v Speaker 0>Is it just back? There we go.

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:57.810
<v Speaker 0>And it does that for all of my

00:22:57.810 --> 00:22:59.010
<v Speaker 0>package JSON.

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So I was gonna find another one

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:02.850
<v Speaker 1>where we can do look at a

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:06.290
<v Speaker 1>where there's some fixable ones that you could

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:07.730
<v Speaker 1>do a fixed PR against

00:23:08.075 --> 00:23:09.995
<v Speaker 1>Because that's the other thing in that in

00:23:09.995 --> 00:23:11.915
<v Speaker 1>that view that you can do is automatically

00:23:11.915 --> 00:23:14.875
<v Speaker 1>open a PR against in GitHub against that

00:23:14.875 --> 00:23:15.754
<v Speaker 1>repository.

00:23:16.955 --> 00:23:19.675
<v Speaker 1>The they'll upgrade that package to the to

00:23:19.675 --> 00:23:20.715
<v Speaker 1>the appropriate

00:23:21.995 --> 00:23:23.675
<v Speaker 1>to the appropriate version.

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:26.609
<v Speaker 0>Oh, we got a fixable one.

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:29.809
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So if you click on that, see

00:23:29.809 --> 00:23:31.650
<v Speaker 1>that big green button that says fix that

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:32.529
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability?

00:23:34.289 --> 00:23:36.130
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So what have we got here? We've

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:37.490
<v Speaker 0>got

00:23:36.945 --> 00:23:39.024
<v Speaker 0>seven eleven. That seems like quite a high

00:23:39.024 --> 00:23:41.264
<v Speaker 0>score. Yeah. So then that's pretty high.

00:23:41.505 --> 00:23:43.505
<v Speaker 1>But but see that why that one is

00:23:43.505 --> 00:23:45.105
<v Speaker 1>probably higher than that one we looked at

00:23:45.105 --> 00:23:46.945
<v Speaker 1>before is because it's fixable.

00:23:47.105 --> 00:23:49.184
<v Speaker 1>So having a fix available is gonna be

00:23:49.345 --> 00:23:50.625
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna push that to the top of

00:23:50.625 --> 00:23:52.465
<v Speaker 1>the pile so that your developers can go,

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:54.330
<v Speaker 1>hey. There's a fix there. All I need

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:56.570
<v Speaker 1>to do is upgrade that package to I

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:57.850
<v Speaker 1>think we're showing there

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:00.730
<v Speaker 1>if we upgraded it to

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:04.010
<v Speaker 0>Seven dot zero dot zero. Seven dot 0

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:04.570
<v Speaker 1>dot zero.

00:24:07.335 --> 00:24:09.175
<v Speaker 0>Okay. And that's what I I suspect, actually,

00:24:09.175 --> 00:24:11.414
<v Speaker 1>when we that fixed PR because it's a

00:24:11.975 --> 00:24:13.735
<v Speaker 1>because it's a indirect

00:24:13.735 --> 00:24:14.695
<v Speaker 1>dependency,

00:24:14.855 --> 00:24:17.815
<v Speaker 1>I think it'll upgrade a few packages there

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:20.470
<v Speaker 1>in order to make sure they're all they've

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:22.470
<v Speaker 1>all they're all the right versions. But if

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:24.070
<v Speaker 1>you press the fixed vulnerability,

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.990
<v Speaker 1>hopefully,

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:29.270
<v Speaker 1>it should open a a PR in

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:31.110
<v Speaker 1>GitHub.

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:32.470
<v Speaker 1>So

00:24:34.255 --> 00:24:36.495
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Right. So that's fine. So we can

00:24:36.495 --> 00:24:38.255
<v Speaker 1>open the fixed PR there.

00:24:44.975 --> 00:24:47.380
<v Speaker 1>And what it should do is is is

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.700
<v Speaker 1>open that in GitHub. So we can see

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.140
<v Speaker 1>it's open a nice

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.700
<v Speaker 1>informative PR there

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:57.620
<v Speaker 1>that's that's showing you exactly what why you

00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:00.185
<v Speaker 1>needed to upgrade it. And I think if

00:25:00.185 --> 00:25:02.345
<v Speaker 1>we go in files changed, it should show

00:25:02.345 --> 00:25:04.905
<v Speaker 1>that it's just gonna have the package dependency

00:25:04.905 --> 00:25:06.025
<v Speaker 1>to the version.

00:25:11.065 --> 00:25:12.265
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's see.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.599
<v Speaker 0>There we go. Yeah. So there we go.

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.080
<v Speaker 1>And you you can have that turned on.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.679
<v Speaker 1>So quite a lot of people have those

00:25:21.679 --> 00:25:22.960
<v Speaker 1>turned on automatically

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:26.240
<v Speaker 1>so that they're they're they're it'll automatically open

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.719
<v Speaker 1>fixed PRs for for things that can be

00:25:28.924 --> 00:25:30.284
<v Speaker 1>that can have a

00:25:31.725 --> 00:25:32.845
<v Speaker 1>package upgrade.

00:25:34.125 --> 00:25:35.404
<v Speaker 0>Well, that was a

00:25:35.645 --> 00:25:37.085
<v Speaker 0>quite a pleasant experience.

00:25:38.205 --> 00:25:40.684
<v Speaker 0>We found a high high vulnerability high risk

00:25:40.684 --> 00:25:43.140
<v Speaker 0>vulnerability and then Snyk has been very kind

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.140
<v Speaker 0>as to give me the PR, upgrade the

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:45.940
<v Speaker 0>dependency

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.619
<v Speaker 0>and it's now merged.

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:51.700
<v Speaker 0>That's awesome. Let's

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:53.779
<v Speaker 0>jump back here. So I guess that's going

00:25:53.779 --> 00:25:56.980
<v Speaker 0>to I'm assuming Snyk knows

00:25:56.455 --> 00:25:58.775
<v Speaker 0>that something has happened here and

00:25:59.495 --> 00:26:02.055
<v Speaker 0>does the redo of the analysis is every

00:26:02.055 --> 00:26:04.135
<v Speaker 0>time there's a push to my repository?

00:26:04.215 --> 00:26:05.255
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So

00:26:05.575 --> 00:26:07.495
<v Speaker 1>did you just merge that? Yeah. So Could

00:26:07.495 --> 00:26:09.175
<v Speaker 0>I do? This when you've turned on the

00:26:09.175 --> 00:26:12.160
<v Speaker 1>GitHub integration, there is automatically a

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.560
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna it's

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.400
<v Speaker 1>gonna rescan on merge anyway

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:17.920
<v Speaker 1>because you had the

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.600
<v Speaker 1>on the GitHub repo when you imported, it

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.720
<v Speaker 1>adds the Snyk tests.

00:26:23.225 --> 00:26:25.465
<v Speaker 1>So when that merge has gone through, it's

00:26:25.465 --> 00:26:26.585
<v Speaker 1>retested it.

00:26:28.105 --> 00:26:29.225
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Cool.

00:26:30.985 --> 00:26:33.145
<v Speaker 0>Let's go back to there is a button

00:26:33.145 --> 00:26:34.505
<v Speaker 0>here that I was curious about.

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:39.369
<v Speaker 0>Fix vulnerabilities. Does this try and fix everything?

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:41.530
<v Speaker 0>Or is it just gonna take me to

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:42.169
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:26:42.809 --> 00:26:43.450
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:46.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It should get it should yeah. So

00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:48.905
<v Speaker 1>that's on the because that was against the

00:26:48.905 --> 00:26:51.625
<v Speaker 1>Dockerfile project, wasn't it? So when you imported

00:26:51.625 --> 00:26:54.184
<v Speaker 1>that project, it also looked at the Dockerfiles.

00:26:54.425 --> 00:26:55.625
<v Speaker 1>And I think if you went back a

00:26:55.625 --> 00:26:57.945
<v Speaker 1>screen, you'd see the little Docker icon there

00:26:59.065 --> 00:27:01.809
<v Speaker 1>and where that was saying fix the Yeah.

00:27:01.809 --> 00:27:04.529
<v Speaker 1>So this is against the against the docker.

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:08.610
<v Speaker 1>Actually, that against the image in in Docker

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:10.690
<v Speaker 1>Hub, or is that against the Docker file?

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:14.129
<v Speaker 0>Wants to upgrade the base image based on

00:27:14.129 --> 00:27:15.250
<v Speaker 0>what I've seen on the last page.

00:27:15.915 --> 00:27:16.555
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:27:18.075 --> 00:27:18.795
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:27:18.955 --> 00:27:20.715
<v Speaker 0>It wants to go from fourteen seventeen to

00:27:20.715 --> 00:27:21.835
<v Speaker 0>fourteen seventeen.

00:27:22.475 --> 00:27:23.115
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:27:23.435 --> 00:27:25.515
<v Speaker 1>So and again, the same the same sort

00:27:25.515 --> 00:27:27.835
<v Speaker 1>of thing applies for for Docker images that

00:27:27.835 --> 00:27:29.835
<v Speaker 1>we can do these automated fixed PRs against

00:27:29.835 --> 00:27:30.635
<v Speaker 1>the Docker file.

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:33.940
<v Speaker 1>I think with Docker images are are a

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:35.700
<v Speaker 1>bit more of a of a complex one

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.700
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of Docker images

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.020
<v Speaker 1>have a lot of vulnerabilities in them. Right?

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:41.299
<v Speaker 1>And especially

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:44.100
<v Speaker 1>the generic

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:47.284
<v Speaker 1>the generic language

00:27:47.925 --> 00:27:49.285
<v Speaker 1>images. You know? I mean, you can see

00:27:49.285 --> 00:27:53.045
<v Speaker 1>that node fourteen's got 600 plus vulnerabilities in

00:27:53.045 --> 00:27:54.965
<v Speaker 1>it. And there's a reason for that. Right?

00:27:54.965 --> 00:27:55.845
<v Speaker 1>It's because

00:27:56.005 --> 00:27:57.524
<v Speaker 1>those generic language

00:27:57.925 --> 00:27:58.884
<v Speaker 1>runtime

00:27:59.285 --> 00:27:59.925
<v Speaker 1>images

00:28:00.409 --> 00:28:03.929
<v Speaker 1>are solving for the generic

00:28:03.929 --> 00:28:06.169
<v Speaker 1>case, aren't they? That's gotta work with every

00:28:06.169 --> 00:28:07.770
<v Speaker 1>node app. So it's gonna have all the

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:09.369
<v Speaker 1>bells and whistles in it.

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:11.610
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna, you know, it's gonna be big.

00:28:13.035 --> 00:28:15.675
<v Speaker 1>You know, I I think there's a there's

00:28:15.675 --> 00:28:16.395
<v Speaker 1>clearly

00:28:17.195 --> 00:28:19.035
<v Speaker 1>well, I mean, I've done whole conference talks

00:28:19.035 --> 00:28:21.995
<v Speaker 1>about how you reduce vulnerability counts in in

00:28:21.995 --> 00:28:24.875
<v Speaker 1>in Docker images, you know, but, obviously, using

00:28:24.875 --> 00:28:25.275
<v Speaker 1>slim,

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:26.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:30.220
<v Speaker 1>slim versions in production is gonna reduce your

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.380
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability count. It's probably not a good idea

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.220
<v Speaker 1>to be deploying things in production

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:38.140
<v Speaker 1>that use those generic language run times because,

00:28:38.515 --> 00:28:40.674
<v Speaker 1>you know, they're just solving for the big

00:28:40.674 --> 00:28:42.674
<v Speaker 1>use case. They're great for trying things out

00:28:42.674 --> 00:28:44.514
<v Speaker 1>because you know they're gonna work every time,

00:28:44.755 --> 00:28:46.674
<v Speaker 1>but you probably don't wanna deploy that in

00:28:46.674 --> 00:28:48.355
<v Speaker 1>production. I mean, I think if you click

00:28:48.355 --> 00:28:50.355
<v Speaker 1>the show more upgrade types there

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:53.650
<v Speaker 1>on the left there, there should probably be

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:56.370
<v Speaker 1>some yeah. There you go. So the node

00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:57.649
<v Speaker 1>slim images,

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:00.929
<v Speaker 1>you know, have much less vulnerabilities in them.

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:03.170
<v Speaker 0>Right.

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:05.090
<v Speaker 0>Okay. And I I guess that's just because

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:05.490
<v Speaker 0>they have

00:29:06.355 --> 00:29:07.954
<v Speaker 0>less less packages

00:29:08.355 --> 00:29:10.274
<v Speaker 0>and the Yeah. Yeah. I mean, less less

00:29:10.274 --> 00:29:12.674
<v Speaker 1>packages, clearly. And I mean, you know, so

00:29:12.755 --> 00:29:15.075
<v Speaker 1>but there's, you know, the workflow that that

00:29:15.075 --> 00:29:15.715
<v Speaker 1>people

00:29:16.034 --> 00:29:18.434
<v Speaker 1>I mean, if you probably, for example, you

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:20.910
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't use that to build your application,

00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:22.670
<v Speaker 1>that that slim image because it's not gonna

00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:24.830
<v Speaker 1>have your build tools in there. Yeah. But,

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:26.830
<v Speaker 1>you know, the so this is where this

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:30.270
<v Speaker 1>idea of of multistage builds comes into play.

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Right? So if I'm in my in my

00:29:31.995 --> 00:29:34.555
<v Speaker 1>build system, I probably do wanna be using

00:29:34.715 --> 00:29:37.755
<v Speaker 1>maybe I do wanna use that node 14.15

00:29:37.755 --> 00:29:40.555
<v Speaker 1>base image to build my software, but then

00:29:40.555 --> 00:29:42.235
<v Speaker 1>I wanna take that software

00:29:42.235 --> 00:29:43.274
<v Speaker 1>out of that

00:29:43.675 --> 00:29:45.675
<v Speaker 1>and put it into a slim image for

00:29:45.675 --> 00:29:48.150
<v Speaker 1>deployment in a multistage build.

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.990
<v Speaker 1>So,

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:52.630
<v Speaker 1>yeah, probably too much too much to go

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:54.790
<v Speaker 1>into in in this session, but,

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:56.630
<v Speaker 1>you know, there are lots of folks who

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:58.790
<v Speaker 1>who talk very eloquently about

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:00.230
<v Speaker 1>the best practices for

00:30:01.125 --> 00:30:02.085
<v Speaker 1>for for managing

00:30:02.325 --> 00:30:06.085
<v Speaker 1>container images in production. Right? But, yeah, generic

00:30:06.085 --> 00:30:08.005
<v Speaker 1>language run times are not usually a very

00:30:08.005 --> 00:30:09.285
<v Speaker 1>good choice for

00:30:10.165 --> 00:30:11.845
<v Speaker 1>from security perspective.

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:16.149
<v Speaker 0>It's one of those things that I think

00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:17.750
<v Speaker 0>I know in the back of my head

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:19.429
<v Speaker 0>and I just have never really

00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:23.110
<v Speaker 0>never really given enough attention to think, yeah,

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:26.405
<v Speaker 0>I probably should try and either build my

00:30:26.405 --> 00:30:28.325
<v Speaker 0>own. It's just so easy to use these

00:30:28.325 --> 00:30:30.245
<v Speaker 0>generic ones, isn't it? Because things just I

00:30:30.245 --> 00:30:30.804
<v Speaker 1>mean, I

00:30:31.284 --> 00:30:32.804
<v Speaker 1>I think that's always the path of least

00:30:32.804 --> 00:30:35.525
<v Speaker 1>resistance is always a bit of the issue,

00:30:35.525 --> 00:30:37.044
<v Speaker 1>isn't it? You know? And I mean, I

00:30:37.044 --> 00:30:39.044
<v Speaker 1>I guess the flip side to that is

00:30:39.125 --> 00:30:39.924
<v Speaker 1>the same with

00:30:40.429 --> 00:30:41.230
<v Speaker 1>with

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:43.790
<v Speaker 1>tools that can help us. We don't want

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:45.630
<v Speaker 1>things that are gonna put loads of barriers

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:47.470
<v Speaker 1>in our way. So that's what we try

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:48.990
<v Speaker 1>to do with Snyk is to say, well,

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:51.309
<v Speaker 1>look, here's the solution, you know, an easy

00:30:51.309 --> 00:30:53.630
<v Speaker 1>solution that's not that doesn't loads of friction

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:54.749
<v Speaker 1>for you. So

00:30:56.725 --> 00:30:57.284
<v Speaker 1>yeah.

00:30:58.645 --> 00:31:00.885
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's see what else we've got on

00:31:00.885 --> 00:31:02.565
<v Speaker 0>this UI then.

00:31:03.365 --> 00:31:05.524
<v Speaker 0>I'll go back to the home page.

00:31:05.765 --> 00:31:07.524
<v Speaker 0>This is all my vulnerabilities

00:31:09.284 --> 00:31:10.850
<v Speaker 0>and project. So I think we probably had

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:12.610
<v Speaker 1>some more interesting things to look at in

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:14.769
<v Speaker 1>that in that particular project. Right?

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:17.490
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. We still got the code analysis that

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:19.330
<v Speaker 0>we haven't clicked on yet. I've got a

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:21.409
<v Speaker 0>good grasp of what the package JSON scanning

00:31:21.409 --> 00:31:22.690
<v Speaker 0>does. That makes a lot of sense to

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:24.845
<v Speaker 0>me. We looked at the Dockerfile, I got

00:31:24.845 --> 00:31:25.804
<v Speaker 0>that that just

00:31:26.365 --> 00:31:29.245
<v Speaker 0>nice convenience things. Also the Debian image, lots

00:31:29.245 --> 00:31:32.365
<v Speaker 0>of vulnerabilities there, so basically coincides with what

00:31:32.365 --> 00:31:33.885
<v Speaker 0>you're saying, don't do that. Like here's the

00:31:33.885 --> 00:31:35.725
<v Speaker 0>nice custom bespoke one and you can see

00:31:35.725 --> 00:31:37.164
<v Speaker 0>that. Look at that. Six

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:40.110
<v Speaker 0>seven. Sorry. Seven vulnerabilities.

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:41.950
<v Speaker 0>Much better than the hundred I mean, it's

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:43.789
<v Speaker 1>important to I think it's important for to

00:31:43.789 --> 00:31:46.030
<v Speaker 1>to to kinda get your head around that

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:48.270
<v Speaker 1>in in container images, you're almost never gonna

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:49.230
<v Speaker 1>have zero vulnerabilities.

00:31:49.865 --> 00:31:51.945
<v Speaker 1>I mean, it's just not that's not that

00:31:51.945 --> 00:31:53.545
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't really be your goal

00:31:53.865 --> 00:31:57.065
<v Speaker 1>to have zero because unless you've unless you've,

00:31:57.065 --> 00:31:58.745
<v Speaker 1>like, built a scratch image and all you

00:31:58.745 --> 00:32:01.305
<v Speaker 1>put in it is, like, a compiled c

00:32:01.305 --> 00:32:02.665
<v Speaker 1>binary or a go binary,

00:32:03.169 --> 00:32:04.609
<v Speaker 1>It's just not realistic.

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:06.690
<v Speaker 1>So you kind of have to you have

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:07.489
<v Speaker 1>to set

00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:09.169
<v Speaker 1>set,

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:11.730
<v Speaker 1>I guess, a strategy. Right? And, I mean,

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:13.570
<v Speaker 1>you know, I I kinda say, well, perhaps

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:14.690
<v Speaker 1>your strategy is, like,

00:32:16.375 --> 00:32:19.495
<v Speaker 1>no no high vulnerabilities in production that have

00:32:19.495 --> 00:32:20.455
<v Speaker 1>an exploit

00:32:20.535 --> 00:32:23.015
<v Speaker 1>and nothing that has a fix. Yeah. That

00:32:23.015 --> 00:32:24.855
<v Speaker 1>might be a good strategy. That'll probably get

00:32:24.855 --> 00:32:26.855
<v Speaker 1>you down to, you know, very small numbers

00:32:26.855 --> 00:32:30.790
<v Speaker 1>of vulnerabilities. But, yeah, aiming for zero is

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:32.309
<v Speaker 1>probably not realistic.

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:35.110
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. And it feels to me like I

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:36.230
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if it's quite half the

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:37.750
<v Speaker 0>battle, but I'm gonna say half the battle

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:39.750
<v Speaker 0>is just being aware of which vulnerabilities actually

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:41.750
<v Speaker 0>exist in my prod environment. Because I'm assuming,

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:44.784
<v Speaker 0>if I know the seven or 20 vulnerabilities

00:32:44.784 --> 00:32:46.705
<v Speaker 0>I've got, I could maybe put things in

00:32:46.705 --> 00:32:48.704
<v Speaker 0>place to make sure they're not exploitable

00:32:48.705 --> 00:32:50.705
<v Speaker 0>in my environment even if there's not a

00:32:50.705 --> 00:32:53.184
<v Speaker 0>ready fix available. It could just be blocking

00:32:53.184 --> 00:32:55.345
<v Speaker 0>firewall ports or certain endpoints on your app

00:32:55.345 --> 00:32:56.600
<v Speaker 0>or whatever.

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Exactly. I mean, you know, I

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.200
<v Speaker 1>is always a bit about trade offs really,

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.560
<v Speaker 1>isn't it? You know, it's about trade off

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.480
<v Speaker 1>between effort versus risk.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.720
<v Speaker 1>And so, you know, you might decide that

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.559
<v Speaker 1>let's say, for example,

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.525
<v Speaker 1>you know, we only perhaps we only care

00:33:12.525 --> 00:33:14.924
<v Speaker 1>about vulnerabilities that are exploitable

00:33:14.925 --> 00:33:16.044
<v Speaker 1>over the network.

00:33:16.285 --> 00:33:18.445
<v Speaker 1>And when we look at the CLI scanning,

00:33:18.445 --> 00:33:19.965
<v Speaker 1>we can talk a bit about how you

00:33:19.965 --> 00:33:21.245
<v Speaker 1>can actually, like,

00:33:22.445 --> 00:33:23.725
<v Speaker 1>sort of filter results,

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:26.230
<v Speaker 1>you know, based on those CVSS things just

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:27.990
<v Speaker 1>to get say, only give me high things

00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:30.070
<v Speaker 1>that are exploitable over the network. But you

00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:31.990
<v Speaker 1>because you might decide that actually

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:35.750
<v Speaker 1>things that require a local shell

00:33:36.645 --> 00:33:38.645
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not exploited. The risk of them

00:33:38.645 --> 00:33:41.684
<v Speaker 1>being exploited in my environment is minimal because

00:33:41.845 --> 00:33:43.765
<v Speaker 1>I use distro list for everything, which doesn't

00:33:43.765 --> 00:33:45.365
<v Speaker 1>have any shells or,

00:33:45.525 --> 00:33:47.765
<v Speaker 1>you know, whatever. But, you know,

00:33:48.325 --> 00:33:50.805
<v Speaker 1>there there's always there's always sort of trade

00:33:50.805 --> 00:33:52.565
<v Speaker 1>offs of of

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:55.250
<v Speaker 1>decision making about how you decide whether something's

00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:58.610
<v Speaker 1>exploitable in your environment or not.

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:00.050
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:03.250
<v Speaker 0>Thank you for that. So do you wanna

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:04.930
<v Speaker 0>jump into what we look at code analysis?

00:34:06.184 --> 00:34:08.425
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So code analysis is a is is

00:34:08.425 --> 00:34:10.105
<v Speaker 1>very cool. This is pretty new.

00:34:10.665 --> 00:34:12.585
<v Speaker 1>This is about vulnerabilities

00:34:12.585 --> 00:34:14.025
<v Speaker 1>in your own code. And I think if

00:34:14.025 --> 00:34:15.625
<v Speaker 1>we when we look at if we have

00:34:15.625 --> 00:34:16.985
<v Speaker 1>a look at Versus Code,

00:34:17.145 --> 00:34:19.225
<v Speaker 1>you know, it probably shows, you know, some

00:34:19.225 --> 00:34:21.550
<v Speaker 1>of the things that are really cool about

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:22.909
<v Speaker 1>about Snykode.

00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:23.390
<v Speaker 1>So

00:34:24.109 --> 00:34:26.030
<v Speaker 1>this this kind of analysis used to be

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.989
<v Speaker 1>super slow.

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:29.070
<v Speaker 1>And, you know, years ago, you used to

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:31.310
<v Speaker 1>have, like, you'd run these things overnight, you

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:32.670
<v Speaker 1>know, and they they turned

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:34.510
<v Speaker 1>turned up millions of

00:34:34.764 --> 00:34:36.925
<v Speaker 1>of false positives and, you know, they were

00:34:36.925 --> 00:34:39.565
<v Speaker 1>really just there. Like you said earlier, you

00:34:39.565 --> 00:34:41.244
<v Speaker 1>know, oh, we do this once a quarter

00:34:41.244 --> 00:34:43.324
<v Speaker 1>for audit and someone writes a report and

00:34:43.324 --> 00:34:45.965
<v Speaker 1>then, you know, everybody ignores it or whatever.

00:34:46.205 --> 00:34:46.605
<v Speaker 1>But

00:34:47.079 --> 00:34:50.119
<v Speaker 1>so Snykode actually uses machine learning. So it's

00:34:50.119 --> 00:34:52.280
<v Speaker 1>got it's it's fast enough to to do

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.679
<v Speaker 1>in real time in your IDE.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.480
<v Speaker 1>But what's really focused on is code errors.

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.640
<v Speaker 1>So in your own code, not code that

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:01.400
<v Speaker 1>you've brought in through a package or whatever.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.415
<v Speaker 1>This is stuff you've written yourself.

00:35:05.335 --> 00:35:05.895
<v Speaker 1>And

00:35:06.295 --> 00:35:08.375
<v Speaker 1>so I what I really like is it

00:35:08.375 --> 00:35:11.095
<v Speaker 1>shows you the flow of what's gonna happen.

00:35:11.255 --> 00:35:12.535
<v Speaker 1>I don't know whether it does it in

00:35:12.535 --> 00:35:14.055
<v Speaker 1>the UI actually, but in the in the

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:16.470
<v Speaker 1>so what happens if you click full details?

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:17.990
<v Speaker 1>I have to admit, I've not looked at

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:20.870
<v Speaker 1>this much inside the the web UI. Well,

00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:23.110
<v Speaker 0>I'm just loving the description of these here.

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:24.870
<v Speaker 0>Like, this one is telling me that we

00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:27.030
<v Speaker 0>can have exception flows. I'm assuming that's because

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:29.395
<v Speaker 0>we got, you know, random access or variable

00:35:29.395 --> 00:35:31.234
<v Speaker 0>access to maps,

00:35:31.234 --> 00:35:32.435
<v Speaker 0>which is obviously scary.

00:35:33.075 --> 00:35:34.915
<v Speaker 0>This one I'm assume is telling me that

00:35:34.915 --> 00:35:37.395
<v Speaker 0>I've got unsanitized input from HTTP,

00:35:37.395 --> 00:35:39.395
<v Speaker 0>which I'm assuming the fail path comes from

00:35:39.395 --> 00:35:41.075
<v Speaker 0>and we're throwing that straight into a function.

00:35:41.075 --> 00:35:42.434
<v Speaker 0>And you know what? These are like, oh,

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.040
<v Speaker 0>you know, they work at the time. It

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.400
<v Speaker 1>shows you it

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.800
<v Speaker 1>shows you actually how oh, look. No. There

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.080
<v Speaker 1>you go. So it'll show you in the

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.080
<v Speaker 1>code how that's got in there. So if

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:53.600
<v Speaker 1>you click through all those steps,

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
<v Speaker 1>it'll show you, you know, it's gone through

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.160
<v Speaker 1>and gone. Here's where this got it came

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.775
<v Speaker 1>in. Here's where it's flowing through. It's flowing

00:36:00.775 --> 00:36:02.855
<v Speaker 1>through here. It's flowing through here. And then

00:36:02.855 --> 00:36:04.135
<v Speaker 1>you use it like this.

00:36:05.415 --> 00:36:07.495
<v Speaker 0>That is ridiculous. It's super cool.

00:36:09.575 --> 00:36:10.615
<v Speaker 0>Oh, that is awesome.

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:14.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And, I mean, it'll do that in

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:15.270
<v Speaker 1>the in the

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:17.029
<v Speaker 1>in in

00:36:17.029 --> 00:36:19.349
<v Speaker 1>in the IDE, like, what you know, in

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:21.349
<v Speaker 1>as a live scan

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:24.069
<v Speaker 1>and show you exactly the code path by

00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:26.505
<v Speaker 1>which that that so presumably, we're talking about

00:36:26.505 --> 00:36:28.185
<v Speaker 1>that file path that

00:36:28.185 --> 00:36:30.505
<v Speaker 1>file path variable there. Right?

00:36:31.545 --> 00:36:33.305
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's nice how you can see how

00:36:33.305 --> 00:36:35.704
<v Speaker 0>it kinda it gets composed together. You can

00:36:35.704 --> 00:36:38.185
<v Speaker 0>see here we're accessing the params

00:36:38.185 --> 00:36:40.185
<v Speaker 0>on the HTTP request to get a name.

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:43.120
<v Speaker 0>'re then calling a function, passing it in,

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:45.120
<v Speaker 0>and then it leaks through until eventually we

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.720
<v Speaker 0>pass it into the send file.

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:50.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's neat, isn't it? And I think

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:51.840
<v Speaker 1>if you click on the fix analysis

00:36:53.535 --> 00:36:57.215
<v Speaker 1>there, it should show you examples of how

00:36:57.535 --> 00:36:59.535
<v Speaker 1>yeah. So there you go. So it's behind

00:36:59.775 --> 00:37:01.695
<v Speaker 1>the scenes, it's also got this massive

00:37:04.494 --> 00:37:07.535
<v Speaker 1>learning database of of open source code. Right?

00:37:07.535 --> 00:37:09.530
<v Speaker 1>So it actually

00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:13.130
<v Speaker 1>show you how other projects have

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:15.290
<v Speaker 1>fixed the same problem.

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:17.930
<v Speaker 1>So you've got three, I think, example fixes

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:20.330
<v Speaker 1>there from different open source projects.

00:37:21.155 --> 00:37:23.555
<v Speaker 1>So it's showing you examples of how,

00:37:23.795 --> 00:37:26.035
<v Speaker 1>you know, not just, you know, how how

00:37:26.035 --> 00:37:26.755
<v Speaker 1>you

00:37:26.915 --> 00:37:28.755
<v Speaker 1>could fix it, but how others have fixed

00:37:28.755 --> 00:37:30.755
<v Speaker 1>the same the same things. So I'll give

00:37:30.755 --> 00:37:32.275
<v Speaker 1>you examples from the real world.

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:35.500
<v Speaker 0>Nice. It's neat. Right?

00:37:36.539 --> 00:37:38.940
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I didn't expect to get like just

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:41.500
<v Speaker 0>that one screen with the way the code

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:43.500
<v Speaker 0>flows through. That was

00:37:43.819 --> 00:37:45.579
<v Speaker 0>that was neat. I like that a lot.

00:37:47.015 --> 00:37:48.375
<v Speaker 0>And you're saying that works in my Versus

00:37:48.375 --> 00:37:49.815
<v Speaker 0>Code as well. Do want should we pop

00:37:49.815 --> 00:37:50.535
<v Speaker 0>it open?

00:37:51.415 --> 00:37:53.735
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. If you've got the Snyk plugin

00:37:53.735 --> 00:37:55.655
<v Speaker 1>installed in your Versus Code,

00:37:56.215 --> 00:37:58.455
<v Speaker 1>it should it should do it. Do you

00:37:58.455 --> 00:38:00.135
<v Speaker 1>have a little Snyk icon somewhere?

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:03.310
<v Speaker 0>Yep. There we go. Yeah. You have. Right?

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:03.790
<v Speaker 1>So

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:06.430
<v Speaker 1>and and I assume you I think you

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:08.990
<v Speaker 1>need to auth via the CLI, but if

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:10.830
<v Speaker 1>you've had the CLI working, it should already

00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:11.710
<v Speaker 1>be authed?

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:15.295
<v Speaker 0>No. I haven't actually installed the CLI. There's

00:38:15.295 --> 00:38:16.735
<v Speaker 0>something I'll use. Oh, I think it's working

00:38:16.735 --> 00:38:18.095
<v Speaker 1>there anyway. Right? I'm I'm

00:38:18.735 --> 00:38:20.735
<v Speaker 1>that's a bit small for my old eyes

00:38:20.735 --> 00:38:22.735
<v Speaker 1>to see in this window, but

00:38:23.855 --> 00:38:25.295
<v Speaker 0>It's the right I think yeah. So this

00:38:25.295 --> 00:38:27.775
<v Speaker 1>is all coming from Snykode. Yeah. So so

00:38:27.775 --> 00:38:28.575
<v Speaker 1>you can see these.

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.680
<v Speaker 1>And I think if you write

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:34.240
<v Speaker 1>yeah. So that's showing you the and if

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:35.920
<v Speaker 1>you right click, it should get

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.240
<v Speaker 1>you should get the

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:41.600
<v Speaker 1>the extra window that gives you yeah. There

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:41.840
<v Speaker 1>you go.

00:38:43.035 --> 00:38:44.795
<v Speaker 1>So you you should have the same thing

00:38:44.795 --> 00:38:47.115
<v Speaker 1>there where it's saying showing the flows.

00:38:47.755 --> 00:38:49.355
<v Speaker 0>Let's see if can get the same one

00:38:49.355 --> 00:38:51.035
<v Speaker 0>so it matches up.

00:38:52.555 --> 00:38:54.475
<v Speaker 0>There we go. There's the same one. Okay.

00:38:54.635 --> 00:38:55.035
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:38:58.960 --> 00:38:59.600
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So you get all that same stuff

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:05.119
<v Speaker 1>in your IDE, and that that will actually,

00:39:05.119 --> 00:39:07.599
<v Speaker 1>you know it's it's fast enough that you

00:39:07.599 --> 00:39:10.160
<v Speaker 1>can be getting that stuff while you

00:39:10.795 --> 00:39:12.075
<v Speaker 1>while you're

00:39:12.315 --> 00:39:13.195
<v Speaker 1>coding.

00:39:16.875 --> 00:39:19.515
<v Speaker 0>I like that it's actually in my IDE.

00:39:19.515 --> 00:39:21.275
<v Speaker 0>I'm actually getting a red squiggle from the

00:39:21.275 --> 00:39:24.089
<v Speaker 0>vulnerability scanner. You know, it's like no. It's

00:39:24.089 --> 00:39:25.609
<v Speaker 0>not an error, but it's definitely a high

00:39:25.609 --> 00:39:27.450
<v Speaker 0>vulnerability thing that I probably wanna be aware

00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:29.130
<v Speaker 0>of and then the description of the issue

00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:29.609
<v Speaker 0>here.

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:31.930
<v Speaker 0>So that kind of integration is good because

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:33.609
<v Speaker 0>then it's front and center with me all

00:39:33.609 --> 00:39:35.289
<v Speaker 0>the time when I'm writing my code. Well,

00:39:35.289 --> 00:39:37.545
<v Speaker 1>I mean, that yeah. And that's again, that's

00:39:37.545 --> 00:39:39.945
<v Speaker 1>part of this developer first thing is, like,

00:39:40.105 --> 00:39:41.945
<v Speaker 1>you know because, really,

00:39:42.185 --> 00:39:44.025
<v Speaker 1>I mean, I don't know whether you've you've

00:39:44.025 --> 00:39:44.825
<v Speaker 1>you've read

00:39:45.225 --> 00:39:47.785
<v Speaker 1>things like I I assume that the the

00:39:47.785 --> 00:39:50.425
<v Speaker 1>cloud native security white paper, but that the

00:39:50.505 --> 00:39:53.460
<v Speaker 1>that CNCF six security did last year and

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:56.420
<v Speaker 1>Liz Rice's book on on cloud native security

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:58.660
<v Speaker 1>and things. You know, it's really about sort

00:39:58.660 --> 00:39:59.220
<v Speaker 1>of

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:02.980
<v Speaker 1>integrating security all the way through

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:03.860
<v Speaker 1>our

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:04.900
<v Speaker 1>SDLC.

00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Right? Because, you know, we're in

00:40:07.125 --> 00:40:10.405
<v Speaker 1>CICD pipeline kind of mode and and code

00:40:10.405 --> 00:40:13.205
<v Speaker 1>continuously flowing. So what we need to do

00:40:13.205 --> 00:40:16.165
<v Speaker 1>really is to integrate in all points in

00:40:16.165 --> 00:40:18.485
<v Speaker 1>that in that process. And the first point

00:40:18.485 --> 00:40:20.645
<v Speaker 1>is clearly developer eyeballs. Right? This is the

00:40:20.645 --> 00:40:22.005
<v Speaker 1>place where it's cheapest to fix.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:26.320
<v Speaker 1>And, you know, so providing tools that give

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:30.400
<v Speaker 1>developers easy insights into issues before they even

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.160
<v Speaker 1>get into into

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.680
<v Speaker 1>source code management

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:36.080
<v Speaker 1>is clearly gonna be your best your your

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.360
<v Speaker 1>best point to start at.

00:40:38.415 --> 00:40:40.735
<v Speaker 1>So these kind of integrations are really,

00:40:41.135 --> 00:40:43.455
<v Speaker 1>you know, sort of key for us is

00:40:43.455 --> 00:40:46.495
<v Speaker 1>make it super easy to for developers to

00:40:46.495 --> 00:40:48.815
<v Speaker 1>get that information right in the ID, right

00:40:48.815 --> 00:40:50.015
<v Speaker 1>in the CLI,

00:40:50.175 --> 00:40:52.415
<v Speaker 1>you know, and and and so you can

00:40:52.415 --> 00:40:52.895
<v Speaker 1>fix things

00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:55.580
<v Speaker 1>super easily, super quickly.

00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:59.180
<v Speaker 0>Nice. I like that. Very, cool.

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:02.860
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:05.900
<v Speaker 0>I don't think we're gonna be able to

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:07.180
<v Speaker 0>fix 50 issues,

00:41:09.605 --> 00:41:11.525
<v Speaker 0>But that number doesn't seem as scary to

00:41:11.525 --> 00:41:13.365
<v Speaker 0>me as some of those Docker container image

00:41:13.365 --> 00:41:15.685
<v Speaker 0>ones, so that's at least a positive.

00:41:17.285 --> 00:41:18.565
<v Speaker 0>Lots of details.

00:41:18.725 --> 00:41:19.605
<v Speaker 0>Very cool. Alright.

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:24.250
<v Speaker 0>Let's jump back over. Where were we? Projects.

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:27.130
<v Speaker 0>Is there anything else on the UI side

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:28.410
<v Speaker 0>of things that we should take a look

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:28.890
<v Speaker 0>at?

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:32.730
<v Speaker 1>So there's obviously a lot of functions. I

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:35.609
<v Speaker 1>mean, it's probably less interesting to this organization,

00:41:35.609 --> 00:41:37.055
<v Speaker 1>but, you know, there's a lot of that

00:41:37.055 --> 00:41:37.935
<v Speaker 1>stuff about

00:41:38.895 --> 00:41:41.295
<v Speaker 1>how you would do things in a bigger

00:41:41.295 --> 00:41:43.855
<v Speaker 1>organization. So being able to ignore things, being

00:41:43.855 --> 00:41:45.615
<v Speaker 1>able to report on things.

00:41:46.015 --> 00:41:48.015
<v Speaker 1>But I think we've we've sort of

00:41:48.414 --> 00:41:50.575
<v Speaker 1>covered the the the developer,

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:54.580
<v Speaker 1>you know, kind of focused bits in the

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:56.180
<v Speaker 1>in the UI,

00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:57.300
<v Speaker 1>I think.

00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:00.740
<v Speaker 1>Mhmm. What about importing Docker images from

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:01.860
<v Speaker 1>Docker Hub?

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:05.700
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So is that do I add a

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:06.180
<v Speaker 0>new thing?

00:42:06.795 --> 00:42:09.515
<v Speaker 0>Yep. No. Yeah. Oh, you so you haven't

00:42:09.515 --> 00:42:09.755
<v Speaker 1>got

00:42:10.474 --> 00:42:11.915
<v Speaker 1>yeah. So you'll need to

00:42:12.555 --> 00:42:15.915
<v Speaker 1>add connect with with Docker Hub. If we

00:42:15.915 --> 00:42:17.755
<v Speaker 1>go down a little bit, there we go.

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:22.710
<v Speaker 0>I'll maybe move that over here.

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:26.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Maybe take that off the screen temporarily.

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:29.030
<v Speaker 0>Where'd it go?

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:30.550
<v Speaker 0>One,

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:30.870
<v Speaker 0>two.

00:42:35.765 --> 00:42:37.765
<v Speaker 0>There we go. Okay. Let me grab my

00:42:37.765 --> 00:42:39.445
<v Speaker 0>token then from the Docker Hub.

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:51.430
<v Speaker 0>Talking new

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:53.270
<v Speaker 0>Snyk.

00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:56.550
<v Speaker 0>And there we go.

00:43:01.455 --> 00:43:03.775
<v Speaker 0>You hate it anyway. I'll see if

00:43:05.615 --> 00:43:06.415
<v Speaker 0>and see if

00:43:10.575 --> 00:43:12.015
<v Speaker 1>there we go. So now if you wanna

00:43:12.015 --> 00:43:13.935
<v Speaker 1>scan your images

00:43:13.935 --> 00:43:16.015
<v Speaker 1>on an ongoing basis that you've got in

00:43:16.015 --> 00:43:18.510
<v Speaker 1>Docker Hub, It's as simple as it was

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:19.710
<v Speaker 1>importing from the

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:22.030
<v Speaker 1>from from

00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:24.110
<v Speaker 1>GitHub.

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:25.870
<v Speaker 1>And this works with a whole bunch of

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:26.830
<v Speaker 1>different registries. Right?

00:43:29.875 --> 00:43:31.075
<v Speaker 1>ECR,

00:43:32.275 --> 00:43:33.315
<v Speaker 1>Quave,

00:43:33.715 --> 00:43:34.755
<v Speaker 1>who else?

00:43:37.315 --> 00:43:38.115
<v Speaker 1>Google,

00:43:38.355 --> 00:43:40.675
<v Speaker 1>blah blah blah. Pretty much everybody.

00:43:41.315 --> 00:43:42.915
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. There was quite a lot of

00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:44.830
<v Speaker 0>options there, wasn't there?

00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:47.710
<v Speaker 0>And it seems to work with pretty much

00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:50.350
<v Speaker 0>all the major source code repositories.

00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:52.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Some of them Some of them like

00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:53.310
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:55.950
<v Speaker 1>We're working on on on on more of

00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:56.109
<v Speaker 1>them.

00:43:57.615 --> 00:43:59.535
<v Speaker 1>Some of them, you know, are are a

00:43:59.535 --> 00:44:01.215
<v Speaker 1>sort of paid upgrade because it tends to

00:44:01.215 --> 00:44:03.295
<v Speaker 1>be more enterprise customers who are using those

00:44:03.295 --> 00:44:03.855
<v Speaker 1>ones.

00:44:04.255 --> 00:44:04.815
<v Speaker 1>But

00:44:08.015 --> 00:44:09.535
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. All the major CIs,

00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:13.270
<v Speaker 0>all the editors. Wow. That's a lot of

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:14.070
<v Speaker 0>integration.

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:18.790
<v Speaker 0>But it it seems to me it doesn't

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:21.270
<v Speaker 0>really matter what stack your organization is using.

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:23.685
<v Speaker 0>It's gonna be covered. Yeah. And, I mean,

00:44:23.685 --> 00:44:25.045
<v Speaker 1>in in a lot of cases, you know,

00:44:25.045 --> 00:44:26.645
<v Speaker 1>if it's not there and, I mean, you'd

00:44:26.645 --> 00:44:27.925
<v Speaker 1>have to be pretty far off the beaten

00:44:27.925 --> 00:44:29.525
<v Speaker 1>track for this not to be like a

00:44:29.525 --> 00:44:30.885
<v Speaker 1>first class integration.

00:44:31.285 --> 00:44:33.205
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of times, you can integrate

00:44:33.205 --> 00:44:35.445
<v Speaker 1>just with the CLI anyway. Right? Especially if

00:44:35.445 --> 00:44:37.605
<v Speaker 1>you're in a if you're doing CI stuff,

00:44:37.605 --> 00:44:40.079
<v Speaker 1>for example, you know, you can write CI

00:44:40.079 --> 00:44:42.720
<v Speaker 1>string CLI strings that are gonna be able

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:45.280
<v Speaker 1>to glue together almost anything. So,

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:49.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah, it's integrations are kinda key part of

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:50.800
<v Speaker 1>of

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.520
<v Speaker 1>making it super easy for folks to use.

00:44:54.665 --> 00:44:57.145
<v Speaker 0>I'm curious about this Kubernetes one here. Does

00:44:57.145 --> 00:45:00.265
<v Speaker 0>that scan, like, my deployments for maybe anti

00:45:00.265 --> 00:45:03.545
<v Speaker 0>patterns over exposing too many ports, like or

00:45:03.545 --> 00:45:05.385
<v Speaker 0>if I just made that up? To be

00:45:05.385 --> 00:45:06.345
<v Speaker 1>a container.

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:08.570
<v Speaker 1>No, because

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:10.810
<v Speaker 1>so at the minute, we're not doing

00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:16.010
<v Speaker 1>we're not doing deployed environment scanning for configuration

00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:17.130
<v Speaker 1>in Kubernetes.

00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:19.770
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely something we're we're looking at. If

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:20.730
<v Speaker 1>you if you just

00:45:22.055 --> 00:45:23.415
<v Speaker 1>scroll up slightly,

00:45:23.575 --> 00:45:26.135
<v Speaker 1>one thing that is coming soon is is

00:45:26.214 --> 00:45:27.895
<v Speaker 1>and in some ways, we'd probably do the

00:45:27.974 --> 00:45:30.615
<v Speaker 1>a similar thing with Kubernetes, but is we're

00:45:30.694 --> 00:45:33.255
<v Speaker 1>we've got this this thing to scan deployed

00:45:33.255 --> 00:45:34.775
<v Speaker 1>AWS environments.

00:45:34.775 --> 00:45:37.390
<v Speaker 1>So Oh, yeah. You know, rather as well

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:39.470
<v Speaker 1>as just being able to look at Terraform

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:42.190
<v Speaker 1>before you've actually spun something up, we can

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:43.390
<v Speaker 1>actually, like, query

00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:47.630
<v Speaker 1>your configured AWS environment and say, well, there's

00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:50.285
<v Speaker 1>x, you know, security issues there. And that'd

00:45:50.285 --> 00:45:51.964
<v Speaker 1>be super cool to do with Kubernetes as

00:45:51.964 --> 00:45:53.405
<v Speaker 1>well. Right? It's to be able to look

00:45:53.405 --> 00:45:55.484
<v Speaker 1>and say, you know, let's look at the

00:45:55.484 --> 00:45:57.885
<v Speaker 1>deployed environment and see whether there are

00:45:59.165 --> 00:45:59.885
<v Speaker 1>issues.

00:46:00.845 --> 00:46:02.045
<v Speaker 1>In terms of this

00:46:02.444 --> 00:46:03.484
<v Speaker 1>scanning

00:46:03.789 --> 00:46:06.029
<v Speaker 1>for Kubernetes that that is in there in

00:46:06.029 --> 00:46:07.869
<v Speaker 1>the UI that you're seeing, that is

00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:09.230
<v Speaker 1>image scanning.

00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:10.510
<v Speaker 1>So deployed

00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:12.750
<v Speaker 1>deployed containers and

00:46:13.789 --> 00:46:16.190
<v Speaker 1>when you so new containers and containers that

00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:18.509
<v Speaker 1>are already running in your Kubernetes cluster.

00:46:18.945 --> 00:46:19.825
<v Speaker 1>So

00:46:19.825 --> 00:46:21.505
<v Speaker 1>you get a similar thing, you know, if

00:46:21.505 --> 00:46:24.145
<v Speaker 1>I enable the the Kubernetes integration. I get,

00:46:24.145 --> 00:46:24.305
<v Speaker 1>like

00:46:25.105 --> 00:46:26.625
<v Speaker 1>I can see all the images that are

00:46:26.625 --> 00:46:28.625
<v Speaker 1>running in my cluster, and I can choose

00:46:28.625 --> 00:46:29.985
<v Speaker 1>to scan them in the same way that

00:46:29.985 --> 00:46:31.105
<v Speaker 1>I can from Docker Hub.

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.480
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Yeah. That that definitely makes a lot

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:36.720
<v Speaker 0>of sense then. I like that as well.

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:39.839
<v Speaker 0>Oh, there's my image. So this is now

00:46:39.839 --> 00:46:42.960
<v Speaker 0>added Yes, Kyle. My Docker Hub image that

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:45.200
<v Speaker 0>I built just before we went live.

00:46:46.845 --> 00:46:48.845
<v Speaker 0>Let's see what we've got here. Okay.

00:46:57.244 --> 00:46:58.125
<v Speaker 0>So this is

00:46:59.559 --> 00:47:01.640
<v Speaker 0>so what does the I'm curious then. What

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.799
<v Speaker 0>does it mean when it scans a container

00:47:03.799 --> 00:47:06.119
<v Speaker 0>image? Like, is it looking at the Docker

00:47:06.119 --> 00:47:07.320
<v Speaker 0>file and saying,

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:10.200
<v Speaker 0>this image has this, looking at the commands

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:12.040
<v Speaker 0>or is it actually pulling the image and

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:15.105
<v Speaker 0>inspecting what's inside of it? It's pulling the

00:47:15.105 --> 00:47:17.105
<v Speaker 1>image and looking at what's inside it. And

00:47:17.105 --> 00:47:18.785
<v Speaker 1>so it'll be identifying

00:47:20.625 --> 00:47:22.385
<v Speaker 1>so there are two there are two things

00:47:22.385 --> 00:47:24.625
<v Speaker 1>going on here that you can link the

00:47:24.625 --> 00:47:27.185
<v Speaker 1>Dockerfile as well and get so if you

00:47:27.185 --> 00:47:29.745
<v Speaker 1>have the Dockerfile in a GitHub repository, for

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:30.340
<v Speaker 1>example,

00:47:30.579 --> 00:47:32.500
<v Speaker 1>you can link the two things together,

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:34.740
<v Speaker 1>which gives you will give you deeper insights

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:37.220
<v Speaker 1>into how you might fix things. So that

00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:39.700
<v Speaker 1>base image recommendation stuff that we looked at

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:40.980
<v Speaker 1>from the Dockerfile,

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:44.020
<v Speaker 1>that's difficult to do just by looking at

00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:46.175
<v Speaker 1>the image. But if you combine those two

00:47:46.175 --> 00:47:48.095
<v Speaker 1>things, you'll get both. So you can say

00:47:48.095 --> 00:47:50.655
<v Speaker 1>this image in Docker Hub and this Docker

00:47:50.655 --> 00:47:53.295
<v Speaker 1>file in GitHub are the same thing, and

00:47:53.295 --> 00:47:55.535
<v Speaker 1>it'll give you the base image recommendations.

00:47:56.495 --> 00:47:58.255
<v Speaker 1>But what you could see here that's kinda

00:47:58.255 --> 00:48:01.089
<v Speaker 1>neat is it'll show you what the in

00:48:01.089 --> 00:48:03.010
<v Speaker 1>which layers

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:04.850
<v Speaker 1>the

00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:07.970
<v Speaker 1>those particular vulnerabilities have been introduced in. So

00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:10.369
<v Speaker 1>we can see that APK tools one is

00:48:10.369 --> 00:48:13.089
<v Speaker 1>coming I'm assuming this is now based image,

00:48:13.745 --> 00:48:14.385
<v Speaker 1>and

00:48:14.705 --> 00:48:16.225
<v Speaker 1>that's being introduced

00:48:16.465 --> 00:48:18.065
<v Speaker 1>sort of by the base image.

00:48:19.585 --> 00:48:21.425
<v Speaker 1>But if we look at the busy box

00:48:21.425 --> 00:48:23.345
<v Speaker 1>one, it looks like that's been that's been

00:48:23.345 --> 00:48:25.105
<v Speaker 1>added into the image by

00:48:25.665 --> 00:48:27.585
<v Speaker 1>by another layer in the Dockerfile.

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:29.280
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Correct.

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.720
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. There's a whole bunch of stuff happening.

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:39.120
<v Speaker 1>It's detected that from the from the built

00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:40.720
<v Speaker 1>image. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:48:42.545 --> 00:48:43.984
<v Speaker 0>But it does tell me there's a fix

00:48:43.984 --> 00:48:47.184
<v Speaker 0>if I upgrade my BusyBox SSL client. So

00:48:47.585 --> 00:48:48.625
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's handy.

00:48:49.265 --> 00:48:50.865
<v Speaker 1>So and you could see on there, you

00:48:50.865 --> 00:48:52.704
<v Speaker 1>can filter on the left by image layers

00:48:52.704 --> 00:48:54.224
<v Speaker 1>there. So you've got six that are in

00:48:54.224 --> 00:48:56.305
<v Speaker 1>the user instructions and Oh, yeah. And one

00:48:56.305 --> 00:48:57.424
<v Speaker 1>that's in the base image.

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:04.280
<v Speaker 1>So I'm assuming again,

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:05.480
<v Speaker 1>my

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:08.440
<v Speaker 1>eyes are slightly struggling there, but I'm assuming

00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:09.880
<v Speaker 1>probably that rebuilding that.

00:49:14.095 --> 00:49:16.815
<v Speaker 1>If that's fixed, where is it installing

00:49:17.055 --> 00:49:19.295
<v Speaker 1>open SSL, limit SSL?

00:49:22.575 --> 00:49:25.135
<v Speaker 0>So it's doing an APK update

00:49:25.135 --> 00:49:26.255
<v Speaker 0>at

00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:29.670
<v Speaker 0>as I build dependencies Python build. But yeah.

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:30.870
<v Speaker 0>So it looks like it's adding a whole

00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:32.390
<v Speaker 0>bunch of It might actually be that. It

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:34.070
<v Speaker 1>might actually be yeah. If you rebuilt that

00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:35.670
<v Speaker 1>image, it might actually fix those.

00:49:39.055 --> 00:49:41.455
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I I think these are probably penned

00:49:41.455 --> 00:49:43.375
<v Speaker 0>somehow just because I know

00:49:44.255 --> 00:49:46.495
<v Speaker 1>Oh, maybe. Yeah. I built this recently, like

00:49:46.495 --> 00:49:49.455
<v Speaker 0>only an hour ago. No. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

00:49:49.855 --> 00:49:51.375
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'm not sure.

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:55.320
<v Speaker 0>In fact, this is the version

00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:57.800
<v Speaker 0>that we oh, no. That's version I and

00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:00.280
<v Speaker 0>there's a version k. Yeah. There's maybe something

00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:02.119
<v Speaker 0>here. It's not quite shipped to Alpine yet.

00:50:02.119 --> 00:50:02.200
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:50:04.494 --> 00:50:06.815
<v Speaker 1>But that that's an interesting point about about

00:50:06.815 --> 00:50:08.655
<v Speaker 1>Docker images in general. And one of the

00:50:08.655 --> 00:50:09.615
<v Speaker 1>reasons for

00:50:10.895 --> 00:50:12.974
<v Speaker 1>monitoring them on an ongoing basis as well

00:50:12.974 --> 00:50:15.295
<v Speaker 1>as, like, scanning them when you're when you're

00:50:15.295 --> 00:50:16.815
<v Speaker 1>making them. Right? So when I if I

00:50:16.815 --> 00:50:18.734
<v Speaker 1>build a Docker image locally before I push

00:50:18.734 --> 00:50:19.615
<v Speaker 1>it to the registry,

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:22.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna scan it and see whether it's

00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:24.440
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable. I might make some changes, scan it

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:25.000
<v Speaker 1>again,

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:27.240
<v Speaker 1>you know, and I finally got my my

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:29.080
<v Speaker 1>image where I want it, and I push

00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:31.000
<v Speaker 1>it to my my registry.

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:33.865
<v Speaker 1>But, you know, what happens in, like, three

00:50:33.865 --> 00:50:35.704
<v Speaker 1>months' time? I mean, I know I've got

00:50:35.704 --> 00:50:37.385
<v Speaker 1>things in my own Docker Hub that I

00:50:37.385 --> 00:50:39.705
<v Speaker 1>have to say I haven't rebuilt for years.

00:50:40.265 --> 00:50:44.105
<v Speaker 1>And, you know, so that that scans ongoing

00:50:44.105 --> 00:50:46.585
<v Speaker 1>over time. And, I mean, you've imported this

00:50:46.585 --> 00:50:48.730
<v Speaker 1>one into into Snyk, and that'll be scanned

00:50:48.730 --> 00:50:50.010
<v Speaker 1>every twenty four hours.

00:50:50.650 --> 00:50:52.810
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of important to make sure

00:50:52.810 --> 00:50:54.330
<v Speaker 1>that you scan these things on an ongoing

00:50:54.330 --> 00:50:55.530
<v Speaker 1>basis because

00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:58.650
<v Speaker 1>new vulnerabilities happen all the time. Right? And,

00:50:58.650 --> 00:50:58.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,

00:50:59.705 --> 00:51:01.305
<v Speaker 1>I I think we had to we we

00:51:01.305 --> 00:51:02.105
<v Speaker 1>surveyed

00:51:02.105 --> 00:51:04.585
<v Speaker 1>some we did a big survey last year,

00:51:04.585 --> 00:51:06.345
<v Speaker 1>I think, and, you know, it was like

00:51:07.225 --> 00:51:09.065
<v Speaker 1>one of the questions was, how do you

00:51:09.065 --> 00:51:10.025
<v Speaker 1>find out about

00:51:10.585 --> 00:51:13.305
<v Speaker 1>vulnerabilities for container images you've already got in

00:51:13.305 --> 00:51:15.940
<v Speaker 1>production? I think it was something like 25%

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:18.420
<v Speaker 1>of people said they didn't know. It's like,

00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:19.140
<v Speaker 1>okay.

00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:22.340
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I think I I fall You might

00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:23.220
<v Speaker 1>wanna be worried about

00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:25.780
<v Speaker 0>a minute to that camp where

00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:26.260
<v Speaker 0>yeah.

00:51:28.185 --> 00:51:30.665
<v Speaker 0>I I just guess I I'm I'm fortunate

00:51:30.665 --> 00:51:32.265
<v Speaker 0>that I don't run a lot of stuff

00:51:32.265 --> 00:51:34.585
<v Speaker 0>in production that's not being used by thousands

00:51:34.585 --> 00:51:36.905
<v Speaker 0>of customers or anything like that, know. I

00:51:36.905 --> 00:51:38.825
<v Speaker 0>I'm a developer advocate like you. Like, we

00:51:38.825 --> 00:51:40.345
<v Speaker 0>spend half our time just hacking on stuff

00:51:40.345 --> 00:51:42.860
<v Speaker 0>and throwing out. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So

00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:44.140
<v Speaker 1>I know I noticed we had a quick

00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:45.820
<v Speaker 1>question in the chat there saying, can you

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:47.660
<v Speaker 1>scan like this on the free tier?

00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:50.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Everything I think everything that that we've

00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:52.620
<v Speaker 1>looked at so far is

00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:54.940
<v Speaker 1>is all available in the free tier.

00:51:56.775 --> 00:51:57.895
<v Speaker 0>That's very cool.

00:51:58.935 --> 00:51:59.495
<v Speaker 0>I

00:52:00.375 --> 00:52:02.215
<v Speaker 0>can imagine that would be quite easy.

00:52:03.655 --> 00:52:04.935
<v Speaker 0>Like, I don't know. I feel like if

00:52:04.935 --> 00:52:06.295
<v Speaker 0>I did have stuff in production and I

00:52:06.295 --> 00:52:07.734
<v Speaker 0>I had all of this stuff, I would

00:52:07.734 --> 00:52:08.935
<v Speaker 0>just be on a mission to get those

00:52:08.935 --> 00:52:10.535
<v Speaker 0>numbers as low as possible all the time.

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:11.960
<v Speaker 0>I I think I'd end up making a

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:13.480
<v Speaker 0>game of it and just be like, hey.

00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:15.319
<v Speaker 0>How many of these are going think it's

00:52:15.319 --> 00:52:16.839
<v Speaker 1>interesting when you do start to we see

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.599
<v Speaker 1>we actually see that quite a lot, right,

00:52:18.599 --> 00:52:19.640
<v Speaker 1>is that that

00:52:22.119 --> 00:52:24.280
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the adoption of tools like

00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:26.655
<v Speaker 1>Snyk is is you know, rather than being

00:52:26.735 --> 00:52:28.495
<v Speaker 1>it used to the way security used to

00:52:28.495 --> 00:52:30.495
<v Speaker 1>work was, like, you know, you'd have some

00:52:30.495 --> 00:52:33.135
<v Speaker 1>tool would be bought by the chief security

00:52:33.135 --> 00:52:35.695
<v Speaker 1>officer and just given, you know, you will

00:52:35.695 --> 00:52:36.495
<v Speaker 1>use this.

00:52:36.815 --> 00:52:39.310
<v Speaker 1>And what what we actually find is that

00:52:39.310 --> 00:52:40.590
<v Speaker 1>that developers

00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:41.870
<v Speaker 1>are start are choosing

00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:44.590
<v Speaker 1>to use this quite often than one small

00:52:44.590 --> 00:52:45.710
<v Speaker 1>team will start

00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:47.950
<v Speaker 1>because they want to make sure that their

00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:50.435
<v Speaker 1>stuff is secure. They know that that, you

00:52:50.435 --> 00:52:52.835
<v Speaker 1>know, they're in control of a lot more

00:52:52.835 --> 00:52:55.235
<v Speaker 1>stuff now than they used to be. And

00:52:55.235 --> 00:52:57.235
<v Speaker 1>they we do see that it kinda gets

00:52:57.235 --> 00:52:59.235
<v Speaker 1>a bit gamified, know, that people are like,

00:52:59.235 --> 00:53:00.994
<v Speaker 1>oh, I wanna get those numbers down, you

00:53:00.994 --> 00:53:01.475
<v Speaker 1>know.

00:53:02.835 --> 00:53:05.235
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. You could have, like, company hackathons where

00:53:05.235 --> 00:53:06.940
<v Speaker 0>you owe me up once a month for

00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:09.260
<v Speaker 0>something and just order some pizza, some beers,

00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:10.780
<v Speaker 0>and just, like, like, let's go squash some

00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:11.900
<v Speaker 0>of these vulnerabilities.

00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:12.940
<v Speaker 0>And that would be a whole lot of

00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:14.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I mean, I I I think I

00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:15.740
<v Speaker 1>was talking to

00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:19.020
<v Speaker 1>to some of the folks in Cloud Native

00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Nordics, and they were saying that

00:53:21.755 --> 00:53:22.475
<v Speaker 1>that,

00:53:22.635 --> 00:53:24.155
<v Speaker 1>you know, teams

00:53:24.155 --> 00:53:26.715
<v Speaker 1>get quite into the idea of of having

00:53:26.715 --> 00:53:28.475
<v Speaker 1>the lowest or whatever. Because,

00:53:29.035 --> 00:53:30.875
<v Speaker 1>you know, until you have this information, you

00:53:30.875 --> 00:53:32.635
<v Speaker 1>just don't know, do you? You're like, I

00:53:32.795 --> 00:53:35.915
<v Speaker 1>know. Yeah. I think just to

00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:37.580
<v Speaker 0>bring in that visibility front and center and

00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:39.660
<v Speaker 0>the IDE and the pool request,

00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:41.660
<v Speaker 0>having the UI like this so anyone can

00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:43.340
<v Speaker 0>go check it out. You know, once you

00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:44.860
<v Speaker 0>have those numbers, you can then start to

00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:46.940
<v Speaker 0>build work on remediation and track that number

00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:48.744
<v Speaker 0>coming down like, you know, the worst thing

00:53:48.744 --> 00:53:50.265
<v Speaker 0>I could do is be obvious and the

00:53:50.265 --> 00:53:52.505
<v Speaker 0>number continues to rise and rise and rise.

00:53:52.505 --> 00:53:52.905
<v Speaker 0>And

00:53:53.385 --> 00:53:55.145
<v Speaker 0>eventually, when I was And that's that's all

00:53:55.145 --> 00:53:56.985
<v Speaker 1>in the in the UI as well. It

00:53:56.985 --> 00:53:58.905
<v Speaker 1>might not be in the you know, some

00:53:58.905 --> 00:54:01.145
<v Speaker 1>of that's more a kinda enterprise y features,

00:54:01.145 --> 00:54:03.200
<v Speaker 1>the reporting and things. But, you know, it'll

00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:05.599
<v Speaker 1>show you that number of vulnerabilities over time

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:08.560
<v Speaker 1>across all your projects for a particular project.

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:12.079
<v Speaker 1>You know, that that sort of that information's

00:54:12.079 --> 00:54:14.160
<v Speaker 1>all all there for you as well.

00:54:15.684 --> 00:54:17.765
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the one of the

00:54:17.925 --> 00:54:20.645
<v Speaker 1>interesting things as well was about

00:54:23.365 --> 00:54:24.405
<v Speaker 1>GitHub.

00:54:24.885 --> 00:54:26.885
<v Speaker 1>If you did you can you pull up

00:54:26.885 --> 00:54:29.765
<v Speaker 1>pull up the that repository that we just

00:54:29.765 --> 00:54:31.920
<v Speaker 1>imported, the get the the

00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:34.560
<v Speaker 1>pull request that you merged, David.

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:36.720
<v Speaker 1>Because you should see the what happens in

00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:39.360
<v Speaker 1>GitHub as well, the the automatic scan.

00:54:41.119 --> 00:54:42.880
<v Speaker 0>Yep. Rawkode

00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:43.760
<v Speaker 0>and it's in.

00:54:48.445 --> 00:54:50.445
<v Speaker 1>So if you look to that PR,

00:54:50.845 --> 00:54:52.765
<v Speaker 1>you should see the Snyk scan were were

00:54:52.765 --> 00:54:55.325
<v Speaker 1>actually ran when you when the the PR

00:54:55.325 --> 00:54:56.045
<v Speaker 1>was

00:54:58.350 --> 00:54:59.790
<v Speaker 1>are we gonna see it there?

00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:02.990
<v Speaker 1>If you scroll down, it should say that

00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:03.630
<v Speaker 1>it's

00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:10.905
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. Perhaps it's not there. Then

00:55:10.905 --> 00:55:12.505
<v Speaker 0>maybe we need to enable something?

00:55:12.665 --> 00:55:13.305
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:55:14.185 --> 00:55:14.745
<v Speaker 1>Possibly.

00:55:15.705 --> 00:55:17.625
<v Speaker 1>But, you know, you'll get the check-in in

00:55:17.625 --> 00:55:19.705
<v Speaker 1>GitHub, you know, when every time you push

00:55:19.705 --> 00:55:21.465
<v Speaker 1>a push a a PR,

00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:26.040
<v Speaker 1>you should you you can have a a

00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:28.200
<v Speaker 1>Snyk scan at that point. So, you know,

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:30.119
<v Speaker 1>it won't it won't be

00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:34.120
<v Speaker 1>you can't merge it until that scan's passed

00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:36.360
<v Speaker 1>and all that kind of good stuff, basically.

00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:37.079
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:55:38.195 --> 00:55:40.435
<v Speaker 0>So there's there's kinda something else I think

00:55:40.435 --> 00:55:42.275
<v Speaker 0>is really cool about this. It's like so

00:55:42.275 --> 00:55:43.955
<v Speaker 0>far we've been looking at this any end

00:55:43.955 --> 00:55:45.795
<v Speaker 0>project. We've looked at it from a code

00:55:45.795 --> 00:55:47.395
<v Speaker 0>point of view to get out, which is

00:55:47.395 --> 00:55:49.475
<v Speaker 0>JavaScript and TypeScript and the image.

00:55:49.795 --> 00:55:51.235
<v Speaker 0>But but I actually added

00:55:51.869 --> 00:55:54.430
<v Speaker 0>other non JavaScript stuff to this. So it's

00:55:54.430 --> 00:55:56.589
<v Speaker 0>like I don't need to write in JavaScript,

00:55:56.589 --> 00:55:58.829
<v Speaker 0>Node and TypeScript to get the benefits of

00:55:58.829 --> 00:56:00.589
<v Speaker 0>the Snyk tool. Like this is my a

00:56:00.589 --> 00:56:03.150
<v Speaker 0>Go project that I work on and it's

00:56:03.150 --> 00:56:04.269
<v Speaker 0>also got

00:56:04.785 --> 00:56:06.625
<v Speaker 0>scans and vulnerabilities.

00:56:07.265 --> 00:56:09.744
<v Speaker 0>So what what's the language support like for

00:56:09.744 --> 00:56:10.385
<v Speaker 0>Snyk?

00:56:11.665 --> 00:56:14.065
<v Speaker 1>Pretty wide and getting wide all the time.

00:56:14.065 --> 00:56:14.625
<v Speaker 1>So

00:56:15.665 --> 00:56:17.825
<v Speaker 1>on some some of the

00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:22.369
<v Speaker 1>go Snyk code is obviously less

00:56:22.369 --> 00:56:23.730
<v Speaker 1>wide at the minute.

00:56:24.450 --> 00:56:25.090
<v Speaker 1>But

00:56:26.290 --> 00:56:28.130
<v Speaker 1>in in Snyk

00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:31.650
<v Speaker 1>opens what we call the open source, which

00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:33.809
<v Speaker 1>is the the package scanning stuff,

00:56:35.315 --> 00:56:36.195
<v Speaker 1>Python,

00:56:37.395 --> 00:56:38.355
<v Speaker 1>.net,

00:56:38.355 --> 00:56:38.835
<v Speaker 1>go

00:56:41.315 --> 00:56:43.155
<v Speaker 1>what else? Let me look it up.

00:56:46.194 --> 00:56:48.835
<v Speaker 1>A whole bunch of libraries that of languages

00:56:48.835 --> 00:56:49.635
<v Speaker 1>that

00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:52.020
<v Speaker 1>that I never use. But

00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:55.220
<v Speaker 0>Let me pull up the website. I think

00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:56.580
<v Speaker 0>there's a list there too.

00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:57.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:56:59.060 --> 00:56:59.940
<v Speaker 1>.Net,

00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Java,

00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:01.780
<v Speaker 1>JavaScript,

00:57:03.355 --> 00:57:04.235
<v Speaker 1>Go,

00:57:04.395 --> 00:57:05.595
<v Speaker 1>PHP,

00:57:05.995 --> 00:57:06.955
<v Speaker 1>Node.

00:57:11.595 --> 00:57:12.555
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. A lot.

00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:19.349
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:23.670
<v Speaker 0>Where is it? I'm sure I've seen that

00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:24.310
<v Speaker 0>earlier.

00:57:25.029 --> 00:57:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. There's like a there's a bar somewhere

00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:29.589
<v Speaker 1>of Yeah. Oh, there we go. Java, JavaScript,

00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:31.190
<v Speaker 0>Takespeare, Python. Okay. That was more than that.

00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:32.549
<v Speaker 0>I've seen it earlier. I can't remember where

00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:34.069
<v Speaker 0>I saw it. Yeah. The others if you

00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:35.190
<v Speaker 1>go

00:57:53.130 --> 00:57:54.250
<v Speaker 0>That's integrations.

00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:54.330
<v Speaker 0>Right?

00:58:01.305 --> 00:58:03.065
<v Speaker 1>I think it's there across the bottom, isn't

00:58:03.065 --> 00:58:04.905
<v Speaker 1>it? Yeah. The these ones in gray. Yeah.

00:58:04.905 --> 00:58:07.305
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. JavaScript.netJava.

00:58:08.265 --> 00:58:09.145
<v Speaker 0>What are you?

00:58:10.744 --> 00:58:13.145
<v Speaker 1>Is that one of you just Elixir, isn't

00:58:13.145 --> 00:58:13.224
<v Speaker 1>it?

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.680
<v Speaker 0>Elixir is the one in the Oh Ruby.

00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:20.680
<v Speaker 0>Drop. Yep. We've Ruby, jQuery, npm, PHP.

00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:24.680
<v Speaker 0>Oh, that's the postgres elephant. Right? No.

00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:27.655
<v Speaker 0>I can't remember. There we go. Go for

00:58:27.655 --> 00:58:29.974
<v Speaker 0>Ruby, Python. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Lots of stuff

00:58:29.974 --> 00:58:31.895
<v Speaker 0>there. So Yeah. What

00:58:31.895 --> 00:58:33.895
<v Speaker 0>languages you're working with, what tools you're working

00:58:33.895 --> 00:58:35.895
<v Speaker 0>with. Snyk just seems to be And we're

00:58:35.895 --> 00:58:38.295
<v Speaker 1>and we're we're launching more and more all

00:58:38.295 --> 00:58:38.615
<v Speaker 1>the time.

00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:41.500
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Very cool.

00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:43.900
<v Speaker 0>And a very generous feature. Thing that that

00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:46.300
<v Speaker 1>that will be added to that is so

00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:48.860
<v Speaker 1>we just acquired a company called FOS ID,

00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:50.460
<v Speaker 1>who

00:58:50.859 --> 00:58:52.380
<v Speaker 1>look for snippets

00:58:52.535 --> 00:58:54.775
<v Speaker 1>of open source code within

00:58:55.015 --> 00:58:56.215
<v Speaker 1>you know, for, like,

00:58:57.735 --> 00:59:01.335
<v Speaker 1>say someone's been copy pasting open source code

00:59:01.335 --> 00:59:02.455
<v Speaker 1>into your

00:59:03.255 --> 00:59:05.970
<v Speaker 1>proprietary product. I would never have. So at

00:59:05.970 --> 00:59:08.450
<v Speaker 1>some point, that will start a pit surfacing

00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:11.170
<v Speaker 1>in Snyk as well is snippet stuff.

00:59:11.330 --> 00:59:12.370
<v Speaker 1>So identifying

00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:14.850
<v Speaker 1>snippets which may have come from other other

00:59:14.850 --> 00:59:15.490
<v Speaker 1>projects.

00:59:17.405 --> 00:59:18.445
<v Speaker 0>Very handy.

00:59:19.005 --> 00:59:20.845
<v Speaker 0>A comment on a chat suggested that maybe

00:59:20.845 --> 00:59:21.805
<v Speaker 0>Scala,

00:59:22.365 --> 00:59:24.125
<v Speaker 0>the three bars. And I'm glad you said

00:59:24.125 --> 00:59:25.645
<v Speaker 0>that, Russell, because I thought that too.

00:59:26.285 --> 00:59:27.724
<v Speaker 0>And it just wasn't brave enough to go

00:59:27.724 --> 00:59:28.525
<v Speaker 0>for the guess.

00:59:29.005 --> 00:59:30.445
<v Speaker 0>And we got a comment from b mad

00:59:30.445 --> 00:59:32.210
<v Speaker 0>who says, I'll be using this service to

00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:34.289
<v Speaker 0>shame other team members and appear smarter than

00:59:34.289 --> 00:59:36.369
<v Speaker 0>I really am. Go for it, man. That's

00:59:36.369 --> 00:59:38.210
<v Speaker 1>that's an awesome use case.

00:59:38.529 --> 00:59:40.369
<v Speaker 1>I would encourage everybody to

00:59:43.410 --> 00:59:43.970
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:59:44.529 --> 00:59:46.609
<v Speaker 0>Is there anything else that we should cover?

00:59:47.345 --> 00:59:49.185
<v Speaker 0>If I if I've forgotten anything?

00:59:49.984 --> 00:59:51.744
<v Speaker 1>We could take a look at the CLI

00:59:51.744 --> 00:59:53.505
<v Speaker 1>scanning quickly. We haven't had a look at

00:59:53.505 --> 00:59:56.065
<v Speaker 1>the CLI yet, have we? No. Let's do

00:59:56.065 --> 00:59:56.545
<v Speaker 0>that.

00:59:57.585 --> 00:59:59.025
<v Speaker 1>So I mean, I actually end up using

00:59:59.025 --> 01:00:00.065
<v Speaker 1>the CLI

01:00:00.065 --> 01:00:03.664
<v Speaker 1>more miles more than than I use the

01:00:02.790 --> 01:00:03.830
<v Speaker 1>the UI.

01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:08.710
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's see. Install. Can I just brew

01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:10.870
<v Speaker 0>install this? Or is there a binary?

01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.910
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:00:12.790 --> 01:00:14.550
<v Speaker 1>If you've got an MPM, you can just

01:00:14.550 --> 01:00:16.710
<v Speaker 1>do MPM install minus g.

01:00:17.904 --> 01:00:20.065
<v Speaker 0>I'll just copy this link here. I think

01:00:20.065 --> 01:00:21.025
<v Speaker 0>we should be good.

01:00:21.825 --> 01:00:23.825
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no. I'm I'm in there. Okay.

01:00:24.865 --> 01:00:25.744
<v Speaker 0>Snyk.

01:00:25.904 --> 01:00:26.545
<v Speaker 0>Snyk.

01:00:26.704 --> 01:00:27.425
<v Speaker 0>Tap.

01:00:27.664 --> 01:00:28.305
<v Speaker 0>Snyk.

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:35.500
<v Speaker 0>Although, not sure what would have been faster.

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:38.380
<v Speaker 0>NPM installed s g or brew and snow.

01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:40.620
<v Speaker 0>Both are particularly slow for me all the

01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:40.860
<v Speaker 0>time.

01:00:43.215 --> 01:00:44.975
<v Speaker 0>Just pick my poison I normally do it

01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:45.935
<v Speaker 1>with NPM,

01:00:45.935 --> 01:00:46.335
<v Speaker 1>but

01:00:47.375 --> 01:00:48.975
<v Speaker 1>So I have no idea. I I'm hoping

01:00:48.975 --> 01:00:50.895
<v Speaker 1>brew is gonna work now. It it's in

01:00:50.895 --> 01:00:53.615
<v Speaker 1>our docks. It must someone must have tested

01:00:53.615 --> 01:00:54.175
<v Speaker 1>it.

01:00:54.975 --> 01:00:56.175
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'm sure it'll be good.

01:00:58.270 --> 01:00:59.950
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I think if it gets this far,

01:00:59.950 --> 01:01:01.870
<v Speaker 0>it means it's yeah. There we go.

01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:04.110
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So

01:01:04.590 --> 01:01:06.270
<v Speaker 0>let's see what happens here.

01:01:12.350 --> 01:01:13.150
<v Speaker 0>Come on homebrew.

01:01:16.565 --> 01:01:18.325
<v Speaker 0>And I'll just drag my window up so

01:01:18.325 --> 01:01:20.005
<v Speaker 0>people can actually see the line that I'm

01:01:20.005 --> 01:01:20.565
<v Speaker 0>typing.

01:01:22.244 --> 01:01:22.965
<v Speaker 0>There.

01:01:25.925 --> 01:01:27.845
<v Speaker 0>It says a %, but it's still making

01:01:27.845 --> 01:01:29.660
<v Speaker 0>me wait. That's rude.

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:33.820
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:36.700
<v Speaker 0>Does that mean I've got a sneak command?

01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:42.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So you're

01:01:45.425 --> 01:01:47.665
<v Speaker 1>that all so the first thing you need

01:01:47.665 --> 01:01:48.865
<v Speaker 1>to do is auth.

01:01:49.505 --> 01:01:51.185
<v Speaker 1>So you need your

01:01:53.585 --> 01:01:55.505
<v Speaker 1>token thingy from

01:01:56.465 --> 01:01:57.985
<v Speaker 1>from your user.

01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:02.550
<v Speaker 1>So Okay.

01:02:03.030 --> 01:02:03.990
<v Speaker 0>Let me

01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:06.550
<v Speaker 0>move my window out the way.

01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:12.150
<v Speaker 0>I've already flashed more tokens on the show

01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:14.735
<v Speaker 0>than I would like. So Yeah. So

01:02:15.295 --> 01:02:17.055
<v Speaker 1>go into your account settings

01:02:17.055 --> 01:02:18.655
<v Speaker 1>and API token.

01:02:39.845 --> 01:02:42.965
<v Speaker 0>I don't see it. Is it service accounts?

01:02:43.925 --> 01:02:46.805
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. No. In in so if you go

01:02:46.805 --> 01:02:49.765
<v Speaker 1>up to your where your account section at

01:02:49.765 --> 01:02:52.405
<v Speaker 1>the top right of the screen Yeah. Account

01:02:52.405 --> 01:02:53.365
<v Speaker 1>settings

01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:55.340
<v Speaker 0>Yes. And it should be in the first

01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:58.700
<v Speaker 1>thing under general. It should be API token.

01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:03.820
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I must be missing it. It might

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:04.940
<v Speaker 0>be really silly.

01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:06.380
<v Speaker 0>Hold on. I'll bring it back onto the

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:06.620
<v Speaker 0>screen.

01:03:08.675 --> 01:03:09.315
<v Speaker 1>So,

01:03:10.115 --> 01:03:11.875
<v Speaker 1>yeah, it won't it won't appear

01:03:11.955 --> 01:03:13.795
<v Speaker 1>anyway unless you click it. So

01:03:15.715 --> 01:03:18.355
<v Speaker 1>yeah. So no. No. Not not those settings.

01:03:18.355 --> 01:03:20.675
<v Speaker 1>Your personal settings. So go to right top

01:03:20.675 --> 01:03:23.395
<v Speaker 1>right hand corner there, account settings. That's it.

01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:25.380
<v Speaker 1>There we Alright.

01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:26.900
<v Speaker 1>Don't click it.

01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:30.579
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I'll move it back over here. Don't

01:03:30.579 --> 01:03:31.780
<v Speaker 1>click on screen.

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:35.060
<v Speaker 0>I'll bring that back.

01:03:36.105 --> 01:03:37.945
<v Speaker 0>I've got my terminal here.

01:03:38.585 --> 01:03:41.145
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Terminal off screen as well. And then

01:03:41.145 --> 01:03:42.185
<v Speaker 1>you do sneak off.

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:50.760
<v Speaker 0>The author then paste my

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:52.360
<v Speaker 0>token.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:55.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh, actually, you don't need the the API

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:57.560
<v Speaker 1>token. You know, you can just do it

01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:59.160
<v Speaker 1>through the browser. So if you ran Snyk

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:00.760
<v Speaker 1>auth, it should have opened the browser, yeah,

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.040
<v Speaker 1>and given you a

01:04:02.355 --> 01:04:04.035
<v Speaker 1>given you a thing saying,

01:04:05.155 --> 01:04:07.235
<v Speaker 1>do you want to authenticate the CLI?

01:04:09.635 --> 01:04:11.395
<v Speaker 1>Did you get that? Oh, I posted a

01:04:11.395 --> 01:04:13.715
<v Speaker 0>token. So I believe that I'm now Alright.

01:04:13.795 --> 01:04:16.195
<v Speaker 0>Although I've just realized

01:04:15.830 --> 01:04:17.110
<v Speaker 0>that my auto complete

01:04:21.350 --> 01:04:23.270
<v Speaker 0>I move off screen again for one second.

01:04:23.270 --> 01:04:25.030
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna run a different Snyk command. Yeah.

01:04:25.030 --> 01:04:27.350
<v Speaker 1>So just just click just click that authenticate

01:04:27.350 --> 01:04:29.350
<v Speaker 1>button there, David, and that'll do it. That'll

01:04:29.350 --> 01:04:30.675
<v Speaker 1>do it for you. Oh, no. But I

01:04:30.755 --> 01:04:32.355
<v Speaker 0>You need the you don't need the API

01:04:32.355 --> 01:04:33.395
<v Speaker 1>token anymore.

01:04:33.795 --> 01:04:35.795
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I already pasted the API token, so

01:04:35.795 --> 01:04:37.235
<v Speaker 0>if I push, like, I was worried that

01:04:37.235 --> 01:04:38.435
<v Speaker 0>when I do a sneak, they all complete

01:04:38.435 --> 01:04:40.115
<v Speaker 0>would commence. I've just done a quick sneak

01:04:40.115 --> 01:04:41.875
<v Speaker 0>dash dash help to hide that. Oh, okay.

01:04:42.515 --> 01:04:44.515
<v Speaker 0>Even though I can just regen the token

01:04:44.515 --> 01:04:46.809
<v Speaker 0>right after the stream, but I'll try and

01:04:46.809 --> 01:04:49.050
<v Speaker 0>avoid displaying it to the world. So

01:04:49.849 --> 01:04:51.930
<v Speaker 1>okay. We're there and that that's the that's

01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:54.170
<v Speaker 1>the folder. That's the git checkout of the

01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:57.530
<v Speaker 1>the thing we've been looking at Yeah. Today,

01:04:57.530 --> 01:04:59.690
<v Speaker 1>isn't it? So if you just run Snyk

01:04:59.690 --> 01:05:01.105
<v Speaker 1>test from there,

01:05:01.505 --> 01:05:02.065
<v Speaker 1>it should

01:05:03.665 --> 01:05:06.065
<v Speaker 1>it'll do the open source the packages test,

01:05:06.065 --> 01:05:06.705
<v Speaker 1>I hope.

01:05:09.905 --> 01:05:11.985
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Because you've got multiple so what it's

01:05:11.985 --> 01:05:14.020
<v Speaker 1>saying there is because it found multiple package

01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:16.660
<v Speaker 1>dot JSONs because that's a meta repository.

01:05:16.819 --> 01:05:18.660
<v Speaker 1>So what we wanna do is actually to

01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:20.339
<v Speaker 1>use minus minus all projects.

01:05:28.214 --> 01:05:29.734
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. What's up in there? I feel to

01:05:29.734 --> 01:05:30.295
<v Speaker 1>it.

01:05:32.214 --> 01:05:34.295
<v Speaker 0>And the run dash d.

01:05:34.615 --> 01:05:35.974
<v Speaker 0>Let's see what the debug says.

01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:41.830
<v Speaker 0>No, Russell.

01:05:42.070 --> 01:05:43.510
<v Speaker 0>No token flashing today.

01:05:53.915 --> 01:05:56.235
<v Speaker 1>Right. Okay. So you've got because it's node,

01:05:56.235 --> 01:05:58.475
<v Speaker 1>you've gotta do NPM install first

01:05:58.715 --> 01:06:00.875
<v Speaker 1>in that in that directory.

01:06:04.075 --> 01:06:05.275
<v Speaker 0>I was I'm trying to work out if

01:06:05.275 --> 01:06:07.600
<v Speaker 0>I could do a find package dot JSON

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:09.520
<v Speaker 0>run command. Yeah. So you can you can

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:11.359
<v Speaker 1>just I mean, to to save you building

01:06:11.359 --> 01:06:13.840
<v Speaker 1>that pack building that that

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:16.000
<v Speaker 1>thing, we can just test that single one

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:16.560
<v Speaker 1>there.

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:18.880
<v Speaker 1>I think if you do minus minus file,

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:21.280
<v Speaker 1>is it? To to specify the

01:06:22.665 --> 01:06:24.505
<v Speaker 0>Why don't we do the more interesting? I

01:06:24.505 --> 01:06:26.025
<v Speaker 0>think the core had a whole bunch of

01:06:26.025 --> 01:06:27.705
<v Speaker 0>stuff in it. So we're we can

01:06:28.025 --> 01:06:29.785
<v Speaker 0>let's run our NPM install here. Hopefully, that

01:06:29.785 --> 01:06:31.385
<v Speaker 0>doesn't take too long, and then I'll try

01:06:31.385 --> 01:06:33.065
<v Speaker 0>this sneak test on this directory.

01:06:33.225 --> 01:06:34.745
<v Speaker 0>Because this time, the

01:06:35.225 --> 01:06:36.185
<v Speaker 0>browser one.

01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:39.100
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:41.980
<v Speaker 0>I'm sure core was the one that had

01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:43.580
<v Speaker 0>a whole bunch of stuff in it.

01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:47.020
<v Speaker 1>I suspect Yeah. See one of them one

01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:48.620
<v Speaker 1>of them was interesting,

01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:50.140
<v Speaker 1>wasn't it? It didn't have any vulnerabilities.

01:06:50.715 --> 01:06:52.235
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Of course, of course,

01:06:52.795 --> 01:06:53.835
<v Speaker 0>I picked that one.

01:06:54.475 --> 01:06:56.955
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's the packages. It's the CLI one

01:06:56.955 --> 01:06:59.355
<v Speaker 1>that was that had some stuff in it.

01:06:59.915 --> 01:07:00.635
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:07:00.715 --> 01:07:02.235
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Cancel. Cancel. Cancel.

01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:04.810
<v Speaker 0>A good thing that note installs are super

01:07:04.810 --> 01:07:05.690
<v Speaker 0>fast. Right?

01:07:08.890 --> 01:07:09.770
<v Speaker 0>Sarcasm.

01:07:11.609 --> 01:07:12.410
<v Speaker 0>Let's

01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:12.650
<v Speaker 0>see.

01:07:17.845 --> 01:07:19.045
<v Speaker 0>I I guess you get to tell me

01:07:19.045 --> 01:07:20.484
<v Speaker 0>a story for the next twenty minutes. What

01:07:20.484 --> 01:07:20.885
<v Speaker 0>have you got?

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:31.120
<v Speaker 0>I'm sure it would take yeah. Look at

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:33.280
<v Speaker 0>that. Oh, there we go. It is going.

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:34.800
<v Speaker 0>Just had to get started first. And I

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:36.160
<v Speaker 0>hadn't had a coffee yet.

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:37.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That's all.

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Get up to speed.

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:43.040
<v Speaker 0>So you said that you So we should

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:44.995
<v Speaker 1>look at we should also look at so

01:07:44.995 --> 01:07:46.755
<v Speaker 1>why don't we look at some Kubernetes YAML

01:07:46.755 --> 01:07:47.475
<v Speaker 1>while

01:07:47.635 --> 01:07:49.555
<v Speaker 1>while that's have you got you got an

01:07:49.635 --> 01:07:51.475
<v Speaker 1>you got something with some Kubernetes YAML in

01:07:51.475 --> 01:07:53.315
<v Speaker 1>it so we can take a look at

01:07:53.315 --> 01:07:54.275
<v Speaker 1>scanning that?

01:07:55.315 --> 01:07:57.475
<v Speaker 0>I've got YAML. I've always got YAML.

01:07:59.470 --> 01:08:00.430
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

01:08:02.030 --> 01:08:04.270
<v Speaker 0>Let's see if I've got my

01:08:06.030 --> 01:08:08.110
<v Speaker 0>That's not interesting. Let's go to the Rawkode

01:08:08.110 --> 01:08:08.830
<v Speaker 0>one.

01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:10.190
<v Speaker 0>I have

01:08:11.445 --> 01:08:13.125
<v Speaker 0>opt Kubernetes.

01:08:13.765 --> 01:08:16.165
<v Speaker 0>I've got a deployment. I've got a postgres

01:08:16.165 --> 01:08:18.085
<v Speaker 0>stateful set and I've got a service. Is

01:08:18.085 --> 01:08:18.804
<v Speaker 0>that enough?

01:08:19.524 --> 01:08:20.645
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:24.319
<v Speaker 0>So

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:26.560
<v Speaker 0>Does that mean I can run Snyk test

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.199
<v Speaker 0>here?

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:31.279
<v Speaker 1>So you want Snyk I

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:32.880
<v Speaker 1>c test?

01:08:38.735 --> 01:08:39.694
<v Speaker 0>Like that?

01:08:43.055 --> 01:08:45.055
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Should be. Yep.

01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:46.255
<v Speaker 1>Let me just

01:08:50.279 --> 01:08:52.279
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. There we go. That should so what

01:08:52.279 --> 01:08:53.319
<v Speaker 1>that's gonna do

01:08:53.719 --> 01:08:54.679
<v Speaker 0>Oh, nice.

01:08:55.159 --> 01:08:56.999
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. There we go. Right? So

01:08:57.639 --> 01:08:59.639
<v Speaker 1>so if we scroll up a bit and

01:08:59.639 --> 01:09:01.559
<v Speaker 1>this obviously works the same in the in

01:09:01.559 --> 01:09:02.519
<v Speaker 1>the UI.

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:04.359
<v Speaker 1>So that's gonna show you

01:09:06.094 --> 01:09:10.255
<v Speaker 1>security issues within that Kubernetes YAML. So what

01:09:10.255 --> 01:09:11.614
<v Speaker 1>have we got? Oh, so

01:09:11.935 --> 01:09:14.574
<v Speaker 1>you haven't got allow privilege escalation set to

01:09:14.574 --> 01:09:15.215
<v Speaker 1>false

01:09:15.534 --> 01:09:17.374
<v Speaker 1>in a security context

01:09:17.534 --> 01:09:18.414
<v Speaker 1>setting.

01:09:18.814 --> 01:09:20.895
<v Speaker 1>You aren't setting runners on route

01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:23.960
<v Speaker 1>and

01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:26.680
<v Speaker 1>not dropping all the default capabilities,

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:28.439
<v Speaker 1>etcetera.

01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:31.800
<v Speaker 1>So we'll we'll

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.935
<v Speaker 0>See, that's fun when I was looking at

01:09:34.935 --> 01:09:37.175
<v Speaker 0>someone else's code, but now it's analyzing my

01:09:37.175 --> 01:09:38.774
<v Speaker 0>YAML and feeling attacked.

01:09:41.335 --> 01:09:43.574
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I should be. I should do better

01:09:43.574 --> 01:09:45.975
<v Speaker 0>there. But now I know. Now I've got

01:09:45.975 --> 01:09:48.215
<v Speaker 0>a sneak IAC test and I can actually

01:09:48.215 --> 01:09:49.014
<v Speaker 0>fix these things.

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:52.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I mean, again, a lot of this

01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:54.820
<v Speaker 1>visibility, isn't it? You know, mean, there there's

01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:56.100
<v Speaker 1>there's clearly

01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:58.820
<v Speaker 1>you know, there might be scenarios where well,

01:09:58.820 --> 01:09:59.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,

01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:02.740
<v Speaker 1>allow privilege escalation set to true is hard

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:05.140
<v Speaker 1>one to justify, but, you know,

01:10:05.885 --> 01:10:07.565
<v Speaker 1>there are clearly scenarios

01:10:07.565 --> 01:10:09.885
<v Speaker 1>where you might want to do all these

01:10:09.885 --> 01:10:10.684
<v Speaker 1>other things.

01:10:12.285 --> 01:10:15.805
<v Speaker 0>Well, yeah. The these are throwaway clusters and

01:10:15.805 --> 01:10:18.445
<v Speaker 0>deployments for clustered. So Yeah. That's actually a

01:10:18.445 --> 01:10:19.324
<v Speaker 1>good scenario.

01:10:19.885 --> 01:10:20.445
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:23.610
<v Speaker 0>But I love that. Can do that stuff.

01:10:23.610 --> 01:10:24.410
<v Speaker 0>Very cool.

01:10:24.970 --> 01:10:26.410
<v Speaker 1>So the IAC

01:10:27.130 --> 01:10:30.250
<v Speaker 1>tooling, obviously, will scan Kubernetes, YAML, scan Helm

01:10:30.250 --> 01:10:30.970
<v Speaker 1>charts,

01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:34.810
<v Speaker 1>scan Terraform as well. Really lots and lots

01:10:34.810 --> 01:10:37.975
<v Speaker 1>of rule sets about Terraform. So for AWS,

01:10:37.975 --> 01:10:38.775
<v Speaker 1>for Google,

01:10:39.895 --> 01:10:41.015
<v Speaker 1>for Azure,

01:10:41.495 --> 01:10:44.775
<v Speaker 1>and, you know, we'll detect security issues

01:10:45.175 --> 01:10:47.415
<v Speaker 1>in in all of those things. And, this

01:10:47.415 --> 01:10:49.175
<v Speaker 1>is, you know, this is kind of important

01:10:49.175 --> 01:10:51.360
<v Speaker 1>for people to to think about, isn't it?

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:53.520
<v Speaker 1>Because it's not just about your container image.

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:55.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like how are you deploying it,

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:56.800
<v Speaker 1>especially in

01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:58.320
<v Speaker 1>in Kubernetes.

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:01.360
<v Speaker 1>And you you almost need to consider the

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:02.720
<v Speaker 1>the deployment

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:05.200
<v Speaker 1>of the application as part of the application,

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:07.974
<v Speaker 1>don't you? Because, you know, it it's all

01:11:07.974 --> 01:11:09.094
<v Speaker 1>part of the same thing.

01:11:09.735 --> 01:11:11.574
<v Speaker 1>So your application can be as secure as

01:11:11.574 --> 01:11:13.574
<v Speaker 1>you like, but if you're spawning that container

01:11:13.574 --> 01:11:16.614
<v Speaker 1>as root with, like, you know, no AppArmor

01:11:16.614 --> 01:11:18.375
<v Speaker 1>or or whatever, then

01:11:18.890 --> 01:11:22.250
<v Speaker 1>you you kind of you you're undoing all

01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:23.930
<v Speaker 1>the all the good work that you may

01:11:23.930 --> 01:11:26.730
<v Speaker 1>have done in in developing this app to

01:11:26.730 --> 01:11:29.450
<v Speaker 1>start with. Right. Well, let's let's be honest.

01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:32.625
<v Speaker 0>Right? AppArmor and SE Linux, nobody actually knows

01:11:32.625 --> 01:11:34.864
<v Speaker 0>how they work. Right? I mean It is

01:11:34.864 --> 01:11:36.625
<v Speaker 1>black magic. Although I've been doing this talk

01:11:36.625 --> 01:11:40.064
<v Speaker 1>with with my friend Camille Potrich about about

01:11:40.465 --> 01:11:41.344
<v Speaker 1>kernel

01:11:41.425 --> 01:11:42.864
<v Speaker 1>privilege escalation

01:11:43.744 --> 01:11:47.430
<v Speaker 1>in in Kubernetes. Like, what happens in in

01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:50.390
<v Speaker 1>on bare metal and what happens in in

01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:51.910
<v Speaker 1>in Kubernetes.

01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:54.390
<v Speaker 1>And so he's been explaining to me in

01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:56.470
<v Speaker 1>a bit more depth what some of these

01:11:56.470 --> 01:11:57.910
<v Speaker 1>things in the kernel actually do.

01:11:59.385 --> 01:12:00.024
<v Speaker 1>And,

01:12:00.344 --> 01:12:02.985
<v Speaker 1>you know, with privilege with kernel hacks, you

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:05.224
<v Speaker 1>know, fair enough, they're pretty rare.

01:12:05.465 --> 01:12:05.945
<v Speaker 1>But

01:12:07.704 --> 01:12:09.385
<v Speaker 1>the AppArmor and SELinux

01:12:09.385 --> 01:12:11.864
<v Speaker 1>are about the only things that really give

01:12:11.864 --> 01:12:13.065
<v Speaker 1>you any protection

01:12:13.230 --> 01:12:14.350
<v Speaker 1>in

01:12:14.350 --> 01:12:16.590
<v Speaker 1>in scenarios like that where you've got really

01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:17.389
<v Speaker 1>serious

01:12:18.190 --> 01:12:20.349
<v Speaker 1>kernel bugs that can be exploited

01:12:20.590 --> 01:12:22.030
<v Speaker 1>from a local shell.

01:12:23.950 --> 01:12:26.110
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I I must say I'm I'm guilty

01:12:26.110 --> 01:12:29.034
<v Speaker 0>of SC and four zero and turning off

01:12:29.034 --> 01:12:31.355
<v Speaker 0>SC limits, but maybe I need to I

01:12:31.355 --> 01:12:32.874
<v Speaker 0>need to change their hours.

01:12:33.994 --> 01:12:35.755
<v Speaker 1>I mean, to be honest, I've been quite

01:12:35.755 --> 01:12:37.355
<v Speaker 1>far away from bare metal for a long

01:12:37.355 --> 01:12:38.554
<v Speaker 1>time. I mean, I used to run a

01:12:38.554 --> 01:12:40.715
<v Speaker 1>public cloud platform, an open set public cloud

01:12:40.715 --> 01:12:43.199
<v Speaker 1>platform. So I was a lot more

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:45.760
<v Speaker 1>you know, that was the kind of stuff

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.439
<v Speaker 1>that kept me up at night. It was,

01:12:47.519 --> 01:12:49.999
<v Speaker 1>you know, virtual machine escaping.

01:12:50.079 --> 01:12:52.639
<v Speaker 1>And, thankfully, again, incredibly rare in the real

01:12:52.639 --> 01:12:55.280
<v Speaker 1>world, but so we were always we had

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:56.159
<v Speaker 1>automated

01:12:56.159 --> 01:12:57.715
<v Speaker 1>checks for things like,

01:12:58.355 --> 01:13:00.595
<v Speaker 1>in our case, AppArmor because we were in

01:13:00.595 --> 01:13:02.835
<v Speaker 1>a Bunty shop. But, yeah, I'm I'm far

01:13:02.835 --> 01:13:05.075
<v Speaker 1>away from the metal now, David. So unlike

01:13:05.075 --> 01:13:05.795
<v Speaker 1>yourself.

01:13:06.035 --> 01:13:08.515
<v Speaker 0>I've got nothing but metal these days. It's

01:13:08.515 --> 01:13:09.955
<v Speaker 0>a whole lot of fun, I've gotta say.

01:13:10.350 --> 01:13:12.350
<v Speaker 0>We got a question. I'm not sure if

01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:14.190
<v Speaker 0>I fully understand this. I'm gonna throw it

01:13:14.190 --> 01:13:15.630
<v Speaker 0>to you and see what happens. But Russell

01:13:15.630 --> 01:13:18.270
<v Speaker 0>is asking if the IAC could perhaps scan

01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:20.749
<v Speaker 0>like Azure API gateways.

01:13:21.150 --> 01:13:24.590
<v Speaker 0>Is that No. That's that's kind of outside

01:13:24.590 --> 01:13:26.885
<v Speaker 1>of the scope of what of what Snyk

01:13:27.364 --> 01:13:28.885
<v Speaker 1>does. I'm assuming,

01:13:28.965 --> 01:13:31.204
<v Speaker 1>Russell, what you're talking about is, like,

01:13:32.165 --> 01:13:34.325
<v Speaker 1>I forget the terminology for this, but but

01:13:34.325 --> 01:13:35.285
<v Speaker 1>scanning

01:13:35.285 --> 01:13:37.525
<v Speaker 1>for for for

01:13:39.150 --> 01:13:41.630
<v Speaker 1>configuration on API gateways and things like that

01:13:41.630 --> 01:13:44.510
<v Speaker 1>in in running in the running scenario. Yeah?

01:13:46.350 --> 01:13:47.870
<v Speaker 0>Let us know, Russell, and we'll we'll circle

01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:49.949
<v Speaker 0>back to that. Yeah. So let's let's let's

01:13:49.949 --> 01:13:51.390
<v Speaker 0>take a bet then. Do you think the

01:13:51.390 --> 01:13:52.830
<v Speaker 0>note the note install is finished?

01:13:54.545 --> 01:13:55.264
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

01:13:57.025 --> 01:13:58.945
<v Speaker 0>There you go. Okay.

01:14:00.145 --> 01:14:00.864
<v Speaker 0>So

01:14:01.025 --> 01:14:03.505
<v Speaker 0>if we were doing a sneak test on

01:14:03.505 --> 01:14:06.465
<v Speaker 0>our CLI Yeah. Let's see what happens. I

01:14:06.465 --> 01:14:08.864
<v Speaker 0>got another comment, nothing but mail these days.

01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:12.120
<v Speaker 1>Okay? I think it's still gonna oh, no.

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:12.840
<v Speaker 1>There we go.

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:16.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So we can see that all those

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:17.560
<v Speaker 1>same vulnerabilities

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.520
<v Speaker 1>have been picked up by the by the

01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:23.085
<v Speaker 1>CLI there Yep. Which is cool.

01:14:23.965 --> 01:14:26.125
<v Speaker 1>If you how are they fix is that

01:14:26.125 --> 01:14:27.885
<v Speaker 1>the one that had a fixable one in

01:14:27.885 --> 01:14:28.364
<v Speaker 1>it?

01:14:28.845 --> 01:14:30.205
<v Speaker 0>I I don't know. I'm I'm too busy

01:14:30.205 --> 01:14:31.805
<v Speaker 0>trying to work out what Snyk Wizard is,

01:14:31.805 --> 01:14:34.525
<v Speaker 0>but I think Snyk Wizard and you'll you'll

01:14:34.525 --> 01:14:35.565
<v Speaker 1>see what's what

01:14:40.829 --> 01:14:42.510
<v Speaker 1>this will depend on whether there is a

01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:45.389
<v Speaker 1>fixable any of those were the fixable ones.

01:14:47.230 --> 01:14:48.670
<v Speaker 0>And is it gonna So this is basically

01:14:48.670 --> 01:14:51.005
<v Speaker 1>gonna guide you to fixing yeah. It's gonna

01:14:51.005 --> 01:14:53.005
<v Speaker 1>guide you to fixing it locally

01:14:53.245 --> 01:14:55.565
<v Speaker 1>in the same way that, you know, we

01:14:55.565 --> 01:14:57.245
<v Speaker 1>sort of do fix PRs.

01:14:58.605 --> 01:15:01.085
<v Speaker 1>This will we'll do it locally for you.

01:15:03.710 --> 01:15:06.910
<v Speaker 0>I think it's doing some number crunching at

01:15:06.910 --> 01:15:07.710
<v Speaker 0>the moment.

01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:10.910
<v Speaker 0>Something else that kinda caught my eye that

01:15:10.910 --> 01:15:12.270
<v Speaker 0>maybe you can shed some light on is

01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:14.030
<v Speaker 0>telling me if I create a dot sneak

01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:14.910
<v Speaker 0>policy file.

01:15:15.804 --> 01:15:17.804
<v Speaker 0>Is that how I would do it ignores

01:15:17.804 --> 01:15:21.085
<v Speaker 0>as code or something? Yeah. I I I

01:15:21.085 --> 01:15:22.684
<v Speaker 1>I have to admit, this was one of

01:15:22.684 --> 01:15:24.125
<v Speaker 1>the things that I had to I was

01:15:24.125 --> 01:15:27.164
<v Speaker 1>looking at myself in the documentation just before

01:15:27.164 --> 01:15:29.450
<v Speaker 1>the show, and I didn't get to what

01:15:29.690 --> 01:15:31.850
<v Speaker 1>how this works. I've never done it.

01:15:32.330 --> 01:15:33.370
<v Speaker 1>I think

01:15:36.570 --> 01:15:38.570
<v Speaker 1>yeah. It's a it's a obviously, a way

01:15:38.570 --> 01:15:42.010
<v Speaker 1>of of creating policies for what what

01:15:43.574 --> 01:15:46.374
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing on an ongoing basis. So

01:15:46.454 --> 01:15:49.334
<v Speaker 1>I I will look up what those mean,

01:15:49.414 --> 01:15:52.054
<v Speaker 1>and I will share with you

01:15:53.414 --> 01:15:55.094
<v Speaker 1>at some point in the future.

01:15:55.815 --> 01:15:56.375
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

01:15:58.369 --> 01:16:00.210
<v Speaker 0>And b mad says they're gonna start selling

01:16:00.210 --> 01:16:01.010
<v Speaker 0>t shirts.

01:16:01.329 --> 01:16:03.809
<v Speaker 0>I fully endorse this. In fact, similar designs

01:16:03.809 --> 01:16:05.649
<v Speaker 0>and I'll add them to the Rawkode store.

01:16:06.130 --> 01:16:08.610
<v Speaker 0>And Russell got excited when you said Azure

01:16:08.610 --> 01:16:10.805
<v Speaker 0>and assumed all of us there. Maybe in

01:16:10.805 --> 01:16:12.885
<v Speaker 0>time, Russell. Snyk is a fast moving open

01:16:12.885 --> 01:16:13.844
<v Speaker 0>source project.

01:16:14.085 --> 01:16:15.605
<v Speaker 0>New stuff coming all the time.

01:16:17.365 --> 01:16:20.405
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So so the policies can are things

01:16:20.405 --> 01:16:21.605
<v Speaker 1>like ignores,

01:16:21.765 --> 01:16:24.165
<v Speaker 1>David. I think it's actually more things you

01:16:24.165 --> 01:16:26.650
<v Speaker 1>can do than just ignores, but I I

01:16:26.809 --> 01:16:28.730
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those features that I've I've

01:16:28.730 --> 01:16:31.050
<v Speaker 1>never used it from the CLI. Mhmm.

01:16:32.889 --> 01:16:35.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I can imagine doing it there or

01:16:36.650 --> 01:16:38.489
<v Speaker 0>I think I'm not sure what's I think

01:16:38.489 --> 01:16:39.369
<v Speaker 0>it's still analyzing.

01:16:44.364 --> 01:16:46.125
<v Speaker 0>I mean, my computer is doing a lot

01:16:46.125 --> 01:16:48.844
<v Speaker 0>on these streams that I've actually it has

01:16:48.844 --> 01:16:50.844
<v Speaker 0>been slowing down more and more.

01:16:51.324 --> 01:16:53.244
<v Speaker 0>So hopefully it's just because of that and

01:16:53.244 --> 01:16:54.445
<v Speaker 0>it won't take too long.

01:16:55.940 --> 01:16:57.380
<v Speaker 0>I am putting it through a lot these

01:16:57.380 --> 01:16:58.019
<v Speaker 0>days.

01:16:58.340 --> 01:17:00.020
<v Speaker 0>And I have left Docker for Mac running

01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:01.860
<v Speaker 0>which is always a bad idea, so let

01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:02.340
<v Speaker 0>me

01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:04.260
<v Speaker 0>me close that.

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:06.659
<v Speaker 0>That virtual machine just seems to draw a

01:17:06.659 --> 01:17:09.860
<v Speaker 0>power like mad. Yeah. I know what you

01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:10.100
<v Speaker 1>mean.

01:17:13.715 --> 01:17:16.355
<v Speaker 0>But I like the the flow of this,

01:17:16.355 --> 01:17:18.435
<v Speaker 0>like, being able to Well, that would be

01:17:18.435 --> 01:17:18.915
<v Speaker 1>fine.

01:17:20.195 --> 01:17:22.035
<v Speaker 0>Get those little reds Yeah.

01:17:23.235 --> 01:17:26.435
<v Speaker 1>So we only have one option there for

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:26.680
<v Speaker 1>for remediating

01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:29.000
<v Speaker 1>that one because it doesn't have a fix,

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:29.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.

01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:33.800
<v Speaker 1>So it's it's saying that you're going to

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:36.360
<v Speaker 1>ignore it and give you a reason for

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:37.080
<v Speaker 1>ignoring it.

01:17:39.435 --> 01:17:40.955
<v Speaker 1>And if you I think if you click

01:17:40.955 --> 01:17:42.955
<v Speaker 1>through these, they'll they'll they'll go through them

01:17:42.955 --> 01:17:44.555
<v Speaker 1>one by one and give you what your

01:17:44.555 --> 01:17:47.195
<v Speaker 1>what your options are for for what to

01:17:47.195 --> 01:17:47.675
<v Speaker 0>do.

01:17:48.235 --> 01:17:50.315
<v Speaker 0>Okay. There you So for this one

01:17:51.810 --> 01:17:54.449
<v Speaker 1>yeah. So, again, there isn't any upgrades or

01:17:54.449 --> 01:17:55.809
<v Speaker 1>or a patch for that.

01:17:57.090 --> 01:17:59.650
<v Speaker 1>The patch the patch stuff's kind of interesting.

01:17:59.650 --> 01:18:03.010
<v Speaker 1>So for sometimes where because we've got a

01:18:03.010 --> 01:18:04.209
<v Speaker 1>big security team,

01:18:04.690 --> 01:18:06.849
<v Speaker 1>you know, obviously doing security research,

01:18:08.125 --> 01:18:09.645
<v Speaker 1>Where there might where there aren't

01:18:10.525 --> 01:18:13.244
<v Speaker 1>sometimes where there aren't upstream fixes

01:18:13.485 --> 01:18:15.644
<v Speaker 1>as in an upgrade pathway,

01:18:15.965 --> 01:18:17.804
<v Speaker 1>we will actually release a patch

01:18:18.685 --> 01:18:20.990
<v Speaker 1>that you can patch in place. So for

01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:23.070
<v Speaker 1>some, you'll see for some vulnerabilities,

01:18:23.070 --> 01:18:24.830
<v Speaker 1>there'll be a sneak patch available,

01:18:24.990 --> 01:18:27.230
<v Speaker 1>which will just patch it whilst

01:18:27.230 --> 01:18:29.550
<v Speaker 1>they're waiting for upstream to fix it.

01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:32.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. So

01:18:32.685 --> 01:18:34.284
<v Speaker 0>don't think they're able fix No.

01:18:36.045 --> 01:18:38.284
<v Speaker 1>But that that would give you the, you

01:18:38.284 --> 01:18:39.644
<v Speaker 1>know, the automated

01:18:40.284 --> 01:18:41.965
<v Speaker 1>way of fixing it if you didn't just

01:18:41.965 --> 01:18:43.564
<v Speaker 1>wanna edit the file yourself.

01:18:43.965 --> 01:18:46.925
<v Speaker 1>The other interesting thing about the the CLI

01:18:46.925 --> 01:18:49.110
<v Speaker 1>is there's a couple of different ways that

01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:50.790
<v Speaker 1>you can output the data.

01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:51.990
<v Speaker 1>So

01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:55.670
<v Speaker 1>there's a an interchange format called Serif that's

01:18:55.670 --> 01:18:57.030
<v Speaker 1>very common in security,

01:18:57.190 --> 01:18:59.030
<v Speaker 1>but it will also output in JSON.

01:18:59.445 --> 01:19:01.445
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is that then you

01:19:01.445 --> 01:19:04.005
<v Speaker 1>can do all sorts of of funky stuff

01:19:04.005 --> 01:19:05.925
<v Speaker 1>with with JQ

01:19:06.005 --> 01:19:07.044
<v Speaker 1>for filtering.

01:19:07.605 --> 01:19:09.284
<v Speaker 1>So, you know, I I was playing around

01:19:09.284 --> 01:19:11.364
<v Speaker 1>the other day with saying you know, we

01:19:11.364 --> 01:19:12.645
<v Speaker 1>talked earlier about saying,

01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:15.960
<v Speaker 1>perhaps I only care about vulnerabilities that have

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:16.760
<v Speaker 1>a network

01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:18.199
<v Speaker 1>attack path.

01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:20.120
<v Speaker 1>So

01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:21.080
<v Speaker 1>if

01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:23.000
<v Speaker 1>we do do you wanna just do a

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.040
<v Speaker 1>scan quickly in JSON, and I'll show you

01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:27.240
<v Speaker 1>what the output looks like.

01:19:28.715 --> 01:19:29.514
<v Speaker 1>I

01:19:30.315 --> 01:19:32.554
<v Speaker 1>think it's just minus minus JSON, is it?

01:19:32.554 --> 01:19:34.155
<v Speaker 0>I don't know. I just I was just

01:19:34.155 --> 01:19:34.874
<v Speaker 0>guessing.

01:19:36.155 --> 01:19:38.875
<v Speaker 0>Let's try. Yes. It's just minus minus JSON.

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:44.360
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. There we go. So if we if

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:46.360
<v Speaker 1>you scroll up a bit there, what what

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:49.880
<v Speaker 1>so, obviously, there's a ton of different information

01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:50.519
<v Speaker 1>there,

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:53.480
<v Speaker 1>but the one I was interested in was

01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:54.920
<v Speaker 1>the CVSS

01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:56.040
<v Speaker 1>score.

01:19:59.165 --> 01:20:01.485
<v Speaker 1>Why is that oh, so can you see

01:20:01.485 --> 01:20:03.885
<v Speaker 1>that string on there? CVSS v three,

01:20:04.125 --> 01:20:06.525
<v Speaker 1>the the up up about four

01:20:07.325 --> 01:20:08.205
<v Speaker 1>yeah. See there.

01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:11.660
<v Speaker 1>So all of those things respond

01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:13.020
<v Speaker 1>correspond

01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:13.980
<v Speaker 1>to that.

01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:17.900
<v Speaker 1>It's a programmatic way of of representing

01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:21.100
<v Speaker 1>that CVSS scoring that we looked at earlier.

01:20:21.575 --> 01:20:23.975
<v Speaker 1>So there, see the AVN?

01:20:23.975 --> 01:20:25.815
<v Speaker 1>That means that there is a net that's

01:20:25.815 --> 01:20:27.094
<v Speaker 1>network exploitable.

01:20:27.495 --> 01:20:29.255
<v Speaker 1>So you can filter on these things. You

01:20:29.255 --> 01:20:30.855
<v Speaker 1>can build a really complex

01:20:31.335 --> 01:20:33.175
<v Speaker 1>if you like that sort of thing, you

01:20:33.175 --> 01:20:34.535
<v Speaker 1>know, I'm sure most of us

01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:38.310
<v Speaker 1>familiar with familiar with j q? Oh, yeah.

01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. David? Yeah.

01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:40.949
<v Speaker 1>So and the

01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:42.550
<v Speaker 1>the interesting

01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:45.750
<v Speaker 1>complexity of building complex g q

01:20:47.045 --> 01:20:49.445
<v Speaker 1>filter strings. But yeah. So you could build

01:20:49.445 --> 01:20:51.045
<v Speaker 1>you could build you know, if you were

01:20:51.045 --> 01:20:53.605
<v Speaker 1>in a CI pipeline and you wanted to

01:20:53.605 --> 01:20:54.804
<v Speaker 1>do Snyk test,

01:20:55.205 --> 01:20:57.285
<v Speaker 1>but you wanted to ignore certain kinds of

01:20:57.285 --> 01:20:58.245
<v Speaker 1>vulnerabilities,

01:20:58.565 --> 01:21:01.125
<v Speaker 1>you can set Snyk you can set what

01:21:01.125 --> 01:21:02.005
<v Speaker 1>the

01:21:02.510 --> 01:21:04.910
<v Speaker 1>the failure is gonna be for a start.

01:21:04.910 --> 01:21:06.750
<v Speaker 1>So you could say, like, you know, I

01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:08.030
<v Speaker 1>don't want to fail.

01:21:08.190 --> 01:21:09.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't wanna return

01:21:10.030 --> 01:21:11.070
<v Speaker 1>non zero

01:21:11.230 --> 01:21:12.590
<v Speaker 1>on everything.

01:21:13.390 --> 01:21:15.470
<v Speaker 1>And then you can make a j q

01:21:16.155 --> 01:21:18.954
<v Speaker 1>query that says filter for, you know, things

01:21:18.954 --> 01:21:20.155
<v Speaker 1>that only have a

01:21:20.715 --> 01:21:23.034
<v Speaker 1>a network. I had a one I was

01:21:23.034 --> 01:21:24.715
<v Speaker 1>playing with the other day that

01:21:25.114 --> 01:21:25.834
<v Speaker 1>did

01:21:25.994 --> 01:21:27.914
<v Speaker 1>kinda do the job. I have to dig

01:21:27.914 --> 01:21:28.635
<v Speaker 1>it out.

01:21:29.514 --> 01:21:31.434
<v Speaker 0>Oh, so it's not top level. It's

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You have to do

01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:37.280
<v Speaker 1>where was that? I put it in a

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:41.520
<v Speaker 1>blog. Wait one second. Dot filter dot ignore.

01:21:47.365 --> 01:21:49.364
<v Speaker 0>Oh, wait. That's not gonna be right. Oh,

01:21:50.325 --> 01:21:51.205
<v Speaker 0>there we go.

01:21:56.005 --> 01:21:59.285
<v Speaker 0>Filtered with ignore or ignored? I don't remember

01:21:59.285 --> 01:22:01.639
<v Speaker 0>now. And then that one Yeah.

01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:05.560
<v Speaker 1>I I had had it's vulnerability to see

01:22:05.639 --> 01:22:08.199
<v Speaker 1>is the the top level thing.

01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:11.080
<v Speaker 1>I've got nowhere to paste anything here, am

01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:11.159
<v Speaker 1>I?

01:22:12.055 --> 01:22:13.415
<v Speaker 0>I'll tell you what. I don't have to

01:22:13.415 --> 01:22:15.095
<v Speaker 0>run the test every time. Why don't we

01:22:15.095 --> 01:22:16.855
<v Speaker 0>write it to you? Know you you know

01:22:16.855 --> 01:22:18.855
<v Speaker 1>where I'm going with this though is that

01:22:19.175 --> 01:22:21.415
<v Speaker 1>there is there is you could build pretty

01:22:21.415 --> 01:22:22.695
<v Speaker 1>complex filters

01:22:22.935 --> 01:22:24.775
<v Speaker 1>using the JSON output.

01:22:26.150 --> 01:22:26.709
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:27.909
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

01:22:28.869 --> 01:22:29.590
<v Speaker 0>So

01:22:30.469 --> 01:22:32.630
<v Speaker 0>no. Need to learn how to spell vulnerabilities.

01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:33.909
<v Speaker 1>Vulnerabilities.

01:22:34.469 --> 01:22:37.269
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. We yeah. Open open close square brackets.

01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:39.670
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So mines are ignored, which means I

01:22:39.670 --> 01:22:42.165
<v Speaker 0>think they live under filtered. So let's try

01:22:42.165 --> 01:22:42.804
<v Speaker 0>that.

01:22:44.405 --> 01:22:47.364
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. And then there was a ignored

01:22:48.645 --> 01:22:48.965
<v Speaker 0>key.

01:22:57.810 --> 01:22:59.810
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't have opened this can of worm,

01:22:59.810 --> 01:23:00.450
<v Speaker 1>should I?

01:23:00.850 --> 01:23:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Live j q is not

01:23:03.970 --> 01:23:05.410
<v Speaker 0>You don't have to be here all day.

01:23:05.410 --> 01:23:07.010
<v Speaker 0>Oh, that that breaks my heart.

01:23:08.605 --> 01:23:11.005
<v Speaker 0>Cannot index an array with a string.

01:23:12.365 --> 01:23:14.605
<v Speaker 0>That's

01:23:14.605 --> 01:23:15.405
<v Speaker 0>a thing.

01:23:16.765 --> 01:23:18.285
<v Speaker 1>JQ is always one of those things that

01:23:18.525 --> 01:23:20.330
<v Speaker 0>It's like a whole new programming language, isn't

01:23:20.330 --> 01:23:22.330
<v Speaker 0>it? Like Yeah. I have to do tons

01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:24.250
<v Speaker 1>of googling every time I get it out.

01:23:24.250 --> 01:23:24.330
<v Speaker 1>But

01:23:25.610 --> 01:23:28.250
<v Speaker 0>Well, I'm sure it's something like piping it

01:23:28.250 --> 01:23:30.890
<v Speaker 0>to contains and then looking for AV Yeah.

01:23:30.890 --> 01:23:32.970
<v Speaker 1>You do. You do. So yeah. If I

01:23:32.970 --> 01:23:34.650
<v Speaker 1>had a if I had somewhere

01:23:34.895 --> 01:23:37.455
<v Speaker 1>copy pasting my test one to you, I

01:23:37.455 --> 01:23:40.015
<v Speaker 1>would do it. But Okay. So you can

01:23:40.015 --> 01:23:40.974
<v Speaker 1>do a select.

01:23:41.295 --> 01:23:42.895
<v Speaker 1>You can do a select. So you pipe

01:23:42.895 --> 01:23:45.055
<v Speaker 1>that pipe that to select, and then you

01:23:45.055 --> 01:23:48.094
<v Speaker 1>select on the on the thing you wanted,

01:23:48.094 --> 01:23:49.215
<v Speaker 1>the the element,

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.200
<v Speaker 1>and then you

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:55.280
<v Speaker 1>you can filter.

01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:56.240
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:59.200
<v Speaker 0>I guess people just have to learn

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:01.440
<v Speaker 0>about that CVSS.

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:03.520
<v Speaker 1>It's just a way of basically a way

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:06.534
<v Speaker 1>of building complex stuff on the CLI. Nice.

01:24:06.695 --> 01:24:08.695
<v Speaker 1>You know, if you if you had a

01:24:08.695 --> 01:24:11.894
<v Speaker 1>need to do that for any reason, integration,

01:24:11.895 --> 01:24:12.454
<v Speaker 1>whatever.

01:24:14.054 --> 01:24:15.414
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I like it.

01:24:16.054 --> 01:24:17.735
<v Speaker 0>Anything else you wanna show before I flick

01:24:17.735 --> 01:24:19.655
<v Speaker 0>those back over to to chatty mode?

01:24:20.530 --> 01:24:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So it would be nice to show

01:24:22.610 --> 01:24:25.490
<v Speaker 1>you this other really cool free thing that

01:24:25.490 --> 01:24:27.890
<v Speaker 1>we're that we're doing called adviser.

01:24:28.130 --> 01:24:29.330
<v Speaker 1>And so

01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:34.485
<v Speaker 1>if you go to snake.i0/adviser,

01:24:35.765 --> 01:24:37.525
<v Speaker 1>I think it yeah. Slash adviser.

01:24:45.630 --> 01:24:47.550
<v Speaker 1>So this is this is something else we

01:24:47.550 --> 01:24:49.870
<v Speaker 1>built that because, you know, we've got all

01:24:49.870 --> 01:24:52.750
<v Speaker 1>this data, you know, data on security vulnerabilities,

01:24:52.750 --> 01:24:54.590
<v Speaker 1>data on open source projects. So,

01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:58.935
<v Speaker 1>there's been a lot of talk recently, and

01:24:58.935 --> 01:25:00.455
<v Speaker 1>I and we we talked about it right

01:25:00.455 --> 01:25:02.294
<v Speaker 1>at the start, right, about supply chain

01:25:02.534 --> 01:25:04.294
<v Speaker 1>security. How do I pick

01:25:04.695 --> 01:25:06.534
<v Speaker 1>an open source project? You know? And in

01:25:06.534 --> 01:25:08.295
<v Speaker 1>the like I said, in the Python world,

01:25:08.295 --> 01:25:09.815
<v Speaker 1>things used to be fairly simple. Right? If

01:25:09.815 --> 01:25:12.215
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to do something with HTTP,

01:25:12.215 --> 01:25:13.255
<v Speaker 1>I used requests.

01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:17.180
<v Speaker 1>That's it. But in newer ecosystems, you can

01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:19.580
<v Speaker 1>often have lots of choice about a particular

01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:20.460
<v Speaker 1>package.

01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:22.620
<v Speaker 1>So how do you choose which package to

01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:24.620
<v Speaker 1>use? And it's not just, like, about

01:25:27.495 --> 01:25:30.055
<v Speaker 1>what vulnerabilities are in it because as we

01:25:30.055 --> 01:25:31.895
<v Speaker 1>all know when we work in open source,

01:25:31.895 --> 01:25:33.575
<v Speaker 1>you know, there are other metrics that are

01:25:33.575 --> 01:25:35.415
<v Speaker 1>kind of important to open source

01:25:35.655 --> 01:25:38.215
<v Speaker 1>things. Right? Like, how how many

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:42.479
<v Speaker 1>different contributions are there? Is it maintained?

01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:44.880
<v Speaker 1>You know? Is there a community around it?

01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:47.280
<v Speaker 1>Mhmm. So we built this adviser tool to

01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:49.920
<v Speaker 1>combine all these data sources. So if you

01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:50.960
<v Speaker 1>have a look at the if you go

01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:52.719
<v Speaker 1>to PyPy, it's probably easiest, and we can

01:25:52.719 --> 01:25:54.320
<v Speaker 1>actually look at something like requests,

01:25:54.995 --> 01:25:57.155
<v Speaker 1>you know, which is a a super well

01:25:57.155 --> 01:25:57.955
<v Speaker 1>maintained

01:25:58.835 --> 01:26:00.435
<v Speaker 1>thing. If you do a search there for

01:26:00.435 --> 01:26:01.235
<v Speaker 1>requests,

01:26:02.435 --> 01:26:04.995
<v Speaker 1>it's clearly there's some weird type of squatting

01:26:04.995 --> 01:26:06.835
<v Speaker 1>things going on here in

01:26:07.075 --> 01:26:08.115
<v Speaker 1>in PyPy

01:26:08.650 --> 01:26:11.370
<v Speaker 1>with these these things that I don't know

01:26:11.370 --> 01:26:12.490
<v Speaker 1>what they are. But if we look at

01:26:12.490 --> 01:26:14.570
<v Speaker 1>the main request package, you'll see kinda how

01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:15.450
<v Speaker 1>adviser works.

01:26:20.425 --> 01:26:22.425
<v Speaker 1>What we get here then is this overall

01:26:22.425 --> 01:26:25.785
<v Speaker 1>health score for a particular package, which includes

01:26:25.785 --> 01:26:27.945
<v Speaker 1>how popular it is, how well maintained it

01:26:27.945 --> 01:26:28.425
<v Speaker 1>is.

01:26:29.385 --> 01:26:31.385
<v Speaker 1>Security is obviously one part of it as

01:26:31.385 --> 01:26:32.985
<v Speaker 1>well, like, how how

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:35.960
<v Speaker 1>secure is it? But it's this whole kind

01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:37.239
<v Speaker 1>of package,

01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:39.160
<v Speaker 1>you know, thing for how do I choose

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.599
<v Speaker 1>which package to use.

01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:43.000
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's super cool.

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:46.200
<v Speaker 1>We're adding more ecosystems to this, you know,

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:47.560
<v Speaker 1>in the next few months. It's kind of

01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:49.955
<v Speaker 1>in beta at the minute, But it's a

01:26:49.955 --> 01:26:52.275
<v Speaker 1>way for people to be able to, like,

01:26:52.275 --> 01:26:52.994
<v Speaker 1>you know,

01:26:54.035 --> 01:26:56.115
<v Speaker 1>have a view onto which package should I

01:26:56.115 --> 01:26:57.475
<v Speaker 1>use for my project.

01:26:58.515 --> 01:27:00.835
<v Speaker 1>And so at the minute, it mainly supports

01:27:00.835 --> 01:27:02.515
<v Speaker 1>node and PyPI.

01:27:02.930 --> 01:27:04.530
<v Speaker 1>But like I say, we're

01:27:05.330 --> 01:27:08.370
<v Speaker 1>NPM and and PyPI, but we're adding ecosystems

01:27:08.370 --> 01:27:09.250
<v Speaker 1>to it.

01:27:09.650 --> 01:27:10.210
<v Speaker 1>And,

01:27:10.450 --> 01:27:12.450
<v Speaker 1>yeah, I'm gonna hopefully do some conference talks

01:27:12.450 --> 01:27:13.970
<v Speaker 1>about it as well because I really like

01:27:13.970 --> 01:27:14.449
<v Speaker 1>it.

01:27:15.090 --> 01:27:17.330
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Very handy tool. I'm gonna have to

01:27:17.330 --> 01:27:18.530
<v Speaker 0>look up lodash now though.

01:27:21.065 --> 01:27:23.625
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So I don't know what that lodash.js

01:27:23.625 --> 01:27:25.865
<v Speaker 1>1 is. It's quite sneaky, isn't it? Like,

01:27:25.865 --> 01:27:26.745
<v Speaker 0>lodash.js

01:27:26.745 --> 01:27:28.585
<v Speaker 0>will send their name and then they've added

01:27:28.585 --> 01:27:29.945
<v Speaker 0>on the dash security,

01:27:30.265 --> 01:27:32.585
<v Speaker 0>like annotation on the tag version. I mean,

01:27:32.585 --> 01:27:34.369
<v Speaker 1>I don't know whether it is typos quote

01:27:34.369 --> 01:27:37.090
<v Speaker 1>or whether it's a genuine package that someone's

01:27:37.090 --> 01:27:39.730
<v Speaker 1>uploaded. But, you know, we're clearly not scoring

01:27:39.730 --> 01:27:43.090
<v Speaker 1>it very highly for some reason or other.

01:27:43.250 --> 01:27:45.250
<v Speaker 0>Seems oh, that was suspicious

01:27:45.795 --> 01:27:48.114
<v Speaker 0>to me. But there you go. I mean,

01:27:48.114 --> 01:27:49.875
<v Speaker 1>may not be suspicious. It may be that's

01:27:49.875 --> 01:27:52.275
<v Speaker 1>a one dude who's contributing to it. In

01:27:52.275 --> 01:27:53.955
<v Speaker 1>which case, you probably still shouldn't use it

01:27:53.955 --> 01:27:56.195
<v Speaker 1>either. Right? Because that dude gets hit by

01:27:56.195 --> 01:27:57.554
<v Speaker 1>a bus and then you're in trouble.

01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:00.720
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's try a Docker one too. Since

01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:02.560
<v Speaker 0>we got a comment saying Docker is available

01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:04.560
<v Speaker 0>also from b mad. We'll take a quick

01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:05.120
<v Speaker 0>look.

01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Docker's in I haven't actually looked too

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.320
<v Speaker 1>much into how the what the Docker support

01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:11.520
<v Speaker 1>is like in there at the minute.

01:28:14.165 --> 01:28:16.485
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So it's a bit more limited, the

01:28:16.565 --> 01:28:19.605
<v Speaker 1>the amount of information on on Docker images.

01:28:19.605 --> 01:28:21.364
<v Speaker 1>I know this has been actively

01:28:21.525 --> 01:28:23.285
<v Speaker 1>actively developed.

01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:27.620
<v Speaker 1>Docker's really new. It's worth saying as well

01:28:27.620 --> 01:28:29.540
<v Speaker 1>that you get Docker you get all sorts

01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:31.940
<v Speaker 1>of Docker goodness built into Docker as well

01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:32.740
<v Speaker 1>these days.

01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:35.780
<v Speaker 1>The Docker Hub built in scanning, if you

01:28:35.780 --> 01:28:37.860
<v Speaker 1>if you actually have, like, a proper Docker

01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:40.595
<v Speaker 1>Hub account, you get free Snyk scanning built

01:28:40.595 --> 01:28:43.555
<v Speaker 1>in. And the Docker CLIs

01:28:43.555 --> 01:28:46.675
<v Speaker 1>all have Snyk scanning built in for free,

01:28:46.675 --> 01:28:47.235
<v Speaker 1>I think,

01:28:48.195 --> 01:28:50.275
<v Speaker 1>for for all platforms now. So you can

01:28:50.275 --> 01:28:52.355
<v Speaker 1>do Docker scan, and it's exactly the same

01:28:52.355 --> 01:28:53.875
<v Speaker 1>as Snyk scan. So you don't even need

01:28:53.875 --> 01:28:56.429
<v Speaker 1>to move outside of the docker CLI.

01:28:57.550 --> 01:28:59.790
<v Speaker 0>Very cool. Very, very handy tool. I agree

01:28:59.790 --> 01:29:03.869
<v Speaker 0>that that's available for everyone. So Snyk.i0/adviser.

01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:06.685
<v Speaker 0>Never pick your next package without it. I

01:29:06.685 --> 01:29:08.205
<v Speaker 0>think that's my takeaway there.

01:29:08.845 --> 01:29:09.485
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:29:09.885 --> 01:29:12.125
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Pick your open source packages like you'd

01:29:12.125 --> 01:29:13.165
<v Speaker 1>pick a hotel.

01:29:15.485 --> 01:29:17.485
<v Speaker 0>It did offer me an alternative when we

01:29:17.485 --> 01:29:19.485
<v Speaker 0>were on the PIPE one for request. It

01:29:19.485 --> 01:29:21.965
<v Speaker 0>did actually say like here's alternative packages like

01:29:21.965 --> 01:29:24.179
<v Speaker 0>this. That was quite cool. We did. Yeah.

01:29:24.179 --> 01:29:26.179
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I offered another http package.

01:29:34.555 --> 01:29:36.875
<v Speaker 0>Oh, a I Yeah. Where you should be.

01:29:36.875 --> 01:29:37.675
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

01:29:38.315 --> 01:29:39.755
<v Speaker 1>Also leaning in there.

01:29:40.475 --> 01:29:41.435
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

01:29:41.995 --> 01:29:44.155
<v Speaker 0>Well, that was a very complete

01:29:44.875 --> 01:29:46.395
<v Speaker 0>tour of Snyk.

01:29:46.875 --> 01:29:48.315
<v Speaker 0>There there's a lot. Right?

01:29:49.450 --> 01:29:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. There's there's more as well. I

01:29:52.010 --> 01:29:52.570
<v Speaker 1>mean,

01:29:53.370 --> 01:29:55.370
<v Speaker 1>like, there's all sorts of bits that, you

01:29:55.370 --> 01:29:57.290
<v Speaker 1>know you know what it's like being DevRel.

01:29:57.290 --> 01:29:58.650
<v Speaker 1>You know, you sort of use bits of

01:29:58.650 --> 01:30:00.250
<v Speaker 1>the thing and you don't use other bits

01:30:00.250 --> 01:30:02.815
<v Speaker 1>of the thing, you know. And often the

01:30:02.815 --> 01:30:04.975
<v Speaker 1>people in the real world who are using

01:30:04.975 --> 01:30:06.574
<v Speaker 1>these things in anger get to

01:30:07.055 --> 01:30:09.375
<v Speaker 1>go in different directions from the direction that

01:30:09.375 --> 01:30:11.135
<v Speaker 1>we go in. Yeah. Definitely.

01:30:12.415 --> 01:30:13.215
<v Speaker 0>I

01:30:13.295 --> 01:30:15.135
<v Speaker 0>was gonna try and summarize everything we've seen,

01:30:15.135 --> 01:30:17.215
<v Speaker 0>but I think maybe we're all angry. So

01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:20.230
<v Speaker 0>we added a repository on Snyk.io and we

01:30:20.230 --> 01:30:22.070
<v Speaker 0>got a whole bunch of vulnerability

01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:23.190
<v Speaker 0>information

01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:26.790
<v Speaker 0>from the code and from our Docker containers

01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:27.830
<v Speaker 0>that were linked

01:30:28.150 --> 01:30:29.270
<v Speaker 0>and the Docker files.

01:30:29.855 --> 01:30:32.735
<v Speaker 0>We then brought that kind of UI experience

01:30:32.735 --> 01:30:35.775
<v Speaker 0>into developer land looking at the Versus code

01:30:35.775 --> 01:30:37.775
<v Speaker 0>integration, the really cool,

01:30:38.975 --> 01:30:40.655
<v Speaker 0>you know, squiggles in front of my code

01:30:40.655 --> 01:30:42.175
<v Speaker 0>front and center as I'm writing that was

01:30:42.175 --> 01:30:42.975
<v Speaker 0>a really nice application. Yeah.

01:30:43.855 --> 01:30:44.415
<v Speaker 0>I've seen

01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:47.180
<v Speaker 0>what bad practices I'm doing. Like, I'm not

01:30:47.180 --> 01:30:49.580
<v Speaker 0>sanitizing HTTP inputs and such. That was really

01:30:49.580 --> 01:30:50.460
<v Speaker 0>really nice.

01:30:50.699 --> 01:30:52.219
<v Speaker 0>We then brought it to the command line

01:30:52.219 --> 01:30:54.780
<v Speaker 0>using Snyk test. We also seen the infrastructure

01:30:54.780 --> 01:30:56.300
<v Speaker 0>as code for Kubernetes.

01:30:56.380 --> 01:30:58.300
<v Speaker 0>I love that that's available for Terraform too.

01:30:58.300 --> 01:30:59.739
<v Speaker 0>I'm definitely gonna have to check that out.

01:31:00.815 --> 01:31:02.815
<v Speaker 0>And then towards the end, we brought in

01:31:02.815 --> 01:31:04.415
<v Speaker 0>the Snyk Advisor and we were looking at

01:31:04.415 --> 01:31:06.575
<v Speaker 0>how we can actually understand the health of

01:31:06.575 --> 01:31:08.815
<v Speaker 0>the open source libraries that we're consuming as

01:31:08.815 --> 01:31:09.295
<v Speaker 0>well.

01:31:09.695 --> 01:31:11.775
<v Speaker 0>An awful lot for people to go and

01:31:11.775 --> 01:31:14.095
<v Speaker 0>kick their tires on, play with, and enjoy.

01:31:15.150 --> 01:31:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Sign up for a free account. Most

01:31:17.230 --> 01:31:18.990
<v Speaker 1>of this, I think almost everything that we've

01:31:18.990 --> 01:31:22.110
<v Speaker 1>looked at is all available for free anyway.

01:31:22.110 --> 01:31:24.030
<v Speaker 1>So have at it.

01:31:24.510 --> 01:31:26.830
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Well, thank you very much for your

01:31:26.830 --> 01:31:28.430
<v Speaker 0>time today, Matt. It's been an absolute pleasure

01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:29.790
<v Speaker 0>going through all this work. Thanks for having

01:31:29.790 --> 01:31:31.655
<v Speaker 1>me. I enjoyed it. It's been great.

01:31:32.295 --> 01:31:34.855
<v Speaker 0>And I hopefully will see you at an

01:31:34.855 --> 01:31:37.415
<v Speaker 0>event or conference soon. Yeah. And we can

01:31:37.415 --> 01:31:39.895
<v Speaker 0>see you in person. But have a have

01:31:39.895 --> 01:31:41.255
<v Speaker 0>a wonderful day and thank you again for

01:31:41.255 --> 01:31:42.615
<v Speaker 0>joining me. Thanks all.
