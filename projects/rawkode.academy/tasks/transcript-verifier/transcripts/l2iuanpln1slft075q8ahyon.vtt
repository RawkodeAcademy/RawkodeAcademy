00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.810
<v Speaker 0>Hello and welcome to today's episode of Rawkode

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.885
<v Speaker 0>live. I'm your host, Rawkode.

00:01:33.205 --> 00:01:34.645
<v Speaker 0>Today, we're gonna be taking a look at

00:01:34.645 --> 00:01:35.605
<v Speaker 0>Gitpod.

00:01:35.765 --> 00:01:37.445
<v Speaker 0>Before we do that, I just wanna take

00:01:37.445 --> 00:01:38.645
<v Speaker 0>a moment to say thank you to my

00:01:38.645 --> 00:01:41.125
<v Speaker 0>employer, Equinix Metal. They are a bare metal

00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:43.285
<v Speaker 0>cloud, and they provide the time and the

00:01:43.285 --> 00:01:45.520
<v Speaker 0>resources that allows me to invest in a

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.680
<v Speaker 0>show and produce great cloud native learning materials

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.119
<v Speaker 0>so we can all learn together.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.280
<v Speaker 0>If you wanna check out Equinix metal, please

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.920
<v Speaker 0>visit

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.439
<v Speaker 0>metal.equinix.com

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.200
<v Speaker 0>and use the code Rawkode

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.680
<v Speaker 0>dash live. This will give you $50

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.225
<v Speaker 0>of credit. That $50 can get you roughly

00:02:00.225 --> 00:02:02.545
<v Speaker 0>one hundred hours of compute on our smallest

00:02:02.545 --> 00:02:04.705
<v Speaker 0>instance. So check it out, have some fun,

00:02:04.705 --> 00:02:05.985
<v Speaker 0>and let me know how you get on.

00:02:06.305 --> 00:02:08.544
<v Speaker 0>Now today to look at Gitpod,

00:02:08.544 --> 00:02:10.145
<v Speaker 0>I am joined by two

00:02:10.625 --> 00:02:13.870
<v Speaker 0>they're great team members, Christian and Sven. Hello.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:14.990
<v Speaker 0>How are you both?

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.230
<v Speaker 1>Hi, David. Great. Hey. Good. Awesome. Thank you.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.030
<v Speaker 0>Would

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.950
<v Speaker 0>you just like to just take a moment

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.110
<v Speaker 0>to first introduce yourselves and then we'll talk

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.950
<v Speaker 0>about what Gitpod is and how it can

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:26.269
<v Speaker 0>help us?

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:29.765
<v Speaker 1>Chris, do you wanna start?

00:02:30.005 --> 00:02:31.525
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I can I can have a go?

00:02:31.525 --> 00:02:33.925
<v Speaker 2>So my name is Chris. I'm the chief

00:02:33.925 --> 00:02:35.205
<v Speaker 2>architect at Gitpod.

00:02:35.525 --> 00:02:37.525
<v Speaker 2>And my role is to

00:02:38.565 --> 00:02:40.725
<v Speaker 2>make sure we stay sort of technically coherent

00:02:40.725 --> 00:02:42.965
<v Speaker 2>and, you know, decide on how we build

00:02:42.965 --> 00:02:43.365
<v Speaker 2>this

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.290
<v Speaker 2>or guide the discussion on how we build

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.129
<v Speaker 2>this thing and make sure the team stays

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.010
<v Speaker 2>aligned on that from the technical perspective.

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:53.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I'm Sven.

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:55.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of the cofounders

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.890
<v Speaker 1>and CEO of Gitpod. And,

00:02:58.565 --> 00:03:00.805
<v Speaker 1>yeah, my passion is like, I'm I'm an

00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:03.364
<v Speaker 1>engineer also, but I really, like, look into

00:03:03.364 --> 00:03:04.405
<v Speaker 1>the product

00:03:05.284 --> 00:03:06.405
<v Speaker 1>stuff and

00:03:06.485 --> 00:03:08.325
<v Speaker 1>yeah. It's in in entirety.

00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:10.245
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. So

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.610
<v Speaker 0>should we start by just saying, you know,

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.170
<v Speaker 0>what is Gitpod and what what problem does

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.130
<v Speaker 0>it aim to solve?

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Of course.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.050
<v Speaker 1>So Gitpod is

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.569
<v Speaker 1>dev environments in the cloud. Basically, our plan

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.035
<v Speaker 1>is always be ready to code. So what

00:03:27.035 --> 00:03:29.355
<v Speaker 1>we wanna make sure is that developers

00:03:29.355 --> 00:03:32.395
<v Speaker 1>stop wasting their time on manually setting up

00:03:32.395 --> 00:03:33.675
<v Speaker 1>local machines,

00:03:33.675 --> 00:03:35.115
<v Speaker 1>you know, with databases,

00:03:35.115 --> 00:03:37.355
<v Speaker 1>compilers, stuff like that before they can start

00:03:37.355 --> 00:03:37.835
<v Speaker 1>coding.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.260
<v Speaker 1>We

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.700
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty simple. Like, we apply lessons learned

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 1>from infrastructure's

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.540
<v Speaker 1>code and continuous integration. So what you do

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.100
<v Speaker 1>is you describe your development environment,

00:03:50.915 --> 00:03:53.395
<v Speaker 1>which is not only the IDE,

00:03:53.395 --> 00:03:55.475
<v Speaker 1>but all the tools you need. You describe

00:03:55.475 --> 00:03:56.515
<v Speaker 1>that in code

00:03:56.675 --> 00:03:59.155
<v Speaker 1>and have that part of your Git repository,

00:03:59.235 --> 00:04:00.435
<v Speaker 1>so it's versioned.

00:04:01.075 --> 00:04:02.035
<v Speaker 1>And with that,

00:04:02.355 --> 00:04:04.915
<v Speaker 1>when someone pushes a change, we can always,

00:04:04.915 --> 00:04:05.875
<v Speaker 1>you know, recreate

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.150
<v Speaker 1>entire dev environments that are fully initialized and

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.510
<v Speaker 1>ready to call. We do that in the

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.590
<v Speaker 1>cloud. So when a developer comes by, wants

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.190
<v Speaker 1>to start a dev environment on a certain

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.910
<v Speaker 1>branch,

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.149
<v Speaker 1>it takes a couple of seconds in order

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:20.589
<v Speaker 1>to get dive into being creative and working

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:21.149
<v Speaker 1>in code.

00:04:24.425 --> 00:04:26.345
<v Speaker 0>Yes. I think it's

00:04:26.825 --> 00:04:29.385
<v Speaker 0>this kind of tooling is is becoming more

00:04:29.385 --> 00:04:31.225
<v Speaker 0>and more important. You know, I think before

00:04:31.225 --> 00:04:33.305
<v Speaker 0>we went live, I talked about my my

00:04:33.305 --> 00:04:35.145
<v Speaker 0>aspirations of being able to survive on a

00:04:35.145 --> 00:04:36.185
<v Speaker 0>Chromebook

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.930
<v Speaker 0>as my day to day machine. And one

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.530
<v Speaker 0>of the challenges there is is having the

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.050
<v Speaker 0>toolings to work on projects.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.610
<v Speaker 0>But even more importantly than that, you know,

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.009
<v Speaker 0>I think making the path easier for open

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:47.849
<v Speaker 0>source contributors to pick up a new project

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:49.370
<v Speaker 0>and a language that they're maybe not all

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.974
<v Speaker 0>that comfortable with with tooling that they're not

00:04:50.974 --> 00:04:52.895
<v Speaker 0>all that comfortable with and have a tool

00:04:52.895 --> 00:04:54.735
<v Speaker 0>that get pod where they can click button

00:04:54.735 --> 00:04:57.375
<v Speaker 0>and have a working environment for

00:04:57.935 --> 00:04:59.935
<v Speaker 0>for making their first contribution, I think, is

00:04:59.935 --> 00:05:00.895
<v Speaker 0>is definitely important.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.670
<v Speaker 0>So can we

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.870
<v Speaker 0>if we understand what what's the process then

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.870
<v Speaker 0>with Gitpod, you know, is this something that

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:09.750
<v Speaker 0>we expect

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.030
<v Speaker 0>the

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.750
<v Speaker 0>maintainers of the projects to put together themselves

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.389
<v Speaker 0>when they're making it available in open source?

00:05:19.565 --> 00:05:22.445
<v Speaker 1>I mean, yes. The the configuration for that

00:05:22.525 --> 00:05:25.725
<v Speaker 1>needs to be engineered by the team. So

00:05:25.725 --> 00:05:28.445
<v Speaker 1>the team decides on what what is the

00:05:28.525 --> 00:05:31.370
<v Speaker 1>perfect dev environment for all of us. You

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.530
<v Speaker 1>know, there are means that you add your

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:34.330
<v Speaker 1>personal

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:37.210
<v Speaker 1>touches on on top with key bindings and

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.729
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that. You can you can do

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:41.130
<v Speaker 1>that for sure. But at the core,

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:44.569
<v Speaker 1>we decide as a team, like, okay. Let's

00:05:44.095 --> 00:05:46.175
<v Speaker 1>we use, you know, this compiler and that

00:05:46.175 --> 00:05:47.855
<v Speaker 1>version, and we have this one time, and

00:05:47.855 --> 00:05:50.015
<v Speaker 1>we use that code generator, and we use

00:05:50.015 --> 00:05:52.335
<v Speaker 1>that database, or we have even 10 different

00:05:52.335 --> 00:05:54.415
<v Speaker 1>databases in our unit test we wanna test

00:05:54.415 --> 00:05:57.375
<v Speaker 1>against. And so that's all stuff you do

00:05:57.375 --> 00:05:59.055
<v Speaker 1>as a team. It doesn't matter whether you

00:05:59.055 --> 00:06:01.270
<v Speaker 1>do that in open source or in some

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.550
<v Speaker 1>commercial project.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.430
<v Speaker 1>You of course, in open source, you have

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.430
<v Speaker 1>even more external

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.110
<v Speaker 1>collaborators,

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.910
<v Speaker 1>contributors

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:10.630
<v Speaker 1>for

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:13.125
<v Speaker 1>whom you wanna make, you know, pay for

00:06:13.125 --> 00:06:15.444
<v Speaker 1>path, make it super easy to contribute, spin

00:06:15.444 --> 00:06:16.565
<v Speaker 1>up a dev environment.

00:06:17.525 --> 00:06:20.085
<v Speaker 1>But even in commercial projects, I mean, I've

00:06:20.085 --> 00:06:22.324
<v Speaker 1>I've been working as a consultant for

00:06:22.565 --> 00:06:24.405
<v Speaker 1>ten, fifteen years now.

00:06:24.724 --> 00:06:26.245
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen a project,

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:29.250
<v Speaker 1>like a commercial real world project where I

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.850
<v Speaker 1>was up to speed in

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.930
<v Speaker 1>in a couple of minutes. Usually, it takes

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.210
<v Speaker 1>two days until we can do do some

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:37.969
<v Speaker 1>work. Yeah.

00:06:39.105 --> 00:06:41.105
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I remember an organization I worked at

00:06:41.105 --> 00:06:42.625
<v Speaker 0>a few years ago where they forced all

00:06:42.625 --> 00:06:44.705
<v Speaker 0>the developers to use an ID that was

00:06:44.705 --> 00:06:46.785
<v Speaker 0>baked inside of a vagrant image. And they

00:06:46.785 --> 00:06:48.225
<v Speaker 0>all had to use the same settings and

00:06:48.225 --> 00:06:49.585
<v Speaker 0>the same color scheme and the same key

00:06:49.585 --> 00:06:51.265
<v Speaker 0>bindings and all of that. And

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.240
<v Speaker 0>I understand the intent there, but definitely not

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.639
<v Speaker 0>the ideal solution. Whereas something like that seems

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:58.560
<v Speaker 0>much more flexible. Now,

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.720
<v Speaker 0>I think the most important question I'm gonna

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.080
<v Speaker 0>ask you today is, does it have them

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.800
<v Speaker 0>key bindings?

00:07:06.485 --> 00:07:07.445
<v Speaker 2>If

00:07:07.845 --> 00:07:09.685
<v Speaker 2>if there is a Versus code extension for

00:07:09.685 --> 00:07:10.885
<v Speaker 2>Vim, then yes.

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:13.765
<v Speaker 0>Right. Nice. So that's okay. So it loads

00:07:13.765 --> 00:07:16.449
<v Speaker 0>Versus code extension. That's awesome. Let's

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.449
<v Speaker 0>pull up my my screen. So this is

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:19.810
<v Speaker 0>the Gitpod homepage.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.650
<v Speaker 0>If you're following along at home or wanna

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.490
<v Speaker 0>check this out on the replay, is getpod.io.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:27.810
<v Speaker 0>So does

00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:30.015
<v Speaker 0>is Gitpod. Does it just use the Versus

00:07:30.015 --> 00:07:32.095
<v Speaker 0>Code extensions or is that built on top

00:07:32.095 --> 00:07:33.615
<v Speaker 0>of Versus Code itself?

00:07:34.895 --> 00:07:37.055
<v Speaker 1>Both. It's a bit yeah. Like,

00:07:37.455 --> 00:07:40.255
<v Speaker 1>the IDE part of that is really not,

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.750
<v Speaker 1>like, the critical thing we wanna get across.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.590
<v Speaker 1>Like, what we really wanna achieve is that

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:46.390
<v Speaker 1>developers

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.030
<v Speaker 1>can bundle up the tools they love and

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.870
<v Speaker 1>they wanna use they would use locally. They

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.790
<v Speaker 1>bundle them up in this recipe

00:07:53.595 --> 00:07:56.235
<v Speaker 1>that Gitpod can execute and provide you in

00:07:56.235 --> 00:07:58.235
<v Speaker 1>a cloud. So you should be able to

00:07:58.235 --> 00:07:59.755
<v Speaker 1>use the IDE you love.

00:07:59.995 --> 00:08:02.715
<v Speaker 1>Right? When we started out, we saw, okay.

00:08:02.715 --> 00:08:04.795
<v Speaker 1>Like, Versus Code is a great IDE. We

00:08:04.795 --> 00:08:06.795
<v Speaker 1>we love it, and it seems to have

00:08:06.795 --> 00:08:09.560
<v Speaker 1>a market share that is significant and, you

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.919
<v Speaker 1>know, and increasing.

00:08:11.319 --> 00:08:13.880
<v Speaker 1>So we looked at Versus Code and and

00:08:14.039 --> 00:08:16.840
<v Speaker 1>checked whether we can, you know, somehow move

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.680
<v Speaker 1>it into the cloud, also talk

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.120
<v Speaker 1>with them actually.

00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:22.280
<v Speaker 1>And so at that point in time, they

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.435
<v Speaker 1>just came from the cloud. There was an

00:08:24.435 --> 00:08:27.395
<v Speaker 1>online version of Versus Code many years ago.

00:08:27.395 --> 00:08:29.075
<v Speaker 1>They moved it to the desktop,

00:08:29.395 --> 00:08:30.675
<v Speaker 1>built Versus Code,

00:08:30.915 --> 00:08:32.995
<v Speaker 1>and at at that point and they said,

00:08:32.995 --> 00:08:34.755
<v Speaker 1>no. We are not interested in changing the

00:08:34.755 --> 00:08:35.635
<v Speaker 1>architecture.

00:08:36.035 --> 00:08:38.850
<v Speaker 1>We wanna focus on desktop entirely. So what

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:40.130
<v Speaker 1>we did is we

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:43.330
<v Speaker 1>saw that there are cool components like the

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.570
<v Speaker 1>Monaco editor and they, you know, develop the

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.490
<v Speaker 1>language of protocols. So we took

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:51.170
<v Speaker 1>those ingredients and created, an online ID called

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:51.650
<v Speaker 1>Feya.

00:08:51.995 --> 00:08:54.074
<v Speaker 1>We moved that to the Eclipse Foundation because

00:08:54.074 --> 00:08:55.834
<v Speaker 1>that's really not the point. We wanna make

00:08:55.834 --> 00:08:57.755
<v Speaker 1>and get this good part is to build

00:08:57.755 --> 00:08:59.195
<v Speaker 1>yet another IDE.

00:08:59.274 --> 00:09:01.675
<v Speaker 1>We wanted to source this dev environment stuff

00:09:01.675 --> 00:09:03.915
<v Speaker 1>and give developers the IDE they love.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.080
<v Speaker 1>But fast forward two years,

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.560
<v Speaker 1>Microsoft has changed its, you know, architectural decisions.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.880
<v Speaker 1>So they made Versus changed the architecture in

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.520
<v Speaker 1>Versus Code so that it runs now nicely

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.760
<v Speaker 1>in browsers as well. And, you know, probably

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.065
<v Speaker 1>have heard of GitHub code spaces.

00:09:21.225 --> 00:09:22.665
<v Speaker 1>And so they did that in the open

00:09:22.665 --> 00:09:26.425
<v Speaker 1>source version. So since last week, you can

00:09:26.425 --> 00:09:26.825
<v Speaker 1>choose

00:09:27.785 --> 00:09:30.185
<v Speaker 1>and get part whether you wanna use Thea

00:09:30.185 --> 00:09:32.345
<v Speaker 1>or Versus Code as a browser front end.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:35.329
<v Speaker 1>In both IDEs, you can install any Versus

00:09:35.329 --> 00:09:36.209
<v Speaker 1>Code extension.

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:38.610
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Nice. To

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.649
<v Speaker 2>dwell on the point that really the IDE

00:09:41.649 --> 00:09:44.050
<v Speaker 2>that you're using is is something that you

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.610
<v Speaker 2>can choose and not something that we prescribe,

00:09:47.725 --> 00:09:50.045
<v Speaker 2>There is a feature that's currently in private

00:09:50.045 --> 00:09:51.645
<v Speaker 2>beta even where it can bring your own

00:09:51.645 --> 00:09:54.285
<v Speaker 2>IDE as as a docker image, and that

00:09:54.285 --> 00:09:56.765
<v Speaker 2>could be anything, you know, Jupyter Labs, Jupyter

00:09:56.765 --> 00:09:57.485
<v Speaker 2>Notebook.

00:09:58.445 --> 00:09:59.965
<v Speaker 2>If you sign client, it could be just

00:09:59.965 --> 00:10:02.205
<v Speaker 2>a terminal with Emacs behind the scenes.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.760
<v Speaker 2>So, really, the the point is we want

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.000
<v Speaker 2>to automate the the dev environment as a

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.080
<v Speaker 2>whole, and the IDE is one part of

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.080
<v Speaker 2>it. And we want to be orthogonal to

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.120
<v Speaker 2>the IDEs

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.560
<v Speaker 2>that you might want to use.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.400
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:17.200
<v Speaker 0>So

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.720
<v Speaker 0>yeah. That's

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:21.035
<v Speaker 0>that's really important. I don't think I fully

00:10:21.035 --> 00:10:23.355
<v Speaker 0>understand that. I understood that as we were

00:10:23.355 --> 00:10:24.875
<v Speaker 0>coming into this. You know, I was thinking,

00:10:24.875 --> 00:10:26.315
<v Speaker 0>it's an ID that runs in the cloud

00:10:26.315 --> 00:10:28.635
<v Speaker 0>and provides us other stuff. But really, there's

00:10:28.635 --> 00:10:29.995
<v Speaker 0>just so much more to it than that.

00:10:29.995 --> 00:10:30.475
<v Speaker 0>So

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.260
<v Speaker 0>alright. So from this homepage, I can see

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.900
<v Speaker 0>a try now button just sitting there attempting

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.140
<v Speaker 0>me to click it. So I'm just gonna

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.820
<v Speaker 0>go ahead and do that. Let's see.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:41.260
<v Speaker 0>So

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.940
<v Speaker 0>so I can just take any repository

00:10:45.405 --> 00:10:47.085
<v Speaker 0>and add it to the end of that

00:10:47.085 --> 00:10:48.925
<v Speaker 0>URL and it's gonna open it up for

00:10:48.925 --> 00:10:49.405
<v Speaker 0>me?

00:10:50.045 --> 00:10:51.085
<v Speaker 2>That's correct. So

00:10:52.205 --> 00:10:54.845
<v Speaker 0>I already opened a few in advance. For

00:10:55.725 --> 00:10:58.285
<v Speaker 0>the audience, what I have here is a

00:10:58.285 --> 00:10:59.405
<v Speaker 0>project called Git series.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.440
<v Speaker 0>So good. I wrote it twice. Once in

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.600
<v Speaker 0>Rust, once in Go. I'll get answer that

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.280
<v Speaker 0>another day of why I did that. But

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.040
<v Speaker 0>it is a project that can scan, get

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.200
<v Speaker 0>repositories, export metrics from it a time series

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:11.600
<v Speaker 0>format.

00:11:12.575 --> 00:11:14.655
<v Speaker 0>I also have another project. I seem to

00:11:14.655 --> 00:11:15.775
<v Speaker 0>do a lot with Git now. Don't realize

00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:17.215
<v Speaker 0>this. But this one's called Git sync. It's

00:11:17.215 --> 00:11:19.135
<v Speaker 0>a GitOps operator written in Rust.

00:11:19.535 --> 00:11:22.895
<v Speaker 0>And I have an Equinix metal terraform provider

00:11:23.215 --> 00:11:25.375
<v Speaker 0>due to be renamed any day now. Currently,

00:11:25.375 --> 00:11:26.255
<v Speaker 0>it still says packet.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.020
<v Speaker 0>And I'm just gonna

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.340
<v Speaker 0>add this to the start.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.220
<v Speaker 0>Does it a protocol matter? Should I remove

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:34.700
<v Speaker 0>that?

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.380
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.660
<v Speaker 1>But for Gitpod, actually, I'm not sure if

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.535
<v Speaker 1>it's back. No. Let's let's continue. I will

00:11:41.535 --> 00:11:42.975
<v Speaker 1>show you with the other repo.

00:11:44.095 --> 00:11:46.655
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So now it's just saying log in

00:11:46.655 --> 00:11:48.015
<v Speaker 0>and launch workspace.

00:11:48.255 --> 00:11:50.095
<v Speaker 0>So I'll authorize this.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.260
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So do you wanna give me a

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:57.140
<v Speaker 0>little bit of

00:11:57.459 --> 00:11:59.779
<v Speaker 0>insight into what's actually happening here?

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. So what's happening in the background

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.580
<v Speaker 2>or what just happened

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.020
<v Speaker 2>was that

00:12:07.225 --> 00:12:08.585
<v Speaker 2>Gitpod understood

00:12:08.585 --> 00:12:11.225
<v Speaker 2>from the URL that you provided or that

00:12:11.225 --> 00:12:12.825
<v Speaker 2>you that was the suffix, basically.

00:12:13.385 --> 00:12:15.785
<v Speaker 2>It understood which repository you wanted to open,

00:12:15.785 --> 00:12:16.345
<v Speaker 2>which

00:12:16.665 --> 00:12:18.665
<v Speaker 2>Git hosting provider you wanted it to open

00:12:18.665 --> 00:12:18.905
<v Speaker 2>from.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:20.820
<v Speaker 2>And

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.380
<v Speaker 2>it, as you then saw, talked to to

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.380
<v Speaker 2>GitLab, signed you in so that you got

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.780
<v Speaker 2>access to to that repository.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.260
<v Speaker 2>And then behind the scenes, it started a

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.540
<v Speaker 2>a Kubernetes pod

00:12:32.605 --> 00:12:36.045
<v Speaker 2>with the IDE in with user land and

00:12:36.045 --> 00:12:38.524
<v Speaker 2>with a default sort of image

00:12:39.005 --> 00:12:40.845
<v Speaker 2>that we call workspace full that has a

00:12:40.845 --> 00:12:41.885
<v Speaker 2>lot of tools

00:12:43.084 --> 00:12:44.204
<v Speaker 2>installed already

00:12:44.524 --> 00:12:46.444
<v Speaker 2>and started the IDE for you.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.840
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.400
<v Speaker 0>I can see that it's downloaded all the

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.440
<v Speaker 0>Go modules.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.960
<v Speaker 0>It's asking me if I wanna set up

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.640
<v Speaker 0>the project or just never.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.520
<v Speaker 0>What do you think would be a good

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.280
<v Speaker 0>first step here? Will we click never or

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.520
<v Speaker 0>will we click setup? Should I just start

00:13:03.215 --> 00:13:05.455
<v Speaker 0>breaking We can set it up. Yeah. We

00:13:05.455 --> 00:13:06.975
<v Speaker 1>can set up your project.

00:13:07.455 --> 00:13:09.615
<v Speaker 1>It's it should be relatively

00:13:10.095 --> 00:13:10.975
<v Speaker 1>easy.

00:13:11.055 --> 00:13:12.575
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So the first thing you need to

00:13:12.575 --> 00:13:13.375
<v Speaker 1>do is,

00:13:14.495 --> 00:13:16.460
<v Speaker 1>like, you know, you you could use and

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.860
<v Speaker 1>just code along here in in this IDE

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:21.580
<v Speaker 1>now, but it's it's not

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.860
<v Speaker 1>you know, it's there's no real kind of

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:25.660
<v Speaker 1>automation

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.580
<v Speaker 1>in there. So it's just, you know, it's

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.335
<v Speaker 1>a checkout of of the context you've you've

00:13:30.335 --> 00:13:32.495
<v Speaker 1>started with, which is the default branch here.

00:13:33.295 --> 00:13:35.135
<v Speaker 1>With the Gitpod YAML, what you can do

00:13:35.135 --> 00:13:36.975
<v Speaker 1>is you can tell Gitpod

00:13:37.215 --> 00:13:39.055
<v Speaker 1>what kind of, for instance,

00:13:39.535 --> 00:13:41.295
<v Speaker 1>base docker image you wanna have

00:13:41.695 --> 00:13:43.535
<v Speaker 1>in your like, when you, you know, when

00:13:43.535 --> 00:13:45.055
<v Speaker 1>you in in your tools, you wanna maybe

00:13:45.055 --> 00:13:46.410
<v Speaker 1>install additional

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:48.410
<v Speaker 1>tools like a database or stuff like that.

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:51.370
<v Speaker 1>And also what kind of tasks should be

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:54.490
<v Speaker 1>executed. So if you click create Gitpod YAML,

00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:01.045
<v Speaker 1>it analyzes your project a bit. And and

00:14:01.045 --> 00:14:04.085
<v Speaker 1>if you double click the Gitpod YAML tab

00:14:04.085 --> 00:14:04.965
<v Speaker 1>in the middle,

00:14:05.445 --> 00:14:07.205
<v Speaker 1>you can make it full screen. And you

00:14:07.205 --> 00:14:10.085
<v Speaker 1>see what it analyze. It's pretty simple. It

00:14:10.085 --> 00:14:12.485
<v Speaker 1>says, like, okay. When you ever someone starts

00:14:12.485 --> 00:14:13.525
<v Speaker 1>this project,

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.630
<v Speaker 1>we have two things we wanna execute one

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:19.670
<v Speaker 1>after the other. First, we wanna run GoGecko

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:21.350
<v Speaker 1>build and go test.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.710
<v Speaker 1>And then afterwards, we wanna run,

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:29.270
<v Speaker 1>actually, the one. So that's just the super

00:14:27.765 --> 00:14:30.245
<v Speaker 1>simple gold standard thing.

00:14:32.725 --> 00:14:35.125
<v Speaker 1>What is important here is there is this

00:14:35.125 --> 00:14:38.005
<v Speaker 1>two different life cycles. It's you know, there's

00:14:38.005 --> 00:14:41.285
<v Speaker 1>init and there's command. The point is that

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:44.130
<v Speaker 1>init can be executed asynchronously.

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:46.290
<v Speaker 1>So when you check-in this,

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:48.930
<v Speaker 1>you can install a webhook on your GitLab

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:49.730
<v Speaker 1>repository,

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.690
<v Speaker 1>and then we'll Gitpod will run through this

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:53.650
<v Speaker 1>interface

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:56.290
<v Speaker 1>whenever someone pushes

00:14:55.935 --> 00:14:57.375
<v Speaker 1>a new branch and you commit to any

00:14:57.375 --> 00:14:58.175
<v Speaker 1>branches.

00:14:58.975 --> 00:15:00.415
<v Speaker 1>And it runs through that, and then it

00:15:00.415 --> 00:15:01.455
<v Speaker 1>takes a snapshot.

00:15:02.015 --> 00:15:04.575
<v Speaker 1>And then when a a real human being

00:15:04.575 --> 00:15:06.815
<v Speaker 1>comes along, wants to start coding, you don't

00:15:06.815 --> 00:15:07.775
<v Speaker 1>have to wait for this.

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:10.830
<v Speaker 1>So this is, you very significant for a

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:12.350
<v Speaker 1>long running build. Like, if you need to

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.830
<v Speaker 1>download the the Internet because you have so

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:17.070
<v Speaker 1>many dependencies or, you know, do stuff like

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:18.750
<v Speaker 1>that, then you don't have to wait for

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:21.070
<v Speaker 1>that. You get a fully kind of initialized

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:21.950
<v Speaker 1>compiled

00:15:22.464 --> 00:15:23.825
<v Speaker 1>code generated

00:15:23.904 --> 00:15:25.025
<v Speaker 1>source code

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:27.025
<v Speaker 1>within a couple of seconds.

00:15:27.904 --> 00:15:30.065
<v Speaker 0>Very cool. To to bring the point home

00:15:30.065 --> 00:15:32.065
<v Speaker 2>how much time that saves, if you do

00:15:32.065 --> 00:15:33.904
<v Speaker 2>that on on Gitpod IO or the Gitpod

00:15:33.904 --> 00:15:35.185
<v Speaker 2>IO repository itself,

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:40.540
<v Speaker 2>you'll save about twelve minutes by not having

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.020
<v Speaker 2>to sit there and watch PaintDry code download

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:44.140
<v Speaker 2>and compile. Right?

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:48.460
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I could see

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.380
<v Speaker 0>I could see a lot of benefits to

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:51.340
<v Speaker 0>the push definitely.

00:15:52.265 --> 00:15:54.025
<v Speaker 0>And I guess in a really weird way,

00:15:54.025 --> 00:15:55.065
<v Speaker 0>if I were,

00:15:55.625 --> 00:15:56.025
<v Speaker 0>you know

00:15:56.905 --> 00:15:59.145
<v Speaker 0>assuming it wasn't 2020 and I'm out on

00:15:59.145 --> 00:16:01.705
<v Speaker 0>a, you know, holiday period, Christmas night out

00:16:01.705 --> 00:16:03.465
<v Speaker 0>with my workmates and I need to fix

00:16:03.465 --> 00:16:05.385
<v Speaker 0>something on my phone, I could I'm assuming

00:16:05.385 --> 00:16:07.145
<v Speaker 0>I could just pop that open and never

00:16:07.145 --> 00:16:08.880
<v Speaker 0>have to leave restaurant. So I like that

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:09.520
<v Speaker 0>idea.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.360
<v Speaker 0>And not that I've ever had to fix

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.680
<v Speaker 0>any production outage from a restaurant before. That

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.600
<v Speaker 0>wasn't definitely wasn't painful.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:16.800
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.960
<v Speaker 0>We actually had a a question just as

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.640
<v Speaker 0>we were chatting there. So let's pop that

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.360
<v Speaker 0>up. So

00:16:22.065 --> 00:16:24.625
<v Speaker 0>Ofer is asking, will we show how to

00:16:24.625 --> 00:16:27.585
<v Speaker 0>use or utilize Docker compose and have that

00:16:27.585 --> 00:16:29.745
<v Speaker 0>run containers when we start the workspace?

00:16:30.545 --> 00:16:32.625
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. We'll definitely try and get around to

00:16:32.625 --> 00:16:33.185
<v Speaker 0>that.

00:16:34.145 --> 00:16:35.665
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Now

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:39.570
<v Speaker 0>should I update this docker configuration?

00:16:41.089 --> 00:16:42.690
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming that it's just a docker file

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:45.330
<v Speaker 0>that is used to provide the tooling environment

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:46.530
<v Speaker 0>for this workspace.

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:49.250
<v Speaker 0>Okay. That that's correct. So there there are

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:51.410
<v Speaker 2>two ways you can provide the user land

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:52.130
<v Speaker 2>for your workspace.

00:16:52.675 --> 00:16:54.115
<v Speaker 2>One is you can

00:16:54.915 --> 00:16:57.155
<v Speaker 2>list in an already built image, and we're

00:16:57.155 --> 00:16:58.675
<v Speaker 2>gonna pull that and use that.

00:16:59.075 --> 00:17:01.555
<v Speaker 2>Or you can provide your own Dockerfile,

00:17:01.555 --> 00:17:04.515
<v Speaker 2>check that in in your repository, and then

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.369
<v Speaker 2>whenever you make a change to that and

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:08.849
<v Speaker 2>open a new workspace on it, Gitpod will

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:09.809
<v Speaker 2>build that for you.

00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:13.010
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I'm gonna click it.

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:15.809
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So you provide some

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:17.970
<v Speaker 0>defaults,

00:17:19.915 --> 00:17:20.954
<v Speaker 2>VNC.

00:17:21.755 --> 00:17:24.635
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. It you know, some not everything runs

00:17:24.635 --> 00:17:25.915
<v Speaker 2>in the browser yet.

00:17:26.075 --> 00:17:26.714
<v Speaker 2>So

00:17:27.195 --> 00:17:28.715
<v Speaker 2>if you need to do something that doesn't

00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:30.555
<v Speaker 2>run-in the browser, you need, I know, need

00:17:30.555 --> 00:17:32.155
<v Speaker 2>to run UI tests, for example,

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.730
<v Speaker 2>then this image comes in handy. And it

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:38.530
<v Speaker 2>starts a VNC server on a frame buffer

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:40.529
<v Speaker 2>and then gives you web VNC view

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:41.330
<v Speaker 2>to it.

00:17:42.049 --> 00:17:42.850
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Cool.

00:17:44.815 --> 00:17:46.414
<v Speaker 0>I'll just click custom.

00:17:47.135 --> 00:17:48.174
<v Speaker 0>And

00:17:48.255 --> 00:17:50.335
<v Speaker 0>I just it wants me to provide

00:17:51.615 --> 00:17:53.935
<v Speaker 0>an image with a name. So what is

00:17:53.935 --> 00:17:56.895
<v Speaker 0>the Gitpod workspace fill that it's suggesting here?

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.159
<v Speaker 1>That's the default one. We have a like,

00:18:01.159 --> 00:18:02.679
<v Speaker 1>you know, that's the one we are running

00:18:02.679 --> 00:18:05.479
<v Speaker 1>currently on. Like, if you don't provide anything,

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.679
<v Speaker 1>then we use the workspace full and it

00:18:08.679 --> 00:18:10.519
<v Speaker 1>it you know, the name is

00:18:11.285 --> 00:18:14.565
<v Speaker 1>accurate. It it has everything you probably might

00:18:14.565 --> 00:18:15.605
<v Speaker 1>wanna have.

00:18:16.165 --> 00:18:17.524
<v Speaker 1>So it's it's,

00:18:17.924 --> 00:18:19.044
<v Speaker 1>you know, it's

00:18:19.605 --> 00:18:21.205
<v Speaker 1>yeah. Batteries included

00:18:21.605 --> 00:18:22.565
<v Speaker 1>very big

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.880
<v Speaker 1>image that is,

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.080
<v Speaker 1>fast to pull because it's it sits on

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.840
<v Speaker 1>every note already, pre pull.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.720
<v Speaker 1>But it's probably not what you really, you

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.200
<v Speaker 1>know, in a professional context, you wanna, you

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.840
<v Speaker 1>know, maybe say, okay. I really need this

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:38.240
<v Speaker 1>version

00:18:39.065 --> 00:18:41.625
<v Speaker 1>of Go or I need that. No. And

00:18:41.625 --> 00:18:43.385
<v Speaker 1>then then you wanna be very specific, so

00:18:43.385 --> 00:18:45.544
<v Speaker 1>you would start with a hand rolled

00:18:45.785 --> 00:18:46.904
<v Speaker 1>docker image.

00:18:48.505 --> 00:18:49.144
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:18:49.545 --> 00:18:51.865
<v Speaker 0>I'll just skip this for now then. Okay.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You can yeah.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.720
<v Speaker 1>You can now you could generate a Gitpod

00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.600
<v Speaker 1>Dockerfile,

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.920
<v Speaker 1>but please just don't don't do that because

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.760
<v Speaker 1>we don't need that for the simple project.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.280
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's kinda what I

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:05.760
<v Speaker 0>was

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.545
<v Speaker 0>getting there. So okay. So we can let

00:19:08.545 --> 00:19:10.225
<v Speaker 0>others know that this project, I'm gonna click

00:19:10.225 --> 00:19:11.585
<v Speaker 0>update with me because I just, click in

00:19:11.585 --> 00:19:12.465
<v Speaker 0>the blue button.

00:19:12.705 --> 00:19:14.785
<v Speaker 1>Alright. You can just close the tab on

00:19:14.785 --> 00:19:16.145
<v Speaker 1>the right. There's this icon.

00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:19.345
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Click on the text. Alright. Let's pop

00:19:19.345 --> 00:19:20.305
<v Speaker 0>this channel down.

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:22.870
<v Speaker 0>Let's see what that's done to my read

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:23.669
<v Speaker 0>me then.

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:26.710
<v Speaker 0>Alright. It wants me to update something and

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:28.710
<v Speaker 0>just say, hey. This is It yeah. It

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:31.510
<v Speaker 1>added this button, this batch to the top.

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:33.910
<v Speaker 1>If you click the preview icon on the

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:34.470
<v Speaker 1>top right,

00:19:34.985 --> 00:19:36.265
<v Speaker 1>yeah, that one

00:19:36.745 --> 00:19:39.465
<v Speaker 1>that one, you see what it did.

00:19:39.785 --> 00:19:41.705
<v Speaker 0>Oh, got it. Okay. So you've added a

00:19:41.705 --> 00:19:43.465
<v Speaker 0>badge then allows other people to pop us

00:19:43.465 --> 00:19:44.825
<v Speaker 0>open instead of Gitpod.

00:19:44.985 --> 00:19:45.785
<v Speaker 0>Right.

00:19:46.105 --> 00:19:46.585
<v Speaker 0>Excellent.

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:50.230
<v Speaker 0>That was all

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:51.190
<v Speaker 0>pretty painless.

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:54.550
<v Speaker 0>So I guess and now I can start

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:57.110
<v Speaker 0>making changes to this application and just develop

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:58.870
<v Speaker 0>it as I normally would. Like, not really

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:01.750
<v Speaker 0>much should change with my normal developer workflow.

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:02.230
<v Speaker 0>Is that right?

00:20:03.275 --> 00:20:05.595
<v Speaker 2>Correct. Yeah. So if you open a

00:20:06.395 --> 00:20:08.554
<v Speaker 2>a Go file, for example, I saw earlier

00:20:08.554 --> 00:20:09.195
<v Speaker 2>the Go get

00:20:09.835 --> 00:20:12.315
<v Speaker 2>looks like it didn't go through because of

00:20:12.315 --> 00:20:13.595
<v Speaker 2>some native dependency.

00:20:13.995 --> 00:20:15.515
<v Speaker 2>But by and large, you know, it it

00:20:15.515 --> 00:20:17.355
<v Speaker 2>will run Go, please, behind the scenes.

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:21.330
<v Speaker 2>It's the Versus Code Go extension

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:23.009
<v Speaker 2>that we all know.

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:24.929
<v Speaker 2>So it should we should feel right at

00:20:24.929 --> 00:20:25.409
<v Speaker 2>home.

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:29.570
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. It seems to have failed here

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:31.330
<v Speaker 0>because lib get was

00:20:32.049 --> 00:20:32.690
<v Speaker 0>not available.

00:20:33.545 --> 00:20:34.184
<v Speaker 0>So

00:20:35.304 --> 00:20:37.465
<v Speaker 0>this is just a debian box. So in

00:20:37.465 --> 00:20:39.304
<v Speaker 0>theory, I should just be able to

00:20:39.545 --> 00:20:40.825
<v Speaker 0>install that. Right?

00:20:42.105 --> 00:20:43.304
<v Speaker 0>Let's see if I got sudo.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.799
<v Speaker 2>So this brings us to a

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:49.639
<v Speaker 2>good point that is

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:52.440
<v Speaker 2>currently in in feature preview. So we have

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.080
<v Speaker 2>sort of this you could consider the better

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.679
<v Speaker 2>feature channel

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.440
<v Speaker 2>like you have with many other projects

00:20:59.105 --> 00:21:00.705
<v Speaker 2>that you can enable in the settings, and

00:21:00.705 --> 00:21:02.145
<v Speaker 2>this would give you sudo.

00:21:02.225 --> 00:21:03.985
<v Speaker 2>And then you could just do exactly what

00:21:03.985 --> 00:21:05.025
<v Speaker 2>you were trying to do.

00:21:05.985 --> 00:21:07.425
<v Speaker 2>If you want, we can go ahead and

00:21:07.425 --> 00:21:08.705
<v Speaker 2>and just enable that.

00:21:09.585 --> 00:21:11.265
<v Speaker 2>This would also, though, be a good use

00:21:11.265 --> 00:21:13.265
<v Speaker 2>case for the stocker file that we were

00:21:13.265 --> 00:21:15.610
<v Speaker 2>just about to create because this is something

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:17.450
<v Speaker 2>that everyone in your team will need. Everyone

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:19.850
<v Speaker 2>who opens this project will need that library.

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:22.650
<v Speaker 2>So there's a good chance you'll want that

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:24.650
<v Speaker 2>installed in the user land for everyone. Right?

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.250
<v Speaker 2>You don't want everyone after they open the

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:27.770
<v Speaker 2>workspace to have to go and do app

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:28.649
<v Speaker 2>get install

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:29.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Lib get.

00:21:32.304 --> 00:21:33.825
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So what do you want me to

00:21:33.825 --> 00:21:34.624
<v Speaker 0>do first?

00:21:36.625 --> 00:21:38.544
<v Speaker 2>I think it it'd be best now probably

00:21:38.544 --> 00:21:39.985
<v Speaker 2>if we enable

00:21:39.985 --> 00:21:42.065
<v Speaker 2>the the feature preview just to show that

00:21:42.065 --> 00:21:44.465
<v Speaker 2>off, and it really helps sort of getting

00:21:44.465 --> 00:21:45.505
<v Speaker 2>that Docker file

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:46.950
<v Speaker 2>ready.

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:49.510
<v Speaker 2>To do that, if you on the upper

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:52.070
<v Speaker 2>right corner on your avatar,

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:55.429
<v Speaker 2>and then click on open workspaces.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:59.190
<v Speaker 2>And then again in the upper right corner

00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.910
<v Speaker 2>in the avatar,

00:22:01.145 --> 00:22:02.264
<v Speaker 2>hit settings.

00:22:04.424 --> 00:22:06.025
<v Speaker 2>And then there you see the feature preview

00:22:06.025 --> 00:22:06.904
<v Speaker 2>at the bottom.

00:22:07.465 --> 00:22:08.825
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yep. There we go. If you tick

00:22:08.825 --> 00:22:11.705
<v Speaker 2>that, that's it. And so the next workspace

00:22:11.945 --> 00:22:14.424
<v Speaker 2>any next workspace that you'll start will have

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.639
<v Speaker 2>support for sudo, apt get, etcetera.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.639
<v Speaker 2>The the code that you just ticked is

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:23.759
<v Speaker 2>exactly what

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.279
<v Speaker 2>Sven alluded to earlier where we're really not

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.280
<v Speaker 2>opinionated about the IDE that you want to

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:29.440
<v Speaker 2>use.

00:22:30.415 --> 00:22:33.054
<v Speaker 2>And there is some some

00:22:33.135 --> 00:22:35.455
<v Speaker 2>code support in there. It's still a bit

00:22:35.455 --> 00:22:37.455
<v Speaker 2>rough around the edges, I would say. So

00:22:37.455 --> 00:22:39.295
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't recommend that that we take it

00:22:39.295 --> 00:22:41.935
<v Speaker 2>on now. Okay. Just, you know, some things

00:22:41.935 --> 00:22:42.735
<v Speaker 2>like

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.240
<v Speaker 2>extensions being preinstalled are are still in the

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.159
<v Speaker 2>works. About to land the PR is actually

00:22:48.159 --> 00:22:49.279
<v Speaker 2>on the repository.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.879
<v Speaker 2>So let let's continue with that. Okay.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.360
<v Speaker 0>And so that just saves automatically. Right? There's

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.799
<v Speaker 0>not anything I have to do here. Okay.

00:22:56.799 --> 00:22:58.559
<v Speaker 0>So I can just close this. Mhmm.

00:22:59.215 --> 00:23:00.575
<v Speaker 0>And then we come back to here. Do

00:23:00.575 --> 00:23:02.174
<v Speaker 0>I need to reload this workspace?

00:23:02.254 --> 00:23:04.014
<v Speaker 2>You would have to stop and start it

00:23:04.014 --> 00:23:04.574
<v Speaker 2>again.

00:23:05.294 --> 00:23:06.734
<v Speaker 2>And to do that,

00:23:07.054 --> 00:23:08.894
<v Speaker 2>again, the upper right corner or the command

00:23:08.894 --> 00:23:11.294
<v Speaker 2>palette in in Versus Code. So command shift

00:23:11.294 --> 00:23:11.934
<v Speaker 2>p

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.320
<v Speaker 2>and then stop workspace,

00:23:15.799 --> 00:23:16.519
<v Speaker 2>and that will

00:23:20.039 --> 00:23:21.559
<v Speaker 2>it's important to note that this is only

00:23:21.559 --> 00:23:23.000
<v Speaker 2>something you have to do, you know, by

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.759
<v Speaker 2>now because we're changing these settings.

00:23:25.559 --> 00:23:27.399
<v Speaker 2>Once these settings are enabled, this is not

00:23:27.399 --> 00:23:28.760
<v Speaker 2>something that

00:23:29.375 --> 00:23:31.695
<v Speaker 2>that you'll have to do again. Okay.

00:23:32.175 --> 00:23:33.695
<v Speaker 0>So we're just waiting for this to stop.

00:23:33.695 --> 00:23:35.535
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming my start button's gonna come back,

00:23:35.535 --> 00:23:37.855
<v Speaker 0>and we just go straight back in. Correct.

00:23:38.095 --> 00:23:38.495
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.880
<v Speaker 1>And it's backing up now, like, the file

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.400
<v Speaker 1>system of your workspace,

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.720
<v Speaker 1>you, you know, get that state back again.

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.559
<v Speaker 1>But when I've earlier

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.000
<v Speaker 1>explained that we have this prebuilt feature and

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
<v Speaker 1>and, you know, it it allows you to

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:55.800
<v Speaker 1>skip the waiting,

00:23:56.355 --> 00:23:58.275
<v Speaker 1>The real reason behind that, you can start

00:23:58.275 --> 00:23:59.554
<v Speaker 1>the workspace now.

00:24:00.515 --> 00:24:02.595
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I just thought this was quite interesting

00:24:02.595 --> 00:24:04.434
<v Speaker 0>here. Uh-huh. It's kind of

00:24:05.075 --> 00:24:06.835
<v Speaker 0>all those changes that I started to make

00:24:06.835 --> 00:24:08.434
<v Speaker 0>are still gonna be available when I come

00:24:08.434 --> 00:24:09.395
<v Speaker 0>back, which is really cool.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:11.080
<v Speaker 2>Yes. It

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.120
<v Speaker 2>also tells you what what did change, and

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.400
<v Speaker 2>you see that here in the tab. So

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.919
<v Speaker 2>if you have a bunch of Gitpod tabs

00:24:16.919 --> 00:24:18.840
<v Speaker 2>closed, you can see what state they were

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.919
<v Speaker 2>in, and it will also show that in

00:24:20.919 --> 00:24:21.640
<v Speaker 2>in the dashboard.

00:24:22.665 --> 00:24:23.865
<v Speaker 2>So, you know, if you have a list

00:24:23.865 --> 00:24:25.225
<v Speaker 2>of in the workspace list so if you

00:24:25.225 --> 00:24:26.745
<v Speaker 2>have a list of workspaces,

00:24:26.905 --> 00:24:28.745
<v Speaker 2>you can then still see what was in

00:24:28.745 --> 00:24:31.225
<v Speaker 2>in case you left something accidentally, for example.

00:24:31.945 --> 00:24:32.585
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:24:32.905 --> 00:24:33.705
<v Speaker 1>What's

00:24:33.785 --> 00:24:36.425
<v Speaker 1>explicit we are so explicit about these changes

00:24:36.425 --> 00:24:38.650
<v Speaker 1>thing and so on because we know we

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:39.210
<v Speaker 1>wanna

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:40.570
<v Speaker 1>emphasize

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:43.290
<v Speaker 1>or allow people to treat dev environments as

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:45.850
<v Speaker 1>ephemeral or disposable. So we would always, you

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:46.970
<v Speaker 1>know, start fresh.

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:49.530
<v Speaker 1>You usually don't do that, like, stopping and

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:52.090
<v Speaker 1>starting workspaces again unless you are working on

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:53.855
<v Speaker 1>the long running feature branch. So

00:24:54.415 --> 00:24:56.575
<v Speaker 1>and so when you go to your workspaces

00:24:56.575 --> 00:24:59.215
<v Speaker 1>list, this is just reading your history. Like

00:24:59.455 --> 00:25:01.855
<v Speaker 1>and there should be little reason to restart

00:25:01.855 --> 00:25:03.775
<v Speaker 1>these workspaces because

00:25:04.175 --> 00:25:06.415
<v Speaker 1>you can always rely on the automation and

00:25:06.415 --> 00:25:09.090
<v Speaker 1>get the freshly prepared ones on the latest,

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:10.929
<v Speaker 1>you know, state of your branches when you

00:25:10.929 --> 00:25:13.250
<v Speaker 1>go to GitLab and start from there. So

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:15.729
<v Speaker 1>that's that's the workflow. You always start fresh

00:25:15.809 --> 00:25:17.970
<v Speaker 1>and even in parallel, and then you just

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:20.745
<v Speaker 1>close your tab, and Gitpod will take care

00:25:20.745 --> 00:25:21.304
<v Speaker 1>of,

00:25:21.705 --> 00:25:23.384
<v Speaker 1>you know or even garbage collect. Like, we

00:25:23.384 --> 00:25:24.904
<v Speaker 1>are stopping the workspace.

00:25:26.264 --> 00:25:27.864
<v Speaker 1>And then eventually,

00:25:27.865 --> 00:25:30.024
<v Speaker 1>after fourteen days of inactivity, it will be

00:25:30.024 --> 00:25:31.144
<v Speaker 1>garbage collected

00:25:31.304 --> 00:25:32.904
<v Speaker 1>so you don't have to clean up after

00:25:32.904 --> 00:25:36.040
<v Speaker 1>you. Yeah. Cool. To to illustrate that point

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.520
<v Speaker 2>further on a good day, I'll have anywhere

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.759
<v Speaker 2>between 20 to 25 workspaces.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.559
<v Speaker 2>Right? I'll have I'll have two to three

00:25:43.559 --> 00:25:45.875
<v Speaker 2>running in parallel like this and that PR

00:25:45.875 --> 00:25:47.715
<v Speaker 2>that I'm trying to review, this feature that

00:25:47.715 --> 00:25:49.315
<v Speaker 2>I'm working on while I'm waiting for build

00:25:49.315 --> 00:25:50.114
<v Speaker 2>somewhere else.

00:25:50.914 --> 00:25:51.554
<v Speaker 2>And

00:25:51.794 --> 00:25:53.875
<v Speaker 2>the only time I really ever restart one

00:25:53.875 --> 00:25:55.315
<v Speaker 2>is when I come back from lunch, and

00:25:55.315 --> 00:25:56.274
<v Speaker 2>that's about it.

00:25:57.075 --> 00:25:58.754
<v Speaker 0>I think the

00:25:59.549 --> 00:26:01.389
<v Speaker 0>okay. So I've got two questions.

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:03.390
<v Speaker 0>First one, ask me if I want to

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:05.870
<v Speaker 0>install a Chrome extension. I am curious what

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:08.109
<v Speaker 0>what does that bring to the environment?

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:12.509
<v Speaker 1>It adds a button

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:14.669
<v Speaker 1>like that says Gitpod

00:26:14.805 --> 00:26:15.845
<v Speaker 1>to all your

00:26:16.405 --> 00:26:17.765
<v Speaker 1>to every GitHub

00:26:18.325 --> 00:26:21.045
<v Speaker 1>and Bitbucket org and GitLab repository,

00:26:21.045 --> 00:26:23.285
<v Speaker 1>even pull request, merge request issues. So you

00:26:23.285 --> 00:26:24.965
<v Speaker 1>can start from any you know, you see

00:26:24.965 --> 00:26:26.645
<v Speaker 1>on the Internet, you see code. There is

00:26:26.645 --> 00:26:28.165
<v Speaker 1>a Gitpod button next to it. You click

00:26:28.165 --> 00:26:29.525
<v Speaker 1>it, and then you you can code on

00:26:29.525 --> 00:26:32.310
<v Speaker 1>that. Awesome. Good. That light led me onto

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:34.230
<v Speaker 0>my what my next question was gonna be

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:36.150
<v Speaker 0>there because because you just said, you know,

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:37.990
<v Speaker 0>about pull requests. I mean, if I have

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:39.910
<v Speaker 0>a pull request for the repository and, you

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:41.590
<v Speaker 0>know, it's not always great to look at

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:43.110
<v Speaker 0>it and that they get help views, and

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:44.550
<v Speaker 0>I can open that specific

00:26:45.325 --> 00:26:47.965
<v Speaker 0>bar, that branch, that revision, and say that

00:26:47.965 --> 00:26:49.965
<v Speaker 0>we Gitpod and actually walk through the changes

00:26:49.965 --> 00:26:52.765
<v Speaker 0>in a more familiar environment. Right? K.

00:26:53.485 --> 00:26:55.885
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It even noticed that you are starting

00:26:55.885 --> 00:26:57.485
<v Speaker 1>on a if you start from a full

00:26:57.485 --> 00:26:57.965
<v Speaker 1>request,

00:26:58.519 --> 00:27:01.559
<v Speaker 1>the IDE doesn't open like this. It opens

00:27:01.639 --> 00:27:03.799
<v Speaker 1>with the changes on the left, and then

00:27:03.799 --> 00:27:06.120
<v Speaker 1>you can skip both through that, and you

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.799
<v Speaker 1>see, you know, these editors.

00:27:08.279 --> 00:27:10.840
<v Speaker 1>And you can even comment in line in

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:11.399
<v Speaker 1>the editor.

00:27:12.105 --> 00:27:14.265
<v Speaker 1>Like, you know, you don't have to go

00:27:14.265 --> 00:27:15.945
<v Speaker 1>back to GitHub in order to do your

00:27:15.945 --> 00:27:17.705
<v Speaker 1>code review. You just do it from the

00:27:17.705 --> 00:27:20.184
<v Speaker 1>IDE. You can even approve or, you know,

00:27:20.184 --> 00:27:21.784
<v Speaker 1>comment, reject, whatnot.

00:27:22.585 --> 00:27:25.544
<v Speaker 0>Okay. I I mean, we're definitely gonna have

00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:26.570
<v Speaker 0>try that to fill in because

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:29.850
<v Speaker 0>I'm into a help some Helm charts repositories.

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:32.170
<v Speaker 0>I run the influx DB Helm charts, and

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:33.770
<v Speaker 0>it gets a lot of pull requests. There's

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:35.610
<v Speaker 0>a lot of work, and anything that can

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:38.410
<v Speaker 0>simplify that for me, like, I'm immediately sold.

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:40.485
<v Speaker 0>So hopefully, we can try that. Let's let's

00:27:40.485 --> 00:27:43.045
<v Speaker 0>do something rudimentary with this go set up

00:27:43.045 --> 00:27:44.165
<v Speaker 0>and then maybe we can look at one

00:27:44.165 --> 00:27:45.685
<v Speaker 0>of those pull requests and see how that

00:27:45.685 --> 00:27:46.164
<v Speaker 0>works.

00:27:47.445 --> 00:27:48.565
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So

00:27:49.605 --> 00:27:52.085
<v Speaker 0>we enable the feature preview because we want

00:27:52.085 --> 00:27:53.525
<v Speaker 0>the ability to do

00:27:54.049 --> 00:27:55.809
<v Speaker 0>sudo. So I'm just gonna do sudo l

00:27:55.809 --> 00:27:57.409
<v Speaker 0>s and that now worked.

00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:59.249
<v Speaker 0>But you also suggested that

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:01.169
<v Speaker 0>this lib get two is not something that

00:28:01.169 --> 00:28:03.730
<v Speaker 0>we want to have everybody installed manually. So

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:05.490
<v Speaker 0>we probably want to add our own get

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:07.090
<v Speaker 0>pod dot docker file.

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:10.445
<v Speaker 0>Is that correct? Mhmm. Yes. Okay.

00:28:11.884 --> 00:28:14.445
<v Speaker 2>What's the flow that that I found works

00:28:14.445 --> 00:28:16.205
<v Speaker 2>is, you know, first, you gotta find out

00:28:16.205 --> 00:28:18.044
<v Speaker 2>the exact name of the package that you

00:28:18.044 --> 00:28:19.884
<v Speaker 2>want to install. So now we could in

00:28:19.884 --> 00:28:21.484
<v Speaker 2>in this terminal, we could do

00:28:21.884 --> 00:28:23.725
<v Speaker 2>up get updates, up install

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.120
<v Speaker 2>Just to make sure we're picking the right

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:29.159
<v Speaker 2>package and that our up go get runs

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:29.720
<v Speaker 2>through,

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.640
<v Speaker 2>and then we we take that and we

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.960
<v Speaker 2>package that into the into the Docker file.

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:36.600
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:28:39.345 --> 00:28:39.985
<v Speaker 0>So

00:28:40.385 --> 00:28:43.745
<v Speaker 0>we will need lib get to dash dev.

00:28:44.705 --> 00:28:46.465
<v Speaker 0>Is there a helper for creating this Docker

00:28:46.465 --> 00:28:47.825
<v Speaker 0>file or should I just go ahead and

00:28:47.825 --> 00:28:49.585
<v Speaker 0>do, like, new file here?

00:28:49.985 --> 00:28:51.985
<v Speaker 1>There is. You can also open the view

00:28:51.985 --> 00:28:53.425
<v Speaker 1>on the right with the Gitpod

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:55.259
<v Speaker 1>icon again and

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:59.259
<v Speaker 1>update Docker configuration once more. Use default.

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.340
<v Speaker 1>And, yes, generated Gitpod deck of the

00:29:06.455 --> 00:29:09.175
<v Speaker 0>k. So now okay. Yeah. So that name

00:29:09.175 --> 00:29:11.175
<v Speaker 0>is completely wherever I want it to be.

00:29:11.175 --> 00:29:13.415
<v Speaker 0>This is just what's set by default. Okay.

00:29:13.415 --> 00:29:13.895
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:29:15.735 --> 00:29:18.055
<v Speaker 0>Because I I I'm very fussy over fails

00:29:18.055 --> 00:29:20.830
<v Speaker 0>on my repository, so it states that that's

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:21.549
<v Speaker 0>an option.

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:24.509
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's get this working then. So

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:27.629
<v Speaker 0>now I ran an app update

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:30.029
<v Speaker 0>from this terminal because I'm just used to

00:29:30.029 --> 00:29:32.350
<v Speaker 0>container images, really stripping all that stuff out.

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:33.870
<v Speaker 0>Is that the same for Gitpod or does

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:35.149
<v Speaker 0>that step unnecessary

00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:35.389
<v Speaker 0>here?

00:29:36.495 --> 00:29:38.815
<v Speaker 1>I think you need to do that. Yep.

00:29:41.855 --> 00:29:42.495
<v Speaker 2>Be wary

00:29:42.895 --> 00:29:45.775
<v Speaker 2>beware that this later will run headless. Right?

00:29:45.775 --> 00:29:48.415
<v Speaker 2>So if you do apt install or apt

00:29:48.415 --> 00:29:49.775
<v Speaker 2>get install, you need to make sure that

00:29:49.775 --> 00:29:51.610
<v Speaker 2>it's not asking exactly. It's not asking for

00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:53.289
<v Speaker 2>confirmation or anything like that.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:56.889
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'll I'll just set this to

00:29:57.370 --> 00:29:58.330
<v Speaker 0>front

00:29:58.330 --> 00:29:58.730
<v Speaker 0>end.

00:30:02.515 --> 00:30:04.995
<v Speaker 2>This environment variable will later be available in

00:30:04.995 --> 00:30:06.674
<v Speaker 2>your workspace too. So if you set it

00:30:06.674 --> 00:30:09.155
<v Speaker 2>here like this, then in your workspace, it

00:30:09.155 --> 00:30:10.914
<v Speaker 2>will be set like that as well. Exactly.

00:30:12.915 --> 00:30:13.874
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:30:14.035 --> 00:30:15.475
<v Speaker 0>With a with a cleaner.

00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:19.490
<v Speaker 1>And this does not run as rules, so

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:21.169
<v Speaker 1>it better put sudo

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:22.130
<v Speaker 1>before.

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:25.169
<v Speaker 0>K. Oh,

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:26.850
<v Speaker 0>provided there.

00:30:30.434 --> 00:30:31.715
<v Speaker 2>There we go.

00:30:34.115 --> 00:30:34.914
<v Speaker 0>Sudo.

00:30:36.674 --> 00:30:37.715
<v Speaker 0>So

00:30:38.915 --> 00:30:40.915
<v Speaker 0>now that I've added the Dockerfile and made

00:30:40.915 --> 00:30:42.915
<v Speaker 0>some changes, is there anything I need to

00:30:42.915 --> 00:30:43.554
<v Speaker 0>do to

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.960
<v Speaker 0>switch to this new image?

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:47.640
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:50.280
<v Speaker 1>You need to get that into your remote

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Git repository.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.240
<v Speaker 1>So you need to create a branch

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:56.040
<v Speaker 1>and push it there because it's Git first.

00:30:56.554 --> 00:30:58.955
<v Speaker 1>You know, Gitpod yeah. You you open new

00:30:58.955 --> 00:31:01.274
<v Speaker 1>dev environments from from Git.

00:31:01.515 --> 00:31:03.514
<v Speaker 1>So if you have it on a branch

00:31:03.595 --> 00:31:05.434
<v Speaker 1>or on your phone, whatever,

00:31:06.554 --> 00:31:08.554
<v Speaker 1>and you start different moments from there, Gitpod

00:31:08.554 --> 00:31:10.075
<v Speaker 1>understands. Okay. That's,

00:31:10.875 --> 00:31:12.469
<v Speaker 1>you know, that's the configuration

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:15.749
<v Speaker 1>I need to to choose.

00:31:16.309 --> 00:31:18.070
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming I can just use these tools

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.709
<v Speaker 0>here

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:20.789
<v Speaker 0>to Yep. To do that. Okay. So I

00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:21.589
<v Speaker 0>can say,

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.989
<v Speaker 0>add it

00:31:25.269 --> 00:31:26.470
<v Speaker 0>both configuration.

00:31:27.875 --> 00:31:30.274
<v Speaker 2>You can also create a branch in the

00:31:30.274 --> 00:31:32.274
<v Speaker 2>status bar where it says master.

00:31:32.434 --> 00:31:33.875
<v Speaker 2>If you click on that, then it will

00:31:33.875 --> 00:31:35.075
<v Speaker 2>ask you if you want to create a

00:31:35.075 --> 00:31:35.794
<v Speaker 2>new branch.

00:31:38.914 --> 00:31:39.395
<v Speaker 0>K.

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:42.420
<v Speaker 0>Then

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:44.260
<v Speaker 0>You need to stage.

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:45.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. This plus.

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:49.140
<v Speaker 2>And then the small tick up top.

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:50.980
<v Speaker 2>Yep.

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:51.780
<v Speaker 2>That's it.

00:31:53.705 --> 00:31:55.465
<v Speaker 2>And to push, you can use the command

00:31:55.465 --> 00:31:57.705
<v Speaker 2>palette. You can use Gitpush in your terminal.

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:06.389
<v Speaker 0>And

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:08.070
<v Speaker 0>that's it.

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:10.549
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:13.830
<v Speaker 0>I guess I should pull this back up

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:14.789
<v Speaker 0>from here.

00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:18.710
<v Speaker 0>And it was good series go.

00:32:21.615 --> 00:32:22.415
<v Speaker 1>Right.

00:32:22.895 --> 00:32:25.135
<v Speaker 0>So should I just create a merge request?

00:32:25.775 --> 00:32:27.615
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You don't have to in order to

00:32:27.615 --> 00:32:29.455
<v Speaker 1>change it. You can to test it, you

00:32:29.455 --> 00:32:31.695
<v Speaker 1>can also just go to the branch, load

00:32:31.695 --> 00:32:32.735
<v Speaker 1>it on the features.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:36.880
<v Speaker 0>You mean from

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You you select that one,

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.960
<v Speaker 1>and then you see the web ID button.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.200
<v Speaker 1>I wanna show you, like, use the drop

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.085
<v Speaker 1>down and choose Gitpod because Gitpod has a

00:32:48.085 --> 00:32:50.245
<v Speaker 1>native integration, GitLab, so you don't need to

00:32:50.245 --> 00:32:51.684
<v Speaker 1>prefix this stuff.

00:32:57.765 --> 00:32:59.685
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Now we can use it. We have

00:32:59.685 --> 00:33:01.125
<v Speaker 1>just had it enabled once.

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:03.580
<v Speaker 0>And this is opening

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:05.179
<v Speaker 0>the branch.

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.740
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Correct. Do see the the context URL

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:08.620
<v Speaker 1>on top?

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:11.419
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

00:33:12.059 --> 00:33:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Right.

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:15.340
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I broke it.

00:33:17.635 --> 00:33:19.235
<v Speaker 0>So I'll start with the default image and

00:33:19.235 --> 00:33:20.355
<v Speaker 0>fix that, I guess.

00:33:21.555 --> 00:33:23.715
<v Speaker 1>You can go to the to the other

00:33:23.715 --> 00:33:24.355
<v Speaker 1>workspace

00:33:24.755 --> 00:33:27.315
<v Speaker 1>and fix the problem and then just force

00:33:27.315 --> 00:33:27.955
<v Speaker 1>push again.

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:30.990
<v Speaker 1>But I I couldn't stop the problem.

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:33.309
<v Speaker 2>Oh, yeah. I forgot I think it was

00:33:33.309 --> 00:33:34.910
<v Speaker 0>signed. So I I just tried to run

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:36.590
<v Speaker 0>it as I as I command. Mhmm. So

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:40.270
<v Speaker 0>okay. So I'll just amend that commit so

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:41.549
<v Speaker 0>we can stage this.

00:33:42.625 --> 00:33:44.384
<v Speaker 2>Use you can use the amend button.

00:33:46.945 --> 00:33:48.304
<v Speaker 1>And then Right.

00:33:48.545 --> 00:33:50.384
<v Speaker 1>Just that one. Perfect.

00:33:51.345 --> 00:33:52.065
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:33:52.385 --> 00:33:54.385
<v Speaker 2>And you guys still gotta push. So if

00:33:54.385 --> 00:33:56.385
<v Speaker 2>you again, you can just use the command

00:33:56.385 --> 00:33:57.105
<v Speaker 2>palette for that.

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:02.860
<v Speaker 1>First push. Oh, yeah. Yeah. The fourth push.

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:03.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.460
<v Speaker 0>K. So

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.580
<v Speaker 0>let's just

00:34:11.994 --> 00:34:14.235
<v Speaker 0>pop back to here

00:34:16.955 --> 00:34:18.315
<v Speaker 0>and try that again.

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:27.020
<v Speaker 0>It's attempting to and build our custom image,

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.940
<v Speaker 0>which should hopefully this time work.

00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:33.500
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It looks better. Okay.

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:35.580
<v Speaker 0>And you were saying

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:37.340
<v Speaker 0>this only does this once.

00:34:37.745 --> 00:34:39.905
<v Speaker 0>So anyone else that now comes to this

00:34:39.905 --> 00:34:41.745
<v Speaker 0>project, they're just gonna get the built version

00:34:41.745 --> 00:34:43.344
<v Speaker 0>of this image and not have to wait.

00:34:43.344 --> 00:34:44.785
<v Speaker 0>Right? Correct.

00:34:45.185 --> 00:34:47.105
<v Speaker 2>Until you make a change to to the

00:34:47.105 --> 00:34:48.705
<v Speaker 2>image of or to the file, of course.

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:51.370
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:54.810
<v Speaker 0>And what we should see the reason that

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:56.969
<v Speaker 0>we did this was because let get caused

00:34:56.969 --> 00:34:59.930
<v Speaker 0>our goal build to fail earlier. So now

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:01.930
<v Speaker 0>when this pops open, we should see our

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:05.610
<v Speaker 0>terminal set in there whether

00:35:03.995 --> 00:35:05.835
<v Speaker 0>a built binary, I'm assuming.

00:35:06.395 --> 00:35:06.955
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:35:07.755 --> 00:35:08.555
<v Speaker 0>Correct.

00:35:09.195 --> 00:35:11.675
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And it should execute the things we

00:35:11.675 --> 00:35:13.995
<v Speaker 1>listed in the tasks in the Gitpodium now

00:35:13.995 --> 00:35:17.035
<v Speaker 1>because we pushed the Gitpodium as well. Excellent.

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:24.140
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no.

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:29.020
<v Speaker 0>I think this is just a good thing

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:31.420
<v Speaker 0>now. This is not anything that we've done.

00:35:34.915 --> 00:35:37.075
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'm not sure about that error message.

00:35:40.035 --> 00:35:42.755
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's some version. The version in the

00:35:43.075 --> 00:35:44.115
<v Speaker 2>Ubuntu

00:35:44.915 --> 00:35:46.435
<v Speaker 2>package doesn't

00:35:46.435 --> 00:35:48.755
<v Speaker 2>match up with what we're expecting here.

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:50.810
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. You're correct.

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:53.690
<v Speaker 0>We installed web 28 because that was available

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:56.170
<v Speaker 0>in Ubuntu, and this uses version

00:35:56.890 --> 00:35:57.690
<v Speaker 0>30.

00:35:58.090 --> 00:35:59.690
<v Speaker 0>So let's just see if it's fixed. If

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:01.530
<v Speaker 0>not, we can move to another project.

00:36:04.735 --> 00:36:06.895
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna have to get a specific version

00:36:06.895 --> 00:36:08.255
<v Speaker 0>for that, I think.

00:36:09.615 --> 00:36:10.575
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

00:36:16.015 --> 00:36:16.575
<v Speaker 0>Leases

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.800
<v Speaker 0>twenty eight eight six

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:25.680
<v Speaker 0>twenty eight.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.840
<v Speaker 0>And then

00:36:33.075 --> 00:36:34.275
<v Speaker 0>download.

00:36:36.755 --> 00:36:38.035
<v Speaker 0>See if that makes it a little bit

00:36:38.035 --> 00:36:38.675
<v Speaker 0>happier.

00:36:38.995 --> 00:36:40.275
<v Speaker 0>And go build.

00:36:42.675 --> 00:36:43.475
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna need some.

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:47.830
<v Speaker 0>I broke it.

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:54.950
<v Speaker 0>Oh, well. Not important.

00:36:58.150 --> 00:37:00.070
<v Speaker 0>Oh, it's just added that back in, actually.

00:37:04.675 --> 00:37:06.115
<v Speaker 0>This is why I tried to avoid using

00:37:06.115 --> 00:37:07.635
<v Speaker 0>Libgit whenever possible.

00:37:08.835 --> 00:37:10.115
<v Speaker 2>There is a

00:37:10.995 --> 00:37:11.795
<v Speaker 2>good good

00:37:12.195 --> 00:37:13.235
<v Speaker 2>go native

00:37:13.715 --> 00:37:16.510
<v Speaker 2>Git implementation as well. Oh, really?

00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:18.109
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:20.029
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if I really wanna keep

00:37:20.029 --> 00:37:22.670
<v Speaker 0>trying to fix this. Yeah.

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:25.309
<v Speaker 0>So the the the v 30 import seems

00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:26.670
<v Speaker 0>to be across a few files.

00:37:30.375 --> 00:37:33.095
<v Speaker 0>And I just don't think that's important. So

00:37:34.375 --> 00:37:36.615
<v Speaker 0>let's pop open something else then.

00:37:38.615 --> 00:37:39.975
<v Speaker 0>Let's do the Rust project.

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:43.900
<v Speaker 0>Feeling brave. Right?

00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:49.260
<v Speaker 0>Think

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:53.260
<v Speaker 0>let's see. Gitpod I o slash

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:54.700
<v Speaker 0>and

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:57.740
<v Speaker 0>slash whatever we wanna call that. Get menu

00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:58.300
<v Speaker 0>environment.

00:38:01.394 --> 00:38:04.674
<v Speaker 0>So you mentioned earlier that Gitpod tries to

00:38:04.674 --> 00:38:07.394
<v Speaker 0>kind of does it do language detection? It

00:38:07.394 --> 00:38:09.234
<v Speaker 0>tries to work at what sensible default makes

00:38:09.234 --> 00:38:10.994
<v Speaker 0>sense for each repositories.

00:38:10.994 --> 00:38:11.635
<v Speaker 0>Is that correct?

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:15.230
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:18.190
<v Speaker 2>Yes and no. So it it does that

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:19.870
<v Speaker 2>in in some very simple cases like the

00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:21.790
<v Speaker 2>ones that we've seen for for Go,

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:22.990
<v Speaker 2>but

00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:24.830
<v Speaker 2>it's not very

00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:27.310
<v Speaker 2>yeah.

00:38:28.484 --> 00:38:30.165
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Elaborate.

00:38:31.605 --> 00:38:33.924
<v Speaker 0>Oh, because this is using the workspace

00:38:33.924 --> 00:38:35.205
<v Speaker 0>fill image,

00:38:35.285 --> 00:38:37.365
<v Speaker 0>is that just mean as prebaked with

00:38:38.244 --> 00:38:41.125
<v Speaker 0>binaries and languages, like support for popular languages?

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:43.150
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm. Because I do have access to Rust

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:43.950
<v Speaker 0>c here.

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:46.590
<v Speaker 1>Yep. I do have PHP,

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:48.910
<v Speaker 0>L. I mean, I'm having quite a lot

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:51.550
<v Speaker 0>of languages here. So Node, Python,

00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:52.350
<v Speaker 2>Go.

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:55.790
<v Speaker 0>Oh, alright.

00:38:56.705 --> 00:38:59.105
<v Speaker 0>So let's click setup project again.

00:39:00.305 --> 00:39:01.745
<v Speaker 0>We'll create the Gitpod.

00:39:04.145 --> 00:39:05.985
<v Speaker 0>It has detected oh, yeah. It's a bit

00:39:05.985 --> 00:39:06.625
<v Speaker 0>small.

00:39:08.465 --> 00:39:10.660
<v Speaker 0>What's that? So that detect that was rust.

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:11.860
<v Speaker 0>It knows that I wanted to a cargo

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:13.620
<v Speaker 0>build, a cargo watch.

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:15.140
<v Speaker 0>I don't

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:16.500
<v Speaker 0>think we're gonna need that.

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:18.820
<v Speaker 0>I'll update the read me with the cool

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:19.540
<v Speaker 0>button again.

00:39:26.005 --> 00:39:27.525
<v Speaker 0>Not sure what happened there.

00:39:27.925 --> 00:39:30.005
<v Speaker 0>K. Let's skip it. Is there a read

00:39:30.005 --> 00:39:30.565
<v Speaker 1>me?

00:39:33.685 --> 00:39:34.645
<v Speaker 0>I'm

00:39:34.645 --> 00:39:36.565
<v Speaker 0>a bit of a cowboy developer, so it's

00:39:36.565 --> 00:39:38.940
<v Speaker 0>very likely that there's not for sure.

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:41.740
<v Speaker 0>Alright. And then we'll just push that and

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:42.860
<v Speaker 0>start. Okay.

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:45.900
<v Speaker 0>So I can do a cargo.

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:50.700
<v Speaker 0>And the crates is gonna compel that one.

00:39:51.375 --> 00:39:52.895
<v Speaker 0>Maybe gonna work. You know, I don't even

00:39:52.895 --> 00:39:55.215
<v Speaker 0>know. I've picked another repository that uses libkat

00:39:55.215 --> 00:39:57.135
<v Speaker 0>again. So who knows what's gonna happen?

00:40:00.095 --> 00:40:01.855
<v Speaker 0>Maybe it's happier.

00:40:03.295 --> 00:40:06.119
<v Speaker 2>So can we come in? Sorry, Nico. Sorry.

00:40:06.119 --> 00:40:08.440
<v Speaker 2>One thing that, you know, might seem minor

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:10.280
<v Speaker 2>but actually really works in

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.240
<v Speaker 2>in the daily life of a developer is

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:15.560
<v Speaker 2>that exactly because your workspace is now running

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:16.200
<v Speaker 2>in the cloud,

00:40:17.385 --> 00:40:19.465
<v Speaker 2>download speeds are just so much faster.

00:40:19.945 --> 00:40:22.025
<v Speaker 2>Like, in downloading libraries,

00:40:22.025 --> 00:40:23.225
<v Speaker 2>dependencies,

00:40:23.305 --> 00:40:25.545
<v Speaker 2>docker images, you name it, you know, it

00:40:25.545 --> 00:40:26.985
<v Speaker 2>just flies off. It's

00:40:28.025 --> 00:40:29.305
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Definitely.

00:40:29.705 --> 00:40:31.785
<v Speaker 0>The download speeds were pretty quick. Although, unfortunately,

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.080
<v Speaker 0>I don't think you can speed up the

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:35.960
<v Speaker 0>Rust Belt times, which are notoriously bad. So

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:39.080
<v Speaker 1>We can eliminate them by, you know, running

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:40.920
<v Speaker 1>them in a prebuilt. Like, all everything we

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.400
<v Speaker 1>are waiting here for would be something we

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.760
<v Speaker 1>could do as a cleansing.

00:40:46.395 --> 00:40:48.955
<v Speaker 0>Well, that was pretty quick, and I've I've

00:40:48.955 --> 00:40:51.675
<v Speaker 0>actually I think this is they're just working.

00:40:54.315 --> 00:40:55.035
<v Speaker 0>Target.

00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:59.020
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no. This is just a library, so

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:00.619
<v Speaker 0>there's no target. So, again, that worked.

00:41:01.099 --> 00:41:01.900
<v Speaker 0>Now this is

00:41:02.619 --> 00:41:04.059
<v Speaker 0>I I would just call it as normal

00:41:04.059 --> 00:41:05.740
<v Speaker 0>now. Right? Like, I would pop open my

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:06.460
<v Speaker 0>file.

00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:10.619
<v Speaker 0>Oh, that's my commented stuff. There we go.

00:41:11.435 --> 00:41:13.195
<v Speaker 0>And I have everything that I need to

00:41:13.195 --> 00:41:14.635
<v Speaker 0>work. Awesome.

00:41:15.275 --> 00:41:17.915
<v Speaker 0>And are there any features from

00:41:17.915 --> 00:41:20.475
<v Speaker 0>this ID interface that you wanna cover before

00:41:20.475 --> 00:41:22.715
<v Speaker 0>we we carry on? Is there anything here

00:41:22.715 --> 00:41:24.235
<v Speaker 0>that is maybe slightly different to the way

00:41:24.235 --> 00:41:25.835
<v Speaker 0>that I would work normally?

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:28.580
<v Speaker 0>The thing is jumping out to me. I'll

00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:29.780
<v Speaker 0>just throw it there as a suggestion. I

00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:31.380
<v Speaker 0>I see no open ports.

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:32.420
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm.

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:33.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:34.340
<v Speaker 2>So

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:36.420
<v Speaker 2>what we're doing there is if you have

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:38.820
<v Speaker 2>some service running in your workspace that listens

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:40.565
<v Speaker 2>on a port, Gitpod

00:41:40.565 --> 00:41:43.204
<v Speaker 2>will detect that and then will make it

00:41:43.204 --> 00:41:43.845
<v Speaker 2>available

00:41:44.325 --> 00:41:46.085
<v Speaker 2>outside of the workspace. You can open that

00:41:46.085 --> 00:41:47.365
<v Speaker 2>in in your browser.

00:41:47.684 --> 00:41:48.805
<v Speaker 2>And by default,

00:41:49.045 --> 00:41:50.244
<v Speaker 2>they are private,

00:41:50.645 --> 00:41:52.885
<v Speaker 2>meaning that only you can access it because,

00:41:52.885 --> 00:41:54.565
<v Speaker 2>you know, you're logged in to Gitpod.

00:41:55.525 --> 00:41:57.020
<v Speaker 2>But you can also make them public, and

00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:59.100
<v Speaker 2>then anyone can just access that.

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:01.740
<v Speaker 2>So you could, I don't know, provide an

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:03.820
<v Speaker 2>endpoint to some other service, or you can

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:05.740
<v Speaker 2>share that with a colleague to download something,

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:06.860
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.

00:42:08.234 --> 00:42:09.915
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So does that mean

00:42:11.355 --> 00:42:12.315
<v Speaker 0>random stupid

00:42:12.555 --> 00:42:15.515
<v Speaker 0>oh, I don't oh, yeah. That'll work. If

00:42:15.515 --> 00:42:17.435
<v Speaker 0>I just install NGINX on this,

00:42:17.914 --> 00:42:19.914
<v Speaker 0>I can just close that and someone can

00:42:19.914 --> 00:42:21.810
<v Speaker 0>just browse to engine x?

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:26.530
<v Speaker 0>That's correct. Oh, it detected it as well.

00:42:30.049 --> 00:42:31.329
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Open a preview.

00:42:32.795 --> 00:42:34.555
<v Speaker 0>I have an engine x page.

00:42:37.355 --> 00:42:38.315
<v Speaker 0>Make public.

00:42:41.515 --> 00:42:42.635
<v Speaker 0>That's pretty cool.

00:42:43.515 --> 00:42:43.915
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:46.670
<v Speaker 0>So obviously, if I was

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:50.510
<v Speaker 0>that's again me, I'm on farm today. I've

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:52.270
<v Speaker 0>picked two really bad examples for showing off

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:53.950
<v Speaker 0>a feature. But if I was working on

00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:56.109
<v Speaker 0>a a website or a React application,

00:42:56.109 --> 00:42:58.270
<v Speaker 0>been able to just run that dev server,

00:42:58.665 --> 00:43:00.665
<v Speaker 0>expose support like I have done for NGINX

00:43:00.665 --> 00:43:02.025
<v Speaker 0>here, and give that link to people. They

00:43:02.025 --> 00:43:04.105
<v Speaker 0>can just come in and see exactly where

00:43:04.105 --> 00:43:06.745
<v Speaker 0>I am, what's working, what's not working, etcetera.

00:43:08.585 --> 00:43:09.625
<v Speaker 0>Is there

00:43:10.345 --> 00:43:12.025
<v Speaker 0>like, if I want if you wanted to,

00:43:12.025 --> 00:43:14.079
<v Speaker 0>like, pair with me on an issue, is

00:43:14.079 --> 00:43:15.840
<v Speaker 0>there, like, any support for that

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:18.720
<v Speaker 0>where we'd be able to modify the code

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:19.680
<v Speaker 0>at the same time?

00:43:23.359 --> 00:43:25.440
<v Speaker 2>So there is some there are two ways

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:27.040
<v Speaker 2>of of sharing your workspace.

00:43:28.404 --> 00:43:30.884
<v Speaker 2>One is you can share the the workspace

00:43:30.884 --> 00:43:31.925
<v Speaker 2>as it's running.

00:43:32.244 --> 00:43:32.964
<v Speaker 2>So

00:43:33.045 --> 00:43:34.884
<v Speaker 2>at the moment, this just means you're giving

00:43:34.884 --> 00:43:37.525
<v Speaker 2>someone else access to, basically, to your machine,

00:43:37.525 --> 00:43:39.365
<v Speaker 2>right, like your workspace. But the

00:43:40.484 --> 00:43:42.244
<v Speaker 2>example is like you're handing your laptop to

00:43:42.244 --> 00:43:43.684
<v Speaker 2>someone else, kinda like that.

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:47.430
<v Speaker 2>The you share some of the the terminals

00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:48.390
<v Speaker 2>at that point,

00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:51.990
<v Speaker 2>and we're still working on adding some, like,

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:54.070
<v Speaker 2>Google Doc style life editing that you also

00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:55.030
<v Speaker 2>share editors.

00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:57.910
<v Speaker 2>And the other mode of sharing is where

00:43:57.910 --> 00:44:00.385
<v Speaker 2>you can share a snapshot. So say you

00:44:00.385 --> 00:44:01.984
<v Speaker 2>have a problem right now or you have

00:44:01.984 --> 00:44:03.665
<v Speaker 2>something that you would like to demonstrate,

00:44:04.305 --> 00:44:06.145
<v Speaker 2>then you can create a snapshot of your

00:44:06.145 --> 00:44:06.945
<v Speaker 2>current state,

00:44:07.345 --> 00:44:09.825
<v Speaker 2>which produces a link that, then you can

00:44:09.825 --> 00:44:11.664
<v Speaker 2>put into an issue, share on Slack, something

00:44:11.664 --> 00:44:13.730
<v Speaker 2>like that. And then someone else can go

00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:15.650
<v Speaker 2>and open that link and get a snapshot

00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:17.650
<v Speaker 2>based on your current state, but it's gonna

00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:19.970
<v Speaker 2>get a workspace, excuse me, based on your

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:21.410
<v Speaker 2>current state, but it's gonna be a separate

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:23.170
<v Speaker 2>workspace. Right? It's like a copy

00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:26.130
<v Speaker 2>that was branched off it and where you

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:26.770
<v Speaker 2>took the snapshot.

00:44:29.555 --> 00:44:32.595
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Cool. So you are working on Google

00:44:32.595 --> 00:44:34.755
<v Speaker 0>Docsys style code editing

00:44:34.755 --> 00:44:36.915
<v Speaker 0>stuff. Nice. We do. Yeah. In theory, you

00:44:36.915 --> 00:44:38.915
<v Speaker 1>could also use the live share

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:40.850
<v Speaker 1>extension from Microsoft.

00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:43.090
<v Speaker 1>It's just that their license doesn't allow it

00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:44.370
<v Speaker 1>to install it in Azure

00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:47.250
<v Speaker 1>in in non visual studio products at the

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:47.730
<v Speaker 1>moment.

00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:50.370
<v Speaker 1>So but we are working on a, you

00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:51.410
<v Speaker 1>know, on

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:54.290
<v Speaker 1>on some collaborative editing extensions for the.

00:44:55.685 --> 00:44:57.205
<v Speaker 0>Very, very cool. Okay.

00:44:58.405 --> 00:45:01.605
<v Speaker 0>You shared a command with me. Yeah. This

00:45:01.605 --> 00:45:03.765
<v Speaker 2>is a really quick way to get a

00:45:03.765 --> 00:45:05.365
<v Speaker 2>get a web server up and running. So,

00:45:05.365 --> 00:45:06.965
<v Speaker 2>you know, short of installing NGINX, if you

00:45:06.965 --> 00:45:08.325
<v Speaker 2>just need a web server that serves a

00:45:08.325 --> 00:45:08.565
<v Speaker 2>file,

00:45:09.339 --> 00:45:11.500
<v Speaker 2>you you push that in, and it's

00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:14.460
<v Speaker 2>gonna spin up a web server for you.

00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:17.660
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Okay. Nice thing is that that works

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:20.540
<v Speaker 2>independently of any kind of, you know, whatever

00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:22.780
<v Speaker 2>whatever you have installed. Behind the scenes, it

00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:24.460
<v Speaker 2>just downloads a gold binary and runs it.

00:45:25.205 --> 00:45:26.965
<v Speaker 2>So this is gonna work. And I could

00:45:26.965 --> 00:45:29.845
<v Speaker 2>never remember the Python line or, you know,

00:45:29.845 --> 00:45:32.325
<v Speaker 2>the PHP line, and it's just gonna start

00:45:32.325 --> 00:45:34.165
<v Speaker 2>with stuff. It's really handy for debugging.

00:45:34.485 --> 00:45:36.165
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's a really cool tip, actually. I

00:45:36.165 --> 00:45:37.765
<v Speaker 0>wasn't familiar with that. So

00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:43.119
<v Speaker 0>alright. Let's we got another question from over.

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:45.359
<v Speaker 0>Working on my computer, I can save a

00:45:45.359 --> 00:45:47.359
<v Speaker 0>file today and it will be available forever.

00:45:47.359 --> 00:45:49.040
<v Speaker 0>And Gitpod, how long can I keep files

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:50.960
<v Speaker 0>that I saved in ID but have not

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:52.799
<v Speaker 0>yet been pushed to the repository?

00:45:55.495 --> 00:45:55.815
<v Speaker 1>There

00:45:56.535 --> 00:45:58.935
<v Speaker 1>yeah. I mentioned before we have an automatic

00:45:58.935 --> 00:46:02.055
<v Speaker 1>garbage collection thing. So by default,

00:46:02.535 --> 00:46:04.855
<v Speaker 1>if you don't restart your workspace for two

00:46:04.855 --> 00:46:06.855
<v Speaker 1>weeks, then it it

00:46:07.095 --> 00:46:07.735
<v Speaker 1>gets

00:46:07.895 --> 00:46:08.455
<v Speaker 1>deleted.

00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:11.170
<v Speaker 1>There is one another week

00:46:11.650 --> 00:46:14.210
<v Speaker 1>where we we could restore the state.

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:17.490
<v Speaker 1>But you can pin your workspace. If you

00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:19.730
<v Speaker 1>wanna have a long living workspace,

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:22.130
<v Speaker 1>so you wanna do the same everyone does

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:25.105
<v Speaker 1>locally, like you have this, you know, stateful

00:46:25.505 --> 00:46:27.425
<v Speaker 1>stuff that you massage over

00:46:27.585 --> 00:46:29.505
<v Speaker 1>your lifespan, then you can do that in

00:46:29.505 --> 00:46:31.985
<v Speaker 1>Gitpod as well. You can have one workspace

00:46:31.985 --> 00:46:33.905
<v Speaker 1>pin it, and then it will never be

00:46:34.065 --> 00:46:36.705
<v Speaker 1>coverage collected. You can restart that, menu the

00:46:36.705 --> 00:46:38.720
<v Speaker 1>sync, and so on. It's just, you know,

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:39.600
<v Speaker 1>we are trying

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:40.960
<v Speaker 1>to

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:42.960
<v Speaker 1>educate people to

00:46:43.119 --> 00:46:44.720
<v Speaker 1>get rid of that because

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:48.240
<v Speaker 1>it is, you know, the the root cause

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:50.480
<v Speaker 1>for configuration drift

00:46:50.694 --> 00:46:51.415
<v Speaker 1>and

00:46:51.734 --> 00:46:53.095
<v Speaker 1>and very

00:46:53.095 --> 00:46:55.335
<v Speaker 1>different states in in environments

00:46:55.335 --> 00:46:55.895
<v Speaker 1>where,

00:46:56.535 --> 00:46:57.255
<v Speaker 1>you know,

00:46:57.895 --> 00:47:00.934
<v Speaker 1>you you cannot really call this dev environments

00:47:00.934 --> 00:47:03.575
<v Speaker 1>as code if you do not really execute

00:47:03.575 --> 00:47:05.710
<v Speaker 1>the automation all the time. If you do

00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:08.270
<v Speaker 1>it once and then you massage it from

00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:08.910
<v Speaker 1>there,

00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:12.110
<v Speaker 1>it you know, it's it's it's nice

00:47:12.350 --> 00:47:13.470
<v Speaker 1>for starters,

00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:15.950
<v Speaker 1>basically, but but then you you do the

00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:16.990
<v Speaker 1>same stuff you do locally.

00:47:17.635 --> 00:47:19.475
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. You're just trying to encourage some best

00:47:19.475 --> 00:47:22.035
<v Speaker 0>practices for people across the board. Right.

00:47:22.675 --> 00:47:24.595
<v Speaker 0>So if I just close this tab,

00:47:24.755 --> 00:47:26.915
<v Speaker 0>that workspace is gonna continue to run

00:47:27.315 --> 00:47:29.155
<v Speaker 0>until I go back to it, until it

00:47:29.155 --> 00:47:30.435
<v Speaker 0>gets garbage collected.

00:47:30.435 --> 00:47:33.315
<v Speaker 0>But, you know, is there a way that

00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:35.180
<v Speaker 0>is should I, like, click stop?

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:36.220
<v Speaker 0>Like, our

00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:39.260
<v Speaker 2>So the workspace is gonna run for another

00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:41.020
<v Speaker 2>two minutes after you close the tab just

00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:42.859
<v Speaker 2>in case you accidentally closed it and, you

00:47:42.859 --> 00:47:44.860
<v Speaker 2>know, command shift t, still there.

00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:46.060
<v Speaker 2>So it does that.

00:47:46.935 --> 00:47:48.935
<v Speaker 2>You can also explicitly stop it

00:47:50.375 --> 00:47:52.615
<v Speaker 2>in the file menu in the command palette

00:47:54.695 --> 00:47:57.015
<v Speaker 2>Okay. Whichever suits your your workflow.

00:47:58.135 --> 00:48:00.455
<v Speaker 2>Alright. Yeah. And if if forget about it,

00:48:00.455 --> 00:48:02.019
<v Speaker 1>you know, you get distracted, you go to

00:48:02.019 --> 00:48:02.980
<v Speaker 1>lunch or whatever.

00:48:03.859 --> 00:48:04.980
<v Speaker 1>The time out is

00:48:05.299 --> 00:48:06.500
<v Speaker 1>thirty minutes

00:48:06.579 --> 00:48:07.619
<v Speaker 1>by default,

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:09.940
<v Speaker 1>and there are there are ways also to

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:12.019
<v Speaker 1>extend it to three hours in in some

00:48:12.019 --> 00:48:14.819
<v Speaker 1>of the professional plans. But yeah. I think

00:48:14.819 --> 00:48:16.740
<v Speaker 1>thirty minutes is is is

00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:19.675
<v Speaker 1>pretty pretty okay. Then in that case, you

00:48:19.675 --> 00:48:21.115
<v Speaker 1>just come back and you see, oh, it

00:48:21.115 --> 00:48:23.195
<v Speaker 1>stopped. You started again. You touch a new

00:48:23.195 --> 00:48:24.075
<v Speaker 1>new look.

00:48:24.635 --> 00:48:25.835
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Thank you.

00:48:27.595 --> 00:48:29.355
<v Speaker 0>I'm just gonna play with this now,

00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:33.890
<v Speaker 0>see if I can find some extensions.

00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:37.170
<v Speaker 0>I changed this theme. It doesn't seem to

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:37.970
<v Speaker 0>be returning.

00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:41.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So we are like, the IDEs and

00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Gitpod, they do not point to the Microsoft

00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:45.890
<v Speaker 1>marketplace.

00:48:46.805 --> 00:48:48.565
<v Speaker 1>But, again, that is

00:48:48.885 --> 00:48:51.605
<v Speaker 1>not okay due to the terms.

00:48:52.485 --> 00:48:54.405
<v Speaker 1>So in order to

00:48:55.045 --> 00:48:57.365
<v Speaker 1>make the all these open source, these code

00:48:57.365 --> 00:49:00.290
<v Speaker 1>extensions are available to everyone and also competition

00:49:00.290 --> 00:49:03.170
<v Speaker 1>projects like like Gitpod and so on. We

00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:05.410
<v Speaker 1>created the open BSX marketplace.

00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:08.210
<v Speaker 1>We moved that to the Eclipse Foundation so

00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:10.930
<v Speaker 1>that it's really on a vendor neutral place,

00:49:11.010 --> 00:49:13.835
<v Speaker 1>you know, that. And then now this this

00:49:13.835 --> 00:49:16.555
<v Speaker 1>is kind of getting adoption. So Versus Codium,

00:49:17.035 --> 00:49:19.515
<v Speaker 1>like, that is the real open source version

00:49:19.515 --> 00:49:21.355
<v Speaker 1>of Versus Code. They are also pointing to

00:49:21.355 --> 00:49:22.315
<v Speaker 1>OpenVSX

00:49:22.315 --> 00:49:23.675
<v Speaker 1>now by default.

00:49:24.555 --> 00:49:26.955
<v Speaker 1>Gitpod, like, all CIR IDEs

00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:29.910
<v Speaker 1>would point to open the as expected fold.

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And if there's something missing, you can

00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:35.990
<v Speaker 1>go to the project

00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:38.310
<v Speaker 1>and, you know, create an issue

00:49:40.315 --> 00:49:42.955
<v Speaker 1>and and just, you know, make sure it

00:49:42.955 --> 00:49:44.155
<v Speaker 1>it gets added.

00:49:45.675 --> 00:49:48.155
<v Speaker 0>Okay. I'm just gonna keep clicking stuff.

00:49:50.395 --> 00:49:51.515
<v Speaker 0>Oh, there we go.

00:49:52.075 --> 00:49:53.915
<v Speaker 0>That's actually the one I use locally sometimes

00:49:53.915 --> 00:49:54.955
<v Speaker 0>anyway. Very cool.

00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:57.490
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's close this down.

00:49:57.730 --> 00:50:00.049
<v Speaker 0>I really wanna check out the pull request

00:50:00.049 --> 00:50:02.130
<v Speaker 0>stuff that we talked about earlier.

00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:04.369
<v Speaker 0>So let's pull that up.

00:50:05.809 --> 00:50:08.049
<v Speaker 0>And well, I need the extension then to

00:50:08.049 --> 00:50:09.250
<v Speaker 0>do this or

00:50:09.444 --> 00:50:11.765
<v Speaker 0>assuming No. Hub won't have the same native

00:50:11.765 --> 00:50:13.605
<v Speaker 0>thing like GitLab had.

00:50:15.125 --> 00:50:16.965
<v Speaker 1>No. You just use your port request.

00:50:17.125 --> 00:50:17.845
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:50:21.605 --> 00:50:23.204
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's just pick this one.

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:28.620
<v Speaker 0>So can see.

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:33.260
<v Speaker 0>Code spacing. So did I just get pod

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:34.140
<v Speaker 0>at the start?

00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:35.660
<v Speaker 2>Correct. Yeah. Correct.

00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:38.285
<v Speaker 2>If you have the the browser extension installed,

00:50:38.285 --> 00:50:39.805
<v Speaker 2>then you're also gonna see a a button

00:50:39.805 --> 00:50:41.165
<v Speaker 2>in the upper right corner.

00:50:41.645 --> 00:50:42.765
<v Speaker 2>Alright. Cool.

00:50:45.005 --> 00:50:46.925
<v Speaker 0>And this is gonna give me a slightly

00:50:47.645 --> 00:50:49.725
<v Speaker 0>different view that we've we've seen with the

00:50:49.725 --> 00:50:51.965
<v Speaker 0>last two projects because it's detecting that I

00:50:51.965 --> 00:50:54.170
<v Speaker 0>was at a pull request from this.

00:50:55.210 --> 00:50:56.010
<v Speaker 1>Correct.

00:51:04.329 --> 00:51:05.930
<v Speaker 0>Okay. What have I got?

00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:07.849
<v Speaker 0>Oh, so it's just straight into the the

00:51:07.849 --> 00:51:08.569
<v Speaker 0>death mode.

00:51:09.744 --> 00:51:11.665
<v Speaker 0>I can click through the files.

00:51:17.265 --> 00:51:19.745
<v Speaker 1>Double click. Double

00:51:20.065 --> 00:51:21.105
<v Speaker 2>click and then And

00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:26.360
<v Speaker 1>then you can also use the cursor

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:29.080
<v Speaker 1>keys in order to navigate through all the

00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:30.360
<v Speaker 1>changes one by one.

00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:33.960
<v Speaker 1>And you can add columns if in case

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.280
<v Speaker 1>you have questions or

00:51:37.845 --> 00:51:38.885
<v Speaker 0>k. So,

00:51:39.525 --> 00:51:41.765
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I've already approved

00:51:41.765 --> 00:51:43.525
<v Speaker 0>this, but if I wanted to add a

00:51:43.525 --> 00:51:44.085
<v Speaker 0>comment,

00:51:44.405 --> 00:51:45.525
<v Speaker 0>what's Mhmm.

00:51:45.925 --> 00:51:47.445
<v Speaker 0>I would say that You hover over

00:51:47.685 --> 00:51:49.525
<v Speaker 1>the the change line on the right hand

00:51:49.525 --> 00:51:49.925
<v Speaker 1>side, like

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:52.340
<v Speaker 1>and you see this

00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:54.660
<v Speaker 1>conversation symbol. You click on it.

00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:56.820
<v Speaker 0>Ah,

00:51:57.540 --> 00:51:58.340
<v Speaker 0>okay.

00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:00.900
<v Speaker 0>So this is pretty it feels pretty similar

00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:02.100
<v Speaker 0>to what I would actually do from the

00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:03.460
<v Speaker 0>GAP site. I can have the single comment

00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:04.980
<v Speaker 0>or actually start a review and and build

00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:07.295
<v Speaker 0>up all those comments. And Right. And you

00:52:07.295 --> 00:52:09.694
<v Speaker 1>would also see all existing comments here. There

00:52:09.694 --> 00:52:11.535
<v Speaker 1>is a comments view even.

00:52:12.815 --> 00:52:14.015
<v Speaker 1>And also on the right hand side, you

00:52:14.015 --> 00:52:15.295
<v Speaker 1>see the GitHub symbol.

00:52:16.255 --> 00:52:18.255
<v Speaker 1>There you see more details on the full

00:52:18.255 --> 00:52:18.654
<v Speaker 1>request.

00:52:19.119 --> 00:52:21.040
<v Speaker 1>And so you see conversations. If you click

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:23.359
<v Speaker 1>on conversations, you would see, you know, existing

00:52:23.359 --> 00:52:24.320
<v Speaker 1>conversations.

00:52:25.599 --> 00:52:27.440
<v Speaker 1>To the files and see them in the

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:29.360
<v Speaker 1>in the different contexts.

00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:33.275
<v Speaker 0>Very, very cool. This is a much better

00:52:33.275 --> 00:52:35.515
<v Speaker 0>experience for working with a pull request than

00:52:35.515 --> 00:52:38.315
<v Speaker 0>working from the GitHub UI. I like it.

00:52:38.714 --> 00:52:39.835
<v Speaker 2>It also

00:52:40.075 --> 00:52:41.994
<v Speaker 2>means you can try it out directly because

00:52:41.994 --> 00:52:43.595
<v Speaker 2>you have a full blown dev environment. You

00:52:43.595 --> 00:52:45.194
<v Speaker 2>know, this isn't just yet another view on

00:52:45.194 --> 00:52:46.154
<v Speaker 2>on the PR itself,

00:52:46.619 --> 00:52:48.779
<v Speaker 2>but you have a terminal. And if your

00:52:48.779 --> 00:52:50.700
<v Speaker 2>project is Gitpodified,

00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:51.900
<v Speaker 2>if you have a configuration,

00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:53.740
<v Speaker 2>everything is, you know, set up and ready

00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:55.740
<v Speaker 2>to go, you can run tests,

00:52:56.779 --> 00:52:57.820
<v Speaker 2>debug even,

00:52:58.299 --> 00:52:59.500
<v Speaker 2>and then try it out proper.

00:53:01.645 --> 00:53:04.204
<v Speaker 0>The workspace fill doesn't come with helm, I

00:53:04.204 --> 00:53:05.005
<v Speaker 0>don't think,

00:53:05.645 --> 00:53:06.845
<v Speaker 0>with control.

00:53:08.444 --> 00:53:10.605
<v Speaker 0>But I could provide them with my own

00:53:10.605 --> 00:53:12.444
<v Speaker 0>image because this is a help charge repository.

00:53:12.444 --> 00:53:14.285
<v Speaker 0>So the tooling that I need is

00:53:14.525 --> 00:53:15.404
<v Speaker 0>kinda specific.

00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:19.600
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Is there any integration with GitHub actions?

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:21.360
<v Speaker 0>Like, would I be able to see if

00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:22.000
<v Speaker 0>the

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:24.880
<v Speaker 0>if the last run was successful or if

00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:26.720
<v Speaker 0>it failed or what failed? Or is that

00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:28.160
<v Speaker 0>something I would have to jump back over

00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:29.280
<v Speaker 0>to GitHub to investigate?

00:53:31.555 --> 00:53:34.275
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. There's nothing special about that, probably, an

00:53:34.275 --> 00:53:36.675
<v Speaker 1>extension around that that you could install.

00:53:38.595 --> 00:53:41.475
<v Speaker 1>But, yeah, we do not use GitHub actions,

00:53:41.475 --> 00:53:41.875
<v Speaker 1>so

00:53:42.435 --> 00:53:43.795
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know.

00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:45.640
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:47.640
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I guess that's the other cool

00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:49.320
<v Speaker 0>thing is that this has access to the

00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:50.600
<v Speaker 0>open BSX

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:52.440
<v Speaker 0>marketplace. So if there's an extension out there

00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:55.480
<v Speaker 0>that already has GitHub action status support, then

00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:57.480
<v Speaker 0>it's just gonna magically work anyway. So that's

00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:58.600
<v Speaker 0>pretty cool. Thanks.

00:54:01.165 --> 00:54:02.925
<v Speaker 0>Do I have the ability to approve the

00:54:02.925 --> 00:54:04.205
<v Speaker 0>pull request from here?

00:54:05.645 --> 00:54:06.365
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

00:54:06.525 --> 00:54:08.605
<v Speaker 1>Usually, revenue changes.

00:54:08.845 --> 00:54:11.005
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. There we go. And then And then

00:54:11.005 --> 00:54:12.445
<v Speaker 0>I can just review this. I can just

00:54:12.445 --> 00:54:13.244
<v Speaker 0>approve it again.

00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:19.300
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I think permissions.

00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:24.900
<v Speaker 1>We need a new

00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:26.660
<v Speaker 1>scope.

00:54:28.575 --> 00:54:29.375
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.

00:54:29.615 --> 00:54:30.815
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I don't think I

00:54:32.015 --> 00:54:34.015
<v Speaker 0>can't remember if I authenticated with GitHub or

00:54:34.015 --> 00:54:34.575
<v Speaker 0>not.

00:54:34.815 --> 00:54:35.855
<v Speaker 0>Maybe I did.

00:54:36.175 --> 00:54:38.815
<v Speaker 1>You can review that in the upper right

00:54:38.815 --> 00:54:40.415
<v Speaker 2>corner on your avatar.

00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:44.280
<v Speaker 2>There is a point called access control.

00:54:45.559 --> 00:54:47.160
<v Speaker 2>The second that one.

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:50.200
<v Speaker 2>They can see what permissions

00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:51.880
<v Speaker 2>your current token has on.

00:54:56.035 --> 00:54:57.155
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Yeah. I

00:54:57.955 --> 00:55:00.675
<v Speaker 1>write public repos is, I guess, the thing

00:55:00.675 --> 00:55:01.315
<v Speaker 1>you would need.

00:55:08.770 --> 00:55:10.050
<v Speaker 0>That's annoying.

00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:13.970
<v Speaker 0>Let me grab that.

00:55:24.795 --> 00:55:26.715
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. So by default, we try and, you

00:55:26.715 --> 00:55:29.275
<v Speaker 2>know, grab the least privileges

00:55:29.355 --> 00:55:31.835
<v Speaker 2>for your account possible. And then, yeah, as

00:55:31.835 --> 00:55:33.035
<v Speaker 2>you need more,

00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:35.800
<v Speaker 2>usually, we'll ask for it.

00:55:36.599 --> 00:55:39.320
<v Speaker 0>Alright. That worked. I've now approved it again.

00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:43.320
<v Speaker 0>And I can be And you can jump

00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:44.920
<v Speaker 1>yeah. You you

00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:47.160
<v Speaker 1>can even merge or go back to GitHub

00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:50.405
<v Speaker 1>by clicking on the the issue number on

00:55:50.405 --> 00:55:51.285
<v Speaker 1>top right.

00:55:55.205 --> 00:55:56.725
<v Speaker 0>In fact, I can merge it from here

00:55:56.725 --> 00:55:58.165
<v Speaker 0>where it's asking me if I wanna do

00:55:58.165 --> 00:55:59.685
<v Speaker 0>a squash or a rebase, or I can

00:55:59.685 --> 00:56:01.365
<v Speaker 0>click the issue number, come over here, and

00:56:01.365 --> 00:56:03.820
<v Speaker 0>just go ahead and do that. So there.

00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:05.260
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:08.220
<v Speaker 0>That's very convenient. I can see

00:56:09.579 --> 00:56:11.900
<v Speaker 0>just how useful that kind of is there.

00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:14.460
<v Speaker 0>With regards to the

00:56:16.035 --> 00:56:17.395
<v Speaker 0>the setups,

00:56:17.555 --> 00:56:19.475
<v Speaker 0>how would one contribute

00:56:19.714 --> 00:56:21.954
<v Speaker 0>to Gitpod to understand that this was a

00:56:21.954 --> 00:56:23.555
<v Speaker 0>Helm chart repo? Like, what would be the

00:56:23.555 --> 00:56:25.315
<v Speaker 0>process for that? Like, if I was, hey.

00:56:25.315 --> 00:56:26.515
<v Speaker 0>I work at Helm charts a lot. I

00:56:26.515 --> 00:56:28.675
<v Speaker 0>wanna make Gitpod work better by default for

00:56:28.675 --> 00:56:31.059
<v Speaker 0>these kind of repositories. Is there as there

00:56:31.059 --> 00:56:32.819
<v Speaker 0>some way for me to contribute that towards

00:56:32.819 --> 00:56:33.619
<v Speaker 0>a project?

00:56:37.059 --> 00:56:38.819
<v Speaker 1>The the way you would solve that is

00:56:38.819 --> 00:56:40.980
<v Speaker 1>for your project. You know, we can't we

00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:43.460
<v Speaker 1>we like, Gitpod is really designed to be

00:56:44.065 --> 00:56:47.265
<v Speaker 1>non opinionated about what kind of projects

00:56:47.265 --> 00:56:49.985
<v Speaker 1>to support. So we want you we wanna

00:56:49.985 --> 00:56:52.785
<v Speaker 1>allow developers to just say, okay. I I

00:56:52.785 --> 00:56:54.705
<v Speaker 1>need this tool, that tool, that CLI tool,

00:56:54.705 --> 00:56:57.140
<v Speaker 1>that extensions, and so on, and please bundle

00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:59.140
<v Speaker 1>that up for me. So you would put

00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:01.300
<v Speaker 1>that into your Docker

00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:03.860
<v Speaker 1>the Docker file as we did previously with

00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:05.620
<v Speaker 1>with Git library.

00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:08.500
<v Speaker 1>We would add few control and helm

00:57:10.065 --> 00:57:11.985
<v Speaker 1>as part of your Docker file. If you

00:57:11.985 --> 00:57:14.705
<v Speaker 1>say, this is a really common case, and

00:57:14.705 --> 00:57:16.625
<v Speaker 1>I know there is this, you know,

00:57:16.945 --> 00:57:19.345
<v Speaker 1>detection mechanism and get what I wanna contribute

00:57:19.345 --> 00:57:22.385
<v Speaker 1>to that. Of course, the Gitpod is open

00:57:22.385 --> 00:57:24.930
<v Speaker 1>source. So if you go to GitHub, Gitpod

00:57:24.930 --> 00:57:26.050
<v Speaker 1>IO Gitpod,

00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:27.730
<v Speaker 1>which is a repository,

00:57:28.290 --> 00:57:30.690
<v Speaker 1>and you can, you know, look whether there's

00:57:30.690 --> 00:57:33.890
<v Speaker 1>an feature request around this already or you

00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:35.890
<v Speaker 1>file one and then set indicate

00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:39.165
<v Speaker 1>you wanna contribute to us, and we we

00:57:39.165 --> 00:57:41.005
<v Speaker 1>can see whether that fits the scope of

00:57:41.005 --> 00:57:41.885
<v Speaker 1>the project

00:57:42.205 --> 00:57:44.205
<v Speaker 1>and and where to best to make to

00:57:44.205 --> 00:57:45.325
<v Speaker 1>the contribution.

00:57:46.045 --> 00:57:47.965
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I guess what I was

00:57:48.445 --> 00:57:50.125
<v Speaker 0>more I guess what I was curious about

00:57:50.125 --> 00:57:52.850
<v Speaker 0>was, like, you know, if I come here,

00:57:53.010 --> 00:57:57.010
<v Speaker 0>for instance, and I add the Gitpod.YAML

00:57:57.650 --> 00:57:58.290
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm.

00:57:58.850 --> 00:58:01.730
<v Speaker 0>You know, when we added that custom Dockerfile,

00:58:01.730 --> 00:58:03.970
<v Speaker 0>really all we did I can't remember the

00:58:03.970 --> 00:58:06.245
<v Speaker 0>exact syntax, so, you know but roughly, we

00:58:06.245 --> 00:58:07.765
<v Speaker 0>said, hey. There's this image

00:58:08.005 --> 00:58:09.845
<v Speaker 0>which is built from this file. Can I

00:58:09.845 --> 00:58:11.205
<v Speaker 0>just tell it to use

00:58:11.525 --> 00:58:13.125
<v Speaker 0>say, published some

00:58:13.285 --> 00:58:15.525
<v Speaker 0>Gitpod images called Helm

00:58:15.845 --> 00:58:17.365
<v Speaker 0>and tell people, hey? If you if you

00:58:17.365 --> 00:58:18.839
<v Speaker 0>want to add a Gitpod YAML to your

00:58:18.839 --> 00:58:20.599
<v Speaker 0>project, then use this image and it'll come

00:58:20.599 --> 00:58:21.880
<v Speaker 0>with all the tools that you need for

00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:24.599
<v Speaker 0>Helm, you know, rather than all these other

00:58:24.599 --> 00:58:27.480
<v Speaker 0>developers also adding their own Gitpod Dockerfile,

00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:29.880
<v Speaker 0>you know, providing maybe some semantics around that,

00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:30.279
<v Speaker 0>I guess.

00:58:31.635 --> 00:58:32.595
<v Speaker 1>So Yeah.

00:58:32.995 --> 00:58:34.835
<v Speaker 1>Of course, you can do that. Like and

00:58:34.835 --> 00:58:36.995
<v Speaker 1>and also and we have this, you know,

00:58:37.715 --> 00:58:39.155
<v Speaker 1>docker images

00:58:39.155 --> 00:58:39.955
<v Speaker 1>repository

00:58:39.955 --> 00:58:42.995
<v Speaker 1>where we maintain those that were proposed when

00:58:42.995 --> 00:58:44.515
<v Speaker 1>you, you know, earlier used to set up

00:58:44.515 --> 00:58:46.830
<v Speaker 1>with it. There were a list of files

00:58:46.830 --> 00:58:49.230
<v Speaker 1>or docker images that were proposed. Right? Workspace

00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:50.990
<v Speaker 1>full, but also the one with VNC or

00:58:50.990 --> 00:58:53.870
<v Speaker 1>different databases and so on. Those are maintained

00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:56.190
<v Speaker 1>in an open source repository,

00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:59.870
<v Speaker 1>and there are some some more, you know,

00:58:59.870 --> 00:59:02.795
<v Speaker 1>there are for very typical setups,

00:59:03.434 --> 00:59:04.234
<v Speaker 1>then

00:59:04.234 --> 00:59:05.675
<v Speaker 1>it might make sense. Yeah.

00:59:06.555 --> 00:59:07.675
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Perfect.

00:59:08.795 --> 00:59:09.515
<v Speaker 0>So

00:59:09.755 --> 00:59:11.915
<v Speaker 0>let me ask another question then.

00:59:12.075 --> 00:59:14.555
<v Speaker 0>Do you use Gitpod to build Gitpod?

00:59:16.210 --> 00:59:17.410
<v Speaker 2>Sure. We

00:59:19.170 --> 00:59:21.090
<v Speaker 2>and we have done so for for quite

00:59:21.090 --> 00:59:22.530
<v Speaker 2>a long time at this point.

00:59:24.210 --> 00:59:25.570
<v Speaker 2>Two years easy.

00:59:26.370 --> 00:59:29.090
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Does your Gitpod have a Docker compose

00:59:29.090 --> 00:59:30.770
<v Speaker 0>file or should I throw one together in

00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:33.605
<v Speaker 0>this project? No. Okay. Let's throw one together

00:59:33.605 --> 00:59:36.005
<v Speaker 2>in here. Okay. And then alright. So we'll

00:59:36.005 --> 00:59:37.525
<v Speaker 0>do that just so we had a question

00:59:37.525 --> 00:59:39.045
<v Speaker 0>about how that would work. So I show

00:59:39.045 --> 00:59:41.285
<v Speaker 0>that and then we can open get pod

00:59:41.285 --> 00:59:43.125
<v Speaker 0>and get pod and then I think that's

00:59:43.125 --> 00:59:45.205
<v Speaker 0>a pretty good overview of of what get

00:59:45.205 --> 00:59:46.805
<v Speaker 0>pod is and how it makes developers lives

00:59:46.805 --> 00:59:48.270
<v Speaker 0>better. So

00:59:49.470 --> 00:59:50.430
<v Speaker 0>let's see.

00:59:52.750 --> 00:59:54.350
<v Speaker 0>Sure. I can remember how to build one

00:59:54.350 --> 00:59:55.870
<v Speaker 0>of these things. So

00:59:58.750 --> 01:00:01.310
<v Speaker 0>let's just do

01:00:00.335 --> 01:00:03.135
<v Speaker 0>engine x. Assume we're gonna run that,

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:05.775
<v Speaker 0>and I can just add the ports.

01:00:07.214 --> 01:00:08.015
<v Speaker 0>And

01:00:08.015 --> 01:00:09.615
<v Speaker 0>I'll add one more.

01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:13.870
<v Speaker 0>I see I can remember how to do

01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:15.550
<v Speaker 0>it, then I would get it wrong. Okay.

01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:17.710
<v Speaker 0>Let's add something with PHP.

01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:20.590
<v Speaker 0>Put it in CLI image.

01:00:22.110 --> 01:00:23.790
<v Speaker 0>So this is a really

01:00:24.030 --> 01:00:26.830
<v Speaker 0>simple and contrived over a compose file. I

01:00:26.830 --> 01:00:28.190
<v Speaker 0>mean, that's just a little bit bigger.

01:00:29.205 --> 01:00:31.045
<v Speaker 0>Let's close this down just now.

01:00:33.525 --> 01:00:35.605
<v Speaker 0>We do have access to Docker Compose and

01:00:35.605 --> 01:00:36.805
<v Speaker 0>the workspace fill

01:00:36.965 --> 01:00:37.605
<v Speaker 0>image.

01:00:38.085 --> 01:00:38.805
<v Speaker 2>Correct.

01:00:39.285 --> 01:00:40.805
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing you would wanna do

01:00:40.805 --> 01:00:42.885
<v Speaker 2>is actually start the the Docker daemon.

01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:46.030
<v Speaker 2>And this is still a preview feature, so,

01:00:46.030 --> 01:00:47.869
<v Speaker 2>you know, we're still flushing out the UX,

01:00:47.869 --> 01:00:50.430
<v Speaker 2>and it was important to give people access

01:00:50.430 --> 01:00:52.350
<v Speaker 2>to this as soon as possible.

01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:55.310
<v Speaker 2>For now, to start the Docker daemon, you

01:00:55.310 --> 01:00:56.430
<v Speaker 2>type sudo

01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:57.950
<v Speaker 2>docker minus up,

01:00:59.675 --> 01:01:01.115
<v Speaker 2>and that will do the rest.

01:01:03.915 --> 01:01:05.515
<v Speaker 2>And that just started the

01:01:06.235 --> 01:01:07.595
<v Speaker 2>the docker daemon now.

01:01:08.555 --> 01:01:11.675
<v Speaker 0>Okay. How do I open a new channel?

01:01:11.675 --> 01:01:12.155
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:14.710
<v Speaker 0>And would I just work with my standard

01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:16.150
<v Speaker 0>tooling normally? So I would just run a

01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:18.230
<v Speaker 0>docker compose up here. Yep.

01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:21.829
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. We don't it doesn't matter if that

01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:23.670
<v Speaker 0>container exits. It's not really important.

01:01:28.985 --> 01:01:31.625
<v Speaker 0>It's pretty quick at downloading the images, benefits

01:01:31.625 --> 01:01:32.505
<v Speaker 0>of cloud.

01:01:35.465 --> 01:01:37.305
<v Speaker 0>And my connection's not that fast, so that's

01:01:37.305 --> 01:01:37.705
<v Speaker 0>pretty cool.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:43.800
<v Speaker 0>You said that the the start of the

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:46.120
<v Speaker 0>episode, this is just running as a Kubernetes

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:46.840
<v Speaker 0>pod?

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:49.000
<v Speaker 2>That is correct. Yes.

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:51.400
<v Speaker 2>So the

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:52.920
<v Speaker 2>Gitpod as a whole

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:55.880
<v Speaker 2>so now it did the Docker compose up

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:57.800
<v Speaker 2>and recognized that there's something running.

01:01:59.855 --> 01:02:01.615
<v Speaker 2>And and the status bar where it says

01:02:01.615 --> 01:02:03.295
<v Speaker 2>port, if you click that again, then you'll

01:02:03.295 --> 01:02:04.655
<v Speaker 2>find a button where you can

01:02:05.055 --> 01:02:06.575
<v Speaker 2>exactly open browser.

01:02:07.295 --> 01:02:07.855
<v Speaker 2>There you go.

01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:13.140
<v Speaker 0>So, I mean, that's just

01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:16.660
<v Speaker 0>that's just my native dev workflow. Like, you

01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:18.980
<v Speaker 0>know, that could be you know, I've added

01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:19.780
<v Speaker 0>PHP,

01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:21.780
<v Speaker 0>but this could be MySQL.

01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:24.180
<v Speaker 0>It could be any it could be Postgres,

01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:24.579
<v Speaker 0>MongoDB.

01:02:25.194 --> 01:02:27.275
<v Speaker 0>My application would just be configured to speak

01:02:27.275 --> 01:02:29.195
<v Speaker 0>on local host like in any other

01:02:29.914 --> 01:02:31.915
<v Speaker 0>other setup. There's nothing particularly

01:02:33.275 --> 01:02:35.275
<v Speaker 0>it it doesn't change anything, which I like.

01:02:35.275 --> 01:02:37.115
<v Speaker 0>Like, all my native tooling is still the

01:02:37.115 --> 01:02:39.835
<v Speaker 0>exact same, only I'm using someone else's computer,

01:02:39.835 --> 01:02:42.390
<v Speaker 0>which which is a nice benefit. Which you

01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:44.070
<v Speaker 2>don't have to set up. Which you don't

01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:46.070
<v Speaker 0>have to set up. Exactly. Yeah.

01:02:46.869 --> 01:02:48.310
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:51.190
<v Speaker 0>It was just too easy.

01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:55.510
<v Speaker 0>I'm very impressed. I I I like it.

01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:55.830
<v Speaker 0>It's just,

01:02:56.685 --> 01:02:58.205
<v Speaker 0>you know, I don't feel like I've been

01:02:58.285 --> 01:02:59.965
<v Speaker 0>there's not been any friction. There's not been

01:02:59.965 --> 01:03:02.845
<v Speaker 0>frustrating. I've just clicked I mean and the

01:03:02.845 --> 01:03:04.525
<v Speaker 0>fact that I can just use Gitpod.io as

01:03:04.525 --> 01:03:07.165
<v Speaker 0>a prefix on any repository and pull request

01:03:07.405 --> 01:03:09.405
<v Speaker 0>is is very very cool. You've definitely put

01:03:09.405 --> 01:03:10.765
<v Speaker 0>a lot of effort into the kind of

01:03:10.765 --> 01:03:12.569
<v Speaker 0>user experience here and I think that changed

01:03:12.569 --> 01:03:14.250
<v Speaker 0>too. So great job.

01:03:15.049 --> 01:03:15.609
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:03:15.930 --> 01:03:18.410
<v Speaker 0>Let's do our if there's any more questions

01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:20.569
<v Speaker 0>or anything that you wanna understand about Gitpod,

01:03:20.569 --> 01:03:21.849
<v Speaker 0>feel free to drop them in the comments.

01:03:21.849 --> 01:03:24.170
<v Speaker 0>We'll open up the Gitpod repository now.

01:03:24.705 --> 01:03:26.865
<v Speaker 0>And I'm assuming it's just gonna work as

01:03:26.865 --> 01:03:28.865
<v Speaker 0>well, but still be fun to do. So

01:03:28.865 --> 01:03:31.665
<v Speaker 0>do you host the Gitpod source code on

01:03:31.665 --> 01:03:34.545
<v Speaker 0>GitHub, GitLab, or somewhere else or both?

01:03:36.065 --> 01:03:37.425
<v Speaker 1>It is GitHub.

01:03:37.425 --> 01:03:37.985
<v Speaker 0>GitHub.

01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:39.390
<v Speaker 1>Currently.

01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:44.190
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's pop over.

01:03:45.069 --> 01:03:46.430
<v Speaker 0>Gitpod.io.

01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Right.

01:03:53.984 --> 01:03:56.545
<v Speaker 0>And we'll add a prefix.

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:11.560
<v Speaker 0>So would you say this is the best

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:14.520
<v Speaker 0>example of a project configured for Gitpod usage?

01:04:16.855 --> 01:04:17.974
<v Speaker 1>For ourselves,

01:04:17.974 --> 01:04:20.055
<v Speaker 1>probably. But for people who are not so

01:04:20.055 --> 01:04:21.734
<v Speaker 1>involved in it, I guess,

01:04:22.694 --> 01:04:25.095
<v Speaker 1>it's good. Like, examples are pretty good if

01:04:25.095 --> 01:04:26.694
<v Speaker 1>they, you know, get out of the way

01:04:26.694 --> 01:04:28.454
<v Speaker 1>and show off, you know, the thing you

01:04:28.454 --> 01:04:31.180
<v Speaker 1>really wanna show. So I like, for instance,

01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:32.220
<v Speaker 1>stuff like these,

01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:32.940
<v Speaker 1>the

01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:35.340
<v Speaker 1>pet clinic project or to do this typical

01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:37.260
<v Speaker 1>to do apps that have this,

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:40.540
<v Speaker 1>you know, conflict. Everyone knows the problem and

01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:42.460
<v Speaker 1>everyone knows what's going on there, but then

01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:44.555
<v Speaker 1>you have still, like, this configuration with the

01:04:44.555 --> 01:04:47.674
<v Speaker 1>database and app servers. And the really good

01:04:47.674 --> 01:04:48.715
<v Speaker 1>real world

01:04:49.115 --> 01:04:51.515
<v Speaker 1>configuration is also the GitLab

01:04:52.075 --> 01:04:53.355
<v Speaker 1>project itself.

01:04:53.355 --> 01:04:55.595
<v Speaker 1>Like, you know, GitLab or GitLab

01:04:56.170 --> 01:04:58.250
<v Speaker 1>is using Gitpod for development.

01:04:59.210 --> 01:05:01.290
<v Speaker 1>And so that configuration

01:05:01.290 --> 01:05:03.610
<v Speaker 1>is also like, that's a that's a huge

01:05:03.610 --> 01:05:04.890
<v Speaker 1>project, and there is

01:05:05.530 --> 01:05:08.090
<v Speaker 1>you know, the configuration is is not

01:05:08.385 --> 01:05:10.785
<v Speaker 1>very simple. It's pretty involved.

01:05:13.345 --> 01:05:16.305
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So I'm sorry, Nico. Sorry.

01:05:16.705 --> 01:05:18.225
<v Speaker 0>Good thing to show here now is the

01:05:18.385 --> 01:05:20.705
<v Speaker 2>in the terminal in in both terminals,

01:05:20.865 --> 01:05:22.865
<v Speaker 2>So we had tasks running in parallel originally.

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:25.000
<v Speaker 2>You see this this message,

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:28.039
<v Speaker 2>this task ran as part of a workspace

01:05:28.039 --> 01:05:28.920
<v Speaker 2>prebuild.

01:05:30.359 --> 01:05:32.359
<v Speaker 2>And what that basically means is that, you

01:05:32.359 --> 01:05:35.079
<v Speaker 2>know, all the code in this workspace has

01:05:35.079 --> 01:05:37.800
<v Speaker 2>already been built. Dependencies have been downloaded.

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:38.839
<v Speaker 2>You're ready to go.

01:05:39.535 --> 01:05:41.215
<v Speaker 2>So I'm always quite happy when I see

01:05:41.215 --> 01:05:43.215
<v Speaker 2>that banana because it basically tells me I

01:05:43.215 --> 01:05:44.255
<v Speaker 2>don't have to go and get a coffee

01:05:44.255 --> 01:05:44.815
<v Speaker 2>now.

01:05:46.095 --> 01:05:47.775
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's like that x k c d

01:05:47.775 --> 01:05:50.015
<v Speaker 0>comic where it's like, it's compiling. No. Sorry.

01:05:50.015 --> 01:05:52.175
<v Speaker 0>We've done that in advance. Stop slacking off.

01:05:54.175 --> 01:05:54.815
<v Speaker 0>So

01:05:55.055 --> 01:05:56.550
<v Speaker 0>two things that jumped out at me with

01:05:56.550 --> 01:05:58.310
<v Speaker 0>this repository. One,

01:05:58.390 --> 01:06:00.550
<v Speaker 0>the theme I installed in the last repository

01:06:00.550 --> 01:06:02.150
<v Speaker 0>is is now seems to be global for

01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.710
<v Speaker 0>my

01:06:03.110 --> 01:06:05.910
<v Speaker 0>my set my other experience. So I'm assuming

01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:07.670
<v Speaker 0>all my keyboard shortcuts and stuff like that

01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:09.270
<v Speaker 0>are all just gonna transfer between, which is

01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:09.670
<v Speaker 0>really cool.

01:06:10.395 --> 01:06:12.715
<v Speaker 0>I also noticed that this opened two terminals

01:06:12.715 --> 01:06:14.795
<v Speaker 0>say by say, is this something you've configured

01:06:14.795 --> 01:06:17.755
<v Speaker 0>in the Gitpod YAML or is this yeah.

01:06:17.755 --> 01:06:18.315
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

01:06:18.955 --> 01:06:20.235
<v Speaker 0>Let's take a look at it then.

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.200
<v Speaker 0>Is this a mono repo?

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:26.320
<v Speaker 2>Yes.

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:29.040
<v Speaker 0>Good. I was gonna ask you a question

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:30.320
<v Speaker 0>about mono repos.

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:31.760
<v Speaker 0>That's very

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.320
<v Speaker 0>handy. Alright. Let's drop this down

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.880
<v Speaker 0>and see what we've got in here. So

01:06:40.295 --> 01:06:42.775
<v Speaker 0>but a prebaked dev environment image hosted on

01:06:42.775 --> 01:06:43.815
<v Speaker 0>GCR.

01:06:44.935 --> 01:06:47.095
<v Speaker 0>I go to the workspace location and a

01:06:47.095 --> 01:06:48.295
<v Speaker 0>checkout location.

01:06:48.375 --> 01:06:49.974
<v Speaker 0>And there are a lot of ports.

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:54.200
<v Speaker 0>The tasks

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:57.880
<v Speaker 0>we've not seen the before syntax yet. Is

01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:00.119
<v Speaker 0>that just like good runs before the edit

01:07:00.119 --> 01:07:01.160
<v Speaker 0>command itself?

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:05.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. So the what the before does is

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:06.920
<v Speaker 2>it runs before anything else,

01:07:07.575 --> 01:07:09.975
<v Speaker 2>and it does so independently of the

01:07:11.255 --> 01:07:13.655
<v Speaker 2>of the life cycle that Sven mentioned earlier.

01:07:13.655 --> 01:07:15.415
<v Speaker 2>So before will run-in

01:07:15.415 --> 01:07:17.095
<v Speaker 2>a prebuilt, but it will also run-in

01:07:18.775 --> 01:07:20.295
<v Speaker 2>not a prebuilt, like, if you start a

01:07:20.295 --> 01:07:20.855
<v Speaker 0>regular workspace.

01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:23.869
<v Speaker 0>Alright. And if you have multiple tasks, you

01:07:23.869 --> 01:07:25.549
<v Speaker 0>can just add this open mode to tell

01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:27.230
<v Speaker 0>to run-in a separate thing.

01:07:27.549 --> 01:07:29.470
<v Speaker 0>And there's a list of Versus code extensions,

01:07:29.470 --> 01:07:31.549
<v Speaker 0>which you think will make my life easier

01:07:31.549 --> 01:07:33.710
<v Speaker 0>here. So that's pretty cool too.

01:07:34.349 --> 01:07:36.190
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if this is

01:07:36.974 --> 01:07:38.414
<v Speaker 0>I I don't know if the conversations are

01:07:38.414 --> 01:07:41.055
<v Speaker 0>or whatnot, but, you know, Versus Code has

01:07:41.055 --> 01:07:41.935
<v Speaker 0>some sort of

01:07:42.974 --> 01:07:44.974
<v Speaker 0>fail like this. Is there any chance of

01:07:44.974 --> 01:07:47.134
<v Speaker 0>standardization there that I'd find this once and

01:07:47.134 --> 01:07:48.015
<v Speaker 0>it works on both,

01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:51.740
<v Speaker 0>know, Gitpod, the Versus Code, and and intelligent

01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:53.580
<v Speaker 0>products or whatever like that. Like,

01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:55.900
<v Speaker 0>do you see that being something that happens?

01:07:57.820 --> 01:07:58.700
<v Speaker 1>I I

01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:01.740
<v Speaker 1>guess so. Eventually, we see, like, you know,

01:08:02.085 --> 01:08:02.724
<v Speaker 1>how

01:08:02.964 --> 01:08:05.365
<v Speaker 1>what is commonly being used. But

01:08:06.244 --> 01:08:07.045
<v Speaker 1>given

01:08:07.205 --> 01:08:10.325
<v Speaker 1>that, you know, GitHub and and Microsoft have

01:08:10.325 --> 01:08:12.724
<v Speaker 1>a lot of reach and the dev container

01:08:12.724 --> 01:08:14.645
<v Speaker 1>format, and that's the format you are talking

01:08:14.645 --> 01:08:14.885
<v Speaker 1>about,

01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:17.699
<v Speaker 1>is pretty nicely designed.

01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:20.260
<v Speaker 1>So we have an our road map. Yeah.

01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:22.740
<v Speaker 1>The the plan to eventually support that. It's

01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:24.340
<v Speaker 1>not, you know, highest on the list, but

01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:26.580
<v Speaker 1>because also adoption is not really very

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:27.939
<v Speaker 1>interesting currently.

01:08:28.445 --> 01:08:30.685
<v Speaker 1>But I I assume this will change a

01:08:30.685 --> 01:08:33.325
<v Speaker 1>bit. So maybe q two, q '3 next

01:08:33.325 --> 01:08:36.445
<v Speaker 1>year, we'll have some sort of support for

01:08:36.445 --> 01:08:37.645
<v Speaker 1>this format as well.

01:08:38.205 --> 01:08:40.125
<v Speaker 1>It's important that, you know, here we have

01:08:40.125 --> 01:08:40.685
<v Speaker 1>some

01:08:40.925 --> 01:08:42.045
<v Speaker 1>some more, like,

01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:45.579
<v Speaker 1>some additional information that we would need in

01:08:45.579 --> 01:08:48.139
<v Speaker 1>order to do stuff like the preloads and

01:08:48.139 --> 01:08:50.300
<v Speaker 1>so on because that's not supported by by

01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:51.899
<v Speaker 1>the format from

01:08:51.899 --> 01:08:53.260
<v Speaker 1>from this code.

01:08:53.979 --> 01:08:55.899
<v Speaker 1>But it would be a great start, and

01:08:55.899 --> 01:08:57.579
<v Speaker 1>it would make it super easy for people

01:08:57.579 --> 01:09:01.545
<v Speaker 1>to start the Gitpod workspace for repositories

01:09:01.545 --> 01:09:03.145
<v Speaker 1>that have the dev container

01:09:03.145 --> 01:09:04.665
<v Speaker 1>format for sure.

01:09:05.225 --> 01:09:06.104
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

01:09:07.145 --> 01:09:08.905
<v Speaker 0>As I mentioned to add, like, I wanted

01:09:08.905 --> 01:09:10.505
<v Speaker 1>to add one thing to the thing you

01:09:10.505 --> 01:09:13.790
<v Speaker 1>mentioned before, David, regarding, like, your theme is

01:09:13.790 --> 01:09:15.229
<v Speaker 1>now on every workspace.

01:09:15.550 --> 01:09:17.470
<v Speaker 1>This is because you install that

01:09:17.710 --> 01:09:19.710
<v Speaker 1>as a user. I'm not sure if you

01:09:19.710 --> 01:09:20.670
<v Speaker 1>remember.

01:09:20.670 --> 01:09:22.270
<v Speaker 1>It was asked whether you wanna install it

01:09:22.270 --> 01:09:24.030
<v Speaker 1>on a workspace or a producer,

01:09:25.230 --> 01:09:26.955
<v Speaker 1>and installing things for user makes a lot

01:09:26.955 --> 01:09:29.194
<v Speaker 1>of sense. These extensions here

01:09:29.755 --> 01:09:32.554
<v Speaker 1>sorry. These extensions here are installed for workspaces.

01:09:32.554 --> 01:09:33.994
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's shared within,

01:09:34.234 --> 01:09:36.314
<v Speaker 1>you know, the Gitpod demo and then with

01:09:36.314 --> 01:09:37.755
<v Speaker 1>the with the with the entire team.

01:09:39.290 --> 01:09:40.970
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I thought I remember the the pop

01:09:40.970 --> 01:09:42.170
<v Speaker 0>up. It said, do you want to make

01:09:42.170 --> 01:09:43.850
<v Speaker 0>us a workspace

01:09:43.850 --> 01:09:46.010
<v Speaker 0>extension or user extension? I had to select

01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:48.569
<v Speaker 0>user because I was don't wanna force my

01:09:48.569 --> 01:09:50.810
<v Speaker 0>theme on everyone else, I guess, that uses

01:09:50.810 --> 01:09:51.450
<v Speaker 0>this for j.

01:09:52.045 --> 01:09:53.965
<v Speaker 0>And is there anything we should show from

01:09:53.965 --> 01:09:56.125
<v Speaker 0>the Gitpod setup? Like, how does the mono

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:58.364
<v Speaker 0>repository stuff work here? Like, you know, I've

01:09:58.364 --> 01:10:00.045
<v Speaker 0>got maybe a part of it. Let's go.

01:10:00.045 --> 01:10:02.284
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming the UI is is TypeScript and

01:10:02.284 --> 01:10:04.284
<v Speaker 0>React. Like, how does this all work together?

01:10:06.250 --> 01:10:07.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. So the

01:10:08.250 --> 01:10:10.170
<v Speaker 2>the key challenge that we see is for

01:10:10.170 --> 01:10:12.330
<v Speaker 2>one that Go Please needs

01:10:12.810 --> 01:10:13.370
<v Speaker 2>each

01:10:13.690 --> 01:10:14.330
<v Speaker 2>Go

01:10:14.890 --> 01:10:17.290
<v Speaker 2>Go module to be its own workspace route.

01:10:18.065 --> 01:10:20.304
<v Speaker 2>So the way we set up the repository

01:10:20.304 --> 01:10:20.945
<v Speaker 2>is

01:10:21.665 --> 01:10:23.905
<v Speaker 2>on the components, we basically have the the,

01:10:23.905 --> 01:10:25.985
<v Speaker 2>you know, the components that make up this

01:10:25.985 --> 01:10:26.624
<v Speaker 2>project.

01:10:27.025 --> 01:10:29.665
<v Speaker 2>And they're a mix of TypeScript and Go,

01:10:30.270 --> 01:10:31.070
<v Speaker 2>And then

01:10:31.389 --> 01:10:34.190
<v Speaker 2>each Go component is its own Go module.

01:10:34.190 --> 01:10:36.109
<v Speaker 2>We don't have a root Go module,

01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:39.550
<v Speaker 2>and they're added as as workspace roots.

01:10:40.750 --> 01:10:43.230
<v Speaker 2>And that yeah. That's pretty much all there

01:10:43.230 --> 01:10:43.710
<v Speaker 2>is to it.

01:10:44.585 --> 01:10:45.705
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Awesome.

01:10:46.345 --> 01:10:48.185
<v Speaker 0>Is there anything that I should show here?

01:10:48.425 --> 01:10:48.985
<v Speaker 0>Or

01:10:49.945 --> 01:10:50.985
<v Speaker 0>is there anything

01:10:51.465 --> 01:10:53.545
<v Speaker 0>anything that we haven't covered so far about

01:10:53.545 --> 01:10:56.185
<v Speaker 0>the Gitpod configuration that you think is

01:10:56.505 --> 01:10:57.785
<v Speaker 0>is important to cover?

01:11:00.199 --> 01:11:03.159
<v Speaker 2>I mean, we could briefly show debugging.

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:05.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean, know, at the end of the

01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:06.840
<v Speaker 2>day, it works like you would expect it

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:07.479
<v Speaker 2>to work

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:10.360
<v Speaker 2>in in your local Versus code as well.

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:12.679
<v Speaker 2>But for exam you know, debugging go tests,

01:11:12.679 --> 01:11:13.479
<v Speaker 2>for example,

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:14.679
<v Speaker 2>works just the same way.

01:11:16.554 --> 01:11:18.554
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Actually, I think I've I've got that

01:11:18.554 --> 01:11:20.074
<v Speaker 0>vibe as we've been going through a a

01:11:20.074 --> 01:11:22.315
<v Speaker 0>few of the projects here. It's like, you're

01:11:22.315 --> 01:11:23.675
<v Speaker 0>not trying to change the way that people

01:11:23.675 --> 01:11:26.395
<v Speaker 0>work. Everything just all that experience that developers

01:11:26.395 --> 01:11:28.395
<v Speaker 0>have, they're they're continuing to use that even

01:11:28.395 --> 01:11:31.034
<v Speaker 0>though their environment has removed or moved to

01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:34.100
<v Speaker 0>to some sort of cloud compute. So and

01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:35.780
<v Speaker 0>that makes a lot of sense. Like, we

01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:38.020
<v Speaker 0>we you're probably not trying to rebuild people's

01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:40.100
<v Speaker 0>habits since they've got five years, ten years

01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:42.260
<v Speaker 0>of experience of working with their tools. Awesome.

01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:43.460
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:11:44.494 --> 01:11:46.574
<v Speaker 0>I'll just unshare my screen. Maybe we could

01:11:46.574 --> 01:11:48.815
<v Speaker 0>start to wrap up and talk about the

01:11:48.815 --> 01:11:51.454
<v Speaker 0>the roadmap for Gitpod, what's coming next. I'm

01:11:51.454 --> 01:11:53.054
<v Speaker 0>also really curious about

01:11:54.014 --> 01:11:54.655
<v Speaker 0>the

01:11:54.815 --> 01:11:57.295
<v Speaker 0>the pricing. Like, I've not paid anything. I've

01:11:57.295 --> 01:11:58.655
<v Speaker 0>not given you any card details. All of

01:11:58.655 --> 01:11:59.375
<v Speaker 0>this is just

01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:00.699
<v Speaker 0>free.

01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:02.539
<v Speaker 0>How does that work?

01:12:07.099 --> 01:12:08.300
<v Speaker 1>How does it work?

01:12:09.179 --> 01:12:12.699
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It is we like, Gitpod is available

01:12:12.699 --> 01:12:14.940
<v Speaker 1>as a Gitpod IO, which is SaaS service.

01:12:15.594 --> 01:12:18.235
<v Speaker 1>And and then also there is this Gitpod

01:12:18.235 --> 01:12:20.554
<v Speaker 1>is open source, so you can also self

01:12:20.554 --> 01:12:23.114
<v Speaker 1>host it on your own Kubernetes clusters. And

01:12:23.355 --> 01:12:26.235
<v Speaker 1>for the self hosted version, there is the

01:12:26.235 --> 01:12:28.155
<v Speaker 1>possibility to, you know,

01:12:28.395 --> 01:12:30.875
<v Speaker 1>unlock certain features with an enterprise license.

01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:33.830
<v Speaker 1>We try to keep everything that is very,

01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:36.389
<v Speaker 1>you know, developer specific in open source and

01:12:36.389 --> 01:12:38.630
<v Speaker 1>everything that is more, you know, important for

01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:43.270
<v Speaker 1>larger teams or even companies, managers, and so

01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:45.335
<v Speaker 1>on. We would put into the

01:12:45.895 --> 01:12:47.335
<v Speaker 1>the enterprise license.

01:12:48.135 --> 01:12:50.775
<v Speaker 1>Forget about IO. We have a freemium subscription.

01:12:50.775 --> 01:12:53.335
<v Speaker 1>We want to support the open source development.

01:12:53.335 --> 01:12:55.735
<v Speaker 1>Also, we see this as,

01:12:56.695 --> 01:12:59.550
<v Speaker 1>you know, kind of a bit different way

01:12:59.550 --> 01:13:00.830
<v Speaker 1>of developing,

01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:03.550
<v Speaker 1>like, special especially with automating

01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:05.950
<v Speaker 1>and having these ephemeral dev environments and so

01:13:05.950 --> 01:13:06.430
<v Speaker 1>on.

01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:09.150
<v Speaker 1>So it is really a good opportunity to,

01:13:09.150 --> 01:13:11.790
<v Speaker 1>you know, lower the friction for open source

01:13:11.790 --> 01:13:12.430
<v Speaker 1>contributors.

01:13:13.565 --> 01:13:16.205
<v Speaker 1>So this is kind of a really important

01:13:16.205 --> 01:13:17.244
<v Speaker 1>thing to

01:13:17.885 --> 01:13:21.005
<v Speaker 1>have a good freemium subscription so that it

01:13:21.005 --> 01:13:23.645
<v Speaker 1>can be used in these scenarios easily and

01:13:23.645 --> 01:13:25.645
<v Speaker 1>people see and understand the value.

01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:29.270
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, eventually, we might need to make

01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:31.110
<v Speaker 1>some money also, of course. But

01:13:32.710 --> 01:13:33.669
<v Speaker 1>currently,

01:13:33.909 --> 01:13:35.989
<v Speaker 1>you know, the focus is really on solving

01:13:35.989 --> 01:13:37.670
<v Speaker 1>this problem for the developer community.

01:13:38.805 --> 01:13:39.844
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Definitely.

01:13:40.324 --> 01:13:42.485
<v Speaker 0>Can I use Gitpod on the free plan

01:13:42.485 --> 01:13:44.885
<v Speaker 0>with private repositories, or is that where the

01:13:44.885 --> 01:13:46.885
<v Speaker 0>the kind of the paying comes in?

01:13:47.525 --> 01:13:49.925
<v Speaker 1>You can use it for one month in

01:13:49.925 --> 01:13:50.724
<v Speaker 1>a trial,

01:13:51.445 --> 01:13:53.925
<v Speaker 1>but then after that, the paying comes in.

01:13:53.925 --> 01:13:54.165
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:57.500
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Awesome. And and what about the the

01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.660
<v Speaker 0>road map then? What what are what are

01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:00.780
<v Speaker 0>the team working on?

01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Besides those features we that are just currently

01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:11.665
<v Speaker 1>released in preview, like having Versus code as

01:14:11.665 --> 01:14:14.145
<v Speaker 1>well as the and also the

01:14:15.105 --> 01:14:17.185
<v Speaker 1>the pseudo and root support.

01:14:18.545 --> 01:14:20.225
<v Speaker 1>We need to flash that out

01:14:20.545 --> 01:14:23.770
<v Speaker 1>some more. We have a feature that Chris

01:14:23.770 --> 01:14:26.090
<v Speaker 1>built actually a couple of months ago already,

01:14:26.090 --> 01:14:28.810
<v Speaker 1>which is not entirely rolled out called full

01:14:28.810 --> 01:14:31.530
<v Speaker 1>workspace backup. That means, currently, we have a

01:14:31.530 --> 01:14:34.250
<v Speaker 1>certain volume, which is a workspace folder.

01:14:34.330 --> 01:14:35.850
<v Speaker 1>That is the stuff that we would back

01:14:35.850 --> 01:14:37.850
<v Speaker 1>up between the the Gitpod sessions.

01:14:38.844 --> 01:14:41.244
<v Speaker 1>With the new version, everything gets back up.

01:14:41.244 --> 01:14:43.405
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter where you have installed that.

01:14:44.525 --> 01:14:47.244
<v Speaker 1>We have some other, like, very exciting features,

01:14:47.244 --> 01:14:49.804
<v Speaker 1>the SSH access, which will allow to use

01:14:49.804 --> 01:14:52.445
<v Speaker 1>code remote SSH and also what Jetpod is

01:14:52.445 --> 01:14:55.320
<v Speaker 1>working on to connect with the pod workspaces

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:58.440
<v Speaker 1>so you can even use your desktop IDE

01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:00.760
<v Speaker 1>in in together with the pod.

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:04.280
<v Speaker 1>The collaborative editing

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:06.520
<v Speaker 1>feature mentioned

01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:07.320
<v Speaker 1>before

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:08.199
<v Speaker 1>is important.

01:15:09.585 --> 01:15:11.025
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure, Chris.

01:15:11.665 --> 01:15:12.704
<v Speaker 1>I guess I

01:15:13.265 --> 01:15:15.265
<v Speaker 1>provided about a few things in the road

01:15:15.265 --> 01:15:15.824
<v Speaker 1>map.

01:15:17.265 --> 01:15:18.545
<v Speaker 2>I think for the

01:15:19.025 --> 01:15:21.105
<v Speaker 2>upcoming time, that's that's it. So,

01:15:22.190 --> 01:15:24.990
<v Speaker 2>we're also the the self hosted version that

01:15:24.990 --> 01:15:26.110
<v Speaker 2>mentioned,

01:15:26.430 --> 01:15:29.470
<v Speaker 2>we have convenient installers for those, you know,

01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:31.230
<v Speaker 2>that make it easy to to install them

01:15:31.230 --> 01:15:33.230
<v Speaker 2>on on GKE and AWS.

01:15:33.710 --> 01:15:36.110
<v Speaker 2>And we're looking into, you know, improving those,

01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:37.070
<v Speaker 2>making those more stable,

01:15:39.215 --> 01:15:41.135
<v Speaker 2>baking in more and more Terraform support on

01:15:41.135 --> 01:15:41.935
<v Speaker 2>that end.

01:15:42.255 --> 01:15:43.775
<v Speaker 2>So also from that side,

01:15:45.135 --> 01:15:46.415
<v Speaker 2>we're working on that.

01:15:47.855 --> 01:15:48.495
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

01:15:48.735 --> 01:15:50.255
<v Speaker 0>Well, thank you very much for joining me

01:15:50.255 --> 01:15:52.760
<v Speaker 0>today. It's a really cool project. I'm I'm

01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:54.520
<v Speaker 0>hoping that it's gonna allow me to finally

01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:56.280
<v Speaker 0>migrate to use my Chromebook. I can see

01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:58.600
<v Speaker 0>even even beyond that on my Mac and

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:00.360
<v Speaker 0>on my Linux machines why I'd still prefer

01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:02.120
<v Speaker 0>this kind of environment as well. There's a

01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:03.000
<v Speaker 0>lot of benefits

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:05.665
<v Speaker 0>and consistency that can be adopted here. And

01:16:05.665 --> 01:16:07.425
<v Speaker 0>the pull request format was just basic on

01:16:07.425 --> 01:16:08.785
<v Speaker 0>the cake. I'm really happy with that as

01:16:08.785 --> 01:16:11.265
<v Speaker 0>well. Is there anything you would like to

01:16:11.265 --> 01:16:13.185
<v Speaker 0>say or share with us before we finish

01:16:13.185 --> 01:16:14.065
<v Speaker 0>up today?

01:16:14.385 --> 01:16:15.185
<v Speaker 0>Nope.

01:16:17.665 --> 01:16:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Thanks, David. That's what I wanna say.

01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:21.780
<v Speaker 1>Like, it's really nice to have this it

01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:23.860
<v Speaker 1>was also nice note having no preparation for

01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:26.020
<v Speaker 1>this session, but I also think it's it's

01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:27.860
<v Speaker 1>really good to have this spontaneous,

01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:31.380
<v Speaker 1>know, just talk about the product. Yeah. That's

01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:33.454
<v Speaker 1>good. Yeah. Some people love it. Some people

01:16:33.454 --> 01:16:35.375
<v Speaker 0>hate it. I'm glad you enjoyed it. I

01:16:35.375 --> 01:16:36.735
<v Speaker 0>I think we we had a really good

01:16:36.735 --> 01:16:38.014
<v Speaker 0>look at Gitpod here. I think it's a

01:16:38.014 --> 01:16:40.094
<v Speaker 0>really cool technology. I love that it's open

01:16:40.094 --> 01:16:42.414
<v Speaker 0>source as well. So, you know, great job.

01:16:42.895 --> 01:16:44.655
<v Speaker 0>Thanks again. I look forward to seeing what

01:16:44.655 --> 01:16:46.094
<v Speaker 0>happens in the future. And thanks again for

01:16:46.094 --> 01:16:48.100
