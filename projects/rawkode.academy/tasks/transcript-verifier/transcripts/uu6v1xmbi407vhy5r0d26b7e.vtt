00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.840
<v Speaker 0>I want to address something that we all

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.760
<v Speaker 0>know is bullshit.

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:08.559
<v Speaker 0>But we all see it anyway in order

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:10.160
<v Speaker 0>to get some contrived

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.120
<v Speaker 0>example

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.839
<v Speaker 0>across

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
<v Speaker 0>to whomever we're speaking with

00:00:14.555 --> 00:00:16.795
<v Speaker 0>about the power and flexibility

00:00:16.795 --> 00:00:18.315
<v Speaker 0>of adopting Kubernetes.

00:00:18.955 --> 00:00:21.355
<v Speaker 0>That the thing is the statement

00:00:21.515 --> 00:00:22.715
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes

00:00:22.795 --> 00:00:24.235
<v Speaker 0>gives us X,

00:00:24.555 --> 00:00:25.915
<v Speaker 0>Y and Z

00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:27.115
<v Speaker 0>for free.

00:00:28.315 --> 00:00:29.915
<v Speaker 0>Usually we'll claim

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.600
<v Speaker 0>that if you adopt enough Kubernetes

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.480
<v Speaker 0>convention

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.200
<v Speaker 0>that you will get scheduling

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.080
<v Speaker 0>for free.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.040
<v Speaker 0>You will get

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.400
<v Speaker 0>auto scaling,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.480
<v Speaker 0>service discovery,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.320
<v Speaker 0>centralized logging

00:00:46.185 --> 00:00:47.145
<v Speaker 0>for free.

00:00:49.785 --> 00:00:51.305
<v Speaker 0>And it's kind of true,

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:54.505
<v Speaker 0>but there's a caveat, a catch,

00:00:54.745 --> 00:00:55.465
<v Speaker 0>something

00:00:55.865 --> 00:00:57.225
<v Speaker 0>that we often forget.

00:00:59.465 --> 00:01:00.985
<v Speaker 0>So for the sake of this video,

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.910
<v Speaker 0>let's pretend that Kubernetes

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:04.950
<v Speaker 0>is Florida.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:07.430
<v Speaker 0>Sure.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.670
<v Speaker 0>When you're in Florida,

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.830
<v Speaker 0>you get sunshine for free.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.750
<v Speaker 0>When we're in Florida,

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.430
<v Speaker 0>we have access to beaches

00:01:15.695 --> 00:01:16.735
<v Speaker 0>for free.

00:01:18.255 --> 00:01:20.255
<v Speaker 0>And of course when we're in Florida

00:01:21.134 --> 00:01:23.055
<v Speaker 0>for a small fee or investment,

00:01:23.695 --> 00:01:24.895
<v Speaker 0>we have access

00:01:24.975 --> 00:01:26.015
<v Speaker 0>to golf,

00:01:26.575 --> 00:01:27.695
<v Speaker 0>jet skiing,

00:01:27.935 --> 00:01:28.575
<v Speaker 0>nightclubs

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.010
<v Speaker 0>and so forth.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.530
<v Speaker 0>And that all sounds amazing,

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.850
<v Speaker 0>but you have to be in Florida.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.850
<v Speaker 0>And you know what isn't free?

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.930
<v Speaker 0>Getting to Florida.

00:01:45.155 --> 00:01:46.915
<v Speaker 0>In order to get to Florida,

00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:49.075
<v Speaker 0>we have to plan it.

00:01:49.954 --> 00:01:52.435
<v Speaker 0>We have to convince our friends or family

00:01:52.435 --> 00:01:54.674
<v Speaker 0>that Florida is better than

00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:56.595
<v Speaker 0>California,

00:01:56.595 --> 00:01:57.395
<v Speaker 0>Sydney,

00:01:58.034 --> 00:01:58.595
<v Speaker 0>Tokyo.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.820
<v Speaker 0>And then we we need to pack.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.540
<v Speaker 0>We have to get to the airport.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.740
<v Speaker 0>We have to sit on a flight

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.260
<v Speaker 0>that can take us one hour,

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.140
<v Speaker 0>five hours,

00:02:13.755 --> 00:02:14.955
<v Speaker 0>fifteen hours.

00:02:15.595 --> 00:02:17.435
<v Speaker 0>All depends where you're coming from.

00:02:19.035 --> 00:02:19.755
<v Speaker 0>And then

00:02:20.635 --> 00:02:22.875
<v Speaker 0>we get there. We are in Florida.

00:02:23.194 --> 00:02:24.315
<v Speaker 0>We have access

00:02:24.555 --> 00:02:26.635
<v Speaker 0>to beautiful beaches and sunshine.

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.030
<v Speaker 0>And of course,

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.110
<v Speaker 0>even when we're in Florida,

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.110
<v Speaker 0>it's not all plain sailing.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.550
<v Speaker 0>You're sitting there with your

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:40.750
<v Speaker 0>margarita

00:02:41.265 --> 00:02:44.065
<v Speaker 0>by the beach enjoying the wonderful sunshine.

00:02:45.105 --> 00:02:46.944
<v Speaker 0>And you pick up a paper and you

00:02:46.944 --> 00:02:47.985
<v Speaker 0>read the headline.

00:02:48.305 --> 00:02:50.705
<v Speaker 0>Florida man uses host pad

00:02:50.865 --> 00:02:52.465
<v Speaker 0>for WordPress container.

00:02:53.905 --> 00:02:55.185
<v Speaker 0>So what's my point?

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:56.145
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.460
<v Speaker 0>is great and you get a lot of

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.580
<v Speaker 0>things for free

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.020
<v Speaker 0>after you paid the tax of adoption.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.300
<v Speaker 0>After

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 0>you've got to Kubernetes.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.340
<v Speaker 0>That journey is gonna be very different depending

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.114
<v Speaker 0>on how much legacy you have and how

00:03:12.114 --> 00:03:13.395
<v Speaker 0>much you need

00:03:13.635 --> 00:03:17.155
<v Speaker 0>to migrate from traditional infrastructure to Kubernetes.

00:03:18.355 --> 00:03:18.995
<v Speaker 0>So

00:03:19.155 --> 00:03:20.995
<v Speaker 0>while there's a lot of pros,

00:03:21.235 --> 00:03:22.754
<v Speaker 0>there's definitely some cons too.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 0>So with that being said, I'll wish you

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.209
<v Speaker 0>the best of luck with whatever journey or

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.810
<v Speaker 0>path you have ahead of you.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.410
<v Speaker 0>Please remember,

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 0>nothing is free.

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:36.450
<v Speaker 0>Enjoy Kubernetes.
