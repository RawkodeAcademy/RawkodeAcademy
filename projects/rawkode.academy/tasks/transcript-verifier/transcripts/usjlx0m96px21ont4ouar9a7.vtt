00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.450
<v Speaker 0>Hello, and welcome to today's episode of Rawkode

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.395
<v Speaker 0>Live. Today, we are taking a look at

00:01:05.395 --> 00:01:07.075
<v Speaker 0>some of the new features that are just

00:01:07.075 --> 00:01:09.875
<v Speaker 0>recently been released with Teleport version eight.

00:01:10.355 --> 00:01:12.435
<v Speaker 0>I'm your host today, David Flanagan. I don't

00:01:12.435 --> 00:01:13.955
<v Speaker 0>remember my name correctly this time, and you

00:01:13.955 --> 00:01:15.555
<v Speaker 0>may know me from across the Internet as

00:01:15.555 --> 00:01:15.955
<v Speaker 0>Rawkode.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.140
<v Speaker 0>As you might be able to tell, I'm

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.060
<v Speaker 0>in an an entirely new space doing a

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.979
<v Speaker 0>livestream on a five g router.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.220
<v Speaker 0>So let's see how this goes.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.780
<v Speaker 0>Today, I am very lucky to be joined

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.700
<v Speaker 0>by Steven Martin once again from the Teleport

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.060
<v Speaker 0>team. Hey, man. How's it going?

00:01:30.845 --> 00:01:32.765
<v Speaker 0>Oh, good. Doing really well.

00:01:33.565 --> 00:01:36.765
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Well, welcome back. Yeah. It's it's gonna

00:01:36.765 --> 00:01:38.125
<v Speaker 0>be fun. It's always nice to take a

00:01:38.125 --> 00:01:39.485
<v Speaker 0>look at some of the the things that

00:01:39.485 --> 00:01:41.405
<v Speaker 0>are happening with a Teleport. It's such a

00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:43.725
<v Speaker 0>a cool product that I literally use every

00:01:43.725 --> 00:01:45.670
<v Speaker 0>single week. So it's always a always good

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.110
<v Speaker 0>to sit down with someone over there and

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.030
<v Speaker 0>and cover some of the new shiny stuff.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.590
<v Speaker 0>For anyone who didn't see the last episode,

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.670
<v Speaker 0>could you maybe give us a small introduction

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.869
<v Speaker 0>to who you are?

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.030
<v Speaker 1>Sure. Yeah. And I'm I'm Steven Martin, solution

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.670
<v Speaker 1>engineering

00:02:00.055 --> 00:02:01.494
<v Speaker 1>manager here at Teleport.

00:02:01.734 --> 00:02:03.975
<v Speaker 1>Just coming up on my two years.

00:02:04.774 --> 00:02:06.534
<v Speaker 1>And for folks that aren't familiar,

00:02:06.695 --> 00:02:09.655
<v Speaker 1>you know, Teleport is a open source access

00:02:09.655 --> 00:02:11.255
<v Speaker 1>plane and certificate authority,

00:02:12.295 --> 00:02:13.815
<v Speaker 1>you know, for your infrastructure.

00:02:13.894 --> 00:02:14.695
<v Speaker 1>So, essentially,

00:02:15.095 --> 00:02:17.040
<v Speaker 1>you know, we make it a very secure

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.400
<v Speaker 1>way, passwordless approach to accessing your resources, whether

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.400
<v Speaker 1>that's SSH machines,

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.320
<v Speaker 1>web apps, Kubernetes,

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.120
<v Speaker 1>databases,

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.000
<v Speaker 1>and now with eight point o, Windows desktops.

00:02:29.615 --> 00:02:30.815
<v Speaker 0>Nice. Awesome.

00:02:32.255 --> 00:02:34.175
<v Speaker 0>So here's a question that I never gave

00:02:34.175 --> 00:02:35.695
<v Speaker 0>you upfront, and I'm gonna lump on you

00:02:35.695 --> 00:02:38.335
<v Speaker 0>now and and just see. Like, you you

00:02:38.335 --> 00:02:40.495
<v Speaker 0>use Teleport a lot. Right? Would that be

00:02:40.495 --> 00:02:41.775
<v Speaker 0>a fair assumption?

00:02:42.255 --> 00:02:44.015
<v Speaker 0>What's what's your what's your favorite feature?

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.930
<v Speaker 1>I

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.930
<v Speaker 1>think the part of it is the is

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:49.810
<v Speaker 1>the tunnel,

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.530
<v Speaker 1>the fact that I can have a machine

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.250
<v Speaker 1>available.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.730
<v Speaker 1>I I run some some of my own,

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.410
<v Speaker 1>you know, personal sites,

00:02:57.945 --> 00:02:59.385
<v Speaker 1>and I wanna get access to it. But

00:02:59.385 --> 00:03:01.625
<v Speaker 1>I'm I am concerned about open ports,

00:03:01.785 --> 00:03:03.625
<v Speaker 1>you know, and people being able to attack

00:03:03.625 --> 00:03:04.585
<v Speaker 1>those ports,

00:03:04.825 --> 00:03:06.665
<v Speaker 1>especially ones that I don't wanna expose all

00:03:06.665 --> 00:03:08.905
<v Speaker 1>the time. So the fact that I can

00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:11.865
<v Speaker 1>SSH into something or even provide other access,

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.280
<v Speaker 1>you know, without opening in a port

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.560
<v Speaker 1>because,

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.599
<v Speaker 1>you know, yes, you could try to try

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.840
<v Speaker 1>to do some firewalling and locking down,

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 1>but that gets hard, you know. Whereas this

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.239
<v Speaker 1>case, you know, you you can really restrict

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:25.560
<v Speaker 1>that more.

00:03:26.745 --> 00:03:29.785
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Definitely. It's a great feature for sure.

00:03:29.864 --> 00:03:31.864
<v Speaker 0>I think it reminds us the the ability

00:03:32.105 --> 00:03:33.705
<v Speaker 0>the capabilities to pair

00:03:33.864 --> 00:03:36.345
<v Speaker 0>either through the web GUI or the command

00:03:36.345 --> 00:03:38.780
<v Speaker 0>line client. Think those those are cool. I've

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 0>been able to debug something in real time

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.660
<v Speaker 0>with some colleagues, especially at our new remote

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.060
<v Speaker 0>first world. I think it's it's fantastic.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.700
<v Speaker 0>So what's new in Teleport eight?

00:03:51.825 --> 00:03:54.144
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. This is we we consider this, you

00:03:54.144 --> 00:03:55.425
<v Speaker 1>know, one of our largest

00:03:55.905 --> 00:03:56.784
<v Speaker 1>releases,

00:03:56.784 --> 00:03:57.745
<v Speaker 1>version eight.

00:03:58.465 --> 00:04:00.465
<v Speaker 1>First, the the one of the largest ones

00:04:00.465 --> 00:04:02.784
<v Speaker 1>that people have probably heard about is our

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:04.065
<v Speaker 1>Windows desktop access.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.390
<v Speaker 1>Now we're not providing, you know, an RDP

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.190
<v Speaker 1>protocol.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.350
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the one of the ways

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.270
<v Speaker 1>we're we're taking this is that we think

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.990
<v Speaker 1>the

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.350
<v Speaker 1>you know, and I'll be stepping through that

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.910
<v Speaker 1>shortly, you know, exactly how that works and

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:18.709
<v Speaker 1>example of it.

00:04:19.515 --> 00:04:22.235
<v Speaker 1>But using our web console, you know, folks

00:04:22.235 --> 00:04:25.355
<v Speaker 1>will be able to open up desktop interaction

00:04:25.675 --> 00:04:28.635
<v Speaker 1>to their current, you know, Windows machines.

00:04:29.115 --> 00:04:31.115
<v Speaker 1>Typically, you know, those are your your server

00:04:31.115 --> 00:04:31.835
<v Speaker 1>types,

00:04:32.395 --> 00:04:34.860
<v Speaker 1>like, 20 Windows 22

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.260
<v Speaker 1>22 data center

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.300
<v Speaker 1>and others even even back to 2012.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.340
<v Speaker 1>In addition, we are providing things like WebAuthn,

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.940
<v Speaker 1>you know, if you wanted to use your

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.419
<v Speaker 1>watch or in my case, I'm gonna use

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:48.380
<v Speaker 1>the the Touch ID.

00:04:49.245 --> 00:04:52.125
<v Speaker 1>Others like, you know, being able to auto

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:52.845
<v Speaker 1>find

00:04:53.645 --> 00:04:55.565
<v Speaker 1>r RDS machines,

00:04:55.805 --> 00:04:57.885
<v Speaker 1>whereas previously, you had to specifically

00:04:58.205 --> 00:05:00.925
<v Speaker 1>poke at it, or point at exactly.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.670
<v Speaker 1>Another is

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:04.390
<v Speaker 1>the

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.910
<v Speaker 1>ability to dynamically add apps and databases.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.110
<v Speaker 1>I'll I'll be showing a Grafano example today

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.510
<v Speaker 1>where you'll be able to directly

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.630
<v Speaker 1>say, okay. I want to deploy this application.

00:05:17.305 --> 00:05:20.264
<v Speaker 1>Here's its tag, and then an existing agent

00:05:20.264 --> 00:05:22.505
<v Speaker 1>will that has registered itself to run those

00:05:22.505 --> 00:05:24.985
<v Speaker 1>tags will automatically run it. So that's a

00:05:24.985 --> 00:05:26.905
<v Speaker 1>way of getting away from, you know, worrying

00:05:26.905 --> 00:05:29.145
<v Speaker 1>about, oh, I deployed. Did I set the

00:05:29.145 --> 00:05:31.940
<v Speaker 1>right YAML on that machine? But now you

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.820
<v Speaker 1>can just say deploy. Here's your tag, and

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.300
<v Speaker 1>it'll you know, kind of like Kubernetes automatically,

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.380
<v Speaker 1>you know, run on a particular agent.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.940
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Well, it sounds like you've got some

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.700
<v Speaker 0>amazing things to show us in the demo.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.940
<v Speaker 0>So we will get to that in just

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:46.385
<v Speaker 0>just a moment.

00:05:46.945 --> 00:05:48.465
<v Speaker 0>We have a a comment from Av and

00:05:48.465 --> 00:05:50.065
<v Speaker 0>Ash, which I'm gonna pop back up again

00:05:50.065 --> 00:05:51.905
<v Speaker 0>just saying that session recording has to be

00:05:51.905 --> 00:05:53.825
<v Speaker 0>everybody's favorite feature. I just I just Oh,

00:05:53.825 --> 00:05:54.625
<v Speaker 1>yeah. No. Yeah.

00:05:55.745 --> 00:05:57.185
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. No. Yeah. I definitely take that for

00:05:57.185 --> 00:05:57.505
<v Speaker 1>granted.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.080
<v Speaker 1>I think it's it's something where, you know,

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.920
<v Speaker 1>you wanna you wanna review, you know, what

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.520
<v Speaker 1>happened. And I look at that as, you

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.520
<v Speaker 1>know, it's great for auditing, but as a

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.600
<v Speaker 1>you know, often if you're a developer or

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.680
<v Speaker 1>someone who's looking back on, okay, what did

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.104
<v Speaker 1>I exactly run? Because, you know, control r

00:06:13.104 --> 00:06:14.465
<v Speaker 1>doesn't find everything right.

00:06:15.345 --> 00:06:16.945
<v Speaker 1>You know, I wanna look back at what

00:06:16.945 --> 00:06:18.785
<v Speaker 1>did I run, what order did I do

00:06:18.785 --> 00:06:20.865
<v Speaker 1>it, were there any errors, and you can

00:06:20.865 --> 00:06:22.945
<v Speaker 1>see it from that. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely.

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:27.500
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, shall we get your screen shared?

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.259
<v Speaker 0>Hop off the demo, and I'll do my

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:31.259
<v Speaker 0>best to throw loads of questions at you

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:33.100
<v Speaker 0>as we go through. Please.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.659
<v Speaker 0>Yep. There you go. You are now live.

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:40.615
<v Speaker 0>Take it away. Great. Thank you. So there's

00:06:40.615 --> 00:06:42.775
<v Speaker 1>a there's a bit of a space theme

00:06:42.775 --> 00:06:44.535
<v Speaker 1>going. I'm on moon,

00:06:44.935 --> 00:06:46.615
<v Speaker 1>teleportdemo.com,

00:06:46.615 --> 00:06:49.495
<v Speaker 1>and, you'll see some Apollos and Hercules,

00:06:49.895 --> 00:06:52.030
<v Speaker 1>as we go. So first off, let let's

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.190
<v Speaker 1>start, yeah, let's start with the Windows example.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.430
<v Speaker 1>So these are some

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.910
<v Speaker 1>particular two domains I have available. So that's

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.430
<v Speaker 1>one of the things is that you can

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.635
<v Speaker 1>hook on to multiple active directory domains.

00:07:06.035 --> 00:07:07.955
<v Speaker 1>It'll automatically bring in,

00:07:09.155 --> 00:07:10.675
<v Speaker 1>you know, the particular

00:07:12.835 --> 00:07:15.075
<v Speaker 1>tags, you know, for those machines.

00:07:15.555 --> 00:07:17.235
<v Speaker 1>I I went ahead and connected,

00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:19.590
<v Speaker 1>via desktop access here. You can see these

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.030
<v Speaker 1>running concurrently.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.430
<v Speaker 1>So I'm on, you know, one of the

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.750
<v Speaker 1>Apollo machines, and I'm also on, one of

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.910
<v Speaker 1>the Hercules. And it's just like regular, you

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.470
<v Speaker 1>know, RDP if you're used to interacting through

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:30.630
<v Speaker 1>that.

00:07:31.755 --> 00:07:33.435
<v Speaker 1>But the major difference is I came in

00:07:33.435 --> 00:07:34.475
<v Speaker 1>passwordlessly,

00:07:34.715 --> 00:07:37.035
<v Speaker 1>so I did not have to, you know,

00:07:37.035 --> 00:07:39.675
<v Speaker 1>provide a password password here, type it in,

00:07:39.675 --> 00:07:41.915
<v Speaker 1>or save it locally on my machine, you

00:07:41.915 --> 00:07:43.595
<v Speaker 1>know, which is what most of the RDP,

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.199
<v Speaker 1>you know, clients do is it gives you

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:48.199
<v Speaker 1>that option. But, you know, how secure is

00:07:48.199 --> 00:07:48.760
<v Speaker 1>that?

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.159
<v Speaker 1>You know, versus in our case and I'll

00:07:51.159 --> 00:07:52.360
<v Speaker 1>and I'll show in a minute, you know,

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.800
<v Speaker 1>how we're connecting in there.

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:56.599
<v Speaker 1>You know, user themselves do not have do

00:07:56.599 --> 00:07:57.479
<v Speaker 1>not have to supply

00:07:57.935 --> 00:08:00.415
<v Speaker 1>a password. But you do supply,

00:08:00.735 --> 00:08:02.335
<v Speaker 1>you know, case of the roles.

00:08:03.055 --> 00:08:03.935
<v Speaker 1>You would say,

00:08:05.055 --> 00:08:06.974
<v Speaker 1>you know, okay. Here's here's the labels you're

00:08:06.974 --> 00:08:09.535
<v Speaker 1>allowed to connect to and then what users,

00:08:09.615 --> 00:08:11.854
<v Speaker 1>it takes in my email. So that's how

00:08:11.854 --> 00:08:13.330
<v Speaker 1>it comes in with Steven. So you can

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.810
<v Speaker 1>see I'm connecting with my particular username, Steven,

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:18.050
<v Speaker 1>that's allowed to go in there.

00:08:19.169 --> 00:08:20.770
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Very cool.

00:08:22.289 --> 00:08:23.010
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.169
<v Speaker 1>And, right now, we have, you know, we

00:08:25.169 --> 00:08:26.930
<v Speaker 1>have the initial web and you you notice

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:28.210
<v Speaker 1>it's labeled preview

00:08:29.055 --> 00:08:31.055
<v Speaker 1>in that a couple of the major features

00:08:31.055 --> 00:08:33.695
<v Speaker 1>coming, you know, will be the session recording,

00:08:33.855 --> 00:08:36.174
<v Speaker 1>will be things like clipboard. You notice it

00:08:36.174 --> 00:08:38.015
<v Speaker 1>is in it is in the the web

00:08:38.015 --> 00:08:38.735
<v Speaker 1>browser.

00:08:39.054 --> 00:08:41.309
<v Speaker 1>And, again, that's because we don't think that

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:44.589
<v Speaker 1>providing the RDP protocol directly is the most

00:08:44.589 --> 00:08:46.750
<v Speaker 1>secure way. We think that providing it through

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:49.149
<v Speaker 1>the web console does provide you that added

00:08:49.149 --> 00:08:51.069
<v Speaker 1>protection that, you know, the proxy is sitting

00:08:51.069 --> 00:08:54.029
<v Speaker 1>in front of it. It's it's verifying your

00:08:54.029 --> 00:08:54.990
<v Speaker 1>access to the machine.

00:08:55.655 --> 00:08:58.615
<v Speaker 1>It's then using a virtual smart card approach,

00:08:59.175 --> 00:09:01.255
<v Speaker 1>and that's the way that it's it's securely

00:09:01.255 --> 00:09:03.815
<v Speaker 1>identifying you through to the active directory,

00:09:04.295 --> 00:09:06.295
<v Speaker 1>and it's it's it's maintaining that for you

00:09:06.295 --> 00:09:07.815
<v Speaker 1>so that, again, to the user, it's it's

00:09:07.815 --> 00:09:08.295
<v Speaker 1>all seamless.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.880
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's very cool. I I I don't

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.240
<v Speaker 0>think I've ever worked for a company that

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.800
<v Speaker 0>doesn't have one or more random selection of

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.440
<v Speaker 0>Windows servers just floating about in the infrastructure,

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.360
<v Speaker 0>and, like, the access management to it was

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.560
<v Speaker 0>always a bit

00:09:22.274 --> 00:09:24.275
<v Speaker 0>a bit wild west y, to be honest.

00:09:24.435 --> 00:09:26.675
<v Speaker 0>And so this is, like this is actually

00:09:26.675 --> 00:09:29.235
<v Speaker 0>bringing these things under almost proper fleet management,

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:30.915
<v Speaker 0>at least from an access point of view,

00:09:30.915 --> 00:09:32.355
<v Speaker 0>which I think is really, really cool.

00:09:32.755 --> 00:09:34.435
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. One one thing to point out is

00:09:34.435 --> 00:09:36.149
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the labeling. So some of

00:09:36.149 --> 00:09:37.269
<v Speaker 1>these, you know, some of these are are

00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:38.550
<v Speaker 1>just pulled directly,

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:41.910
<v Speaker 1>but then you can give additional labeling,

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.950
<v Speaker 1>in terms of you know, you'll notice here

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:46.870
<v Speaker 1>I have the one environment production.

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:48.790
<v Speaker 1>So the this is not the same as

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.950
<v Speaker 1>some of these other tags as well as

00:09:51.245 --> 00:09:52.925
<v Speaker 1>the domain. So if we take a look

00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:53.485
<v Speaker 1>at,

00:09:54.685 --> 00:09:55.885
<v Speaker 1>in terms of,

00:09:56.285 --> 00:09:58.365
<v Speaker 1>you know, the configuration here. So this this

00:09:58.365 --> 00:10:00.524
<v Speaker 1>is the this is where I've set up,

00:10:01.324 --> 00:10:03.644
<v Speaker 1>the Windows desktop service from from the machine

00:10:03.644 --> 00:10:04.445
<v Speaker 1>I'm connecting to.

00:10:05.259 --> 00:10:07.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying this is my domain controller,

00:10:07.579 --> 00:10:09.660
<v Speaker 1>the domain that's actually connected to Apollo,

00:10:09.899 --> 00:10:10.700
<v Speaker 1>the user.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.540
<v Speaker 1>You can also set it up to use

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.019
<v Speaker 1>another more generic user, like Teleport Service.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.100
<v Speaker 1>That's actually in our documentation.

00:10:17.259 --> 00:10:18.380
<v Speaker 1>But then this is part of how you

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:19.980
<v Speaker 1>can do more host labeling. So in this

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.855
<v Speaker 1>case, I'm saying if the name matches this,

00:10:22.855 --> 00:10:24.375
<v Speaker 1>any any of the machines that have this

00:10:24.375 --> 00:10:25.655
<v Speaker 1>this name,

00:10:26.215 --> 00:10:28.695
<v Speaker 1>label them domain. So this is an additional

00:10:28.695 --> 00:10:30.535
<v Speaker 1>label I'm putting on. And then in case

00:10:30.535 --> 00:10:32.295
<v Speaker 1>of, like, Hercules, I wanted to add in

00:10:32.295 --> 00:10:33.895
<v Speaker 1>a production one. So I'm looking for that

00:10:33.895 --> 00:10:35.815
<v Speaker 1>prod name and add it in. So that's

00:10:35.815 --> 00:10:37.310
<v Speaker 1>where you could give that. I don't want

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:38.910
<v Speaker 1>you going to all machines, but I'm gonna

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:41.150
<v Speaker 1>say your user can see, you know, particular

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:42.350
<v Speaker 1>labeled machines.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:45.390
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Does this have any requirements on, like,

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.630
<v Speaker 0>a minimum Windows version? Does it run on

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.950
<v Speaker 0>all Windows since 10? Or

00:10:51.274 --> 00:10:54.315
<v Speaker 1>Pre window well, we Windows Server '20 twelve,

00:10:54.714 --> 00:10:56.154
<v Speaker 1>and up. Now

00:10:56.714 --> 00:10:59.355
<v Speaker 1>Windows ten eleven could work. I'd say most

00:10:59.355 --> 00:11:00.875
<v Speaker 1>of our clients are gonna be running the

00:11:00.875 --> 00:11:01.995
<v Speaker 1>Windows servers.

00:11:02.555 --> 00:11:03.755
<v Speaker 1>And you do need to be in a

00:11:03.755 --> 00:11:06.529
<v Speaker 1>domain so that so the, you know, you

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:08.209
<v Speaker 1>know, these are part of an active directory

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:10.209
<v Speaker 1>domain. Alright. Okay. So it's not I can't

00:11:10.209 --> 00:11:12.930
<v Speaker 0>expose my personal Windows machine over that quite

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:15.089
<v Speaker 0>yet, but maybe in the future. Yeah. No.

00:11:15.089 --> 00:11:17.570
<v Speaker 1>No. Exactly. Yeah. Right. I mean, again, it's

00:11:17.649 --> 00:11:19.730
<v Speaker 1>we're we're really focused on making sure it's

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:20.769
<v Speaker 1>the most secure connection,

00:11:21.535 --> 00:11:23.775
<v Speaker 1>and active directory allows us to do that

00:11:23.775 --> 00:11:26.335
<v Speaker 1>virtual smart card approach. So it's patchless.

00:11:27.055 --> 00:11:28.655
<v Speaker 1>You could you could just put up an

00:11:28.655 --> 00:11:30.335
<v Speaker 1>RDP. You know, you could just pass through

00:11:30.335 --> 00:11:33.055
<v Speaker 1>RDP protocol, but then you're just typically gonna

00:11:33.055 --> 00:11:34.655
<v Speaker 1>be saying, okay. Put in your username and

00:11:34.655 --> 00:11:36.110
<v Speaker 1>password and go. Yeah.

00:11:36.589 --> 00:11:37.790
<v Speaker 1>But, again, we wanted to make sure it

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:38.990
<v Speaker 1>was the most secure way.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:42.589
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Very cool. I like that. Yeah. Yeah.

00:11:43.149 --> 00:11:45.550
<v Speaker 1>I'd say the other one, which, one of

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:49.630
<v Speaker 1>the other cool features is around our about

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:50.110
<v Speaker 1>ports.

00:11:51.375 --> 00:11:54.095
<v Speaker 1>So you probably have noticed in your configuration,

00:11:54.095 --> 00:11:55.695
<v Speaker 1>the number sometimes you have a number of

00:11:55.695 --> 00:11:59.455
<v Speaker 1>ports open, right, to allow access to Teleport.

00:11:59.615 --> 00:12:00.895
<v Speaker 1>And with our,

00:12:01.215 --> 00:12:03.455
<v Speaker 1>you know, latest version, you can limit that

00:12:03.455 --> 00:12:05.535
<v Speaker 1>to a single port, like four four three.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:08.030
<v Speaker 1>So if you take a look at

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:11.070
<v Speaker 1>and, this is getting a little nerdy.

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:12.430
<v Speaker 1>I

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:16.430
<v Speaker 1>can take a look at a configuration

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:18.510
<v Speaker 1>of Teleport through here,

00:12:20.615 --> 00:12:22.055
<v Speaker 1>and this is telling me all the ports

00:12:22.055 --> 00:12:23.654
<v Speaker 1>that are available. So you notice they all

00:12:23.654 --> 00:12:25.894
<v Speaker 1>have a common four four three. So it's

00:12:25.894 --> 00:12:28.134
<v Speaker 1>saying, this is my public address. This is

00:12:28.134 --> 00:12:30.055
<v Speaker 1>what I'm going through the browser. This is

00:12:30.055 --> 00:12:32.774
<v Speaker 1>my SSH. This is my Kubernetes,

00:12:32.774 --> 00:12:34.454
<v Speaker 1>you know, database, all 443.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.360
<v Speaker 1>Now I have another server,

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.400
<v Speaker 1>enterprise,

00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:40.200
<v Speaker 1>more of a Star Trek theme. You

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.720
<v Speaker 1>notice there's different ports.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.440
<v Speaker 1>So I in this case, I'm running it

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.640
<v Speaker 1>off. You and you have the you have

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.680
<v Speaker 1>the option of using either.

00:12:49.495 --> 00:12:50.855
<v Speaker 1>There are some times where you may wanna

00:12:50.855 --> 00:12:53.014
<v Speaker 1>run that, but, you know, this really simplifies

00:12:53.014 --> 00:12:54.535
<v Speaker 1>it going to a single port.

00:12:55.334 --> 00:12:57.255
<v Speaker 1>Because, you know, as as you might run

00:12:57.255 --> 00:12:59.095
<v Speaker 1>into or we run into some of our

00:12:59.095 --> 00:13:02.295
<v Speaker 1>enterprise clients, you know, it can be difficult

00:13:02.295 --> 00:13:03.839
<v Speaker 1>for them to open up, you know, a

00:13:03.839 --> 00:13:06.560
<v Speaker 1>number of ports like that, whether for users

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.839
<v Speaker 1>or for the agents,

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:10.160
<v Speaker 1>to be able to provide that connectivity.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.640
<v Speaker 1>So that's really a a big thing to

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.120
<v Speaker 1>to make it, you know, easier for security,

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.360
<v Speaker 1>as well as just configuring your environment so

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.845
<v Speaker 1>that I don't have to worry about, you

00:13:18.845 --> 00:13:20.685
<v Speaker 1>know, different ports in the load balancers or

00:13:20.685 --> 00:13:22.445
<v Speaker 1>things. I can just use a single one.

00:13:22.845 --> 00:13:24.525
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. The less ports I have to open

00:13:24.525 --> 00:13:26.365
<v Speaker 0>up to the world or even in a

00:13:26.365 --> 00:13:28.525
<v Speaker 0>private even a private network, the better.

00:13:29.005 --> 00:13:30.045
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I get that.

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:32.890
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Yeah. And and you can always use

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:33.690
<v Speaker 1>this this

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:36.970
<v Speaker 1>URL web web API slash find to look

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:38.490
<v Speaker 1>at, you know, what is the configuration for

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.490
<v Speaker 1>the server, what's the server version, and and

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:41.530
<v Speaker 1>the different ports.

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:43.450
<v Speaker 1>So that's that's usually a good way that

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:45.210
<v Speaker 1>I when I'm working with a new client

00:13:45.675 --> 00:13:47.995
<v Speaker 1>or someone just checking out the OSS, like,

00:13:48.235 --> 00:13:49.515
<v Speaker 1>if they're having a trouble with the port,

00:13:49.515 --> 00:13:51.275
<v Speaker 1>hey. What's your configuration? And they can do

00:13:51.275 --> 00:13:51.675
<v Speaker 1>this.

00:13:53.435 --> 00:13:54.075
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:13:54.795 --> 00:13:55.515
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:13:56.955 --> 00:13:58.395
<v Speaker 1>Now one of the other and I mentioned

00:13:58.395 --> 00:13:59.835
<v Speaker 1>earlier was about our

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.340
<v Speaker 1>support for web auth in,

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.420
<v Speaker 1>and I hope I'm saying it right. I

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.380
<v Speaker 1>was it's like

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.740
<v Speaker 1>web web auth in. I'm sure everyone's maybe

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.899
<v Speaker 1>maybe in in The UK, you say it

00:14:10.899 --> 00:14:12.660
<v Speaker 1>a little differently, but, the n.

00:14:13.995 --> 00:14:16.635
<v Speaker 1>But, essentially, that's providing another you know, previously,

00:14:16.635 --> 00:14:18.875
<v Speaker 1>we'd supported, like, the Google auth type,

00:14:19.355 --> 00:14:21.115
<v Speaker 1>as well as YubiKey,

00:14:21.115 --> 00:14:23.035
<v Speaker 1>and this takes it to another level, you

00:14:23.035 --> 00:14:24.635
<v Speaker 1>know, with our support of things like touch

00:14:24.635 --> 00:14:27.435
<v Speaker 1>ID or using your watch and able to,

00:14:27.835 --> 00:14:28.555
<v Speaker 1>authentic

00:14:28.875 --> 00:14:30.220
<v Speaker 1>you know, additionally,

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:31.740
<v Speaker 1>authenticate a user.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Now in this case, what I've done is

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.780
<v Speaker 1>I've said for a particular nodes,

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.460
<v Speaker 1>if they're labeled prod,

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.500
<v Speaker 1>then you do need to use that. And

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.940
<v Speaker 1>we can check your you know, I have

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:43.980
<v Speaker 1>a prod access role.

00:14:46.035 --> 00:14:48.355
<v Speaker 1>You'll see this is requiring MFA true.

00:14:48.675 --> 00:14:49.395
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:14:50.035 --> 00:14:50.755
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:14:51.075 --> 00:14:53.155
<v Speaker 1>And then on your individual deployment,

00:14:53.395 --> 00:14:54.435
<v Speaker 1>you can decide,

00:14:54.595 --> 00:14:56.915
<v Speaker 1>are you gonna support multiple? So a person

00:14:56.915 --> 00:14:58.915
<v Speaker 1>could have Google auth. They could have YubiKey

00:14:58.915 --> 00:15:00.860
<v Speaker 1>and web auth. Or you may say, well,

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:02.780
<v Speaker 1>we're only gonna do you could say only

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.060
<v Speaker 1>a particular one.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.420
<v Speaker 1>So it's up to you if you want

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.740
<v Speaker 1>to allow multiple or only or only allow

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.020
<v Speaker 1>a single on your machine.

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.060
<v Speaker 1>Then in this case, you know, so I'm

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.525
<v Speaker 1>gonna go ahead and log in there. It's

00:15:14.525 --> 00:15:16.285
<v Speaker 1>gonna say, need to verify.

00:15:19.245 --> 00:15:21.565
<v Speaker 1>And I just got this Mac, so I'm

00:15:22.125 --> 00:15:23.245
<v Speaker 1>using this lovely,

00:15:23.485 --> 00:15:24.685
<v Speaker 1>fingerprint thing.

00:15:25.005 --> 00:15:25.965
<v Speaker 1>Thought that was pretty cool.

00:15:28.279 --> 00:15:29.720
<v Speaker 1>And now now I'm in the machine. Now

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.080
<v Speaker 1>if I go to another machine,

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.880
<v Speaker 1>like in this case, a

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.519
<v Speaker 1>dev one, I don't need to because it

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:38.600
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have that require on. But I'm saying

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.519
<v Speaker 1>for particular labeled machines,

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.519
<v Speaker 1>then you you will have to do that.

00:15:42.519 --> 00:15:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:15:43.605 --> 00:15:46.005
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we yeah. You can save for

00:15:46.005 --> 00:15:48.645
<v Speaker 0>these labels or these individual nodes that you

00:15:48.645 --> 00:15:51.765
<v Speaker 0>require that that second factor before we actually

00:15:51.765 --> 00:15:54.005
<v Speaker 0>give you access to. Does can

00:15:54.485 --> 00:15:55.925
<v Speaker 0>you use Touch ID to log in to

00:15:55.925 --> 00:15:57.820
<v Speaker 0>the Teleport server too,

00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.580
<v Speaker 0>or is that just Yes.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.780
<v Speaker 1>For for local users, you could. Now in

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.340
<v Speaker 1>in if you're using a single sign on,

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.820
<v Speaker 1>we would assume that would take over for

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.500
<v Speaker 1>the authentication part of it.

00:16:10.795 --> 00:16:13.035
<v Speaker 1>But if you're if you're using local users

00:16:13.035 --> 00:16:14.714
<v Speaker 1>only, yes, you you can you can certainly

00:16:14.714 --> 00:16:17.595
<v Speaker 1>use that. That's sweet. Nice. Yep.

00:16:17.915 --> 00:16:20.475
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. We definitely recommend that if you're if

00:16:20.475 --> 00:16:21.435
<v Speaker 1>you want to have,

00:16:22.235 --> 00:16:23.915
<v Speaker 1>even if you're using OSS, let's say let's

00:16:23.915 --> 00:16:26.389
<v Speaker 1>say you're using GitHub as your SSO,

00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:27.990
<v Speaker 1>well, maybe you want a backup

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:31.029
<v Speaker 1>local admin user in case, you know, as

00:16:31.029 --> 00:16:32.709
<v Speaker 1>we've seen, sometimes things go down

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:35.269
<v Speaker 1>in the last week or so,

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:37.829
<v Speaker 1>you know, then you could have an MFA

00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:40.230
<v Speaker 1>on that admin user. We'd certainly recommend that.

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:41.725
<v Speaker 1>And that that is the default to have

00:16:41.725 --> 00:16:42.845
<v Speaker 1>an MFA on.

00:16:43.325 --> 00:16:45.565
<v Speaker 0>Yes. So you're sure there's touch ID there,

00:16:45.565 --> 00:16:47.245
<v Speaker 0>but that's gonna work with anything that supports

00:16:47.245 --> 00:16:50.365
<v Speaker 0>web auth in, really. Right? Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

00:16:50.365 --> 00:16:51.485
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Exactly. So

00:16:51.965 --> 00:16:53.005
<v Speaker 0>this web As long as,

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. As long as the, yeah, the the

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:58.100
<v Speaker 1>browser supports whatever web browser you're using, then

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.020
<v Speaker 1>then you should be good. In terms of

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.220
<v Speaker 1>how you control

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.620
<v Speaker 1>it, so in terms of my account setting,

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.060
<v Speaker 1>can say I have two. So this is

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:05.300
<v Speaker 1>my

00:17:06.904 --> 00:17:08.424
<v Speaker 1>touch ID, and then I also have a

00:17:08.424 --> 00:17:09.624
<v Speaker 1>Yubi registered.

00:17:09.625 --> 00:17:11.384
<v Speaker 1>So the YubiKey, I can use

00:17:11.625 --> 00:17:12.585
<v Speaker 1>in my

00:17:12.744 --> 00:17:14.024
<v Speaker 1>desktop interaction,

00:17:14.184 --> 00:17:16.424
<v Speaker 1>you know, whereas the the touch ID, can

00:17:16.424 --> 00:17:18.744
<v Speaker 1>use with my Safari browser.

00:17:19.784 --> 00:17:20.505
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.400
<v Speaker 0>I like that feature too. It's just one

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.160
<v Speaker 0>of those quality of life improvements. Right? It

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.800
<v Speaker 0>just enables that things available at touch ID

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.520
<v Speaker 0>or Windows Hello or anything else like that.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.040
<v Speaker 0>It just and rather than getting your phone

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.360
<v Speaker 0>out and looking for Authy or Google Authenticator

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.025
<v Speaker 0>and all that stuff, you know, with the

00:17:36.025 --> 00:17:38.985
<v Speaker 0>biometric approaches. Password. What is my password? Copy,

00:17:38.985 --> 00:17:40.585
<v Speaker 1>paste, show, reveal.

00:17:41.465 --> 00:17:42.985
<v Speaker 1>You know, as as you're out on and

00:17:42.985 --> 00:17:44.345
<v Speaker 1>as you probably run into your if you're

00:17:44.345 --> 00:17:45.945
<v Speaker 1>out on the train or out somewhere, like,

00:17:45.945 --> 00:17:47.144
<v Speaker 1>I don't really wanna be showing

00:17:47.385 --> 00:17:49.705
<v Speaker 1>people my codes or passwords, but I like,

00:17:49.705 --> 00:17:51.040
<v Speaker 1>you know, having a touch ID is is

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.040
<v Speaker 1>very convenient. Yeah. Well, I I have a

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.480
<v Speaker 0>an Apple Watch, and the first thing I'll

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.000
<v Speaker 0>be doing now in my Teleport cluster is

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.200
<v Speaker 0>seeing if I can get that all hooked

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.880
<v Speaker 0>up so that I can access my Oh.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.280
<v Speaker 0>My machines with just touching my watch, which

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.080
<v Speaker 0>will be nice.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:02.880
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:18:03.885 --> 00:18:04.525
<v Speaker 0>Now

00:18:05.565 --> 00:18:07.565
<v Speaker 1>I am I am running this in AWS.

00:18:07.565 --> 00:18:08.925
<v Speaker 1>So definitely one of the things I wanted

00:18:08.925 --> 00:18:11.804
<v Speaker 1>to touch is on our additional AWS features.

00:18:12.685 --> 00:18:14.845
<v Speaker 1>And you can see here I've I've a

00:18:14.845 --> 00:18:15.645
<v Speaker 1>number of

00:18:17.129 --> 00:18:21.049
<v Speaker 1>accounts available. So from a single Teleport

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:22.169
<v Speaker 1>instance,

00:18:22.649 --> 00:18:24.090
<v Speaker 1>you can and I'm doing you can do

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:24.969
<v Speaker 1>this from the

00:18:25.529 --> 00:18:27.529
<v Speaker 1>where you're deploying it or from an agent

00:18:27.529 --> 00:18:28.730
<v Speaker 1>that's running in AWS,

00:18:29.315 --> 00:18:31.315
<v Speaker 1>then you can act you can allow access

00:18:31.315 --> 00:18:33.875
<v Speaker 1>to multiple roles in different accounts.

00:18:34.035 --> 00:18:35.395
<v Speaker 1>So you can see here I have one

00:18:35.395 --> 00:18:37.395
<v Speaker 1>account here, and this is actually our main

00:18:37.395 --> 00:18:38.754
<v Speaker 1>solution engineer account,

00:18:39.075 --> 00:18:40.595
<v Speaker 1>and then I have others. So that gives

00:18:40.595 --> 00:18:41.875
<v Speaker 1>you that ability, you know, and a lot

00:18:41.875 --> 00:18:43.635
<v Speaker 1>of us, especially if you're running enterprise, you

00:18:43.635 --> 00:18:44.434
<v Speaker 1>will have multiple

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:46.390
<v Speaker 1>AWS accounts.

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:48.630
<v Speaker 1>So then from here, can launch right into

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:49.110
<v Speaker 1>it.

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.070
<v Speaker 1>So I can see my servers.

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:58.070
<v Speaker 1>I can go to r d RDS.

00:19:08.215 --> 00:19:10.055
<v Speaker 1>And then and then it it is restricted

00:19:10.055 --> 00:19:10.775
<v Speaker 1>to,

00:19:11.095 --> 00:19:13.095
<v Speaker 1>you know, what that role is allowed access.

00:19:13.095 --> 00:19:15.495
<v Speaker 1>So I've gone in as SAM power user,

00:19:15.495 --> 00:19:18.370
<v Speaker 1>which power being that user has fair amount

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:19.330
<v Speaker 1>of privileges.

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Or by default, you'd probably wanna give them

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:23.810
<v Speaker 1>read only, and then then they can access

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:25.650
<v Speaker 1>request to get more access.

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:26.770
<v Speaker 0>K.

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:29.490
<v Speaker 0>That that was almost too much magic in

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:31.570
<v Speaker 0>one go for me there because

00:19:31.255 --> 00:19:33.174
<v Speaker 0>it feels as if you just logged in

00:19:33.174 --> 00:19:33.975
<v Speaker 0>beforehand

00:19:33.975 --> 00:19:36.855
<v Speaker 0>and it's magically worked. But that's actually launched

00:19:36.855 --> 00:19:39.015
<v Speaker 0>you an AWS console session, logged you in

00:19:39.015 --> 00:19:41.174
<v Speaker 0>as a user that was listed on Teleport,

00:19:41.174 --> 00:19:43.575
<v Speaker 0>and then that's what you're I mean, it

00:19:43.575 --> 00:19:44.294
<v Speaker 0>was just so fast.

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:47.729
<v Speaker 0>Let's do a different AWS account.

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:50.129
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. I think I

00:19:50.289 --> 00:19:51.729
<v Speaker 1>probably have to

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:52.849
<v Speaker 0>check.

00:19:53.409 --> 00:19:54.610
<v Speaker 0>Didn't mean to put you on the spot

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:56.690
<v Speaker 0>there. No. No. No problem. Yeah. No. I

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:58.370
<v Speaker 1>I think I didn't add a role for

00:19:58.370 --> 00:19:58.769
<v Speaker 1>this user,

00:19:59.475 --> 00:20:01.235
<v Speaker 1>but that's that's part of how you would

00:20:01.395 --> 00:20:03.554
<v Speaker 1>just just to highlight how you configure it.

00:20:04.915 --> 00:20:07.075
<v Speaker 1>You know? So you'd add in different roles

00:20:07.075 --> 00:20:09.075
<v Speaker 1>here. Mhmm. And then you would say what

00:20:09.075 --> 00:20:10.755
<v Speaker 1>account they're allowed to see. So that's why

00:20:10.755 --> 00:20:12.355
<v Speaker 1>it's not showing those others because that account

00:20:12.355 --> 00:20:13.235
<v Speaker 1>wasn't identified.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:16.029
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. But if you wanna add another one,

00:20:16.029 --> 00:20:17.309
<v Speaker 1>yeah, you could do that that way.

00:20:18.429 --> 00:20:19.710
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's just,

00:20:20.429 --> 00:20:21.950
<v Speaker 0>you know, we're looking at the list of

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:24.029
<v Speaker 0>AWS accounts. You click launch, and right away,

00:20:24.029 --> 00:20:25.789
<v Speaker 0>I'm staring at the AWS console. It was

00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:27.575
<v Speaker 0>just, you know, it worked too well at

00:20:27.575 --> 00:20:29.495
<v Speaker 0>that point where I'm I'm skeptical though. I'm

00:20:29.495 --> 00:20:31.095
<v Speaker 0>like, really? Did that just happen?

00:20:31.335 --> 00:20:33.575
<v Speaker 1>So Yep. Yeah. No. It's it's it's very

00:20:33.575 --> 00:20:35.895
<v Speaker 1>fast. One of the things we've noticed is

00:20:35.895 --> 00:20:38.775
<v Speaker 1>that while there are way and I I

00:20:38.775 --> 00:20:40.930
<v Speaker 1>mentioned about that power user, you know, we

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:42.049
<v Speaker 1>have seen where

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:45.490
<v Speaker 1>requesting additional access can be complicated in some

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:46.610
<v Speaker 1>of the SSOs.

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:48.610
<v Speaker 1>So this gives you that ability to do

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:49.090
<v Speaker 1>that

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:50.770
<v Speaker 1>often more quickly.

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:53.810
<v Speaker 1>Now you also have this in local,

00:20:54.424 --> 00:20:55.945
<v Speaker 1>you know, from the command line.

00:20:57.385 --> 00:20:58.665
<v Speaker 1>So you can see I'm logged in that

00:20:58.665 --> 00:20:59.624
<v Speaker 1>same user,

00:21:00.105 --> 00:21:01.624
<v Speaker 1>you know, particular access.

00:21:01.625 --> 00:21:04.345
<v Speaker 1>I can take a look at the apps.

00:21:05.065 --> 00:21:06.505
<v Speaker 1>And I already I already logged in. Let

00:21:06.505 --> 00:21:08.350
<v Speaker 1>me let me show you. Let me log

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:09.630
<v Speaker 1>out of that one so I can show

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:09.950
<v Speaker 1>you the

00:21:13.549 --> 00:21:16.190
<v Speaker 1>so if I log in directly to

00:21:17.549 --> 00:21:19.630
<v Speaker 1>access, it's gonna get a little mad at

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:21.549
<v Speaker 1>me because what do you log in as?

00:21:23.815 --> 00:21:24.614
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:21:26.855 --> 00:21:29.014
<v Speaker 0>So, okay, before you hit return on this

00:21:29.335 --> 00:21:31.815
<v Speaker 1>Mhmm. Or or maybe even another terminal, can

00:21:31.815 --> 00:21:33.335
<v Speaker 0>you run AWS

00:21:33.815 --> 00:21:35.654
<v Speaker 0>s three l s or something? That's just

00:21:35.654 --> 00:21:37.495
<v Speaker 0>something that would, I guess, fail. Sure.

00:21:42.509 --> 00:21:44.990
<v Speaker 0>So this should say unauthenticated,

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:45.869
<v Speaker 0>I would imagine.

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:49.389
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Okay. Yep. Yeah. No. And this this

00:21:49.389 --> 00:21:50.669
<v Speaker 1>is a very new brand a brand new

00:21:50.669 --> 00:21:52.509
<v Speaker 1>machine for me. And we and we've gone

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:55.295
<v Speaker 1>in our case, we, you know if I

00:21:55.295 --> 00:21:57.215
<v Speaker 1>wanted to do that because we use Okta,

00:21:57.215 --> 00:21:59.375
<v Speaker 1>I would have to log in through Okta,

00:21:59.855 --> 00:22:02.335
<v Speaker 1>get get the, you know, temporary tokens, and

00:22:02.335 --> 00:22:03.855
<v Speaker 1>then copy and paste those here.

00:22:04.655 --> 00:22:05.775
<v Speaker 1>So that's a little bit a little bit

00:22:05.775 --> 00:22:07.215
<v Speaker 1>of longer process for me.

00:22:07.695 --> 00:22:08.895
<v Speaker 1>But, yeah, I'd say I don't I don't

00:22:08.895 --> 00:22:09.775
<v Speaker 1>have the access yet.

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:11.749
<v Speaker 1>If I

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:18.870
<v Speaker 1>see,

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:20.309
<v Speaker 1>I am still getting used to this Mac

00:22:20.309 --> 00:22:20.710
<v Speaker 1>world.

00:22:33.565 --> 00:22:35.325
<v Speaker 1>So I'm I'm logging in as that same

00:22:35.325 --> 00:22:37.565
<v Speaker 1>that same access you saw me clicking.

00:22:37.804 --> 00:22:38.125
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:41.330
<v Speaker 1>So now I'm logged in. Yeah. That

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:43.649
<v Speaker 1>you can do that one.

00:22:48.049 --> 00:22:49.330
<v Speaker 0>No. That's the button. So I use that

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:51.090
<v Speaker 1>command, t s h eight AWS.

00:22:52.705 --> 00:22:55.105
<v Speaker 1>Now the other the other thing which which

00:22:55.105 --> 00:22:57.425
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to show, particularly with this console

00:22:57.425 --> 00:22:58.225
<v Speaker 1>access,

00:22:58.305 --> 00:22:58.865
<v Speaker 1>is

00:22:59.105 --> 00:23:01.665
<v Speaker 1>the concept of using the auto join.

00:23:01.985 --> 00:23:04.065
<v Speaker 1>So one of our features here, if you

00:23:04.065 --> 00:23:05.425
<v Speaker 1>go into our documentation about,

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.040
<v Speaker 1>you know, joining nodes.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:13.000
<v Speaker 1>So often in in you've seen this where

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.840
<v Speaker 1>and let me you know, if I wanna

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:17.000
<v Speaker 1>add a new new machine, I might do

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:17.880
<v Speaker 1>tokens

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:19.720
<v Speaker 1>add

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.000
<v Speaker 1>type equals node.

00:23:22.085 --> 00:23:23.605
<v Speaker 1>So then I get I get this particular

00:23:23.605 --> 00:23:25.525
<v Speaker 1>token. I can copy copy and paste it

00:23:25.525 --> 00:23:26.645
<v Speaker 1>and use it on machine.

00:23:26.805 --> 00:23:29.605
<v Speaker 1>Well, rather than worrying about token distribution,

00:23:29.845 --> 00:23:32.005
<v Speaker 1>do I use SSM? Do I use,

00:23:32.565 --> 00:23:34.760
<v Speaker 1>you know, Vault or something? You know, we

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.440
<v Speaker 1>we we saw the best way to do

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.559
<v Speaker 1>that was to,

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.279
<v Speaker 1>you know, have the concept of, you know,

00:23:40.279 --> 00:23:41.320
<v Speaker 1>auto joining.

00:23:42.039 --> 00:23:43.960
<v Speaker 1>Now it will this will allow you to

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.159
<v Speaker 1>install Teleport,

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.679
<v Speaker 1>and I've gone ahead and done that in

00:23:46.679 --> 00:23:47.799
<v Speaker 1>AMI machine

00:23:48.755 --> 00:23:51.715
<v Speaker 1>where it's it's already built in. It uses

00:23:51.715 --> 00:23:52.755
<v Speaker 1>the EC token

00:23:52.995 --> 00:23:54.914
<v Speaker 1>e e EC two token.

00:23:55.394 --> 00:23:57.955
<v Speaker 1>The machine itself that's running has permission to

00:23:57.955 --> 00:23:59.955
<v Speaker 1>look up that machine and verify it.

00:24:00.674 --> 00:24:02.355
<v Speaker 1>You can see here this is the policy

00:24:02.355 --> 00:24:02.835
<v Speaker 1>it's setting,

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.440
<v Speaker 1>and and then this is example of the

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.760
<v Speaker 1>token that I've I've already configured, you know,

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.160
<v Speaker 1>what roles are allowed, SSH, apps, things of

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:10.799
<v Speaker 1>that nature.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.559
<v Speaker 1>You also set in here,

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.360
<v Speaker 1>okay. Well, how how long until this when

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.465
<v Speaker 1>the server starts is it still allowed to

00:24:17.465 --> 00:24:18.025
<v Speaker 1>join?

00:24:18.505 --> 00:24:20.905
<v Speaker 1>Because it's not unlimited. You can't just install

00:24:21.145 --> 00:24:23.465
<v Speaker 1>Teleport, use token, and then go.

00:24:23.705 --> 00:24:25.465
<v Speaker 1>This is meant to be used for when

00:24:25.465 --> 00:24:27.945
<v Speaker 1>any server first starts up. And then you

00:24:27.945 --> 00:24:30.425
<v Speaker 1>also are setting well, okay. Well, what accounts

00:24:30.425 --> 00:24:32.410
<v Speaker 1>are are allowed to join and what from

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:34.650
<v Speaker 1>what regions? So you can restrict where those

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:36.170
<v Speaker 1>machines are coming from. So it's not just

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:36.809
<v Speaker 1>open.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:38.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So you have a a fair amount

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:39.450
<v Speaker 1>of control here.

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:41.370
<v Speaker 0>K.

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Yep. So in this case, I have, a

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:46.250
<v Speaker 1>set of AMI machines. The one I wanna

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:48.625
<v Speaker 1>use is example node three. It's it's a

00:24:48.625 --> 00:24:50.145
<v Speaker 1>Amazon Linux two,

00:24:50.385 --> 00:24:54.625
<v Speaker 1>with a built in Teleport

00:24:54.625 --> 00:24:55.905
<v Speaker 1>installer already there.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead and do t two micro, whatever

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:01.920
<v Speaker 1>is your favorite.

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.360
<v Speaker 1>As part of this, I wanted to you

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.200
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to be able to pull out,

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.360
<v Speaker 1>some of the tags,

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.840
<v Speaker 1>when it runs. So it pulls it pulls

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.560
<v Speaker 1>in tags, and it's both gonna use that

00:25:13.635 --> 00:25:15.235
<v Speaker 1>in terms of how it connects

00:25:16.435 --> 00:25:17.875
<v Speaker 1>to Teleport

00:25:18.035 --> 00:25:20.515
<v Speaker 1>as well as just informational things. So that's

00:25:20.515 --> 00:25:22.195
<v Speaker 1>a useful feature if you can you can

00:25:22.195 --> 00:25:24.355
<v Speaker 1>say, oh, pull pull in whatever tags are

00:25:24.355 --> 00:25:26.115
<v Speaker 1>being set on your your EC two.

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:29.650
<v Speaker 1>And I am I don't need SSH, so

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:30.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking it out.

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:36.690
<v Speaker 1>Now the way I'm I'm telling it to

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:38.690
<v Speaker 1>connect and not necessarily the way you have

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:40.495
<v Speaker 1>to, but I'm saying this is your auth

00:25:40.495 --> 00:25:42.415
<v Speaker 1>service. So I don't need a token, but

00:25:42.415 --> 00:25:43.535
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying this is what I want you

00:25:43.535 --> 00:25:44.414
<v Speaker 1>to connect to.

00:25:44.735 --> 00:25:46.414
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna name you

00:25:46.735 --> 00:25:47.534
<v Speaker 1>dev

00:25:47.615 --> 00:25:48.015
<v Speaker 1>three.

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:53.289
<v Speaker 1>You're in environment dev

00:25:55.769 --> 00:25:57.610
<v Speaker 1>and then group dev. When I was setting

00:25:57.610 --> 00:25:59.850
<v Speaker 1>this up, was like, environment groups, those are

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:00.809
<v Speaker 1>sometimes different.

00:26:02.169 --> 00:26:02.889
<v Speaker 1>Let's do that.

00:26:04.095 --> 00:26:06.014
<v Speaker 1>So we're pretty good to go.

00:26:06.975 --> 00:26:08.975
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let me you can click the button

00:26:08.975 --> 00:26:10.654
<v Speaker 0>now, I'm gonna try and

00:26:12.015 --> 00:26:13.695
<v Speaker 0>rephrase what I think you're doing just to

00:26:13.695 --> 00:26:15.455
<v Speaker 0>make sure I understand that what what was

00:26:15.455 --> 00:26:17.800
<v Speaker 0>actually happening here. So you've got an AMI

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.720
<v Speaker 0>image, an Amazon machine image that you're spending

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.640
<v Speaker 0>up, and you've added some tags to it

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.880
<v Speaker 0>through the UI. Now you've assigned an IAM

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.480
<v Speaker 0>role to this machine so that it can

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.000
<v Speaker 0>query its own tags.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:28.920
<v Speaker 0>Also,

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.234
<v Speaker 0>this AMI

00:26:31.235 --> 00:26:33.075
<v Speaker 0>is shipping with Teleport,

00:26:33.235 --> 00:26:34.755
<v Speaker 0>which because

00:26:34.755 --> 00:26:37.955
<v Speaker 0>it's in this account with the right role

00:26:37.955 --> 00:26:40.434
<v Speaker 0>is auto going to auto join your Teleport

00:26:40.434 --> 00:26:41.315
<v Speaker 0>cluster

00:26:41.315 --> 00:26:43.794
<v Speaker 0>and be automatically approved and be available in

00:26:43.794 --> 00:26:44.355
<v Speaker 0>the UI.

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:46.049
<v Speaker 0>Is that

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:48.690
<v Speaker 0>close? Pretty close. The the one thing is

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:51.570
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't need a role itself to join.

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:54.690
<v Speaker 1>It's the server itself that has the role

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:56.529
<v Speaker 1>that can verify that machine.

00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:58.289
<v Speaker 1>So you don't you don't need to you

00:26:58.289 --> 00:27:00.049
<v Speaker 1>don't need to come with a role as

00:27:00.049 --> 00:27:02.805
<v Speaker 1>the node. It rather, it's the server itself

00:27:02.805 --> 00:27:05.365
<v Speaker 1>has the role, so it's able to describe

00:27:05.365 --> 00:27:07.445
<v Speaker 1>instances. Otherwise, it couldn't confirm,

00:27:08.165 --> 00:27:09.925
<v Speaker 1>what is what is that machine, where is

00:27:09.925 --> 00:27:12.085
<v Speaker 1>it coming from. Okay. So yeah. So there's

00:27:12.085 --> 00:27:14.830
<v Speaker 0>nothing special about the machines themselves, although other

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:16.270
<v Speaker 0>than that you've configured it with a tag

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:18.510
<v Speaker 0>to tell it where the the cluster server

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:20.350
<v Speaker 0>is. That's it. Yeah. I I I didn't

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:21.549
<v Speaker 1>have to do that. It was just my

00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:23.869
<v Speaker 1>my preference. Yeah. Okay.

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:26.110
<v Speaker 1>K. It looks like I didn't run that.

00:27:31.805 --> 00:27:33.565
<v Speaker 1>What is what I thought it was O,

00:27:33.565 --> 00:27:34.445
<v Speaker 1>E C 2.

00:27:37.325 --> 00:27:37.805
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah.

00:27:40.299 --> 00:27:41.339
<v Speaker 0>Good catch.

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:43.179
<v Speaker 0>I have to stay at that for another

00:27:43.179 --> 00:27:44.859
<v Speaker 0>forty five minutes before I noticed.

00:27:47.419 --> 00:27:49.260
<v Speaker 1>Well, just wanted to so I'm using so

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:51.179
<v Speaker 1>I'm using our AWS access here to to

00:27:51.179 --> 00:27:53.260
<v Speaker 1>verify has it started up yet. I can

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.059
<v Speaker 1>see it has started.

00:27:54.845 --> 00:27:56.684
<v Speaker 1>Everything we saw before,

00:27:57.085 --> 00:27:59.085
<v Speaker 1>it's in US East 1 D,

00:27:59.965 --> 00:28:00.925
<v Speaker 1>and it is running.

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.100
<v Speaker 1>So then if we go back, here it

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:09.660
<v Speaker 1>is.

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.140
<v Speaker 1>And as part as part of this configuration,

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:18.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm using our our PAM.

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:21.740
<v Speaker 1>I installed Teleport. I use our PAM integration

00:28:22.295 --> 00:28:24.295
<v Speaker 1>so they can auto create the user. So

00:28:24.295 --> 00:28:26.455
<v Speaker 1>Steven isn't on this machine, but it'll auto

00:28:26.615 --> 00:28:28.855
<v Speaker 1>automatically create it when it comes in.

00:28:30.855 --> 00:28:32.695
<v Speaker 1>I also I also allow this you know,

00:28:32.695 --> 00:28:35.180
<v Speaker 1>the user to get pseudo rights, know, just

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.620
<v Speaker 1>like EC two, but I'm it doesn't have

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:38.460
<v Speaker 1>to come in as EC two. And then

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.059
<v Speaker 1>this this is what I was mentioning about,

00:28:40.059 --> 00:28:42.780
<v Speaker 1>you know, getting tags. So Yep. This is

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:43.659
<v Speaker 1>pulling in

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:45.100
<v Speaker 1>the

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:48.625
<v Speaker 1>metadata intent, which you don't need a role

00:28:48.625 --> 00:28:49.825
<v Speaker 1>for that, but you do need it for

00:28:49.825 --> 00:28:51.505
<v Speaker 1>this if you wanna pull out a group

00:28:51.505 --> 00:28:53.105
<v Speaker 1>and environment, and then I have the PAM

00:28:53.105 --> 00:28:55.105
<v Speaker 1>on. And here here's that token part. So

00:28:55.105 --> 00:28:57.425
<v Speaker 1>there's no, you know, long token needed anymore.

00:28:57.425 --> 00:28:58.625
<v Speaker 1>You just say I'm joining by e c

00:28:58.625 --> 00:29:00.680
<v Speaker 1>2 token. It's gonna see I'm coming from

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.000
<v Speaker 1>US West 1 in the account, and then

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.440
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna let it's going to allow it

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.080
<v Speaker 1>to join.

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.120
<v Speaker 0>Okay. I I I got two questions then.

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.040
<v Speaker 0>So let's assuming I wanna be able to

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.200
<v Speaker 0>replicate this in my own AWS infrastructure. Anyone

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.640
<v Speaker 0>watching does. Like,

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.585
<v Speaker 0>what's what's special about this AMI or what

00:29:16.585 --> 00:29:18.025
<v Speaker 0>do they need to do themselves to be

00:29:18.025 --> 00:29:19.625
<v Speaker 0>able to get this kind of workflow without

00:29:19.625 --> 00:29:22.585
<v Speaker 0>using the, you know, your demo AMI?

00:29:23.305 --> 00:29:25.945
<v Speaker 1>Yep. I'd say they would they would have

00:29:25.945 --> 00:29:26.985
<v Speaker 1>the AMI.

00:29:27.385 --> 00:29:28.665
<v Speaker 1>They or I'm sorry. They would start with

00:29:28.665 --> 00:29:31.610
<v Speaker 1>a machine. They would want to install

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:32.570
<v Speaker 1>Teleport

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:34.169
<v Speaker 1>and at least have

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:35.690
<v Speaker 1>the token

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:38.170
<v Speaker 1>configuration set up. So you're saying I'm using

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:40.250
<v Speaker 1>a token and the auth service.

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:43.210
<v Speaker 1>I I had this Teleport YAML generated, but

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:44.410
<v Speaker 1>you don't you wouldn't have to. You could

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:46.144
<v Speaker 1>just set up the Teleport YAML,

00:29:46.385 --> 00:29:48.705
<v Speaker 1>and have that ready to go, have the

00:29:48.705 --> 00:29:51.585
<v Speaker 1>Teleport service installed and enabled,

00:29:52.065 --> 00:29:54.625
<v Speaker 1>and then it'll start and then use this

00:29:54.625 --> 00:29:55.504
<v Speaker 1>configuration.

00:29:56.625 --> 00:29:58.784
<v Speaker 1>The the biggest thing is making sure that

00:29:58.784 --> 00:29:59.745
<v Speaker 1>your Teleport

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:04.659
<v Speaker 1>auth service is on a EC two that

00:30:04.659 --> 00:30:06.820
<v Speaker 1>has this permission that is allowed to describe

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:09.059
<v Speaker 1>those instances. Otherwise, it can't confirm

00:30:09.299 --> 00:30:11.619
<v Speaker 1>that, you know, as you set here,

00:30:12.019 --> 00:30:13.860
<v Speaker 1>what account is it, what region is it,

00:30:14.404 --> 00:30:16.965
<v Speaker 1>and then verifying that it's allowed to join.

00:30:18.885 --> 00:30:22.645
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So because that allow list there takes

00:30:22.645 --> 00:30:24.645
<v Speaker 0>multiple accounts, like, I can actually have a

00:30:24.645 --> 00:30:26.005
<v Speaker 0>single Teleport

00:30:26.005 --> 00:30:28.404
<v Speaker 0>that looks after or has access to my

00:30:28.404 --> 00:30:30.700
<v Speaker 0>instances across multiple AWS account?

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:31.740
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:33.020
<v Speaker 0>Very cool.

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:36.380
<v Speaker 0>I like that. I guess my my next

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:38.940
<v Speaker 0>question is how do I get this on

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:40.380
<v Speaker 0>every other cloud now? Is that is that

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.140
<v Speaker 0>Teleport nine? Do I have to wait a

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:42.540
<v Speaker 0>little longer?

00:30:44.265 --> 00:30:46.665
<v Speaker 1>Well, kind of like the console part where,

00:30:46.825 --> 00:30:48.345
<v Speaker 1>you know, a a large amount of our

00:30:48.345 --> 00:30:49.705
<v Speaker 1>clients are AWS.

00:30:49.705 --> 00:30:52.425
<v Speaker 1>So we we have initially released console and

00:30:52.425 --> 00:30:53.705
<v Speaker 1>CLI for AWS.

00:30:53.865 --> 00:30:55.465
<v Speaker 1>You know, we'll see one one of our

00:30:55.465 --> 00:30:56.185
<v Speaker 1>ads,

00:30:57.305 --> 00:30:59.010
<v Speaker 1>and I don't have that database running on

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:01.169
<v Speaker 1>this one, but we did just add our

00:31:01.409 --> 00:31:02.929
<v Speaker 1>one of our first Azure

00:31:02.929 --> 00:31:04.289
<v Speaker 1>features of database.

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:07.249
<v Speaker 1>So we're supporting their Postgres and MySQL,

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:09.809
<v Speaker 1>which you know, so that so we are

00:31:09.809 --> 00:31:11.809
<v Speaker 1>expanding into, you know, GCP

00:31:12.345 --> 00:31:14.025
<v Speaker 1>and Azure. I'd say right now, the Console

00:31:14.025 --> 00:31:16.105
<v Speaker 1>and CLI are AWS only, but we we

00:31:16.105 --> 00:31:17.865
<v Speaker 1>could see about adding them in there. A

00:31:17.865 --> 00:31:19.625
<v Speaker 1>lot of it is Yeah. Yeah, how how

00:31:19.625 --> 00:31:21.945
<v Speaker 1>well do they integrate from an API standpoint.

00:31:22.424 --> 00:31:23.945
<v Speaker 1>Some of them make it more awkward than

00:31:23.945 --> 00:31:24.184
<v Speaker 1>others,

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:26.570
<v Speaker 1>but, you know, we're we're continuing to look

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:29.450
<v Speaker 1>at it. AWS needs us the most. I

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:30.649
<v Speaker 0>mean, I don't know how many times I've

00:31:30.649 --> 00:31:33.049
<v Speaker 0>had to bang my head against access delegation

00:31:33.049 --> 00:31:35.130
<v Speaker 0>for AWS. You know, Azure and GCP are

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:37.529
<v Speaker 0>lucky. Like, generally, those companies are using g

00:31:37.529 --> 00:31:39.690
<v Speaker 0>Suite or maybe even Outlook or also c

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:41.985
<v Speaker 0>six five, and it's all integrated really nicely.

00:31:41.985 --> 00:31:44.145
<v Speaker 0>But AWS is just this big sore jaggy

00:31:44.145 --> 00:31:45.905
<v Speaker 0>thumb of authentication.

00:31:45.905 --> 00:31:47.345
<v Speaker 0>How do get people access to this within

00:31:47.345 --> 00:31:48.225
<v Speaker 0>my organization?

00:31:48.785 --> 00:31:50.625
<v Speaker 0>At least I I've always found it notoriously

00:31:50.625 --> 00:31:52.545
<v Speaker 0>difficult. So I

00:31:52.865 --> 00:31:54.785
<v Speaker 0>like this feature. I think it's a whole

00:31:54.785 --> 00:31:54.945
<v Speaker 0>lot.

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:57.100
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Yeah. And we try to make these

00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:58.380
<v Speaker 1>docs I mean, part of why I'm showing

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.460
<v Speaker 1>them is make them as explicit as possible.

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:02.539
<v Speaker 1>Also, on the AWS console one,

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:05.180
<v Speaker 1>which I wrote part of that, so yell

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:05.820
<v Speaker 1>at me.

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:07.500
<v Speaker 1>Not

00:32:09.034 --> 00:32:11.195
<v Speaker 1>but this steps you through really low really

00:32:11.195 --> 00:32:13.115
<v Speaker 1>low level with, like, giving you read only

00:32:13.115 --> 00:32:15.434
<v Speaker 1>access example and a power user example.

00:32:15.595 --> 00:32:17.434
<v Speaker 1>One of the trickier parts I found is

00:32:17.434 --> 00:32:19.114
<v Speaker 1>that it says power user.

00:32:19.355 --> 00:32:20.794
<v Speaker 1>I had to expand that,

00:32:21.434 --> 00:32:24.554
<v Speaker 1>because the it it doesn't give you IAM

00:32:24.554 --> 00:32:24.955
<v Speaker 1>rights.

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:27.970
<v Speaker 1>You can you can I can do an

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:29.970
<v Speaker 1>e c two, but then I couldn't in

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:32.370
<v Speaker 1>in this case, I couldn't actually assign an

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:34.210
<v Speaker 1>IAM role to my e c two, which

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:36.210
<v Speaker 1>seems kind of strange? But you have to

00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:38.610
<v Speaker 1>have a specific IAM permission to do that

00:32:39.145 --> 00:32:41.305
<v Speaker 1>or even if I wanted to change IAM

00:32:41.305 --> 00:32:42.024
<v Speaker 1>roles.

00:32:42.184 --> 00:32:44.585
<v Speaker 1>So what they might call power user, and

00:32:44.585 --> 00:32:46.905
<v Speaker 1>this is a default role in AWS,

00:32:46.905 --> 00:32:48.585
<v Speaker 1>may not always mean what you think.

00:32:49.065 --> 00:32:50.345
<v Speaker 1>So I'd say that's the only extra thing

00:32:50.345 --> 00:32:52.810
<v Speaker 1>is making sure you you're clear what these

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:53.770
<v Speaker 1>roles are doing

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:56.170
<v Speaker 1>Yep. And that they don't always cover every

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:58.570
<v Speaker 1>part of AWS that you expect.

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:00.730
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:02.730
<v Speaker 0>And we have a question from the audience,

00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:04.650
<v Speaker 0>which I knew was gonna come up eventually,

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:06.090
<v Speaker 0>and I'm sure you've heard this a billion

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:06.410
<v Speaker 0>times.

00:33:06.965 --> 00:33:09.285
<v Speaker 0>But Kevin is asking, any chance we can

00:33:09.285 --> 00:33:11.765
<v Speaker 0>have SAML or YDC in the open open

00:33:11.765 --> 00:33:13.525
<v Speaker 0>source version so that we don't have to

00:33:13.525 --> 00:33:14.485
<v Speaker 0>use GitHub?

00:33:15.205 --> 00:33:16.325
<v Speaker 1>Well,

00:33:16.325 --> 00:33:17.925
<v Speaker 1>yeah. I mean, that that's

00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:21.149
<v Speaker 1>one of our particular enterprise features,

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:24.510
<v Speaker 1>probably one of the largest that people decide

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:25.549
<v Speaker 1>to go enterprise.

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:28.029
<v Speaker 1>I'd say most of our clients

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:30.830
<v Speaker 1>who are using SAML or ADC, you know,

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:32.350
<v Speaker 1>are already in

00:33:34.034 --> 00:33:34.914
<v Speaker 1>a company.

00:33:35.475 --> 00:33:37.635
<v Speaker 1>We don't see quite as many of our

00:33:37.635 --> 00:33:39.075
<v Speaker 1>open source. Maybe there are more than I

00:33:39.075 --> 00:33:39.634
<v Speaker 1>expect.

00:33:39.875 --> 00:33:41.874
<v Speaker 1>Like, if they're using, Keycloak,

00:33:42.355 --> 00:33:43.634
<v Speaker 1>you you could use that.

00:33:44.515 --> 00:33:46.169
<v Speaker 1>But, you know, right now, we see that

00:33:46.169 --> 00:33:47.610
<v Speaker 1>as a way of us providing value in

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:50.169
<v Speaker 1>enterprise, whether you're using our hosted service or

00:33:50.169 --> 00:33:51.369
<v Speaker 1>the on prem.

00:33:51.929 --> 00:33:54.090
<v Speaker 1>Now, you know, in in some cases, like

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:56.409
<v Speaker 1>with our RBAC, you know, we release that

00:33:56.409 --> 00:33:59.049
<v Speaker 1>to open source. Previously, that was an enterprise

00:33:59.049 --> 00:33:59.289
<v Speaker 1>feature.

00:33:59.865 --> 00:34:01.705
<v Speaker 1>So, you know, we are we are always

00:34:01.705 --> 00:34:05.065
<v Speaker 1>evaluating that. I I there's no plans that

00:34:05.065 --> 00:34:07.384
<v Speaker 1>I know of to release that that way.

00:34:07.865 --> 00:34:10.105
<v Speaker 1>But we are looking at, you know, still

00:34:10.105 --> 00:34:12.639
<v Speaker 1>increasing the GitHub feature, making that, you know,

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:13.440
<v Speaker 1>even better.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.159
<v Speaker 1>So, you know, we we we do we

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:18.640
<v Speaker 1>definitely don't do want OSS to be,

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.239
<v Speaker 1>fully usable in in a deployment. You know,

00:34:22.239 --> 00:34:24.400
<v Speaker 1>we're not trying to say you get 90%

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.840
<v Speaker 1>in the last 10% you have to pay

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:26.000
<v Speaker 1>for.

00:34:27.125 --> 00:34:28.484
<v Speaker 1>But, you know, for now, we we do

00:34:28.484 --> 00:34:30.165
<v Speaker 1>think it's better to keep that as enterprise.

00:34:30.484 --> 00:34:32.484
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'm always very thankful that the GitHub

00:34:32.484 --> 00:34:34.484
<v Speaker 0>one is available for me because I I

00:34:34.484 --> 00:34:35.844
<v Speaker 0>I use it in all of my Teleport

00:34:35.844 --> 00:34:36.565
<v Speaker 0>instances.

00:34:36.885 --> 00:34:38.324
<v Speaker 0>What I would say to you, Kevin, is

00:34:38.324 --> 00:34:40.405
<v Speaker 0>I know Kevin is in the Discord server.

00:34:40.405 --> 00:34:42.150
<v Speaker 0>So jump into the Teleport channel and tell

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:43.510
<v Speaker 0>us what your use case is, and I'll

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:45.590
<v Speaker 0>share that with Steven and the Teleport team.

00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:47.909
<v Speaker 0>And maybe there's maybe something will happen in

00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:49.750
<v Speaker 0>the longer run. But I do like the

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:52.710
<v Speaker 0>GitHub SSO. It works well. Yep. Yep. Oh,

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:54.389
<v Speaker 1>no. We we definitely appreciate feedback on that

00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:56.630
<v Speaker 1>and other features. It helps us to understand

00:34:56.775 --> 00:34:59.095
<v Speaker 1>what the community is doing and and making

00:34:59.095 --> 00:35:01.015
<v Speaker 1>sure it's definitely functional for them.

00:35:01.895 --> 00:35:02.535
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:35:03.414 --> 00:35:04.615
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Alright.

00:35:06.135 --> 00:35:07.895
<v Speaker 0>That's that's a lot of features in a

00:35:07.895 --> 00:35:09.895
<v Speaker 0>release. I've gotta say that that that

00:35:10.055 --> 00:35:11.255
<v Speaker 0>but you could you could just have done

00:35:11.255 --> 00:35:13.070
<v Speaker 0>the desktop of Windows access, so that would

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:14.830
<v Speaker 0>have been already a huge release, but that's

00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:16.270
<v Speaker 0>to add on all this other stuff as

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:16.670
<v Speaker 0>well.

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Well, just say, I I I've a lot

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:20.350
<v Speaker 1>of my

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:22.510
<v Speaker 1>when I when I was a consultant,

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:24.350
<v Speaker 1>often, we were we were deploying

00:35:25.065 --> 00:35:26.985
<v Speaker 1>to Linux servers,

00:35:27.305 --> 00:35:29.224
<v Speaker 1>but our our development and some of our

00:35:29.305 --> 00:35:31.785
<v Speaker 1>even our staging until we got to final

00:35:31.785 --> 00:35:33.225
<v Speaker 1>release was Windows.

00:35:33.865 --> 00:35:35.625
<v Speaker 1>Or we or we might rely on active

00:35:35.625 --> 00:35:36.744
<v Speaker 1>directory for

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:39.970
<v Speaker 1>maintaining our single sign on. Like, well, we

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:41.090
<v Speaker 1>have to get to that machine.

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:44.369
<v Speaker 1>And it was, you know, often a single

00:35:44.369 --> 00:35:46.050
<v Speaker 1>admin user or,

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:48.369
<v Speaker 1>it it could be difficult to,

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:52.565
<v Speaker 1>issue issue passwords that, weren't like your typical

00:35:52.565 --> 00:35:53.125
<v Speaker 1>one.

00:35:53.605 --> 00:35:55.765
<v Speaker 1>So we definitely see that that expands

00:35:56.565 --> 00:35:59.125
<v Speaker 1>our functionality and, you know, a lot of

00:35:59.125 --> 00:36:01.765
<v Speaker 1>what we think of our our, you know,

00:36:01.765 --> 00:36:02.485
<v Speaker 1>customer,

00:36:02.565 --> 00:36:04.085
<v Speaker 1>you know, usage

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.599
<v Speaker 1>that that it's that a lot of people

00:36:06.599 --> 00:36:07.560
<v Speaker 1>are using both.

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.880
<v Speaker 1>And nowadays, it gets kinda tricky about, you

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.560
<v Speaker 1>know, we don't have Windows phones much, but

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:13.560
<v Speaker 1>many people are using surfaces. Many people are

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:16.520
<v Speaker 1>using Windows servers for various various reasons.

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:18.760
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Awesome.

00:36:19.615 --> 00:36:21.695
<v Speaker 0>Suresh, I do see your comment.

00:36:22.175 --> 00:36:23.855
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure I fully understand. So if

00:36:23.855 --> 00:36:25.695
<v Speaker 0>you wanna type in a bit more detail,

00:36:25.775 --> 00:36:28.015
<v Speaker 0>please feel free. I will read out the

00:36:28.015 --> 00:36:29.935
<v Speaker 0>question for you, Steven, but Okay. I think

00:36:29.935 --> 00:36:31.215
<v Speaker 0>we might I think we might need some

00:36:31.215 --> 00:36:33.500
<v Speaker 0>more on that. But Suresh is asking, do

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:35.020
<v Speaker 0>we have any monitoring tool which can pull

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:38.300
<v Speaker 0>container and server metrics on dashboards for Teleport?

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:41.180
<v Speaker 0>So I'm not sure if Suresh is asking

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:44.619
<v Speaker 0>if Teleport exposes, like, Prometheus endpoint or anything

00:36:44.619 --> 00:36:46.695
<v Speaker 0>like that or if it's gonna prevent access

00:36:46.695 --> 00:36:49.335
<v Speaker 0>to other Prometheus endpoints, but I'll let you

00:36:49.575 --> 00:36:50.535
<v Speaker 0>if you wanna try it now, so let

00:36:50.535 --> 00:36:51.175
<v Speaker 0>go for it.

00:36:52.615 --> 00:36:54.695
<v Speaker 1>I'd say I mean, Teleport provides its own

00:36:54.695 --> 00:36:56.135
<v Speaker 1>Prometheus metrics.

00:36:56.695 --> 00:36:57.895
<v Speaker 1>It it does not

00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:01.780
<v Speaker 1>it's not offering a general set of metrics.

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:03.540
<v Speaker 1>So we would expect you to use another

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:04.100
<v Speaker 1>tool,

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:05.860
<v Speaker 1>like Prometheus.

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:08.100
<v Speaker 1>You can definitely get access to those,

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:09.460
<v Speaker 1>through Teleport.

00:37:11.045 --> 00:37:12.565
<v Speaker 1>So it's not it's not just

00:37:13.205 --> 00:37:15.045
<v Speaker 1>but I would say it itself is not

00:37:15.045 --> 00:37:17.445
<v Speaker 1>meant as a a monitoring tool,

00:37:17.525 --> 00:37:19.925
<v Speaker 1>you know, for your particular set of services

00:37:19.925 --> 00:37:20.805
<v Speaker 1>or servers.

00:37:21.765 --> 00:37:22.405
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:37:22.565 --> 00:37:25.000
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense. Yeah. Alright. Harish, if you

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.599
<v Speaker 0>wanna add any more details, if we didn't

00:37:26.599 --> 00:37:28.519
<v Speaker 0>answer that question for you, just jump back

00:37:28.519 --> 00:37:30.680
<v Speaker 0>into the comments and we'll do our best.

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.480
<v Speaker 0>Is there anything else, Steven, you wanna you

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.000
<v Speaker 0>wanna show us? Yeah. A couple couple quick

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.599
<v Speaker 1>things. One, and I and I think this

00:37:36.599 --> 00:37:38.904
<v Speaker 1>is a little bit related to what that

00:37:38.904 --> 00:37:40.905
<v Speaker 1>gentleman was asking in terms of,

00:37:41.224 --> 00:37:43.224
<v Speaker 1>you know well, when you do wanna let's

00:37:43.224 --> 00:37:44.505
<v Speaker 1>say you did wanna deploy,

00:37:44.904 --> 00:37:45.944
<v Speaker 1>a particular,

00:37:45.944 --> 00:37:48.984
<v Speaker 1>you know, either analytics or monitoring system. So

00:37:48.984 --> 00:37:50.185
<v Speaker 1>this is a case of,

00:37:50.505 --> 00:37:51.785
<v Speaker 1>you know, I have a Grafana

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:53.480
<v Speaker 1>configuration,

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:55.720
<v Speaker 1>and I want to deploy it on a

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:58.040
<v Speaker 1>machine that will take my Grafana.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:58.840
<v Speaker 1>So

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.000
<v Speaker 1>you can in this case, we can take

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.160
<v Speaker 1>a quick look at you know, I I

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:05.720
<v Speaker 1>have a Teleport agent running here,

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:06.920
<v Speaker 1>and I've said,

00:38:07.515 --> 00:38:08.234
<v Speaker 1>okay.

00:38:08.474 --> 00:38:11.115
<v Speaker 1>This is an app service. I'm not specifically

00:38:11.115 --> 00:38:11.915
<v Speaker 1>defining

00:38:11.994 --> 00:38:13.355
<v Speaker 1>my app services,

00:38:13.515 --> 00:38:14.954
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying you can,

00:38:15.994 --> 00:38:18.795
<v Speaker 1>I will take any applications that have this

00:38:18.875 --> 00:38:22.240
<v Speaker 1>this, particular set of tags? So it's in

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.880
<v Speaker 1>development environment, and it's the Grafana app. So

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:27.040
<v Speaker 1>then when I'm ready, I can just say,

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:29.360
<v Speaker 1>t cuddle create.

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:33.040
<v Speaker 1>And then that's deployed,

00:38:36.395 --> 00:38:37.515
<v Speaker 1>directly available,

00:38:39.275 --> 00:38:40.955
<v Speaker 1>and I can launch straight into it.

00:38:41.755 --> 00:38:43.915
<v Speaker 1>So just a few seconds, I was able

00:38:43.915 --> 00:38:45.195
<v Speaker 1>to deploy

00:38:45.355 --> 00:38:47.595
<v Speaker 1>a particular web application

00:38:47.595 --> 00:38:49.435
<v Speaker 1>right on right on an agent that's running.

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:53.170
<v Speaker 1>So that's a big jump from have as

00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:54.690
<v Speaker 1>we I talked a little bit earlier, having

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:57.090
<v Speaker 1>to have that YAML all defined, all perfect,

00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:57.890
<v Speaker 1>all set,

00:38:58.210 --> 00:38:59.570
<v Speaker 1>and, you know, oh, where do I wanna

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:00.770
<v Speaker 1>run it? You know, I have to have

00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:02.610
<v Speaker 1>that in the right place. You know, as

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:03.970
<v Speaker 1>long in this case, I can say, well,

00:39:04.095 --> 00:39:05.855
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna deploy an agent. I I may

00:39:05.855 --> 00:39:07.215
<v Speaker 1>not even want it running all the time.

00:39:07.215 --> 00:39:08.575
<v Speaker 1>You know, I may wanna deploy this and

00:39:08.575 --> 00:39:10.015
<v Speaker 1>then take it and then take it back

00:39:10.015 --> 00:39:11.775
<v Speaker 1>down. So I I can actually

00:39:12.095 --> 00:39:13.055
<v Speaker 1>just remove that.

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Now it's gone.

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:29.190
<v Speaker 0>So is

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:33.030
<v Speaker 0>that is the is the magic effect again,

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:36.415
<v Speaker 0>Steven? You're you're Yes. You're confusing me. So

00:39:36.415 --> 00:39:38.015
<v Speaker 0>we're we don't have to run

00:39:38.575 --> 00:39:40.415
<v Speaker 0>any more agents? Is that what you're is

00:39:40.415 --> 00:39:42.335
<v Speaker 0>that did everything else apply? You're still the

00:39:42.335 --> 00:39:44.175
<v Speaker 1>agent. So I am definitely running an agent

00:39:44.175 --> 00:39:47.135
<v Speaker 1>here. Okay. This this dev one, this machine,

00:39:47.135 --> 00:39:48.335
<v Speaker 1>I deployed it specifically

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:50.650
<v Speaker 1>because I wanted it to be

00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:54.010
<v Speaker 1>an agent. Oh, okay. I want yeah. So

00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:56.410
<v Speaker 1>in this case, I'm saying I want I'm

00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:57.850
<v Speaker 1>allowing resources,

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:00.570
<v Speaker 1>web applications that fit this labeling.

00:40:01.285 --> 00:40:02.405
<v Speaker 0>Oh, okay. Okay.

00:40:02.725 --> 00:40:04.325
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Got it. Yeah. If I try if

00:40:04.325 --> 00:40:06.325
<v Speaker 1>I try to yeah. Exact no. That's that's

00:40:06.325 --> 00:40:08.165
<v Speaker 1>an important point. If I try to deploy

00:40:08.165 --> 00:40:09.605
<v Speaker 1>this with environment

00:40:09.845 --> 00:40:10.645
<v Speaker 1>prod,

00:40:11.045 --> 00:40:12.245
<v Speaker 1>I would have to have an agent that

00:40:12.245 --> 00:40:13.285
<v Speaker 1>accepts those labels.

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:15.620
<v Speaker 1>And then it it it wouldn't find a

00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:18.500
<v Speaker 1>home if that's if that's not if that's

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:19.300
<v Speaker 1>not set.

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:21.140
<v Speaker 1>So it's meant to be, yes, that I

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:23.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying I want this particular

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:24.900
<v Speaker 1>deployment.

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:27.305
<v Speaker 1>And Okay. You know, it'll it allows you

00:40:27.305 --> 00:40:28.664
<v Speaker 1>allows you to do that. Similar similar to

00:40:28.664 --> 00:40:31.065
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes, like, you have the the taints or

00:40:31.065 --> 00:40:33.385
<v Speaker 1>tolerations, right, of saying, you know, what's what's

00:40:33.385 --> 00:40:34.984
<v Speaker 1>allowed to be to run here.

00:40:35.305 --> 00:40:36.984
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. You've given us the ability now to

00:40:36.984 --> 00:40:38.105
<v Speaker 0>kind of schedule

00:40:38.105 --> 00:40:40.184
<v Speaker 0>these app services and point them to the

00:40:40.184 --> 00:40:42.530
<v Speaker 0>correct agents to expose them. Previously,

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:43.970
<v Speaker 0>I was always it was a very manual

00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:45.410
<v Speaker 0>process. I was having to make sure I

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:47.010
<v Speaker 0>set up the agents in the regard, please,

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:48.609
<v Speaker 0>and and Yeah. This is this is much

00:40:48.609 --> 00:40:50.130
<v Speaker 0>nicer. Again, one of those quality of life

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:51.650
<v Speaker 0>things that just makes it all a bit

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:53.010
<v Speaker 0>easier to get started.

00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:54.609
<v Speaker 0>So Yep. I mean, it took me a

00:40:54.609 --> 00:40:56.050
<v Speaker 0>minute to work at what was actually happening

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:57.490
<v Speaker 0>here, but I like it though. I got

00:40:57.490 --> 00:40:57.650
<v Speaker 0>it.

00:40:58.505 --> 00:40:59.465
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Cool.

00:41:00.265 --> 00:41:01.705
<v Speaker 1>The one I want and and kinda a

00:41:01.705 --> 00:41:03.225
<v Speaker 1>little bit similar to the

00:41:04.345 --> 00:41:06.585
<v Speaker 1>in terms of auto finding

00:41:06.825 --> 00:41:08.825
<v Speaker 1>is the databases. So you notice I have

00:41:08.825 --> 00:41:10.825
<v Speaker 1>a mix here of names. I have some

00:41:10.825 --> 00:41:12.920
<v Speaker 1>that are look a little you probably noticed

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.599
<v Speaker 1>are a little more manual types where I'm

00:41:14.599 --> 00:41:16.039
<v Speaker 1>I'm I have a name, I have a

00:41:16.039 --> 00:41:16.680
<v Speaker 1>tier,

00:41:16.839 --> 00:41:18.520
<v Speaker 1>and then here, I have ones that are

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:21.160
<v Speaker 1>more expanded. They have an account ID, engine

00:41:21.319 --> 00:41:22.040
<v Speaker 1>version,

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.440
<v Speaker 1>and then and then others here.

00:41:25.025 --> 00:41:27.745
<v Speaker 1>So in terms of this database agent

00:41:28.545 --> 00:41:29.905
<v Speaker 1>I can take a look here.

00:41:34.465 --> 00:41:37.825
<v Speaker 1>I've I've configured this database service. So I've

00:41:37.825 --> 00:41:41.099
<v Speaker 1>said, you will find any database service or,

00:41:41.099 --> 00:41:42.300
<v Speaker 1>like, RDS

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:44.460
<v Speaker 1>that has a type of RDS

00:41:44.619 --> 00:41:46.860
<v Speaker 1>and this tag environment dev.

00:41:47.099 --> 00:41:48.540
<v Speaker 1>And if we take a look at

00:41:48.859 --> 00:41:50.140
<v Speaker 1>back on our RDS,

00:41:57.345 --> 00:41:57.984
<v Speaker 0>Maybe?

00:41:58.785 --> 00:41:59.665
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. US

00:42:00.145 --> 00:42:01.424
<v Speaker 1>East One. Don't go down on me again.

00:42:01.424 --> 00:42:02.145
<v Speaker 1>So

00:42:04.704 --> 00:42:05.505
<v Speaker 1>I have this.

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:09.060
<v Speaker 1>Is that the one I want?

00:42:10.339 --> 00:42:11.300
<v Speaker 1>That's fine. So

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:15.460
<v Speaker 1>I've tagged this as environment dev. So it

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:16.820
<v Speaker 1>will only bring back,

00:42:17.299 --> 00:42:18.260
<v Speaker 1>those

00:42:18.339 --> 00:42:19.380
<v Speaker 1>specific,

00:42:19.619 --> 00:42:22.605
<v Speaker 1>databases with that tag, And then you'd you

00:42:22.605 --> 00:42:24.765
<v Speaker 1>can allow users to have that.

00:42:25.245 --> 00:42:27.325
<v Speaker 1>Now, again, just like the

00:42:28.845 --> 00:42:32.205
<v Speaker 1>allowing machines to come in, my agent running

00:42:32.205 --> 00:42:34.605
<v Speaker 1>needs permission to find these databases.

00:42:35.289 --> 00:42:37.210
<v Speaker 1>And once it has that permission,

00:42:37.289 --> 00:42:38.890
<v Speaker 1>and it's also able to

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:39.930
<v Speaker 1>control

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:41.530
<v Speaker 1>your its access,

00:42:41.849 --> 00:42:43.849
<v Speaker 1>that's one of our important

00:42:47.045 --> 00:42:50.165
<v Speaker 1>security considerations is that it can auto find

00:42:50.165 --> 00:42:51.365
<v Speaker 1>them and add them,

00:42:51.685 --> 00:42:53.925
<v Speaker 1>but you also want to

00:42:54.085 --> 00:42:56.405
<v Speaker 1>limit what it can do. So in this

00:42:56.405 --> 00:42:58.565
<v Speaker 1>case, I'm saying, okay.

00:42:58.965 --> 00:42:59.525
<v Speaker 1>You can

00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:03.299
<v Speaker 1>get your role. You can change your role.

00:43:03.299 --> 00:43:04.580
<v Speaker 1>You can modify it.

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:07.140
<v Speaker 1>But I'm gonna put a boundary on you.

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:09.859
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna say, you're only able to do

00:43:09.859 --> 00:43:10.500
<v Speaker 1>this.

00:43:10.819 --> 00:43:12.819
<v Speaker 1>You can connect, but you can't do more

00:43:12.819 --> 00:43:13.140
<v Speaker 1>than that.

00:43:14.125 --> 00:43:16.605
<v Speaker 1>And that's an important thing we we strongly

00:43:16.605 --> 00:43:19.245
<v Speaker 1>recommend people using this feature do is set

00:43:19.245 --> 00:43:22.045
<v Speaker 1>those permission boundaries so that a machine itself

00:43:22.045 --> 00:43:24.365
<v Speaker 1>can change its permissions to say, well, I'm

00:43:24.365 --> 00:43:27.780
<v Speaker 1>gonna add, you know, a database connection here,

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:29.380
<v Speaker 1>but, you know, we're not gonna let you

00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:29.940
<v Speaker 1>then,

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:32.420
<v Speaker 1>add in some other service or things. You

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:34.340
<v Speaker 1>know, the machine can only set, you know,

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:35.780
<v Speaker 1>these particular changes for it. So so it's

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:36.420
<v Speaker 1>dynamic,

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:38.740
<v Speaker 1>but it's not able to do more than

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:40.915
<v Speaker 1>that than what you're limiting to, the the

00:43:40.915 --> 00:43:42.115
<v Speaker 1>permission boundary.

00:43:43.714 --> 00:43:44.435
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:43:45.954 --> 00:43:47.315
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Very cool.

00:43:47.635 --> 00:43:48.275
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:43:48.755 --> 00:43:51.075
<v Speaker 1>And then this also also leads into that

00:43:51.075 --> 00:43:51.795
<v Speaker 1>that,

00:43:52.595 --> 00:43:55.319
<v Speaker 1>you know, port thing where I can,

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:57.560
<v Speaker 1>you know, provide that access

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:58.680
<v Speaker 1>for user.

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.079
<v Speaker 1>So I can log in to,

00:44:05.319 --> 00:44:05.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,

00:44:14.184 --> 00:44:15.545
<v Speaker 1>and then what if I if I wanna

00:44:15.545 --> 00:44:17.145
<v Speaker 1>connect, I I can set up a proxy

00:44:17.145 --> 00:44:17.865
<v Speaker 1>to it

00:44:18.585 --> 00:44:20.105
<v Speaker 1>that allows me to,

00:44:20.345 --> 00:44:22.105
<v Speaker 1>you know, keep that single

00:44:23.810 --> 00:44:25.090
<v Speaker 1>single port.

00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:33.250
<v Speaker 1>Nope.

00:44:37.285 --> 00:44:39.045
<v Speaker 1>I think I think I meant to do

00:44:39.045 --> 00:44:39.845
<v Speaker 1>one.

00:44:41.365 --> 00:44:42.085
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:44:42.165 --> 00:44:43.205
<v Speaker 0>There you go.

00:44:45.845 --> 00:44:47.925
<v Speaker 1>But in this case, I'm I'm going through

00:44:47.925 --> 00:44:49.285
<v Speaker 1>the local proxy,

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:52.829
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm connecting through to through that

00:44:52.829 --> 00:44:55.390
<v Speaker 1>single Teleport four four three. So this way,

00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:57.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to expose, like, the three

00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:59.390
<v Speaker 1>zero three six or another port,

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:01.230
<v Speaker 1>for the user to go through. But I

00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:02.990
<v Speaker 1>can I can use this this proxy approach?

00:45:03.675 --> 00:45:05.355
<v Speaker 1>And that that again allows us to use

00:45:05.355 --> 00:45:07.755
<v Speaker 1>that single port approach which simplifies things.

00:45:08.155 --> 00:45:09.755
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. 100%.

00:45:10.075 --> 00:45:11.435
<v Speaker 0>Couldn't agree with that, Mark.

00:45:13.035 --> 00:45:13.595
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:18.740
<v Speaker 0>Their ask is Quite a lot. Yeah.

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:23.780
<v Speaker 0>That's it's it's it's a big release. I

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:26.420
<v Speaker 0>mean, I just don't understand how Teleport maintains

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:29.140
<v Speaker 0>this velocity. I feel like it was just

00:45:28.765 --> 00:45:30.205
<v Speaker 0>a little while ago. We were talking about

00:45:30.205 --> 00:45:32.445
<v Speaker 0>all the new features with Teleport seven and

00:45:32.445 --> 00:45:34.845
<v Speaker 0>the new database access stuff, and then Teleport

00:45:34.845 --> 00:45:36.445
<v Speaker 0>eight sneaks up on me, and there's all

00:45:36.445 --> 00:45:38.765
<v Speaker 0>this other new stuff now. And I I

00:45:38.765 --> 00:45:41.165
<v Speaker 0>love the balance of, like, here's some new

00:45:41.165 --> 00:45:43.805
<v Speaker 0>shiny features, but also we're always making improvements

00:45:43.805 --> 00:45:45.300
<v Speaker 0>to that quality of life. Like, I think

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:46.900
<v Speaker 0>half the stuff we've seen today is just

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:49.620
<v Speaker 0>making things simpler and easier for Teleport users,

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:50.660
<v Speaker 0>which is fantastic.

00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And people are welcome to join our

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Slack.

00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:57.780
<v Speaker 1>You know, there's also get GitHub discussions that

00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:58.820
<v Speaker 1>we have in our repository.

00:45:59.465 --> 00:46:01.545
<v Speaker 1>So both are great great places

00:46:01.785 --> 00:46:02.985
<v Speaker 1>to have that dialogue,

00:46:04.025 --> 00:46:05.785
<v Speaker 1>you know, so it we really encourage people

00:46:05.785 --> 00:46:07.465
<v Speaker 1>to to try things out. You know, most

00:46:07.465 --> 00:46:08.425
<v Speaker 1>of the features

00:46:08.905 --> 00:46:11.065
<v Speaker 1>besides that SAML one we talked about, you

00:46:11.065 --> 00:46:13.065
<v Speaker 1>know, those are all those are open available

00:46:13.065 --> 00:46:14.825
<v Speaker 1>in open sas open OSS.

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.960
<v Speaker 1>We're already seeing some dialogue in terms of

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.280
<v Speaker 1>desktop access and things. So definitely encourage people

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.400
<v Speaker 1>to try those out and let us know

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.120
<v Speaker 1>any questions.

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:23.360
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I I I think I say this

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:25.840
<v Speaker 0>to everyone, but just there's no there's no

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:27.920
<v Speaker 0>excuses for not having a Teleport in your

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:30.005
<v Speaker 0>setup these days. It's just you get so

00:46:30.005 --> 00:46:31.845
<v Speaker 0>much value from having it there

00:46:32.085 --> 00:46:33.685
<v Speaker 0>and and convention,

00:46:33.685 --> 00:46:35.365
<v Speaker 0>and security is hard. Like, why would you

00:46:35.365 --> 00:46:36.965
<v Speaker 0>make it harder and not have something like

00:46:36.965 --> 00:46:38.565
<v Speaker 0>Teleport there to take away some of that

00:46:38.565 --> 00:46:39.205
<v Speaker 0>burden?

00:46:39.765 --> 00:46:40.405
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:46:40.565 --> 00:46:42.380
<v Speaker 0>Thank you for taking time out of your

00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:44.540
<v Speaker 0>day, for joining us, preparing those demos, and

00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:47.020
<v Speaker 0>walking us through it. Really, really cool additions

00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:48.060
<v Speaker 0>to Teleport.

00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:49.740
<v Speaker 0>And then, hopefully, we can have you back

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:51.980
<v Speaker 0>again for Teleport nine, which based on your

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:53.900
<v Speaker 0>velocity, will soon be in about three weeks.

00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:55.900
<v Speaker 1>Maybe maybe Ben and I will join. We'll

00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:56.540
<v Speaker 1>we'll join together.

00:46:58.035 --> 00:46:58.595
<v Speaker 1>Awesome. Alright,

00:46:59.714 --> 00:47:01.555
<v Speaker 1>David. Thank you so much for having us.

00:47:02.915 --> 00:47:06.915
<v Speaker 1>Just, you know, please please, visit goteleport.com.

00:47:07.395 --> 00:47:08.994
<v Speaker 1>We hope you try it out. Let us

00:47:08.994 --> 00:47:10.275
<v Speaker 1>know any feedback, good and bad.

00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:13.650
<v Speaker 1>And as always, I I really enjoy dialoguing

00:47:13.650 --> 00:47:15.810
<v Speaker 1>with you here directly,

00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:18.050
<v Speaker 1>David, or or anywhere else. It's fantastic to

00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:18.690
<v Speaker 1>work with you.

00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:21.090
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Awesome. Well, it was a pleasure, and

00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:22.690
<v Speaker 0>well done on all those demos. They all

00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:24.925
<v Speaker 0>worked. There were no full paths other than

00:47:24.925 --> 00:47:27.085
<v Speaker 0>potentially AWS going down, but I think we

00:47:27.085 --> 00:47:28.525
<v Speaker 0>managed to stay away from that.

00:47:29.165 --> 00:47:30.525
<v Speaker 0>Have a great day, Steven. It was a

00:47:30.525 --> 00:47:31.964
<v Speaker 0>pleasure, and I'll catch you again soon. Yep.

00:47:31.964 --> 00:47:33.565
<v Speaker 0>Bye. Yep. Happy holidays. Bye.

00:47:51.924 --> 00:47:52.404
<v Speaker 0>Live.
