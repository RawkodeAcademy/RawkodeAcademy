00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.360
<v Speaker 0>Hello,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.800
<v Speaker 0>and welcome back to the Rawkode Academy.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.720
<v Speaker 0>My name is David Flanagan, although you may

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.400
<v Speaker 0>know me from across the Internet and this

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.920
<v Speaker 0>channel as Rawkode.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.800
<v Speaker 0>And I often say clustered is the worst

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.040
<v Speaker 0>idea I've ever had. I've now taken that

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.125
<v Speaker 0>back. This episode is the worst idea I've

00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:44.844
<v Speaker 0>ever had.

00:01:46.765 --> 00:01:47.564
<v Speaker 0>Echo.

00:01:48.685 --> 00:01:50.365
<v Speaker 0>Can I ask if I have an echo?

00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:52.844
<v Speaker 0>I'll work on that if I need to.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.100
<v Speaker 0>There is an echo. Two people have said

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.500
<v Speaker 0>it now.

00:02:14.935 --> 00:02:16.375
<v Speaker 0>If you have an echo, make sure you

00:02:16.375 --> 00:02:18.055
<v Speaker 0>don't have two tabs open.

00:02:21.655 --> 00:02:22.375
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

00:02:22.455 --> 00:02:23.334
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.310
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Don't have it open on Twitter at

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.150
<v Speaker 0>the same time and cause me get the

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.510
<v Speaker 0>fear. Alright.

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.230
<v Speaker 0>We're on low latency mode. So we have

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.310
<v Speaker 0>around a one second delay from whatever you

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.829
<v Speaker 0>type and whatever I see. So we can

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.030
<v Speaker 0>have a good conversation today.

00:02:39.644 --> 00:02:41.245
<v Speaker 0>And we're gonna have fun. So like I

00:02:41.245 --> 00:02:43.005
<v Speaker 0>said, this is the worst episode.

00:02:43.245 --> 00:02:45.165
<v Speaker 0>Worst idea I've ever had because I have

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.685
<v Speaker 0>broken two clusters.

00:02:46.765 --> 00:02:49.405
<v Speaker 0>My goal is to have random members of

00:02:49.405 --> 00:02:51.084
<v Speaker 0>the audience come on and join me

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.660
<v Speaker 0>and see if they can fix them.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.300
<v Speaker 0>I was really confident when I broke these

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.900
<v Speaker 0>clusters that I I was like, yeah. Nobody

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.140
<v Speaker 0>will fix this. And now I'm worried that

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.180
<v Speaker 0>they're too easy.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.980
<v Speaker 0>So whether this episode is thirty minutes long

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 0>or ninety minutes long, I have no idea.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.835
<v Speaker 0>That is down to you, the audience. So

00:03:08.835 --> 00:03:10.915
<v Speaker 0>if you haven't seen cluster before, I would

00:03:10.915 --> 00:03:12.435
<v Speaker 0>encourage you to check it out.

00:03:12.835 --> 00:03:14.435
<v Speaker 0>We pop over to my screen share for

00:03:14.435 --> 00:03:15.795
<v Speaker 0>a second. You will see

00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:17.715
<v Speaker 0>that there is a cluster

00:03:18.115 --> 00:03:19.955
<v Speaker 0>oh, don't do that. There is a cluster

00:03:19.955 --> 00:03:22.410
<v Speaker 0>playlist with over 42 of these episodes. So

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.770
<v Speaker 0>if you wanna see how people

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 0>come on computer. There we go.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.650
<v Speaker 0>Clustered, filled playlist. There's loads of these. Right?

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.650
<v Speaker 0>We've had teams from Adobe,

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.010
<v Speaker 0>Zapier. We've had members of the community, IBM.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.690
<v Speaker 0>We've had Pixielabs,

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:36.410
<v Speaker 0>Aerospike,

00:03:37.005 --> 00:03:39.245
<v Speaker 0>ChainGuard versus ChainGuard. That was a fun one.

00:03:39.245 --> 00:03:40.685
<v Speaker 0>Like, there are lots of companies. So go

00:03:40.685 --> 00:03:42.445
<v Speaker 0>please check out the other episodes of Clustered

00:03:42.445 --> 00:03:44.845
<v Speaker 0>if you wanna do more or see more

00:03:44.845 --> 00:03:47.325
<v Speaker 0>people sweat on the stream. Alright.

00:03:47.965 --> 00:03:49.405
<v Speaker 0>We're gonna get this thing kicked off in

00:03:49.405 --> 00:03:50.845
<v Speaker 0>just a minute. What I need you to

00:03:50.845 --> 00:03:51.085
<v Speaker 0>do

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.970
<v Speaker 0>is I have created a buzzer for today's

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 0>session. If you go to this URL, this

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.130
<v Speaker 0>will allow you to register your name,

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:59.970
<v Speaker 0>and we're gonna allow you to buzz in

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.970
<v Speaker 0>and join me for ten minutes to see

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.490
<v Speaker 0>if you can fix a cluster.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.490
<v Speaker 0>If you don't want to, that's fine. You

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.085
<v Speaker 0>can just watch and laugh. There are rules,

00:04:08.085 --> 00:04:10.645
<v Speaker 0>Andrew. Yes. No. URI

00:04:10.645 --> 00:04:12.485
<v Speaker 0>code has not been used to break any

00:04:12.485 --> 00:04:13.605
<v Speaker 0>of these clusters.

00:04:14.085 --> 00:04:14.645
<v Speaker 0>So

00:04:14.885 --> 00:04:17.445
<v Speaker 0>join the buzzer. And while I do that,

00:04:17.445 --> 00:04:19.605
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna thank our sponsors as well.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.520
<v Speaker 0>So get that at the sponsor's way. Alright.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.520
<v Speaker 0>So from the very start of clustered, we

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.600
<v Speaker 0>have been using Teleport. Right? Teleport is what

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.199
<v Speaker 0>we use every single week to debug these

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.615
<v Speaker 0>clusters and pay it on them. I can,

00:04:33.615 --> 00:04:36.095
<v Speaker 0>like I'm gonna do today, add GitHub users

00:04:36.095 --> 00:04:38.655
<v Speaker 0>to a GitHub team, and they are magically

00:04:38.655 --> 00:04:40.575
<v Speaker 0>gonna have access to these clusters. They can

00:04:40.575 --> 00:04:43.615
<v Speaker 0>SSH and and try and fix stuff. So

00:04:43.615 --> 00:04:45.535
<v Speaker 0>if you're not familiar with Teleport, please go

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:47.455
<v Speaker 0>to Rawkode.live/Teleport.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.990
<v Speaker 0>It'll make our sponsors happy. It keeps clusters

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.710
<v Speaker 0>happening,

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.270
<v Speaker 0>and I would be well, yeah, just check

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.390
<v Speaker 0>it out. You're gonna love it. I'm gonna

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.990
<v Speaker 0>use it all through this episode as well,

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.270
<v Speaker 0>so you'll see how amazing it is.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.270
<v Speaker 0>Oh, we've got people on the the buzzer.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.550
<v Speaker 0>Sweet. I was wondering what that noise was.

00:05:03.475 --> 00:05:06.035
<v Speaker 0>Also, Equinix metal provide all of the hardware

00:05:06.035 --> 00:05:07.395
<v Speaker 0>for clustered, and they have done since the

00:05:07.395 --> 00:05:09.315
<v Speaker 0>very beginning. If you wanna check out Equinix

00:05:09.315 --> 00:05:11.395
<v Speaker 0>metal, go to Rawkode.live/metal.

00:05:11.395 --> 00:05:12.915
<v Speaker 0>Use the code raw code, and that'll get

00:05:12.915 --> 00:05:14.915
<v Speaker 0>you $200 in credit to start playing around

00:05:14.915 --> 00:05:17.700
<v Speaker 0>with it. These machines are chunky. Right? I

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.540
<v Speaker 0>could run clusters on a small DM with

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.980
<v Speaker 0>one core and one gig of RAM, but

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.580
<v Speaker 0>I don't. I run it on large bare

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.220
<v Speaker 0>metals machines with 48 cores and 60 or

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.060
<v Speaker 0>90 gig of RAM depending on which instance

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.500
<v Speaker 0>I use. Why?

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.100
<v Speaker 0>It just makes it a bit more fun.

00:05:30.525 --> 00:05:32.365
<v Speaker 0>If you've not tried that, go check it

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:32.845
<v Speaker 0>out.

00:05:33.165 --> 00:05:35.245
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's put this back down here.

00:05:35.565 --> 00:05:37.725
<v Speaker 0>So I can see yeah. We've got people

00:05:37.725 --> 00:05:39.805
<v Speaker 0>in there, we can start testing and get

00:05:39.805 --> 00:05:41.405
<v Speaker 0>our first person on. I'm gonna reset the

00:05:41.405 --> 00:05:42.845
<v Speaker 0>buzzers and lock them.

00:05:43.245 --> 00:05:44.125
<v Speaker 0>No cheating.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.860
<v Speaker 0>And we're gonna get our first contestant on.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.980
<v Speaker 0>So I do have space for somebody

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:52.500
<v Speaker 0>here.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.900
<v Speaker 0>So

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.260
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna unlock the buzzers. First one to

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.865
<v Speaker 0>buzz in, I will paste the link into

00:06:00.865 --> 00:06:03.185

<v Speaker 0>So click the link, turn on your camera.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.550
<v Speaker 0>We'll get you access to this cluster.

00:06:29.335 --> 00:06:31.255
<v Speaker 0>If you're not here in a minute, we'll

00:06:31.255 --> 00:06:32.775
<v Speaker 0>pass it over to someone else.

00:06:41.095 --> 00:06:42.615

<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I do. Awesome. Okay. So

00:07:07.004 --> 00:07:09.004
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna add you to either cluster one

00:07:09.004 --> 00:07:11.245
<v Speaker 0>or cluster cluster two. Do you have a

00:07:11.245 --> 00:07:11.645
<v Speaker 0>preference?

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.070
<v Speaker 1>I have literally no idea what's going on

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.590

<v Speaker 0>So I hope you've read it.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.470
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's just give you access to cluster

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:22.270

00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:44.889
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So this is gonna get you access

00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:47.370
<v Speaker 0>to this cluster. You can accept that invite

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:48.250
<v Speaker 0>just now.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.730
<v Speaker 0>Will unlock my

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:51.610
<v Speaker 0>password.

00:07:58.085 --> 00:07:59.685
<v Speaker 0>Alright. You have an invite.

00:08:00.085 --> 00:08:01.685
<v Speaker 0>Once you've accepted that, you will be able

00:08:01.685 --> 00:08:04.805
<v Speaker 0>to log in at join.clusters.live.

00:08:04.805 --> 00:08:07.125
<v Speaker 0>This will give you access to the cluster,

00:08:07.365 --> 00:08:08.965
<v Speaker 0>and I will show you how to start

00:08:08.965 --> 00:08:09.605
<v Speaker 0>fixing it.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.660
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:15.660
<v Speaker 0>I'll just hide this over here.

00:08:29.165 --> 00:08:32.044
<v Speaker 1>Where where would I find the the invite?

00:08:32.044 --> 00:08:33.325
<v Speaker 1>I think it's in GitHub. If you go

00:08:33.325 --> 00:08:35.725
<v Speaker 0>to GitHub.com, it should be a notification. You'll

00:08:35.725 --> 00:08:37.589
<v Speaker 0>also get an email address at an email

00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:39.110
<v Speaker 0>to your to your email.

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:41.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. I'll

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:43.990
<v Speaker 1>just do that way.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:47.670
<v Speaker 1>Sorry about my wife. I'm a little bit

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:48.310
<v Speaker 1>sick right now.

00:08:50.945 --> 00:08:52.305
<v Speaker 0>No worries at all.

00:08:53.185 --> 00:08:55.425
<v Speaker 0>So how's your Kubernetes experience?

00:08:58.305 --> 00:09:03.105
<v Speaker 1>I am a systems engineer and IT consultant

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.560
<v Speaker 1>by day. And my main thing is Kubernetes

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.880
<v Speaker 1>clusters and operating them for

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.519
<v Speaker 1>customers, but mostly managed ones. I'm do I

00:09:14.519 --> 00:09:17.235
<v Speaker 1>have one for one customer that's on prem

00:09:17.235 --> 00:09:20.115
<v Speaker 1>and that's fully fully managed by by our

00:09:20.115 --> 00:09:20.675
<v Speaker 1>team,

00:09:21.075 --> 00:09:21.795
<v Speaker 1>including

00:09:22.035 --> 00:09:24.355
<v Speaker 1>control plan and everything. It's on headset cloud,

00:09:24.355 --> 00:09:25.955
<v Speaker 1>so that should tell you how much manual

00:09:25.955 --> 00:09:27.555
<v Speaker 1>work is. Yeah.

00:09:28.595 --> 00:09:30.595
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm I'm doing this, like, for

00:09:30.595 --> 00:09:32.515
<v Speaker 1>two year two years now. Nice.

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:34.089
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:09:34.089 --> 00:09:37.209
<v Speaker 0>So I just opened an SSH session onto

00:09:37.209 --> 00:09:38.570
<v Speaker 0>one control player.

00:09:39.529 --> 00:09:41.370
<v Speaker 0>What that means is if if you go

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:42.570
<v Speaker 0>to join Clustered

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:44.490
<v Speaker 0>Live, you'll be able to log in with

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:45.450
<v Speaker 0>your GitHub authentication.

00:09:56.355 --> 00:09:58.115
<v Speaker 0>And then if you click once you're logged

00:09:58.115 --> 00:10:00.435
<v Speaker 0>in, click on activity and active sessions, and

00:10:00.435 --> 00:10:02.440
<v Speaker 0>you will see my session, and you can

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.360
<v Speaker 0>use options and join.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.080
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.880
<v Speaker 0>So go to act yep. Sweet.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.480
<v Speaker 0>Alright. You now have access to a cube

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.440
<v Speaker 0>admin cluster.

00:10:15.515 --> 00:10:17.275
<v Speaker 0>I'll give you one bit of advice because

00:10:17.275 --> 00:10:19.835
<v Speaker 0>everybody gets this unclustered. You will have to

00:10:19.835 --> 00:10:22.075
<v Speaker 0>export your cube config, which I'm happy to

00:10:22.075 --> 00:10:23.035
<v Speaker 0>do for you.

00:10:23.435 --> 00:10:24.235
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:10:24.875 --> 00:10:26.635
<v Speaker 0>Then the cube admin location,

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.610
<v Speaker 0>Everything should be as unique. Your mission is

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:34.170
<v Speaker 0>to upgrade the clustered application and a default

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.130
<v Speaker 0>namespace from version one to version two.

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:38.810
<v Speaker 0>Good luck.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:40.410
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.570
<v Speaker 0>And I'll give you ten minutes, and then

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:43.850
<v Speaker 0>we'll we'll give someone else a shot.

00:10:48.985 --> 00:10:50.105
<v Speaker 1>You

00:10:51.145 --> 00:10:54.025
<v Speaker 1>already exported the cube config, but

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.120
<v Speaker 1>is this is this part of the challenge,

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.279
<v Speaker 1>or is this a problem?

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.759
<v Speaker 0>This is part of the challenge. So it

00:11:02.759 --> 00:11:04.120
<v Speaker 0>would appear that you do not have a

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.480
<v Speaker 0>working control plan.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.600
<v Speaker 2>Oh, no.

00:11:18.185 --> 00:11:20.105
<v Speaker 1>How is this cluster provision?

00:11:20.425 --> 00:11:23.625
<v Speaker 0>With Kube admin, Kube ADM. Are you familiar

00:11:23.625 --> 00:11:24.505
<v Speaker 0>with Kube ADM?

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:27.190
<v Speaker 1>Vaguely.

00:11:27.589 --> 00:11:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Just true wrappers.

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.230
<v Speaker 0>So if we run p s a u

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.830
<v Speaker 0>x and grab the cube,

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.310
<v Speaker 0>we'll see all of our control plan components.

00:11:38.625 --> 00:11:40.625
<v Speaker 0>There's one missing at the moment, which is

00:11:40.625 --> 00:11:42.145
<v Speaker 0>the API server.

00:11:42.945 --> 00:11:43.665
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:11:49.585 --> 00:11:51.905
<v Speaker 0>So by joining me, you already get a

00:11:51.905 --> 00:11:54.760
<v Speaker 0>$20 Amazon voucher. If at any point you

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.360
<v Speaker 0>wanna hand it over to someone else, just

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.600
<v Speaker 0>feel free to to say thanks and off

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.279
<v Speaker 0>you go. But if you need any advice,

00:12:00.279 --> 00:12:01.880
<v Speaker 0>I'm happy to give little hints as we

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.960
<v Speaker 0>go. So, you know, don't feel uncomfortable. Don't

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:04.680
<v Speaker 0>feel under pressure.

00:12:05.175 --> 00:12:07.735
<v Speaker 0>Like, just do what you're happy with. Of

00:12:08.455 --> 00:12:09.015
<v Speaker 1>course.

00:12:12.375 --> 00:12:13.735
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Just

00:12:13.975 --> 00:12:15.415
<v Speaker 1>just to be real with you for a

00:12:15.415 --> 00:12:18.615
<v Speaker 1>moment here, I'm just googling what to do

00:12:18.615 --> 00:12:21.310
<v Speaker 1>to restart the API server for now. I

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:23.709
<v Speaker 0>I Google every day. Don't you worry, man.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Just just to to keep the viewers

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:28.430
<v Speaker 1>involved and and not staring at a blank

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:30.910
<v Speaker 1>screen. And I found, like, I'm I think

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.670
<v Speaker 1>from 02/2017,

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:35.630
<v Speaker 1>which says, oh, just restart the container. I

00:12:35.855 --> 00:12:38.655
<v Speaker 1>I guess that won't work since modern Kubernetes

00:12:38.655 --> 00:12:40.255
<v Speaker 1>doesn't use Docker anymore. But

00:12:41.135 --> 00:12:43.215
<v Speaker 0>There's no Docker on these machines, I'm afraid.

00:12:43.215 --> 00:12:43.935
<v Speaker 0>There's container d.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.920
<v Speaker 0>And the way that Kube admin works is

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.400
<v Speaker 0>that all of our control plane components are

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.280
<v Speaker 0>configured via static manifests.

00:13:03.095 --> 00:13:03.975
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:13:09.095 --> 00:13:11.335
<v Speaker 1>Do we have the the manifests on the

00:13:11.335 --> 00:13:13.655
<v Speaker 1>on the control plan notes themselves? They are

00:13:13.655 --> 00:13:15.815
<v Speaker 0>indeed. They're in slash e t c slash

00:13:15.815 --> 00:13:17.575
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes slash manifests.

00:13:31.505 --> 00:13:33.425
<v Speaker 0>And thank you for using a pager.

00:13:34.465 --> 00:13:36.305
<v Speaker 0>That means the audience sees exactly what you

00:13:36.305 --> 00:13:37.905
<v Speaker 0>see, which is always great.

00:13:38.465 --> 00:13:39.185
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:13:41.905 --> 00:13:42.465
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:13:58.090 --> 00:13:59.770
<v Speaker 0>We got six minutes left to make some

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:00.490
<v Speaker 0>progress.

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:01.130
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:14:12.545 --> 00:14:14.225
<v Speaker 0>Wanna chat? Help out. You guys are always

00:14:14.225 --> 00:14:14.945
<v Speaker 0>really good at this.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh, okay. I didn't even think about that.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:21.420
<v Speaker 1>But it's No. They haven't ticked a lot

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.100
<v Speaker 0>too far, but the chat are usually pretty

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.339
<v Speaker 0>good at helping. So Alright.

00:14:26.139 --> 00:14:27.740
<v Speaker 0>But right now, you you have no API

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:28.380
<v Speaker 0>server.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.620
<v Speaker 0>There are logs for the API server.

00:14:31.125 --> 00:14:32.565
<v Speaker 0>I can tell you where those are if

00:14:32.565 --> 00:14:33.765
<v Speaker 0>you want to go take a look.

00:14:34.085 --> 00:14:36.165
<v Speaker 0>They're in VarLog containers,

00:14:36.165 --> 00:14:37.765
<v Speaker 0>which may be a good place to start.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.960
<v Speaker 0>We have a symptom.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Just

00:15:00.505 --> 00:15:00.985
<v Speaker 0>uh-huh.

00:15:07.065 --> 00:15:08.905
<v Speaker 0>So this is telling us that our API

00:15:08.905 --> 00:15:09.625
<v Speaker 0>server

00:15:09.865 --> 00:15:10.985
<v Speaker 0>actually cannot start,

00:15:11.589 --> 00:15:14.230
<v Speaker 0>and we're seeing a connection refused on local

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:16.230
<v Speaker 0>host port two three seven nine.

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:18.630
<v Speaker 0>Do we know what port number or application

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:19.590
<v Speaker 0>that may be?

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:23.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't, but we'll find out soon.

00:15:26.555 --> 00:15:28.875
<v Speaker 0>Joss, our objective is to upgrade the application

00:15:28.875 --> 00:15:30.955
<v Speaker 0>from v one to v two, and the

00:15:30.955 --> 00:15:33.675
<v Speaker 0>chat is in there pretty quick. Is down.

00:15:33.675 --> 00:15:34.795
<v Speaker 1>It's what you see.

00:15:35.275 --> 00:15:36.075
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:15:36.635 --> 00:15:37.675
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:45.970
<v Speaker 1>It's kinda sad.

00:16:02.245 --> 00:16:04.165
<v Speaker 1>Let me look at the manifest here because

00:16:04.165 --> 00:16:05.205
<v Speaker 1>it's like mean

00:16:06.325 --> 00:16:07.765
<v Speaker 0>okay. That's a good idea.

00:16:08.819 --> 00:16:10.740
<v Speaker 0>Oh, don't run cube in cube admin in

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:11.380
<v Speaker 0>it, please.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.100
<v Speaker 0>That will get us in a much worse

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:14.740
<v Speaker 0>position.

00:16:15.139 --> 00:16:15.860
<v Speaker 0>But yeah.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:19.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. There's some HCD thing, and there's

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.660
<v Speaker 1>no HCD in

00:16:22.015 --> 00:16:24.415
<v Speaker 1>in the the locks. Is etcd in this

00:16:24.415 --> 00:16:25.935
<v Speaker 1>case part of the

00:16:27.215 --> 00:16:27.855
<v Speaker 1>not

00:16:28.175 --> 00:16:30.655
<v Speaker 1>like I'm not actually sure.

00:16:30.815 --> 00:16:32.815
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the control plane,

00:16:32.975 --> 00:16:34.255
<v Speaker 1>most definitely, but

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:38.610
<v Speaker 1>should should it generate a lock? Has is

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:40.210
<v Speaker 1>it has it has it been running at

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:40.770
<v Speaker 1>all?

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:43.330
<v Speaker 1>So I mean This cluster was healthy at

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:44.370
<v Speaker 0>one point today.

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:48.210
<v Speaker 0>SSD was alive. It would appear that it's

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:48.850
<v Speaker 0>currently broken.

00:16:50.375 --> 00:16:51.895
<v Speaker 0>You certainly can take a look at the

00:16:51.895 --> 00:16:53.015
<v Speaker 0>static manifest

00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:56.295
<v Speaker 0>or try to find the logs, I think,

00:16:56.295 --> 00:16:57.175
<v Speaker 0>would be a good show.

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:07.789
<v Speaker 0>Okay. That's

00:17:08.269 --> 00:17:11.069
<v Speaker 0>no. That's not is is not running. Seems

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:14.109
<v Speaker 1>it is not a problem. Okay.

00:17:26.905 --> 00:17:29.145
<v Speaker 0>You've got a couple of minutes left. What

00:17:29.145 --> 00:17:30.904
<v Speaker 0>are you thinking? What are you thinking?

00:17:31.625 --> 00:17:34.825
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking I have no fucking clue how

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.399
<v Speaker 0>do Can can I can I swear on

00:17:36.399 --> 00:17:38.080
<v Speaker 1>this show? You can't swear. Yes. We we

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.600
<v Speaker 0>swear all the time on cluster. Don't you,

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.399
<v Speaker 0>Lenny? Oh, alright. I have no fucking clue

00:17:42.399 --> 00:17:44.799
<v Speaker 1>how to use KubeAdam and how to to

00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:47.360
<v Speaker 1>deal with the manifest and how to to

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.840
<v Speaker 1>deploy them if they are not deployed and

00:17:50.145 --> 00:17:52.065
<v Speaker 1>or check if they're deployed.

00:17:52.545 --> 00:17:54.785
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Would you like to swap out, or

00:17:54.785 --> 00:17:55.185
<v Speaker 0>do you wanna

00:17:57.985 --> 00:17:59.745
<v Speaker 1>I'm a be real with you.

00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:02.465
<v Speaker 1>Some somebody else can take it at this

00:18:02.465 --> 00:18:05.470
<v Speaker 1>point. I can can Google it. No worries.

<v Speaker 3>yeah. Well, one of the things that we

00:20:14.305 --> 00:20:16.065
<v Speaker 0>try to do with cluster is to, like,

00:20:16.065 --> 00:20:18.385
<v Speaker 0>try to dismantle this hero culture that we

00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:19.825
<v Speaker 0>have. Like, we all know some stuff. We

00:20:19.825 --> 00:20:21.505
<v Speaker 0>all know we all don't know a lot

00:20:21.505 --> 00:20:23.110

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:24.390
<v Speaker 0>okay if we say we don't know, and

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.389

<v Speaker 3>to look into Teleport

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.440
<v Speaker 3>one of these days. Alright. Looks like you're

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.640
<v Speaker 0>in the session. So if you can just

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.160
<v Speaker 0>type echo hello, let me know that you're

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.039
<v Speaker 0>there. Thank you.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.760
<v Speaker 0>Teleport is awesome. It's such a cool tool.

00:22:56.305 --> 00:22:58.945
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So you're continuing from where Benjamin left

00:22:58.945 --> 00:22:59.505
<v Speaker 0>us.

00:22:59.825 --> 00:23:01.985
<v Speaker 0>So what's your thought process so far? And

00:23:01.985 --> 00:23:04.465
<v Speaker 0>your ten minutes section there. Well, I I

00:23:04.465 --> 00:23:05.025
<v Speaker 3>guess

00:23:05.425 --> 00:23:07.265
<v Speaker 3>it's this is not running.

00:23:08.545 --> 00:23:10.145
<v Speaker 3>I see some container

00:23:10.145 --> 00:23:13.220
<v Speaker 3>d, so I guess we're using container d.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:14.419
<v Speaker 0>That's correct.

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:15.940
<v Speaker 0>So

00:23:22.179 --> 00:23:22.740
<v Speaker 3>okay.

00:23:25.195 --> 00:23:28.075
<v Speaker 3>Then I guess we should look at

00:23:31.434 --> 00:23:32.075
<v Speaker 3>few.

00:23:32.635 --> 00:23:33.834
<v Speaker 3>I think you mean. Right?

00:23:35.755 --> 00:23:36.154
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:39.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm a bit nervous.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:41.659
<v Speaker 3>I I feel like

00:23:42.299 --> 00:23:44.379
<v Speaker 3>on a on a job interview.

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:48.140
<v Speaker 0>Every day someone's on clustered, typing is your

00:23:48.299 --> 00:23:50.700
<v Speaker 0>the first thing that goes. Yeah. I mean,

00:23:51.925 --> 00:23:54.565
<v Speaker 3>while watching, it seems easy.

00:23:54.885 --> 00:23:56.805
<v Speaker 3>But then when you're on the spot, it's

00:23:56.805 --> 00:23:58.565
<v Speaker 3>like, oh, what should I do now?

00:23:59.445 --> 00:24:00.725
<v Speaker 3>Okay. So

00:24:03.365 --> 00:24:04.965
<v Speaker 3>controller manager

00:24:05.285 --> 00:24:07.390
<v Speaker 3>failed to get status.

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:08.990
<v Speaker 3>I guess these are

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:14.350
<v Speaker 3>k. So let's do it like this

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:18.669
<v Speaker 4>and look for that CD.

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:20.830
<v Speaker 4>No. It's d.

00:24:22.365 --> 00:24:23.164
<v Speaker 4>K.

00:24:25.405 --> 00:24:29.085
<v Speaker 4>Manifests

00:24:29.085 --> 00:24:30.044
<v Speaker 4>tier.

00:24:33.165 --> 00:24:35.245
<v Speaker 0>Sorry. I'm I'm laughing at my own maliciousness

00:24:35.245 --> 00:24:35.485
<v Speaker 0>now.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.080
<v Speaker 0>It's just I don't know if you know

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.760
<v Speaker 0>what's the timestamps on those files, but it

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:40.720
<v Speaker 0>made me laugh.

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.840
<v Speaker 3>The what? The timestamps on the files.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.679
<v Speaker 3>Oh, okay.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.200
<v Speaker 0>It's in the future.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

00:24:50.655 --> 00:24:52.095
<v Speaker 3>What do we have here?

00:24:54.255 --> 00:24:55.534
<v Speaker 3>This seems

00:24:56.095 --> 00:24:57.294
<v Speaker 3>not okay.

00:24:58.175 --> 00:24:58.735
<v Speaker 3>But

00:24:59.535 --> 00:25:01.215
<v Speaker 0>I I think the time stamps are super

00:25:01.215 --> 00:25:02.975
<v Speaker 0>freshly. You can ignore that. I just I'm

00:25:02.975 --> 00:25:04.969
<v Speaker 0>laughing. That's all. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:07.929
<v Speaker 3>was a red herring. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For

00:25:07.929 --> 00:25:08.409
<v Speaker 0>sure.

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:15.209
<v Speaker 3>But it's weird that we don't get any

00:25:19.505 --> 00:25:21.745
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I would have expected there to be

00:25:21.745 --> 00:25:23.825
<v Speaker 0>etcd logs and the kubelet to be trying

00:25:23.825 --> 00:25:24.785
<v Speaker 0>to start it.

00:25:26.545 --> 00:25:27.425
<v Speaker 0>So yeah.

00:25:28.545 --> 00:25:28.865
<v Speaker 0>Weird.

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.799
<v Speaker 3>Kind of weird.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:33.679
<v Speaker 3>Is

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:37.039
<v Speaker 3>the

00:25:38.639 --> 00:25:40.399
<v Speaker 3>cubelet binary

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.840
<v Speaker 3>untempered yet? It's untempered. If I have not

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.600
<v Speaker 0>recompelled the cubelet, that I can tell you.

00:25:46.184 --> 00:25:46.904
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

00:25:47.865 --> 00:25:49.225
<v Speaker 3>Why would it

00:25:50.745 --> 00:25:51.865
<v Speaker 3>okay. Let's see.

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:00.020
<v Speaker 3>But, yeah, I I guess the

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:02.100
<v Speaker 3>manifest folder

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:06.179
<v Speaker 3>is set correctly

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.020
<v Speaker 3>because it seems like it's

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:10.580
<v Speaker 3>trying to start the other

00:26:11.455 --> 00:26:12.815
<v Speaker 3>static pods

00:26:13.215 --> 00:26:14.174
<v Speaker 3>or not.

00:26:14.975 --> 00:26:16.894
<v Speaker 0>Yep. So you're talking about a kubelet flag

00:26:16.894 --> 00:26:19.294
<v Speaker 0>that allows you to specify a different directory

00:26:19.294 --> 00:26:21.215
<v Speaker 0>for the static manifest.

00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:24.710
<v Speaker 0>You can confirm that if you want. I'm

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:27.349
<v Speaker 0>happy to tell you that it's not changed.

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:30.630
<v Speaker 0>But it should be looking in the Etsy

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:32.309
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes manifest.

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:37.029
<v Speaker 0>Yes, Russell. You are the only person who

00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:40.144
<v Speaker 0>has recompiled the Kubelet. You evil evil person.

00:26:45.985 --> 00:26:47.025
<v Speaker 3>Advertiser.

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:55.129
<v Speaker 3>Okay. So why would the kubelet

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:56.649
<v Speaker 3>not start

00:26:57.850 --> 00:26:59.690
<v Speaker 3>a static pod

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:03.850
<v Speaker 3>defined in the manifest folder?

00:27:08.845 --> 00:27:10.044
<v Speaker 3>Do we have this?

00:27:11.005 --> 00:27:12.124
<v Speaker 0>I find a

00:27:12.924 --> 00:27:16.365
<v Speaker 0>good way to kind of check this. Restarting

00:27:16.365 --> 00:27:18.365
<v Speaker 0>the Kubelet and you've tailing the logs from

00:27:18.365 --> 00:27:20.365
<v Speaker 0>the start usually does reveal a bit more

00:27:20.365 --> 00:27:20.765
<v Speaker 0>information.

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.660
<v Speaker 0>You got five minutes left. Yeah. Okay.

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:26.260
<v Speaker 3>Let's actually

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.100
<v Speaker 3>would can we

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:34.340
<v Speaker 3>do we have screen? You

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.985
<v Speaker 0>can use screen. Yep. Okay.

00:27:43.865 --> 00:27:45.865
<v Speaker 3>That's

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:57.100
<v Speaker 3>Loading cert starting controller.

00:27:58.140 --> 00:27:58.860
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

00:28:03.595 --> 00:28:04.155
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.400
<v Speaker 3>K. So I

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.120
<v Speaker 3>see for creating

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.320
<v Speaker 3>already exist.

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.600
<v Speaker 3>And then get

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:27.520
<v Speaker 3>preparing.

00:28:30.295 --> 00:28:32.534
<v Speaker 0>So did you see anything for ETD there?

00:28:33.255 --> 00:28:36.855
<v Speaker 3>I yeah. I saw this, the deleted smear

00:28:36.855 --> 00:28:37.895
<v Speaker 3>pod.

00:28:38.855 --> 00:28:41.095
<v Speaker 3>And then I saw

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:44.470
<v Speaker 3>failed to

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:51.350
<v Speaker 3>something about probe.

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:53.030
<v Speaker 3>But

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:55.030
<v Speaker 3>okay. Let's leave it like this.

00:29:03.525 --> 00:29:04.165
<v Speaker 3>So

00:29:04.805 --> 00:29:06.965
<v Speaker 3>it looks like we have

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:15.190
<v Speaker 0>Good cold dropping down to cray control. I

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:16.950
<v Speaker 0>think that that should help.

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:19.669
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. I'm not sure how.

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:22.310
<v Speaker 3>Copy paste.

00:29:25.155 --> 00:29:26.435
<v Speaker 0>I can do that for you if you

00:29:26.435 --> 00:29:27.395
<v Speaker 0>want. Oh, you got it.

00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:40.230
<v Speaker 3>Okay. A bit more

00:29:42.309 --> 00:29:43.269
<v Speaker 0>oh, no.

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:46.549
<v Speaker 3>Find oh, because it's

00:29:48.309 --> 00:29:49.109
<v Speaker 3>p s.

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:51.510
<v Speaker 3>Let's see. Looks

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:52.309
<v Speaker 3>like it's running.

00:29:54.705 --> 00:29:55.985
<v Speaker 3>Copy.

00:29:55.985 --> 00:29:57.825
<v Speaker 3>Is there a way to

00:29:59.265 --> 00:30:01.345
<v Speaker 3>easy copy

00:30:01.985 --> 00:30:02.945
<v Speaker 3>and paste?

00:30:04.785 --> 00:30:07.105
<v Speaker 0>You just have to what operating system are

00:30:07.105 --> 00:30:07.425
<v Speaker 0>you on?

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.320
<v Speaker 3>Windows Chrome?

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.720
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Control c and control v in your

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:17.160
<v Speaker 0>browser should hopefully work just just fine. Yeah.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.559
<v Speaker 3>I tried, but it didn't seem to work.

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:20.360
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:21.000
<v Speaker 3>So

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:22.760
<v Speaker 3>cache is open.

00:30:28.175 --> 00:30:29.534
<v Speaker 3>Does it work now?

00:30:32.735 --> 00:30:33.775
<v Speaker 3>Oh, okay.

00:30:34.415 --> 00:30:35.135
<v Speaker 3>So

00:30:35.615 --> 00:30:36.895
<v Speaker 3>it somehow

00:30:36.895 --> 00:30:37.615
<v Speaker 3>fixed it.

00:30:39.179 --> 00:30:41.259
<v Speaker 0>I have no idea why.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.700
<v Speaker 3>It it shouldn't help?

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:47.019
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:48.379
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:50.860
<v Speaker 0>But, you know, the the name of the

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.540
<v Speaker 0>game is the update image. So if it

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:54.595
<v Speaker 0>works, it works. But, yeah, I'm I'm a

00:30:54.595 --> 00:30:55.874
<v Speaker 0>bit confused by that.

00:30:56.995 --> 00:30:57.955
<v Speaker 3>So now

00:30:58.035 --> 00:30:59.075
<v Speaker 3>we're two.

00:31:00.595 --> 00:31:02.595
<v Speaker 0>So you have to upgrade the clustered application

00:31:02.595 --> 00:31:03.875
<v Speaker 0>from v one to v two.

00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:11.929
<v Speaker 3>Do we have canines?

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:14.809
<v Speaker 3>No. We do not. Do

00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:20.410
<v Speaker 3>we have nano?

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:20.890
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:31:28.595 --> 00:31:29.875
<v Speaker 3>The name cluster.

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:38.700
<v Speaker 3>Oh,

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:39.419
<v Speaker 3>no.

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:42.780
<v Speaker 3>How do I

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:45.419
<v Speaker 3>well, I guess I don't.

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:50.105
<v Speaker 3>Where is the image? So to v two.

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:13.130
<v Speaker 0>Is it working?

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:18.170
<v Speaker 3>Can you still still see my screen?

00:32:20.044 --> 00:32:21.405
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Run kubectl

00:32:21.405 --> 00:32:22.205
<v Speaker 0>get pods.

00:32:22.605 --> 00:32:23.965
<v Speaker 0>Do we have a new pod?

00:32:27.325 --> 00:32:29.485
<v Speaker 0>We do not. Okay. Did not.

00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:35.289
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.

00:32:38.809 --> 00:32:41.450
<v Speaker 3>Do we have a Oh, look at that.

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:43.690
<v Speaker 0>The controller manager is also broken.

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:46.730
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Alright. You've got about one minute left.

00:32:48.495 --> 00:32:49.135
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

00:32:49.935 --> 00:32:51.375
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. Just let me know when

00:32:52.095 --> 00:32:54.175
<v Speaker 0>You've made amazing progress. I I have no

00:32:54.175 --> 00:32:55.695
<v Speaker 0>idea why that API

00:32:56.015 --> 00:32:57.455
<v Speaker 0>server is working right now.

00:32:58.495 --> 00:32:59.215
<v Speaker 3>What

00:33:00.175 --> 00:33:00.975
<v Speaker 3>can you

00:33:01.535 --> 00:33:03.775
<v Speaker 3>say what

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:05.870
<v Speaker 3>should have been the the issue? I'll wait

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:07.870
<v Speaker 0>till the end of the episode just

00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:10.110
<v Speaker 0>in case it comes back and breaks again.

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:12.270
<v Speaker 0>I don't wanna give it away, but we'll

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:14.190
<v Speaker 0>we'll go over the break and for sure.

00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:16.350
<v Speaker 3>HTTP

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:17.390
<v Speaker 3>probe failed.

00:33:19.274 --> 00:33:22.234
<v Speaker 3>So I guess there's a liveness probe

00:33:22.235 --> 00:33:22.874
<v Speaker 3>and

00:33:25.995 --> 00:33:26.554
<v Speaker 3>manifest

00:33:27.514 --> 00:33:28.394
<v Speaker 3>cube.

00:33:29.995 --> 00:33:31.514
<v Speaker 3>Controller manager, I think.

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:36.510
<v Speaker 3>Can I remove it?

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:39.790
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Or You can if you want.

00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:46.195
<v Speaker 0>I'll let you finish finish this change, and

00:33:46.195 --> 00:33:47.635
<v Speaker 0>we'll see if anything's working. And then we'll

00:33:47.635 --> 00:33:49.154
<v Speaker 0>swap you out for someone else because you're

00:33:49.154 --> 00:33:50.755
<v Speaker 0>a little bit over, but I'll let you

00:33:50.755 --> 00:33:53.394
<v Speaker 0>finish what you're working on. Oh, okay. Okay.

00:33:53.394 --> 00:33:53.874
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

00:33:54.355 --> 00:33:55.875
<v Speaker 3>That's fine. That's the manager

00:33:55.875 --> 00:33:56.434
<v Speaker 3>usually

00:33:57.390 --> 00:33:57.790
<v Speaker 3>has

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:00.990
<v Speaker 3>have a RIPE NOS pro? It does indeed.

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:01.470
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:06.190
<v Speaker 3>Describe.

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:08.989
<v Speaker 3>Yes. We should

00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:10.670
<v Speaker 3>oh,

00:34:13.574 --> 00:34:14.215
<v Speaker 3>yeah.

00:34:14.935 --> 00:34:16.295
<v Speaker 0>You can move it out and back in.

00:34:16.295 --> 00:34:17.815
<v Speaker 0>That's a good trick. Yep. It usually helps

00:34:17.815 --> 00:34:20.135
<v Speaker 0>speed it up. Alright. The comments are saying

00:34:20.135 --> 00:34:22.455
<v Speaker 0>that Benjamin did actually run a cube admin

00:34:22.455 --> 00:34:23.735
<v Speaker 0>in a on a machine.

00:34:25.255 --> 00:34:27.175
<v Speaker 0>I didn't clock that. It must have skipped

00:34:27.175 --> 00:34:28.135
<v Speaker 0>past me when I was

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:30.110
<v Speaker 0>looking at the comments.

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:32.030
<v Speaker 0>Cool. But I think that should be okay.

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:33.150
<v Speaker 0>I don't think we keep

00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:34.270
<v Speaker 0>in it.

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:36.270
<v Speaker 0>Whatever. Think I changed. But

00:34:37.390 --> 00:34:38.910
<v Speaker 0>I'll check. I'll check.

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:41.150
<v Speaker 3>And we

00:34:41.390 --> 00:34:42.270
<v Speaker 3>dot

00:34:48.984 --> 00:34:50.505
<v Speaker 0>Okay. It's restarting. Yep.

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.360
<v Speaker 0>You have a controller manager.

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.880
<v Speaker 3>And

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:00.680
<v Speaker 3>my cluster

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:01.480
<v Speaker 3>pod

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:02.600
<v Speaker 3>is still

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.080
<v Speaker 3>not doing anything.

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:05.880
<v Speaker 3>Just

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.455
<v Speaker 3>on this, and then I'll pass it over.

00:35:12.415 --> 00:35:13.695
<v Speaker 0>A wrong name, Swiss.

00:35:14.895 --> 00:35:15.935
<v Speaker 4>Oh, yeah.

<v Speaker 3>Okay.

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:31.110

<v Speaker 0>I have no idea why it's fixed, but

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:05.890
<v Speaker 0>does it matter? You fixed it, so well

00:36:05.890 --> 00:36:06.130
<v Speaker 0>done.

00:36:07.704 --> 00:36:09.944
<v Speaker 3>It it happens sometime. Like, you you fix

00:36:09.944 --> 00:36:12.025
<v Speaker 3>it and you don't know why it works.

00:36:12.025 --> 00:36:13.224
<v Speaker 0>Well, let's take a look at some of

00:36:13.224 --> 00:36:15.145
<v Speaker 0>the breaks in this machine. Right? So if

00:36:15.145 --> 00:36:17.224
<v Speaker 0>we take a look at the Kubernetes

00:36:17.224 --> 00:36:18.025
<v Speaker 0>manifest

00:36:18.345 --> 00:36:20.825
<v Speaker 0>now the Kubernetes may have broken may have

00:36:20.825 --> 00:36:21.305
<v Speaker 0>fixed this,

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.720
<v Speaker 0>but I'm not sure. Oh, I need to

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.240
<v Speaker 0>test the browser because the

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:28.720
<v Speaker 0>then causes a little bit of trouble.

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.760
<v Speaker 0>I changed the name of

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.000
<v Speaker 0>the entity

00:36:35.535 --> 00:36:38.255
<v Speaker 0>node in the manifest. So, actually,

00:36:38.335 --> 00:36:40.015
<v Speaker 0>the entity shouldn't have been able to come

00:36:40.015 --> 00:36:40.735
<v Speaker 0>back up,

00:36:41.694 --> 00:36:43.295
<v Speaker 0>which I'm a little bit confused, but it

00:36:43.295 --> 00:36:43.855
<v Speaker 0>did

00:36:44.095 --> 00:36:46.975
<v Speaker 0>because its real name is one.

00:36:47.055 --> 00:36:48.174
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. One. Yeah.

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:49.840
<v Speaker 0>But

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:53.600
<v Speaker 3>oh, let's see. I would have probably not

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.440
<v Speaker 3>called that.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.120
<v Speaker 0>Also, nobody said an alias,

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.280
<v Speaker 3>which is It's bit quite

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.720
<v Speaker 3>weird with, like, changing

00:37:03.494 --> 00:37:06.775
<v Speaker 3>underlying IPs or host names or, like, it

00:37:06.775 --> 00:37:07.255
<v Speaker 3>kind

00:37:07.894 --> 00:37:10.535
<v Speaker 3>of breaks and you need to manually

00:37:10.694 --> 00:37:11.415
<v Speaker 3>fix it.

00:37:12.375 --> 00:37:15.015
<v Speaker 3>So yeah. But it came back on that,

00:37:15.015 --> 00:37:16.454
<v Speaker 0>and that that's the only mission. The the

00:37:16.454 --> 00:37:19.190
<v Speaker 0>other gotcha here was that if you'd set

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:21.829
<v Speaker 0>an alias decay, which 99%

00:37:21.829 --> 00:37:22.950
<v Speaker 0>of people do,

00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:25.750
<v Speaker 0>things would have been a little bit broken.

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:27.430
<v Speaker 0>But because you kept using kubectl

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:29.670
<v Speaker 0>in fact, no. Now it's broken. S e

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:30.950
<v Speaker 0>z is now broken. Anyway.

00:37:32.555 --> 00:37:34.795
<v Speaker 0>Oh, well. Yeah. I changed the auto complete

00:37:34.795 --> 00:37:36.155
<v Speaker 0>on the k alias to be the get

00:37:36.155 --> 00:37:37.355
<v Speaker 0>command. So

00:37:37.835 --> 00:37:39.835
<v Speaker 0>just as a mails annoyance to people. But

00:37:39.835 --> 00:37:41.435
<v Speaker 0>it doesn't matter. Like I said, please drop

00:37:41.435 --> 00:37:42.955
<v Speaker 0>an email david@rockwood.com.

00:37:42.955 --> 00:37:44.155
<v Speaker 0>I will hook you up with that feature,

00:37:44.155 --> 00:37:46.075
<v Speaker 0>and thank you for for joining. We've got

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:47.780
<v Speaker 0>one more cluster to fix that I'm gonna

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:49.060
<v Speaker 0>get someone else on.

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:52.100
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Thank you for having me. Cheers.

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:53.620
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:57.300
<v Speaker 0>Damn you, cluster.

00:38:01.184 --> 00:38:03.905
<v Speaker 0>Cool. Alright. I'm gonna open the buzzers again.

00:38:03.905 --> 00:38:05.184
<v Speaker 0>So if you wanna come on and take

00:38:05.184 --> 00:38:07.025
<v Speaker 0>a pop at cluster number two,

00:38:08.224 --> 00:38:10.625
<v Speaker 0>we've got more Amazon vouchers to give away.

00:38:10.625 --> 00:38:12.385
<v Speaker 0>The link is there. I'll give you all

00:38:12.385 --> 00:38:14.450
<v Speaker 0>another ten, fifteen seconds to get back into

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:16.210
<v Speaker 0>the buzzer room if you're not already, and

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:18.050
<v Speaker 0>then I'm going to unlock the buzzers.

00:38:22.529 --> 00:38:23.410
<v Speaker 0>No

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:25.170
<v Speaker 0>idea how it's a d got back online

00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:25.810
<v Speaker 0>there.

00:38:26.529 --> 00:38:27.250
<v Speaker 0>That's annoying.

00:38:30.665 --> 00:38:32.745
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I'm going to unlock the buzzers at

00:38:32.745 --> 00:38:33.625
<v Speaker 0>a random moment.

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:45.589
<v Speaker 0>Said you were close, but FHKE

00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:46.390
<v Speaker 0>was

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:47.190
<v Speaker 0>first.

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.950
<v Speaker 0>So

00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:51.430
<v Speaker 0>link has gone into the YouTube chat.

00:38:52.789 --> 00:38:55.029
<v Speaker 0>Please come and join me, FHKE.

00:38:56.744 --> 00:38:59.065
<v Speaker 0>I will get you access to cluster two.

00:39:02.424 --> 00:39:04.585
<v Speaker 0>I'll open a session just now.

00:39:06.345 --> 00:39:07.865
<v Speaker 0>I'm looking forward to this one,

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:09.590
<v Speaker 0>I think.

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:20.150
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I'll give you another

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:21.990
<v Speaker 0>twenty seconds, FHKE

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:23.510
<v Speaker 0>and then oh, there we go.

00:39:25.235 --> 00:39:26.035
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:39:29.155 --> 00:39:29.875
<v Speaker 5>Hello.

00:39:30.515 --> 00:39:31.875
<v Speaker 5>Hey. How's it going?

00:39:32.195 --> 00:39:34.595
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Well, I'm a bit disappointed that my

00:39:34.595 --> 00:39:37.590
<v Speaker 0>first break was only partial break, but sometimes

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:39.430
<v Speaker 0>that happens on clusters. I'm not gonna dwell

00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:41.110
<v Speaker 0>on it. How are how are you doing?

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:42.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. Good. Thanks.

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:45.110
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Can

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:45.670
<v Speaker 0>you

00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:48.390
<v Speaker 0>give me your GitHub username, please?

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:51.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah. Sure. It's f h k. So that's

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:52.790
<v Speaker 5>the one I use for here.

00:39:57.005 --> 00:39:58.845
<v Speaker 0>K. Let's get you added.

00:40:00.125 --> 00:40:02.285
<v Speaker 0>So you're gonna get an email just now.

00:40:02.605 --> 00:40:04.045
<v Speaker 0>If you just click on that and accept

00:40:04.045 --> 00:40:08.840
<v Speaker 0>the invitation and then go to join.cluster.live.

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:10.920
<v Speaker 0>We will get you into cluster number two.

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:12.360
<v Speaker 0>So we haven't seen anything to do with

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.040
<v Speaker 0>cluster number two, so you're starting from a

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:14.920
<v Speaker 0>fresh slate.

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:16.440
<v Speaker 5>Good stuff.

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.000
<v Speaker 0>Dan asks, is this the first live Kubernetes

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.120
<v Speaker 0>debugging session you've hosted?

00:40:22.715 --> 00:40:25.755
<v Speaker 0>No. No. We have over 42 episodes of

00:40:25.755 --> 00:40:27.755
<v Speaker 0>clustered. This is the first one we've made

00:40:27.755 --> 00:40:30.475
<v Speaker 0>interactive with the audience actually participating,

00:40:30.475 --> 00:40:33.115
<v Speaker 0>but there are loads and loads of episodes

00:40:33.115 --> 00:40:34.875
<v Speaker 0>of clustered on the channel. So go to

00:40:34.875 --> 00:40:36.395
<v Speaker 0>rockwood.live and check that out.

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:43.170
<v Speaker 0>Russell asking, can I save the session history?

00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:44.930
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. The session history will be there in

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:46.450
<v Speaker 0>the other log of Teleport and in the

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:48.130
<v Speaker 0>bash history. I'm I'm gonna go back through

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:49.170
<v Speaker 0>it and see if I can work with

00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:51.330
<v Speaker 0>what happened. It did appear SGD was broken

00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:52.610
<v Speaker 0>at the end there as well.

00:40:54.345 --> 00:40:54.985
<v Speaker 0>So

00:40:55.305 --> 00:40:58.025
<v Speaker 0>but the the image was updated, so I

00:40:58.025 --> 00:40:59.465
<v Speaker 0>can't I can't argue.

00:41:00.665 --> 00:41:02.185
<v Speaker 0>So Where do I need to go to?

00:41:02.185 --> 00:41:04.025
<v Speaker 0>If you go to your email, you should

00:41:04.025 --> 00:41:05.545
<v Speaker 0>have a GitHub team invitation.

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.680
<v Speaker 5>Yeah. I've just joined that GitHub. Oh, alright.

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:12.280
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So if you go to join .clustered.live,

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:16.920
<v Speaker 0>Andrew is asking which episode was the Unicode

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:20.280
<v Speaker 0>one. Search for clustered Guy Templeton

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:21.720
<v Speaker 0>or Guinevere,

00:41:22.175 --> 00:41:24.895
<v Speaker 0>who was my host cohost on that episode.

00:41:25.455 --> 00:41:26.895
<v Speaker 0>And that is the one with the Unicode

00:41:26.895 --> 00:41:28.815
<v Speaker 0>break that we never speak of again.

00:41:31.615 --> 00:41:34.255
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So if you're logged on to, Teleport

00:41:34.255 --> 00:41:36.895
<v Speaker 0>now, if you expand the activity menu

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.200
<v Speaker 0>you go to active sessions. Cool.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah. I can see that. And then options

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.480
<v Speaker 0>and join,

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:45.720
<v Speaker 0>and then just type echo hello, anything to

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.320
<v Speaker 0>let me know that you're in this session.

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:51.000
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:41:51.835 --> 00:41:54.155
<v Speaker 0>I will export your KubeConfig for you, and

00:41:54.155 --> 00:41:55.755
<v Speaker 0>then the cluster is all yours for the

00:41:55.755 --> 00:41:57.115
<v Speaker 0>next ten minutes.

00:41:59.435 --> 00:42:01.115
<v Speaker 0>And I'll fix my spelling as well.

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:08.140
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:14.220
<v Speaker 0>All yours. Cool. Best of luck.

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:16.540
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry. What's the challenge on this one?

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:19.340
<v Speaker 0>Same again. Upgrade the clustered application from v

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:20.220
<v Speaker 0>one to v two.

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:42.240
<v Speaker 5>Okay. No event.

00:42:53.395 --> 00:42:55.715
<v Speaker 0>The pending salema operator is okay and can

00:42:55.715 --> 00:42:56.515
<v Speaker 0>be ignored.

00:42:57.155 --> 00:42:57.715
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:43:28.805 --> 00:43:31.605
<v Speaker 0>The chat comments are assisting you here if

00:43:31.605 --> 00:43:32.244
<v Speaker 0>you can see them.

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah. No. Sorry. I missed the I really

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:36.800
<v Speaker 5>thought I've done that.

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:47.040
<v Speaker 0>It's just a clustered with a k,

00:43:47.825 --> 00:43:49.745
<v Speaker 0>Like, Rawkode with a key.

00:43:57.985 --> 00:43:58.705
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

00:43:58.865 --> 00:43:59.585
<v Speaker 0>where'd it go?

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.240
<v Speaker 5>I think staying it down.

00:44:21.765 --> 00:44:23.205
<v Speaker 5>What's going be done?

00:44:24.165 --> 00:44:24.805
<v Speaker 0>Good question.

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:35.970
<v Speaker 5>Can't see anything obviously there.

00:44:39.855 --> 00:44:40.895
<v Speaker 5>No. No. No.

00:44:44.815 --> 00:44:45.615
<v Speaker 0>Guess, though.

00:44:46.575 --> 00:44:47.695
<v Speaker 0>I wonder if there are any comm jobs

00:44:47.695 --> 00:44:48.175
<v Speaker 0>or anything.

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:54.560
<v Speaker 0>Yep. Current jobs.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.600
<v Speaker 5>I can look in the APIs overall, but

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:00.720
<v Speaker 5>it logs up there. What's up?

00:45:14.165 --> 00:45:17.205
<v Speaker 5>They don't have. What

00:45:17.205 --> 00:45:18.965
<v Speaker 0>were you looking for in the manifest there?

00:45:19.599 --> 00:45:20.960
<v Speaker 5>Just see if the audit log was set

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.240
<v Speaker 5>up for the API seven.

00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:23.520
<v Speaker 0>I

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:25.839
<v Speaker 0>should set them up, actually. That would that

00:45:25.839 --> 00:45:26.720
<v Speaker 0>would be good.

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:29.360
<v Speaker 0>An improvement for future clusters, I think.

00:45:31.599 --> 00:45:33.599
<v Speaker 5>I can just sleep there. So what's that?

00:45:33.599 --> 00:45:34.480
<v Speaker 5>What's the current amount?

00:45:37.255 --> 00:45:38.775
<v Speaker 5>So I'm gonna guess this is some kind

00:45:38.775 --> 00:45:40.455
<v Speaker 5>of loop, and every six sixty seconds, it's

00:45:40.455 --> 00:45:41.495
<v Speaker 5>gonna scale it down.

00:45:47.655 --> 00:45:49.655
<v Speaker 0>This is the cluster that I broke Carl

00:45:49.655 --> 00:45:50.215
<v Speaker 0>off. Yeah.

00:46:04.115 --> 00:46:06.035
<v Speaker 0>Yes. My job is to laugh, Carlos, not

00:46:06.035 --> 00:46:06.755
<v Speaker 0>to help.

00:46:07.395 --> 00:46:09.315
<v Speaker 0>This is the only episode of Clustered where

00:46:09.315 --> 00:46:10.595
<v Speaker 0>I have not been on

00:46:10.994 --> 00:46:12.675
<v Speaker 0>the line with someone else for fixing. So

00:46:12.675 --> 00:46:14.195
<v Speaker 0>I'm enjoying this one.

00:46:16.595 --> 00:46:18.440
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I'm wishing I had had those

00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:20.760
<v Speaker 0>sleep processes in the process table with LD

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:21.880
<v Speaker 0>preload, but

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:23.720
<v Speaker 0>that may have been a bit too mean.

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.200
<v Speaker 0>But there's definitely stuff in roll capping on

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:28.760
<v Speaker 0>this machine.

00:46:31.495 --> 00:46:32.935
<v Speaker 0>You got five minutes left.

00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:47.170
<v Speaker 0>So you ran who, checking for other users.

00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:49.090
<v Speaker 0>You'd run jobs to see if there was

00:46:49.090 --> 00:46:50.210
<v Speaker 0>anything scheduled.

00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:53.330
<v Speaker 0>Nothing so far. If you could choose a

00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:55.570
<v Speaker 0>pager on the longer commands, it just means

00:46:55.570 --> 00:46:56.770
<v Speaker 0>we see what you see as well for

00:46:56.770 --> 00:46:56.930
<v Speaker 0>you.

00:46:57.705 --> 00:46:59.385
<v Speaker 5>Yeah. Sure. Thank you.

00:47:06.825 --> 00:47:07.865
<v Speaker 5>It's obviously running.

00:47:26.184 --> 00:47:28.265
<v Speaker 0>See, this is one of the breaks where

00:47:28.265 --> 00:47:30.345
<v Speaker 0>I was like, this is super sneaky. And

00:47:30.345 --> 00:47:32.425
<v Speaker 0>then five minutes before we went live, I

00:47:32.425 --> 00:47:33.865
<v Speaker 0>was like, it's too obvious. Like, it's just

00:47:33.865 --> 00:47:35.865
<v Speaker 0>far too obvious. And now I'm not I'm

00:47:35.865 --> 00:47:37.305
<v Speaker 0>I'm so swayed. I don't know.

00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:39.800
<v Speaker 0>I hope you find it because I want

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:42.280
<v Speaker 0>I've I've gotta talk about it, but let's

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:43.000
<v Speaker 0>let's see what happens.

00:47:58.994 --> 00:47:59.875
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

00:48:03.395 --> 00:48:04.994
<v Speaker 0>Clone would be too easy, wouldn't it?

00:48:24.995 --> 00:48:27.155
<v Speaker 0>Peter has just joined and is asking what

00:48:27.155 --> 00:48:29.315
<v Speaker 0>is the issue. Well, the issue is

00:48:30.035 --> 00:48:30.835
<v Speaker 0>that

00:48:31.155 --> 00:48:32.995
<v Speaker 0>every time our

00:48:33.075 --> 00:48:35.955
<v Speaker 0>deployment is scaled from zero replicas to a

00:48:35.955 --> 00:48:36.675
<v Speaker 0>positive number,

00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:40.230
<v Speaker 0>Some rogue process appears

00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:42.390
<v Speaker 0>to be scaling it back to zero.

00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:44.470
<v Speaker 0>We are looking for that process.

00:48:56.445 --> 00:48:57.885
<v Speaker 5>I mean, if it's running on the host,

00:48:57.885 --> 00:48:59.485
<v Speaker 5>maybe I could just move the KubeConfig somewhere

00:48:59.485 --> 00:49:01.165
<v Speaker 5>else, and it would fail to authenticate.

00:49:05.005 --> 00:49:05.805
<v Speaker 0>I like that.

00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:12.530
<v Speaker 0>Very clever.

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:20.690
<v Speaker 5>Terminal

00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:21.170
<v Speaker 5>just.

00:49:22.095 --> 00:49:24.095
<v Speaker 0>If you need to resize the window, it

00:49:24.095 --> 00:49:26.335
<v Speaker 0>does help. It's a bug in xterm JS.

00:49:26.575 --> 00:49:28.895
<v Speaker 0>Just resizing it by, like, one pixel does

00:49:28.895 --> 00:49:30.255
<v Speaker 0>seem to kick it back in line or

00:49:30.255 --> 00:49:32.415
<v Speaker 0>type in reset as a command.

00:49:32.895 --> 00:49:34.335
<v Speaker 5>Oh, yeah. Seems to be working now.

00:49:51.845 --> 00:49:54.325
<v Speaker 5>Okay. It's happening again. So it's not probably

00:49:54.325 --> 00:49:55.765
<v Speaker 5>not something running on the hose.

00:49:57.285 --> 00:49:59.125
<v Speaker 0>So maybe it's, I guess, on a container.

00:49:59.845 --> 00:50:00.645
<v Speaker 1>Potentially.

00:50:00.645 --> 00:50:00.805
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:50:05.799 --> 00:50:07.720
<v Speaker 0>Alright. You have two minute.

00:50:09.079 --> 00:50:11.079
<v Speaker 0>I like your process here, though. You're doing

00:50:11.079 --> 00:50:11.640
<v Speaker 0>well.

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:13.080
<v Speaker 5>Thanks.

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.319
<v Speaker 5>Yeah. I can't see anything, but, like, obviously,

00:50:15.319 --> 00:50:16.599
<v Speaker 5>they'll be doing this when I get good

00:50:16.599 --> 00:50:16.839
<v Speaker 5>data.

00:50:17.925 --> 00:50:19.765
<v Speaker 0>Depends whether you trust all the names of

00:50:19.765 --> 00:50:21.125
<v Speaker 0>the processes, I guess.

00:50:21.525 --> 00:50:22.405
<v Speaker 5>That's true.

00:50:22.965 --> 00:50:25.205
<v Speaker 0>There's a really cool command for debugging every

00:50:25.205 --> 00:50:27.045
<v Speaker 0>image in the cluster. I am not saying

00:50:27.045 --> 00:50:29.205
<v Speaker 0>that's gonna give you any information whatsoever,

00:50:29.285 --> 00:50:29.765
<v Speaker 0>but

00:50:30.485 --> 00:50:31.285
<v Speaker 0>you never know.

00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:33.809
<v Speaker 0>You're already doing it.

00:50:44.705 --> 00:50:46.785
<v Speaker 5>So where did they make that one?

00:50:46.945 --> 00:50:47.905
<v Speaker 0>Which one?

00:50:48.385 --> 00:50:49.505
<v Speaker 5>This one here.

00:50:49.665 --> 00:50:51.345
<v Speaker 0>I can't see what you select. You'll need

00:50:51.345 --> 00:50:54.305
<v Speaker 0>to Sorry. It's the one that begins SHA256.

00:50:56.109 --> 00:50:58.349
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's just that's just one that's resolved

00:50:58.349 --> 00:51:01.470
<v Speaker 0>to a sha. If you were to on

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:03.550
<v Speaker 0>your Gret, do a cap dash capital b

00:51:03.550 --> 00:51:05.070
<v Speaker 0>two, it would also show you the name,

00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:07.070
<v Speaker 0>I think, before it. So it could be

00:51:07.070 --> 00:51:08.349
<v Speaker 0>extra matchers.

00:51:08.349 --> 00:51:10.270
<v Speaker 0>So before the dash I do. Yeah.

00:51:13.015 --> 00:51:15.095
<v Speaker 0>All right, you got about thirty seconds and

00:51:15.095 --> 00:51:16.615
<v Speaker 0>then I'll swap you out.

00:51:19.895 --> 00:51:21.735
<v Speaker 0>But I feel that you've made really good

00:51:21.735 --> 00:51:22.855
<v Speaker 0>progress for people here.

00:51:37.519 --> 00:51:39.359
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Your time Yep.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.175
<v Speaker 0>Nice work, though. Very well done. Yeah. Thank

00:51:42.175 --> 00:51:42.655
<v Speaker 0>you.

00:51:43.375 --> 00:51:45.454
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Drop me an email, david@rawkode.com.

00:51:45.454 --> 00:51:46.734
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna send that to my other time.

00:51:46.734 --> 00:51:48.415
<v Speaker 0>And I'll put it into the the comments

00:51:48.415 --> 00:51:49.694
<v Speaker 0>as well at the end of the episode.

00:51:49.694 --> 00:51:51.694
<v Speaker 0>But, yeah, you got a an Amazon voucher.

00:51:51.694 --> 00:51:54.015
<v Speaker 0>Thank you for joining me. And Thank you.

00:51:54.175 --> 00:51:56.175
<v Speaker 0>Let's see who else wants to come on.

00:51:58.010 --> 00:52:00.410
<v Speaker 0>Alright. The link for the buzzer is there.

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:02.410
<v Speaker 0>I'll give these all twenty seconds to get

00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:05.050
<v Speaker 0>ready. I'll unlock them at a random moment

00:52:05.050 --> 00:52:06.970
<v Speaker 0>in time. First one to buzz does get

00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:08.490
<v Speaker 0>to come on and join and see if

00:52:08.490 --> 00:52:09.690
<v Speaker 0>they can fix this cluster.

00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:23.860
<v Speaker 0>Vladimir,

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:26.340
<v Speaker 0>you are first. Please

<v Speaker 0>The link is in the chat. I'll see

00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:33.060
<v Speaker 0>you in a minute.

00:52:38.365 --> 00:52:40.605
<v Speaker 0>Carlos, a a different cluster or the same

00:52:40.605 --> 00:52:43.165
<v Speaker 0>one? It is the same cluster. I only

00:52:43.165 --> 00:52:45.485
<v Speaker 0>broke two clusters for today's episode. The first

00:52:45.485 --> 00:52:47.485
<v Speaker 0>one was fixed by

00:52:47.805 --> 00:52:48.685
<v Speaker 0>magic.

00:52:49.645 --> 00:52:50.765

<v Speaker 0>Something is scaling a replica or deployment a

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:20.140
<v Speaker 0>replica set time to zero. I

00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:27.980
<v Speaker 3>saw here.

00:56:02.444 --> 00:56:04.765
<v Speaker 0>It's half Postgres. Oh, because she said I

00:56:04.765 --> 00:56:06.525

<v Speaker 0>open right now.

01:00:05.619 --> 01:00:07.700
<v Speaker 7>Yeah. She was gonna come, but then it's

01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:11.025
<v Speaker 7>it's DevOps days London on the Thursday, Friday.

01:00:11.345 --> 01:00:12.785
<v Speaker 7>So that makes it a bit

01:00:13.744 --> 01:00:14.545
<v Speaker 7>Ah.

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:15.745
<v Speaker 7>Interesting.

01:00:16.945 --> 01:00:18.225
<v Speaker 0>Once you're in the session, if you could

01:00:18.225 --> 01:00:19.905
<v Speaker 0>please type echo hello or anything like that

01:00:19.905 --> 01:00:21.505
<v Speaker 0>to let me know that you're there. Perfect.

<v Speaker 0>You have ten minutes. Best of luck.

01:00:28.869 --> 01:00:29.430
<v Speaker 3>So

01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:34.630
<v Speaker 7>It's very different when you're on this side

01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:35.990
<v Speaker 7>of the screen, I've got to say.

01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:39.365
<v Speaker 0>Your ability to take will follow the window,

01:00:39.365 --> 01:00:40.405
<v Speaker 0>I guarantee it.

01:00:46.645 --> 01:00:48.325
<v Speaker 7>I was just checking in case you put

01:00:48.325 --> 01:00:50.724
<v Speaker 7>the deployment YAML in here, and it was

01:00:50.724 --> 01:00:52.885
<v Speaker 7>being auto

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.800
<v Speaker 7>sort of sculped down or something like that.

01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:58.680
<v Speaker 7>Where do we start? There's that command to

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.760
<v Speaker 7>get all the images. I'm just gonna Google

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:02.360
<v Speaker 7>it because I can never remember.

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:03.560
<v Speaker 7>I

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:06.760
<v Speaker 0>tend to use git control cluster dash and

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:09.635
<v Speaker 0>full dump and then grab for image. Yeah.

01:01:14.515 --> 01:01:16.195
<v Speaker 7>I wonder if I can paste.

01:01:17.395 --> 01:01:18.115
<v Speaker 7>No.

01:01:18.355 --> 01:01:19.155
<v Speaker 7>Paste.

01:01:19.315 --> 01:01:19.635
<v Speaker 7>Okay.

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:31.460
<v Speaker 7>What's the namespace? It's.

01:01:34.925 --> 01:01:35.645
<v Speaker 2>Alright.

01:01:38.605 --> 01:01:39.805
<v Speaker 7>Oh, it's before.

01:01:40.525 --> 01:01:41.805
<v Speaker 7>It's really annoying.

01:01:41.965 --> 01:01:45.005
<v Speaker 7>These two things. This sounds like some nice

01:01:45.005 --> 01:01:47.165
<v Speaker 0>twitches on that keyboard. What are you rocking?

01:01:49.484 --> 01:01:51.240
<v Speaker 7>M x Browns, I think.

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:54.120
<v Speaker 0>Oh, nice. I only have one mechanical keyboard,

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:54.680
<v Speaker 7>which

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:57.800
<v Speaker 7>shocks some people. I currently just got the

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:00.600
<v Speaker 0>Keychron q three, which I am loving right

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:03.035
<v Speaker 0>now. Although it is a heavy beast. So

01:02:03.195 --> 01:02:06.075
<v Speaker 7>Very nice. Is that, like, metal aluminum

01:02:06.075 --> 01:02:08.795
<v Speaker 7>thingy? Yeah. I got the knob version, so,

01:02:08.795 --> 01:02:11.435
<v Speaker 0>like, I can use that for random stuff.

01:02:12.635 --> 01:02:14.395
<v Speaker 0>Don't let me distract you from fixing the

01:02:14.395 --> 01:02:15.035
<v Speaker 0>cluster at all.

01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:21.300
<v Speaker 7>What's Kubefit DS and Kubefit? Kubefit is what

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:23.860
<v Speaker 0>we use to advertise the BGP address on

01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:26.580
<v Speaker 0>this echo Xpero cluster. You can ignore Kubefit

01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:27.460
<v Speaker 0>for today.

01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:28.660
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

01:02:31.875 --> 01:02:32.675
<v Speaker 7>CTR.

01:02:32.675 --> 01:02:34.755
<v Speaker 7>What was that other one that that does

01:02:35.075 --> 01:02:38.035
<v Speaker 7>the CRI one? CRI CTR, is it? That's

01:02:38.035 --> 01:02:39.155
<v Speaker 0>the one. Yeah.

01:02:41.955 --> 01:02:42.435
<v Speaker 7>Yes.

01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:46.310
<v Speaker 7>Agent. What's agent?

01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:48.310
<v Speaker 7>Oh, emissary

01:02:48.310 --> 01:02:49.430
<v Speaker 7>ingress agent.

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:52.710
<v Speaker 7>KubeScheduler.

01:02:59.095 --> 01:03:00.935
<v Speaker 7>I'm just doing the same things that everyone

01:03:00.935 --> 01:03:01.815
<v Speaker 7>else does.

01:03:02.615 --> 01:03:05.095
<v Speaker 7>Okay. So in case I see something different,

01:03:05.415 --> 01:03:07.335
<v Speaker 7>well, that unless you can see it.

01:03:09.895 --> 01:03:10.935
<v Speaker 7>Root root root.

01:03:11.490 --> 01:03:13.330
<v Speaker 7>Look for the hybrid things.

01:03:13.570 --> 01:03:15.330
<v Speaker 7>There's people saying stuff in chat that might

01:03:15.330 --> 01:03:17.250
<v Speaker 7>help me. Not yet. No.

01:03:17.570 --> 01:03:19.250
<v Speaker 0>Oh. I think we've stopped a lot of

01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:20.850
<v Speaker 0>hopefully, I've stopped a lot of people with

01:03:20.850 --> 01:03:23.010
<v Speaker 0>this one. Although Carlos is suggesting that you

01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:24.369
<v Speaker 0>check your mutation webhook.

01:03:26.435 --> 01:03:28.755
<v Speaker 0>Andrew thinks maybe something in an in a

01:03:28.755 --> 01:03:29.555
<v Speaker 0>container.

01:03:31.475 --> 01:03:32.755
<v Speaker 7>What is it? Mutating

01:03:32.995 --> 01:03:34.515
<v Speaker 0>Mutating webhook configuration.

01:03:34.755 --> 01:03:35.635
<v Speaker 0>Look.

01:03:35.955 --> 01:03:37.315
<v Speaker 0>Configurations.

01:03:38.310 --> 01:03:40.950
<v Speaker 0>Bug down 40 sleep, 60 in the process

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:42.390
<v Speaker 0>table. Yep.

01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:48.470
<v Speaker 7>How can I not spell mutating?

01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:50.310
<v Speaker 0>Mutating

01:03:50.310 --> 01:03:52.230
<v Speaker 0>webhook config. Yeah. That's right. Right?

01:04:01.015 --> 01:04:03.975
<v Speaker 7>It's actually being made. Run kubectl

01:04:03.975 --> 01:04:07.740
<v Speaker 0>API dash resources and get from music.

01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:14.620
<v Speaker 0>Which

01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:18.860
<v Speaker 7>one has sleep? Sleep.

01:04:24.585 --> 01:04:26.744
<v Speaker 7>There's a way to see the process tree.

01:04:26.744 --> 01:04:27.785
<v Speaker 7>If I pick a ped

01:04:28.905 --> 01:04:30.825
<v Speaker 0>Yes. You can see the process tree.

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:34.200
<v Speaker 7>And I can never remember how to do

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:34.760
<v Speaker 7>it.

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:37.880
<v Speaker 0>E f e f a u x would

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:39.160
<v Speaker 0>be a good way to do it.

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:42.280
<v Speaker 7>PS. What is it? E f? A u

01:04:43.175 --> 01:04:44.375
<v Speaker 0>AUX.

01:04:44.695 --> 01:04:45.495
<v Speaker 0>Well,

01:04:52.455 --> 01:04:53.575
<v Speaker 0>if you come up for sleep, you won't

01:04:53.575 --> 01:04:54.535
<v Speaker 0>see the process tree.

01:04:58.330 --> 01:04:59.770
<v Speaker 0>And if you use a pager, it means

01:04:59.770 --> 01:05:01.050
<v Speaker 0>we see what you see.

01:05:02.890 --> 01:05:03.770
<v Speaker 0>Thank you.

01:05:04.170 --> 01:05:04.810
<v Speaker 0>And

01:05:07.369 --> 01:05:08.810
<v Speaker 7>then we can search for sleep.

01:05:15.835 --> 01:05:17.755
<v Speaker 0>I mean, there's lots of harmless reasons sleep

01:05:17.755 --> 01:05:19.275
<v Speaker 0>could be running. Is there all

01:05:19.994 --> 01:05:22.234
<v Speaker 0>down and on sleep here? We all use

01:05:22.234 --> 01:05:23.275
<v Speaker 0>sleep in our scripts. Right?

01:05:43.085 --> 01:05:44.205
<v Speaker 0>What are you thinking?

01:05:46.204 --> 01:05:48.205
<v Speaker 7>See. I don't know.

01:05:51.484 --> 01:05:52.445
<v Speaker 3>What am I doing wrong?

01:05:53.730 --> 01:05:54.609
<v Speaker 7>CRI.

01:05:54.609 --> 01:05:56.530
<v Speaker 0>CRI CTL.

01:06:01.330 --> 01:06:04.369
<v Speaker 0>What subscribed purely to comment on the mutating

01:06:04.369 --> 01:06:06.050
<v Speaker 0>typo? Thank you, bot.

01:06:06.290 --> 01:06:07.810
<v Speaker 7>Oh, what did I do?

01:06:08.770 --> 01:06:09.410
<v Speaker 0>Mutating.

01:06:10.105 --> 01:06:11.945
<v Speaker 0>I don't know. It's been too long since

<v Speaker 0>we Too many a t a t a

01:06:13.705 --> 01:06:15.545
<v Speaker 7>t a t I n g's, I think.

01:06:18.345 --> 01:06:21.065
<v Speaker 0>Andrew is asking what's the KubePap pod that

01:06:21.065 --> 01:06:22.980
<v Speaker 0>is not named for the not named.

01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:26.660
<v Speaker 0>CubePad also runs a small

01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:30.580
<v Speaker 0>daemon set to advertise the BGP on every

01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:33.460
<v Speaker 0>machine. And the control plane one is the

01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:34.660
<v Speaker 0>leader election

01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:36.580
<v Speaker 0>and services routine stuff.

01:06:44.234 --> 01:06:46.234
<v Speaker 7>State not ready. It's because it's being

01:06:47.835 --> 01:06:49.595
<v Speaker 7>is it being paused

01:06:50.970 --> 01:06:52.010
<v Speaker 7>Or something.

01:06:52.090 --> 01:06:54.010
<v Speaker 7>What's doing that? What could do that?

01:06:56.330 --> 01:06:59.130
<v Speaker 0>Good comments there from Carlos and Bogdan.

01:07:01.370 --> 01:07:02.410
<v Speaker 0>Not that I want you to be able

01:07:02.410 --> 01:07:04.490
<v Speaker 0>to fix this or anything, but those are

01:07:04.490 --> 01:07:05.050
<v Speaker 0>good comments.

01:07:06.955 --> 01:07:09.275
<v Speaker 0>Carlos says concentrate in the process table.

01:07:10.075 --> 01:07:12.155
<v Speaker 0>If we need to, we'll jump into EBPF.

01:07:12.155 --> 01:07:13.755
<v Speaker 0>How's your EBPF, Allison?

01:07:14.795 --> 01:07:15.595
<v Speaker 0>Terrible.

01:07:18.475 --> 01:07:20.315
<v Speaker 0>Fuck Dan noticed ATQ

01:07:20.315 --> 01:07:20.715
<v Speaker 0>maybe.

01:07:23.810 --> 01:07:25.570
<v Speaker 7>I don't know what ATQ is.

01:07:30.210 --> 01:07:31.490
<v Speaker 7>What is ATQ?

01:07:33.010 --> 01:07:35.090
<v Speaker 0>It is a

01:07:37.454 --> 01:07:39.695
<v Speaker 0>command runner on Linux.

01:07:43.615 --> 01:07:44.575
<v Speaker 0>Settler for cron.

01:07:54.780 --> 01:08:00.460
<v Speaker 7>How do I view them? Minus

01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:04.700
<v Speaker 7>minus b. No. Q.

01:08:09.325 --> 01:08:10.924
<v Speaker 7>Oh, we can never send mail to the

<v Speaker 7>Someone was saying

01:08:31.859 --> 01:08:32.899
<v Speaker 7>processes. Yeah.

01:08:33.854 --> 01:08:37.054
<v Speaker 7>Everything's in everything's everything's running as a process.

01:08:37.774 --> 01:08:39.135
<v Speaker 0>Everything is a process.

01:08:39.295 --> 01:08:43.054
<v Speaker 7>Everything's a process. I mean, the PSEUXEF,

01:08:43.054 --> 01:08:44.814
<v Speaker 0>I mean, it shows you much more than

01:08:44.814 --> 01:08:45.774
<v Speaker 0>I think you

01:08:46.894 --> 01:08:48.734
<v Speaker 0>you you actually paid attention to.

01:08:50.199 --> 01:08:51.639
<v Speaker 0>Again, not that I want you to fix

01:08:51.639 --> 01:08:52.519
<v Speaker 0>this, but

<v Speaker 7>No.

01:09:17.524 --> 01:09:18.325
<v Speaker 7>Something's

01:09:18.325 --> 01:09:19.045
<v Speaker 7>running Chrome.

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:25.120
<v Speaker 7>SSHD is running.

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:30.239
<v Speaker 0>You've got one minute.

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:34.240
<v Speaker 0>Playing flies when you're having fun. Right? I

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:34.800
<v Speaker 0>know. Yeah.

01:09:36.105 --> 01:09:37.545
<v Speaker 7>Contained the share.

01:09:39.545 --> 01:09:41.305
<v Speaker 7>There's so many things on here.

01:09:42.425 --> 01:09:43.465
<v Speaker 7>Teleport.

01:09:44.025 --> 01:09:45.305
<v Speaker 7>Bash. Woo hoo.

01:09:46.185 --> 01:09:47.064
<v Speaker 7>Teleport.

01:09:47.305 --> 01:09:48.105
<v Speaker 0>Bugged

01:09:48.105 --> 01:09:50.585
<v Speaker 0>down. Somebody already moved admin.com

01:09:50.490 --> 01:09:51.370
<v Speaker 0>away,

01:09:51.370 --> 01:09:52.890
<v Speaker 0>and that made no difference.

01:09:53.530 --> 01:09:54.330
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm.

01:09:59.690 --> 01:10:01.370
<v Speaker 7>Just delete all the pods.

01:10:01.770 --> 01:10:03.130
<v Speaker 0>Please don't delete all the pods.

01:10:08.074 --> 01:10:09.755
<v Speaker 7>That's usually what I do

01:10:09.915 --> 01:10:11.994
<v Speaker 7>on the managed cluster when stuff's not working.

01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:20.090
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Your time is up, Alistair.

01:10:21.690 --> 01:10:23.450
<v Speaker 0>Thank you for joining us. Please email me,

01:10:23.450 --> 01:10:24.650
<v Speaker 0>david@rockwood.com.

01:10:24.650 --> 01:10:26.570
<v Speaker 0>I will get you the Amazon voucher,

01:10:26.730 --> 01:10:29.210
<v Speaker 0>and we will invite someone else on. Thanks,

01:10:29.210 --> 01:10:29.450
<v Speaker 0>man.

01:10:31.665 --> 01:10:32.385
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:10:32.625 --> 01:10:36.865
<v Speaker 0>So the link is on the page. CosmoBuzz.net

01:10:36.865 --> 01:10:38.065
<v Speaker 0>blah blah blah blah blah.

01:10:38.465 --> 01:10:40.625
<v Speaker 0>Get your buzzers ready. I will be unlocking

01:10:40.625 --> 01:10:42.945
<v Speaker 0>the buzzers a moment's early. First one to

01:10:42.945 --> 01:10:44.465
<v Speaker 0>buzz, the guest to come on and join

01:10:44.465 --> 01:10:46.940
<v Speaker 0>me. I think we'll do two more people.

01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:48.780
<v Speaker 0>We'll try and finish this at seven.

01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:51.260
<v Speaker 0>And then if it's not fixed, I will

01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:53.420
<v Speaker 0>run through the break on this cluster.

01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:56.300
<v Speaker 0>That oh.

01:10:57.445 --> 01:10:59.845
<v Speaker 0>Well, it said Dan, but now said it

01:10:59.845 --> 01:11:01.445
<v Speaker 0>was first. So I think it that's some

01:11:01.445 --> 01:11:03.525
<v Speaker 0>sort of weird sync on the buzzer. So

01:11:03.525 --> 01:11:05.845
<v Speaker 0>said, click the link and come and join

01:11:05.845 --> 01:11:06.405
<v Speaker 0>me.

01:11:08.165 --> 01:11:09.765
<v Speaker 0>I will paste it one more time.

01:11:14.590 --> 01:11:16.670
<v Speaker 0>And I will wait here patiently for Seth

01:11:16.670 --> 01:11:17.869
<v Speaker 0>to join us.

01:11:20.350 --> 01:11:22.350
<v Speaker 0>Seth has been active in the chat so

01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:24.190
<v Speaker 0>far, so I know he's got ideas.

01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:25.790
<v Speaker 0>Curious to see if he's gonna get to

01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:27.790
<v Speaker 0>the bottom of this skill down.

01:11:31.675 --> 01:11:33.835
<v Speaker 0>And I think Dan's the only other person

01:11:33.835 --> 01:11:35.675
<v Speaker 0>in the buzzer that's not been on. So

01:11:35.675 --> 01:11:37.355
<v Speaker 0>Dan, we'll get you on after Seth if

01:11:37.355 --> 01:11:38.794
<v Speaker 0>Seth doesn't fix it.

01:11:40.074 --> 01:11:42.474
<v Speaker 0>Because that was pretty close. So Dan, you

01:11:42.474 --> 01:11:43.195
<v Speaker 0>are next.

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:45.159

<v Speaker 0>I'm having fun. Are you having fun?

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:53.800
<v Speaker 2>I am. I am.

01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:57.720
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Dan's joining us too. Dan, you can

01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:59.995
<v Speaker 0>fix it next. Right? We're gonna give Seth

01:11:59.995 --> 01:12:02.155
<v Speaker 0>ten minutes and then and then Dan. So

01:12:02.155 --> 01:12:03.995
<v Speaker 0>thank you both for joining me. Alright. Seth,

01:12:03.995 --> 01:12:05.835

<v Speaker 0>and join the session that we have opened

01:13:10.445 --> 01:13:12.125
<v Speaker 0>just now on

01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:14.630
<v Speaker 0>two control plan one.

01:13:15.989 --> 01:13:17.750
<v Speaker 0>And then just type echo hello or anything

01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:18.949
<v Speaker 0>like that so that we know you're in

<v Speaker 0>Perfect.

01:13:21.670 --> 01:13:23.670
<v Speaker 0>Alright. You got ten minutes starting now. Best

01:13:23.670 --> 01:13:23.989
<v Speaker 0>of luck.

01:13:25.245 --> 01:13:26.124
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

01:13:26.125 --> 01:13:26.844
<v Speaker 2>Great.

01:13:27.565 --> 01:13:29.324
<v Speaker 2>So, yeah, I think there were a couple

01:13:29.324 --> 01:13:33.005
<v Speaker 2>of things that Alistair was doing that seemed

01:13:33.005 --> 01:13:33.724
<v Speaker 2>useful.

01:13:34.525 --> 01:13:37.405
<v Speaker 2>Someone had suggested a t q, and so

01:13:37.405 --> 01:13:39.165
<v Speaker 2>I think a t dash l will give

01:13:39.165 --> 01:13:39.565
<v Speaker 2>us

01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:41.430
<v Speaker 2>anything

01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:43.270
<v Speaker 2>scheduled there. It looks like nothing.

01:13:43.670 --> 01:13:47.350
<v Speaker 2>Another potential place we could schedule stuff

01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:49.670
<v Speaker 2>would be with

01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:52.950
<v Speaker 2>system CTL

01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:54.870
<v Speaker 2>timers, I guess.

01:13:55.554 --> 01:13:56.834
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.

01:13:57.315 --> 01:13:58.514
<v Speaker 2>So if we do

01:14:05.395 --> 01:14:07.155
<v Speaker 2>is it just timers or list timers?

01:14:09.239 --> 01:14:11.320
<v Speaker 0>List timers, I believe. Right? List

01:14:14.199 --> 01:14:17.400
<v Speaker 0>dash timers. One more well Yeah. No space.

01:14:30.864 --> 01:14:32.864
<v Speaker 0>Interest and hypothesis, Dan.

01:14:33.905 --> 01:14:35.344
<v Speaker 0>When I tell you what the break is

01:14:35.344 --> 01:14:38.465
<v Speaker 0>or you discover the break, I'll talk about

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:38.960
<v Speaker 0>something that's important.

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:41.199
<v Speaker 0>Maybe.

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:43.360
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So what are thinking?

01:14:44.719 --> 01:14:45.920
<v Speaker 2>Nothing

01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:46.639
<v Speaker 2>there

01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:48.639
<v Speaker 2>jumps out at me.

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:50.719
<v Speaker 2>We

01:14:51.815 --> 01:14:54.535
<v Speaker 2>people had suggested looking at containers running on

01:14:54.535 --> 01:14:55.335
<v Speaker 2>the host.

01:14:55.655 --> 01:14:57.815
<v Speaker 2>Cry control always confuses me, so maybe I'll

01:14:57.815 --> 01:15:00.295
<v Speaker 2>try to install NerdControl because it is

01:15:00.535 --> 01:15:01.735
<v Speaker 2>more familiar.

01:15:02.055 --> 01:15:04.055
<v Speaker 0>Yep. Do we go do See what happens.

01:15:21.784 --> 01:15:23.784
<v Speaker 0>Dot local ben is not in the path,

01:15:23.784 --> 01:15:25.784
<v Speaker 0>so you will have to modify it or

01:15:25.784 --> 01:15:26.824
<v Speaker 0>push it to somewhere else.

01:15:34.389 --> 01:15:37.189
<v Speaker 0>It seems to be you pushed it to

01:15:37.190 --> 01:15:39.510
<v Speaker 0>home slash dot local then.

01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:42.309
<v Speaker 5>That

01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.590
<v Speaker 0>should be it.

01:15:50.244 --> 01:15:50.965
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

01:15:51.445 --> 01:15:52.564
<v Speaker 2>Nothing there.

01:15:54.724 --> 01:15:57.284
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes pods run-in a namespace

01:15:57.445 --> 01:15:58.324
<v Speaker 0>that you would have to

01:16:01.639 --> 01:16:03.639
<v Speaker 2>And so to add a namespace in nerd

01:16:03.639 --> 01:16:05.800
<v Speaker 2>c t l, I'm just gonna Google that.

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:07.800
<v Speaker 0>Try dash capital e. It might do all

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:08.679
<v Speaker 0>namespaces.

01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:11.880
<v Speaker 2>Good idea. I think after the p s.

01:16:15.285 --> 01:16:15.925
<v Speaker 0>Nope.

01:16:17.045 --> 01:16:18.885
<v Speaker 0>Or for shop. Then you may have to

01:16:18.885 --> 01:16:20.405
<v Speaker 0>do dash n create style.

01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:28.260
<v Speaker 0>Apparently, I don't know how to work Nerd

01:16:28.260 --> 01:16:29.780
<v Speaker 0>Control or Nerd Control.

01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:32.900
<v Speaker 0>Oh, there you go. Here we go. It

01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:34.340
<v Speaker 5>needs to be before PS.

01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:36.660
<v Speaker 2>K.

01:16:40.765 --> 01:16:43.804
<v Speaker 2>Everything came up seven hours ago.

01:16:44.765 --> 01:16:46.045
<v Speaker 2>We do have this

01:16:46.765 --> 01:16:47.805
<v Speaker 2>pause container.

01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:03.420
<v Speaker 0>So you think the malicious workload is in

01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:03.980
<v Speaker 0>a container?

01:17:06.765 --> 01:17:09.165
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't sure about that, but I I

01:17:09.165 --> 01:17:11.485
<v Speaker 2>figured we should look at them as a

01:17:11.485 --> 01:17:12.445
<v Speaker 2>starting point.

01:17:14.205 --> 01:17:14.845
<v Speaker 2>But,

01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:18.525
<v Speaker 2>yeah, nothing here looks particularly

01:17:18.525 --> 01:17:19.005
<v Speaker 2>interesting

01:17:20.679 --> 01:17:21.959
<v Speaker 2>unless I'm

01:17:22.199 --> 01:17:24.599
<v Speaker 2>skimming over it in the with the the

01:17:24.599 --> 01:17:26.599
<v Speaker 2>pressure of the stream on me. You know?

01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:32.360
<v Speaker 0>You know, it's amazing how quickly we should

01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:34.280
<v Speaker 0>get everything we've ever known the minute cameras

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:35.480
<v Speaker 0>in front of your face. Right?

01:17:45.825 --> 01:17:47.345
<v Speaker 0>So you're just scrolling up and down this

01:17:47.345 --> 01:17:47.905
<v Speaker 0>list right now?

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:51.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. It was just looking at well, I

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.760
<v Speaker 2>I made my screen large enough that I

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:53.800
<v Speaker 2>didn't have to scroll. But

01:18:04.775 --> 01:18:07.415
<v Speaker 2>Just looking at the commands that they're all

01:18:07.415 --> 01:18:08.374
<v Speaker 2>issuing.

01:18:14.775 --> 01:18:17.014
<v Speaker 0>Venom is curious if the pod is scaling

01:18:17.014 --> 01:18:17.815
<v Speaker 0>itself down.

01:18:20.199 --> 01:18:21.960
<v Speaker 0>Leszek Yes. It's fine. Is it going to

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:23.880
<v Speaker 0>be something like a bash script pushed into

01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:25.479
<v Speaker 0>the background of a session?

01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:29.480
<v Speaker 0>Peter is asking if the images are real.

01:18:31.725 --> 01:18:34.445
<v Speaker 0>Alastair's looking for processes running Python or parallel.

01:18:34.445 --> 01:18:35.564
<v Speaker 0>Lots of ideas.

01:18:35.645 --> 01:18:37.965
<v Speaker 0>Wonderful ideas, but they're all wrong.

01:18:39.085 --> 01:18:39.885
<v Speaker 3>Get

01:18:41.485 --> 01:18:44.284
<v Speaker 2>deploy clustered. Kind of. Maybe.

01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:54.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. So there's no in it container or

01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:55.659
<v Speaker 2>anything on there.

01:18:57.020 --> 01:18:58.140
<v Speaker 0>Would have been a good way to do

01:18:58.140 --> 01:18:59.980
<v Speaker 0>it. The same effect, I guess. But, yeah,

01:19:00.185 --> 01:19:01.785
<v Speaker 0>not how it's done today. That would have

01:19:01.785 --> 01:19:02.264
<v Speaker 2>been

01:19:02.905 --> 01:19:04.264
<v Speaker 2>would have been neat.

01:19:04.425 --> 01:19:07.145
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at the postgres one.

01:19:10.665 --> 01:19:10.905
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:26.430
<v Speaker 0>Wesley's asking, consistently triggers fire when a pod

01:19:26.430 --> 01:19:27.070
<v Speaker 0>starts.

01:19:28.625 --> 01:19:29.505
<v Speaker 0>Interesting.

01:19:33.185 --> 01:19:35.745
<v Speaker 0>I'm not entirely sure, to be honest. No

01:19:35.745 --> 01:19:36.385
<v Speaker 0>idea.

01:19:38.465 --> 01:19:40.864
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. So Postgres appears to

01:19:41.790 --> 01:19:44.429
<v Speaker 0>Russell's asking if the process runs on another

01:19:44.429 --> 01:19:46.429
<v Speaker 0>node. These are single node clusters

01:19:46.590 --> 01:19:48.190
<v Speaker 0>for the record and

01:19:48.190 --> 01:19:50.030
<v Speaker 0>no external hardware we choose.

01:19:57.230 --> 01:19:59.345
<v Speaker 0>I'm afraid you've only got one minute left.

01:19:59.345 --> 01:19:59.505
<v Speaker 0>It

01:20:00.625 --> 01:20:02.225
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. It it flew by.

01:20:05.425 --> 01:20:07.585
<v Speaker 0>I have been rather sneaky with this one,

01:20:07.585 --> 01:20:10.145
<v Speaker 0>I have to say. I was unconfident

01:20:10.410 --> 01:20:12.410
<v Speaker 0>coming into this. Like, I know people are

01:20:12.410 --> 01:20:14.730
<v Speaker 0>gonna get it too quickly, but I I'm

01:20:14.730 --> 01:20:16.810
<v Speaker 0>glad that this has stumped people because

01:20:17.210 --> 01:20:19.050
<v Speaker 0>there's something important to learn at the end

01:20:19.050 --> 01:20:20.010
<v Speaker 0>of this episode.

01:20:22.410 --> 01:20:24.650
<v Speaker 2>What was the the flag on PS to

01:20:24.650 --> 01:20:25.450
<v Speaker 2>see the tree?

01:20:25.905 --> 01:20:28.225
<v Speaker 0>E f a u x. E f will

01:20:28.225 --> 01:20:29.265
<v Speaker 0>give you the tree and a u x

01:20:29.265 --> 01:20:30.705
<v Speaker 0>will show you all the processes.

01:20:32.625 --> 01:20:34.945
<v Speaker 0>I think the f stands for forest.

01:20:35.585 --> 01:20:37.025
<v Speaker 0>That's what they call the tree in the

01:20:37.025 --> 01:20:37.745
<v Speaker 0>PS format.

01:20:39.390 --> 01:20:42.110
<v Speaker 2>Nice. That's it. HPAs were checked. Yep.

01:20:48.989 --> 01:20:51.310
<v Speaker 0>Well, Dan, glad he didn't choose this one.

01:20:51.735 --> 01:20:54.215
<v Speaker 0>Dan, still very a lot of people curious

01:20:54.215 --> 01:20:55.974
<v Speaker 0>about the ATD.

01:21:00.775 --> 01:21:02.455
<v Speaker 0>I'll give you another Yeah. Think thirty seconds

01:21:02.455 --> 01:21:04.375
<v Speaker 0>that what do got? No. I I think

01:21:04.375 --> 01:21:05.655
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready to hand it over. I don't

01:21:05.655 --> 01:21:08.020
<v Speaker 2>have any ideas that'll bear that'll bear fruit

01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:09.060
<v Speaker 2>in thirty seconds.

01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:11.700
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, thank you for coming on. It's

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:14.980

<v Speaker 0>I'll okay. I'll share one again.

01:21:33.875 --> 01:21:34.515
<v Speaker 0>There you go.

01:21:38.510 --> 01:21:40.590
<v Speaker 0>Alex, joined late. What's the symptom?

01:21:43.389 --> 01:21:45.869
<v Speaker 0>Our deployment and replica set has been scaled

01:21:45.869 --> 01:21:46.749
<v Speaker 0>to zero,

01:21:47.150 --> 01:21:48.590
<v Speaker 0>and no one has been able to work

01:21:48.590 --> 01:21:50.590
<v Speaker 0>out how or why

01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:51.309

<v Speaker 0>Just go to your browser, join .clustered.live.

01:23:24.235 --> 01:23:27.754
<v Speaker 4>Join .clustered.live.

01:23:27.755 --> 01:23:28.715
<v Speaker 4>Let's try that out.

01:23:29.820 --> 01:23:32.300
<v Speaker 4>Can't find that server cluster with a k?

01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:34.060
<v Speaker 0>K. Oops. I missed all the clustered. My

01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:34.780
<v Speaker 4>bad. Yep.

01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:39.100
<v Speaker 4>That didn't work either.

01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:43.340
<v Speaker 0>Clustered.live.

01:23:43.875 --> 01:23:46.355
<v Speaker 0>So join .clustered.live.

01:23:48.755 --> 01:23:50.675
<v Speaker 0>I'll type it again and speak a chitchat

01:23:50.675 --> 01:23:51.395

01:24:21.085 --> 01:24:22.204
<v Speaker 0>You wanna join?

01:24:23.565 --> 01:24:24.125
<v Speaker 0>Let me know.

01:24:25.710 --> 01:24:29.390
<v Speaker 0>Dustin asking, has anyone described the replica set

01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:30.830
<v Speaker 0>events? We have seen the events on the

01:24:30.830 --> 01:24:33.469
<v Speaker 0>replica set. We're scaling up and something is

01:24:33.469 --> 01:24:34.670
<v Speaker 0>scaling it down.

01:24:35.390 --> 01:24:38.030
<v Speaker 0>Russell is asking about OS cron versus Kubernetes

01:24:38.030 --> 01:24:39.469
<v Speaker 0>cron. Could it be cron?

01:24:42.324 --> 01:24:44.724
<v Speaker 0>Well, as it says Cron jobs were empty.

01:24:52.005 --> 01:24:52.885
<v Speaker 0>Any takers?

01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:08.280
<v Speaker 0>Alright, I am just gonna post a link.

01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:10.200
<v Speaker 0>Anyone that wants to come on and have

01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:11.800
<v Speaker 0>a go at this, please click the link.

01:25:12.925 --> 01:25:15.325
<v Speaker 0>We will not be rebuilding the cluster from

01:25:15.325 --> 01:25:16.125
<v Speaker 0>scratch.

01:25:23.565 --> 01:25:25.405
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I'm gonna give it one more minute

01:25:25.405 --> 01:25:27.245
<v Speaker 0>and then I will walk through the break.

01:25:29.010 --> 01:25:31.730
<v Speaker 0>If anybody wants a chance at fixing this

01:25:31.730 --> 01:25:34.449
<v Speaker 0>before I reveal it, now is your opportunity.

01:25:35.650 --> 01:25:37.490
<v Speaker 0>Bogdan, maybe you wanna come back on and

01:25:37.490 --> 01:25:37.810
<v Speaker 0>try it?

01:25:44.435 --> 01:25:45.955
<v Speaker 0>Dan, feel free to jump back on. Dan,

01:25:45.955 --> 01:25:47.874
<v Speaker 0>if you've got the link when you come.

01:25:52.594 --> 01:25:52.994
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:26:26.710 --> 01:26:27.590
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:26:27.670 --> 01:26:28.390
<v Speaker 0>Hello.

01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:31.590
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Hello.

01:26:33.110 --> 01:26:33.750
<v Speaker 3>Hey.

01:26:34.470 --> 01:26:35.270
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

01:26:36.244 --> 01:26:38.165
<v Speaker 3>Let me see. I

01:26:38.165 --> 01:26:40.164
<v Speaker 3>still have this open.

01:26:42.804 --> 01:26:44.405
<v Speaker 0>What was your username again?

01:26:45.284 --> 01:26:46.405
<v Speaker 0>There we go. Sorry?

01:26:46.885 --> 01:26:48.804
<v Speaker 0>It's a different team for this cluster, so

01:26:48.804 --> 01:26:50.840
<v Speaker 0>I will add you to that. So it

01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.840
<v Speaker 0>will automatically add you this time, so you

01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:53.719
<v Speaker 0>may have to

01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:55.400
<v Speaker 0>just reload

01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:57.080
<v Speaker 0>your teleport page.

01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:01.480
<v Speaker 0>In fact, I can always change the roles.

01:27:09.855 --> 01:27:12.495
<v Speaker 0>Oh, that's better. One. Because she gave you

01:27:12.495 --> 01:27:13.695
<v Speaker 0>one earlier.

01:27:14.175 --> 01:27:16.575
<v Speaker 0>I will just give you access to everything

01:27:16.895 --> 01:27:18.175
<v Speaker 0>so you don't have to reload.

01:27:18.989 --> 01:27:20.829
<v Speaker 0>Please join the active session and type echo

01:27:20.829 --> 01:27:22.349
<v Speaker 0>hello or something so that I know you're

01:27:22.349 --> 01:27:22.909
<v Speaker 0>here.

01:27:25.389 --> 01:27:26.109
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

01:27:27.550 --> 01:27:29.789
<v Speaker 3>Is that your production

01:27:29.789 --> 01:27:30.269
<v Speaker 3>account?

01:27:33.195 --> 01:27:33.995
<v Speaker 0>Which one?

01:27:35.835 --> 01:27:38.475
<v Speaker 3>No. No. I was just joking. I I

01:27:38.475 --> 01:27:41.355
<v Speaker 3>asked if that's your production account.

01:27:41.755 --> 01:27:43.915
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. These are my production clusters we're fixing.

01:27:43.915 --> 01:27:45.275
<v Speaker 0>I actually don't know what's wrong with them.

01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:47.240
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:48.520
<v Speaker 3>So

01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:53.160
<v Speaker 3>should I see it in the active sessions?

01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:55.080
<v Speaker 0>Yep. You should hopefully be able to see

01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:57.720
<v Speaker 0>the active sessions. Looks like Dan is on

01:27:57.720 --> 01:27:58.440
<v Speaker 0>a note.

01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:00.600
<v Speaker 0>Join the first one. One. Right?

01:28:02.145 --> 01:28:04.145
<v Speaker 0>To control plane one. The first session, forty

01:28:04.145 --> 01:28:05.505
<v Speaker 0>nine minutes old.

01:28:05.745 --> 01:28:07.905
<v Speaker 0>Join that one. Join.

01:28:11.745 --> 01:28:13.505
<v Speaker 3>I mean, I I said yes, but I

01:28:13.505 --> 01:28:15.905
<v Speaker 3>have literally no idea.

01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:19.860
<v Speaker 3>Can

01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:21.460
<v Speaker 3>I get hints

01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:23.940
<v Speaker 3>to to

01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:25.780
<v Speaker 3>maybe

01:28:26.180 --> 01:28:29.060
<v Speaker 3>get it over with faster? Like, is it

01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:31.620
<v Speaker 3>something on the host, or is it something

01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:32.420
<v Speaker 3>in the cluster?

01:28:33.675 --> 01:28:36.315
<v Speaker 0>It is something on the host, and Dan

01:28:36.315 --> 01:28:38.875
<v Speaker 0>has been very close a few times by

01:28:38.875 --> 01:28:41.114
<v Speaker 0>telling us to look at the at daemon.

01:28:41.994 --> 01:28:44.315
<v Speaker 3>Oh, okay. So a t d a t

01:28:44.315 --> 01:28:46.635
<v Speaker 0>q. I mean, that is definitely how

01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:49.240
<v Speaker 0>the rogue processes are being scheduled.

01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:55.240
<v Speaker 3>Okay. So can I just do

01:29:04.855 --> 01:29:06.375
<v Speaker 0>I mean, you can stop it, but I'd

01:29:06.375 --> 01:29:08.375
<v Speaker 0>like you to faint the the bad thing

01:29:08.375 --> 01:29:08.695
<v Speaker 0>too?

01:29:13.380 --> 01:29:14.100
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:23.300
<v Speaker 3>Do we have the scale here? Okay.

01:29:37.494 --> 01:29:38.295
<v Speaker 3>That's annoying.

01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:48.080
<v Speaker 3>Like, I

01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:49.760
<v Speaker 3>oh, okay.

01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:53.200
<v Speaker 3>Where did this come from?

01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:56.880
<v Speaker 3>Didn't you we already run ATQ? And

01:29:58.215 --> 01:30:01.255
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Something you did triggered some schedules.

01:30:02.775 --> 01:30:03.814
<v Speaker 3>Oh, okay.

01:30:07.815 --> 01:30:08.934
<v Speaker 3>But how

01:30:08.935 --> 01:30:12.295
<v Speaker 3>do they still run if ATD is stopped?

01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:20.750
<v Speaker 0>We've had someone else join, but I don't

01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:20.910
<v Speaker 0>think

01:30:22.110 --> 01:30:22.989
<v Speaker 0>Joe, are you there?

01:30:26.295 --> 01:30:27.815
<v Speaker 3>Like, if there's

01:30:28.215 --> 01:30:31.175
<v Speaker 3>Right. Someone who wants to try, I can

01:30:31.175 --> 01:30:31.495
<v Speaker 3>just

01:30:32.455 --> 01:30:34.935
<v Speaker 0>Dan removed all the ATQ commands, and they

01:30:34.935 --> 01:30:36.935
<v Speaker 0>came back. That's that's a pain in the

01:30:36.935 --> 01:30:37.175
<v Speaker 0>ass.

01:30:40.220 --> 01:30:42.540
<v Speaker 0>I don't think anyone's got any ideas.

01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:45.260
<v Speaker 3>Oh, okay. Interesting.

01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:49.580
<v Speaker 3>Is this some tampered with?

01:30:49.900 --> 01:30:53.340
<v Speaker 0>CubeControl is not tampered with. No. Interesting

01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:53.740
<v Speaker 0>idea.

01:30:59.685 --> 01:31:02.565
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I'm gonna just start dropping hints so

01:31:02.565 --> 01:31:04.725
<v Speaker 0>that we can uncover what's actually happening here.

01:31:06.570 --> 01:31:08.249
<v Speaker 0>But I find it interesting

01:31:08.329 --> 01:31:10.249
<v Speaker 0>that people are running kubectl

01:31:10.969 --> 01:31:13.050
<v Speaker 0>in a very trustful fashion.

01:31:16.010 --> 01:31:16.729
<v Speaker 0>So

01:31:16.969 --> 01:31:18.969
<v Speaker 0>how does kubectl know how to speak to

01:31:18.969 --> 01:31:20.010
<v Speaker 0>our API server?

01:31:23.025 --> 01:31:24.065
<v Speaker 3>Oh, okay.

01:31:25.505 --> 01:31:26.144
<v Speaker 3>Well,

01:31:27.185 --> 01:31:28.704
<v Speaker 3>did you set it?

01:31:30.785 --> 01:31:31.824
<v Speaker 3>Oh, okay.

01:31:34.705 --> 01:31:35.505
<v Speaker 3>Is there, like

01:31:36.545 --> 01:31:36.864
<v Speaker 3>yeah.

01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:44.679
<v Speaker 3>So tricky.

01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:48.360
<v Speaker 1>I guess

01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:52.360
<v Speaker 3>oh, because it's

01:31:54.505 --> 01:31:55.864
<v Speaker 3>we also have

01:31:57.945 --> 01:31:58.665
<v Speaker 3>oh.

01:32:01.785 --> 01:32:03.625
<v Speaker 0>So the comments seem to think that I

01:32:03.625 --> 01:32:05.305
<v Speaker 0>set up an alias or a function for

01:32:05.305 --> 01:32:07.785
<v Speaker 0>cube control. I have not. This is 100%

01:32:07.785 --> 01:32:09.385
<v Speaker 0>a perfectly legal break.

01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:15.499
<v Speaker 0>So there was something in that

01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:17.340
<v Speaker 0>admin.com

01:32:17.340 --> 01:32:19.260
<v Speaker 0>that should be investigated.

01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:21.340
<v Speaker 3>The cube boss metal?

01:32:22.075 --> 01:32:22.795
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm.

01:32:23.115 --> 01:32:24.554
<v Speaker 0>So do you know what that is?

01:32:30.635 --> 01:32:32.155
<v Speaker 0>Just a take on which?

01:32:33.915 --> 01:32:37.429
<v Speaker 3>I mean, it is a command that KubeCTL

01:32:37.429 --> 01:32:40.230
<v Speaker 3>runs and then it gets a token, right,

01:32:40.230 --> 01:32:41.989
<v Speaker 3>or something like it's

01:32:42.150 --> 01:32:44.229
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. So if we take a look at

01:32:44.710 --> 01:32:45.989
<v Speaker 3>Like, an external

01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:47.989
<v Speaker 3>Like authentication.

01:32:49.635 --> 01:32:52.595
<v Speaker 0>Exactly. Right? So the this is called Kubernetes

01:32:52.595 --> 01:32:55.074
<v Speaker 0>or a kube control authentication helper.

01:32:55.795 --> 01:32:58.755
<v Speaker 0>Mostly for managed Kubernetes clusters like AWS and

01:32:58.755 --> 01:33:00.995
<v Speaker 0>GCP where you don't have a specific token

01:33:00.995 --> 01:33:03.475
<v Speaker 0>and you run a command and it gets

01:33:03.475 --> 01:33:03.955
<v Speaker 0>a token.

01:33:05.340 --> 01:33:07.260
<v Speaker 0>But there's nothing stopping that command from doing

01:33:07.260 --> 01:33:08.939
<v Speaker 0>malicious things in your cluster.

01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:11.179
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So, actually,

01:33:12.540 --> 01:33:13.900
<v Speaker 0>our way sorry, sir.

01:33:14.540 --> 01:33:16.540
<v Speaker 0>Our way Yeah. I'll let you drive it.

01:33:17.855 --> 01:33:19.615
<v Speaker 0>And if we run a tape on this,

01:33:19.615 --> 01:33:21.055
<v Speaker 0>we'll see that we have a

01:33:21.295 --> 01:33:23.775
<v Speaker 0>binary, which I thought was particularly mean of

01:33:23.775 --> 01:33:24.335
<v Speaker 0>me.

01:33:26.415 --> 01:33:29.135
<v Speaker 0>A fail. Fail? Yeah. That's what I meant.

01:33:29.775 --> 01:33:30.895
<v Speaker 0>As I I mean, we don't really have

01:33:30.895 --> 01:33:32.335
<v Speaker 0>any visibility into

01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:33.980
<v Speaker 0>what this is doing

01:33:34.219 --> 01:33:35.020
<v Speaker 0>at all.

01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:39.260
<v Speaker 0>We could run strings on it.

01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:43.739
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. And I guess you And you may

01:33:43.739 --> 01:33:45.660
<v Speaker 0>you may see something interesting or you may

01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:46.380
<v Speaker 0>not. Yeah.

01:33:54.405 --> 01:33:56.005
<v Speaker 0>Actually, you don't really see that much.

01:33:56.885 --> 01:33:58.485
<v Speaker 0>But what I wanted people to be aware

01:33:58.485 --> 01:34:01.000
<v Speaker 0>of with this is that, like, those authentication

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.080
<v Speaker 0>helpers are really opaque, you should never really

01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:05.560
<v Speaker 0>trust a KubeConfig without knowing what it's actually

01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:06.119
<v Speaker 0>doing.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.480
<v Speaker 0>I have stored a plain bash version of

01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:11.719
<v Speaker 0>the script on the host, which I can

01:34:11.719 --> 01:34:12.440
<v Speaker 0>show you if you wish.

01:34:13.215 --> 01:34:13.854
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:34:14.574 --> 01:34:17.695
<v Speaker 0>Which I sneakily did it. How how

01:34:18.735 --> 01:34:19.614
<v Speaker 3>would you

01:34:21.054 --> 01:34:22.414
<v Speaker 3>go and fix it?

01:34:23.614 --> 01:34:23.935
<v Speaker 3>Because

01:34:25.550 --> 01:34:27.950
<v Speaker 0>So that's what our authentication helper is actually

01:34:27.950 --> 01:34:28.510
<v Speaker 0>doing.

01:34:29.550 --> 01:34:31.710
<v Speaker 3>Okay. It sets up a so because this

01:34:31.710 --> 01:34:34.110
<v Speaker 0>happens before the kube control command,

01:34:34.670 --> 01:34:36.830
<v Speaker 0>I had to use at to sleep them

01:34:36.830 --> 01:34:38.750
<v Speaker 0>for five, thirty, and sixty seconds.

01:34:39.244 --> 01:34:41.004
<v Speaker 0>So they would run afterwards.

01:34:41.565 --> 01:34:42.604
<v Speaker 0>That's what I your

01:34:43.005 --> 01:34:43.965
<v Speaker 0>cube control

01:34:44.284 --> 01:34:46.764
<v Speaker 0>modifications would actually work for a short period

01:34:46.764 --> 01:34:49.244
<v Speaker 0>of time, and then it would all go

01:34:49.244 --> 01:34:49.724
<v Speaker 0>to shit.

01:34:51.260 --> 01:34:53.900
<v Speaker 0>And then I could parallel it with SHC,

01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:55.660
<v Speaker 0>which gives you a binary of any shell

01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:57.820
<v Speaker 0>script that kinda make us a bit more

01:34:57.820 --> 01:34:59.579
<v Speaker 0>hidden. But that was it.

01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:02.300
<v Speaker 0>The fix here is

01:35:04.405 --> 01:35:06.405
<v Speaker 0>not to use that gip config and to

01:35:06.405 --> 01:35:08.565
<v Speaker 0>instead use trusted credentials,

01:35:08.565 --> 01:35:09.765
<v Speaker 0>which I have left.

01:35:10.005 --> 01:35:11.045
<v Speaker 0>You can see

01:35:11.525 --> 01:35:12.165
<v Speaker 0>here,

01:35:12.645 --> 01:35:14.165
<v Speaker 0>we have used our local BEN

01:35:14.485 --> 01:35:15.285
<v Speaker 0>cache,

01:35:16.565 --> 01:35:17.765
<v Speaker 0>which is a real

01:35:18.830 --> 01:35:20.030
<v Speaker 0>credential file.

01:35:20.830 --> 01:35:21.949
<v Speaker 3>Oh, okay.

01:35:22.590 --> 01:35:24.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. And that's all the the results for

01:35:24.670 --> 01:35:27.070
<v Speaker 3>dot key and dot certificate.

01:35:28.430 --> 01:35:31.070
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. But it's it's it's really, really easy

01:35:31.070 --> 01:35:34.425
<v Speaker 0>to write a bad KubeConfig authentication helper that

01:35:34.425 --> 01:35:35.945
<v Speaker 0>does lots of nasty stuff inside of a

01:35:35.945 --> 01:35:37.785
<v Speaker 0>cluster. Like, I mean, all I'm doing here

01:35:37.785 --> 01:35:39.465
<v Speaker 0>is cat and out some

01:35:40.105 --> 01:35:41.625
<v Speaker 0>very important credentials.

01:35:42.185 --> 01:35:43.705
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. But I I think

01:35:44.505 --> 01:35:47.865
<v Speaker 3>exec snoop would have helped because

01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:50.219
<v Speaker 3>you would be able to see

01:35:51.980 --> 01:35:53.340
<v Speaker 3>that kubectl

01:35:53.980 --> 01:35:54.860
<v Speaker 3>executed

01:35:55.659 --> 01:35:57.099
<v Speaker 3>that those helper.

01:35:57.580 --> 01:36:00.300
<v Speaker 3>And then yeah. Yeah. Let's let's do it.

01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:02.644
<v Speaker 0>Let's because I like BCC tools. I just

01:36:02.644 --> 01:36:04.324
<v Speaker 0>don't remember the name of the package, but

01:36:06.644 --> 01:36:07.124
<v Speaker 3>search.

01:36:07.445 --> 01:36:08.004
<v Speaker 3>Maybe

01:36:09.284 --> 01:36:10.564
<v Speaker 3>in one word.

01:36:11.125 --> 01:36:13.364
<v Speaker 3>Oh, no. BPS CC tools. Yeah.

01:36:19.010 --> 01:36:21.090
<v Speaker 0>Carlos is asking how I would debug this.

01:36:21.090 --> 01:36:23.489
<v Speaker 0>I would use execs note to debug this

01:36:23.489 --> 01:36:24.610
<v Speaker 0>%.

01:36:24.850 --> 01:36:27.090
<v Speaker 0>So let me open a second session.

01:36:40.244 --> 01:36:42.084
<v Speaker 0>We could run exec snip.

01:36:42.085 --> 01:36:44.165
<v Speaker 0>We could run our acute control.

01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:46.940
<v Speaker 0>We've got a scale command here somewhere, don't

01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:47.659
<v Speaker 0>we? Yep.

01:36:48.940 --> 01:36:49.820
<v Speaker 0>And

01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:52.219
<v Speaker 0>probably should have felt this on a few

01:36:52.219 --> 01:36:54.219
<v Speaker 0>things, but Yeah. That's alright.

01:36:55.739 --> 01:36:57.580
<v Speaker 0>Let's see. Yeah. There we go. I've got

01:36:57.580 --> 01:36:59.805
<v Speaker 0>our three act commands being run. You can

01:36:59.805 --> 01:37:02.205
<v Speaker 0>see our cube control scale, which is then

01:37:02.365 --> 01:37:04.125
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm. We've got our off metal

01:37:04.445 --> 01:37:07.085
<v Speaker 0>and then off metal as you run-in the

01:37:07.085 --> 01:37:09.965
<v Speaker 0>the acts. We could see the certificates

01:37:10.125 --> 01:37:12.045
<v Speaker 0>that are being kind of injected in.

01:37:12.820 --> 01:37:14.420
<v Speaker 0>So everything you kind of need, that is

01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:15.780
<v Speaker 0>available for exact.

01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:20.100
<v Speaker 0>The BPF tools are awesome. Right? I I

01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:21.860
<v Speaker 0>I really feel that everybody should learn all

01:37:21.860 --> 01:37:23.780
<v Speaker 0>of these. There's loads of them. Yeah. Actually,

01:37:23.780 --> 01:37:24.900
<v Speaker 0>if we do

01:37:25.715 --> 01:37:26.675
<v Speaker 0>a s

01:37:27.075 --> 01:37:29.235
<v Speaker 0>user local PIN

01:37:29.555 --> 01:37:30.275
<v Speaker 0>rep,

01:37:31.795 --> 01:37:33.554
<v Speaker 0>where do they live?

01:37:33.715 --> 01:37:35.395
<v Speaker 3>No. I think it's in

01:37:38.830 --> 01:37:40.030
<v Speaker 0>Oh, Spend.

01:37:42.750 --> 01:37:45.070
<v Speaker 3>There there's a lot of scripts in

01:37:45.870 --> 01:37:47.630
<v Speaker 3>user share

01:37:48.190 --> 01:37:49.150
<v Speaker 3>BCC

01:37:49.150 --> 01:37:49.710
<v Speaker 3>or something.

01:37:51.265 --> 01:37:52.145
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. I guess

01:37:52.945 --> 01:37:55.265
<v Speaker 0>We got exact snip, kill snip, mount snip.

01:37:55.265 --> 01:37:57.105
<v Speaker 0>Open snip is one of my favorites. That's

01:37:57.105 --> 01:37:58.145
<v Speaker 0>fucking awesome.

01:37:58.625 --> 01:38:00.225
<v Speaker 0>In fact, we'd see

01:38:00.785 --> 01:38:02.385
<v Speaker 0>I'll grab it because I know what I'm

01:38:02.385 --> 01:38:03.185
<v Speaker 0>looking for.

01:38:03.425 --> 01:38:04.785
<v Speaker 0>If we grab for cash,

01:38:06.010 --> 01:38:07.610
<v Speaker 0>it's not too noisy.

01:38:09.450 --> 01:38:10.969
<v Speaker 0>Oh, that was too noisy.

01:38:11.450 --> 01:38:13.210
<v Speaker 0>We would have seen the credential files in

01:38:13.210 --> 01:38:15.370
<v Speaker 0>there as as well. So, yeah, all those

01:38:15.370 --> 01:38:16.810
<v Speaker 0>not kills are pretty cool.

01:38:17.530 --> 01:38:18.250
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:38:18.410 --> 01:38:19.770
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Thank you, Bogdan.

01:38:20.455 --> 01:38:23.735
<v Speaker 3>Thank you a lot again. Cheers. Bye.

01:38:24.615 --> 01:38:27.655
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Thank you everybody for watching the community

01:38:27.655 --> 01:38:31.255
<v Speaker 0>versus Rawkode episode of Clustert. Clustert is on

01:38:31.255 --> 01:38:33.690
<v Speaker 0>every single week on my channel except for

01:38:33.690 --> 01:38:35.610
<v Speaker 0>when I'm traveling. I'm actually at CD con

01:38:35.610 --> 01:38:37.770
<v Speaker 0>in Austin, Texas next week, so there won't

01:38:37.770 --> 01:38:38.810
<v Speaker 0>be Clustered.

01:38:38.970 --> 01:38:41.290
<v Speaker 0>But we will be back the following week.

01:38:41.450 --> 01:38:43.050
<v Speaker 0>So, hopefully, I will see you all then.

01:38:43.050 --> 01:38:44.890
<v Speaker 0>Remember to subscribe to the channel, like the

01:38:44.890 --> 01:38:47.130
<v Speaker 0>video, and, hopefully, I see you all again

01:38:47.130 --> 01:38:47.530
<v Speaker 0>soon.

01:38:47.975 --> 01:38:50.535
<v Speaker 0>So thank you for tuning in. And I

01:38:50.535 --> 01:38:52.135
<v Speaker 0>think, actually, this was a whole lot more

01:38:52.135 --> 01:38:54.295
<v Speaker 0>fun than I expected. So I'm gonna run

01:38:54.295 --> 01:38:56.855
<v Speaker 0>more community versus Rawkode episodes

01:38:57.415 --> 01:38:59.494
<v Speaker 0>and see if we can do this again.

01:38:59.735 --> 01:39:01.575
<v Speaker 0>So I'll get that maybe once a month.

01:39:01.575 --> 01:39:04.000
<v Speaker 0>Let's see. Alright. Thank you, everybody. Have a

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:04.720
<v Speaker 0>wonderful evening.
