00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.679
<v Speaker 0>Hello, and welcome back to the Rawkode Academy.

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:05.600
<v Speaker 0>This is Rawkode live, and I am your

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.200
<v Speaker 0>host, David Flanagan.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.440
<v Speaker 0>Today, I am joined by Lucas from Loft

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.320
<v Speaker 0>who is gonna interest introduce us to their

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.855
<v Speaker 0>new open source project, DevPod.

00:00:15.254 --> 00:00:17.414
<v Speaker 0>Hello, Lucas. How are you? Hey, David.

00:00:17.814 --> 00:00:20.055
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing alright. Thanks for having me on.

00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:22.134
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's been a while. We haven't done

00:00:22.134 --> 00:00:23.494
<v Speaker 0>a session like this for a long, long

00:00:23.494 --> 00:00:24.935
<v Speaker 0>time, so it's nice to have you back

00:00:24.935 --> 00:00:26.375
<v Speaker 0>in the hot seat and ready to show

00:00:26.375 --> 00:00:28.055
<v Speaker 0>us something new and cool today.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.000
<v Speaker 0>For

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.119
<v Speaker 0>anyone who hasn't seen our previous episode or

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.720
<v Speaker 0>isn't familiar with you and your work, could

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.240
<v Speaker 0>you please take a few moments to introduce

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.520
<v Speaker 0>yourself and tell us what you've been up

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.000
<v Speaker 0>to?

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Sure. I'm Lucas.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of the founders of Loft Labs.

00:00:43.955 --> 00:00:45.635
<v Speaker 1>What we do with our product Loft is

00:00:45.635 --> 00:00:49.235
<v Speaker 1>essentially provide, you know, building blocks for

00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:52.595
<v Speaker 1>platform engineers who have to build platforms on

00:00:52.595 --> 00:00:53.795
<v Speaker 1>top of Kubernetes

00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:57.320
<v Speaker 1>to provision, you know, clusters for the engineering

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.480
<v Speaker 1>teams, etcetera, in, you know, one of these

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.080
<v Speaker 1>building blocks. And I think that's the last

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.920
<v Speaker 1>time we've spoken, David, as vCosta. That's a

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.320
<v Speaker 1>pretty popular open source project we launched.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.280
<v Speaker 1>We also maintain the DevSpace

00:01:10.125 --> 00:01:12.445
<v Speaker 1>project, which we handed over as a sandbox

00:01:12.445 --> 00:01:13.885
<v Speaker 1>project to the CNCF.

00:01:14.205 --> 00:01:16.445
<v Speaker 1>And now we're on our third project, and

00:01:16.445 --> 00:01:18.605
<v Speaker 1>that's that's what we're talking about today.

00:01:19.565 --> 00:01:22.525
<v Speaker 0>Nice. Awesome. So the the project was announced

00:01:22.525 --> 00:01:23.565
<v Speaker 0>last week, I believe.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.960
<v Speaker 0>It's called DevPod, and I know that it's

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.000
<v Speaker 0>a tool

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.640
<v Speaker 0>that sits on top of dev containers and

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.040
<v Speaker 0>tries to give people virtual

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.360
<v Speaker 0>machines or infrastructure with all the tooling that

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.600
<v Speaker 0>they need to work on a project. Is

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.040
<v Speaker 0>that am I on the right line, sir?

00:01:41.135 --> 00:01:43.215
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That wraps it up pretty well. Yeah.

00:01:43.215 --> 00:01:45.055
<v Speaker 1>We announced it last Tuesday.

00:01:45.455 --> 00:01:46.655
<v Speaker 1>And DevPod,

00:01:46.655 --> 00:01:48.975
<v Speaker 1>the idea is essentially, you know, you want

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:50.655
<v Speaker 1>something like code spaces,

00:01:50.655 --> 00:01:52.655
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want it as a hosted

00:01:52.655 --> 00:01:55.135
<v Speaker 1>managed service that kind of locks you into

00:01:55.135 --> 00:01:56.549
<v Speaker 1>a specific infra,

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.270
<v Speaker 1>you essentially want that flexibility of, you know,

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.470
<v Speaker 1>spinning things up in your own AWS account

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.150
<v Speaker 1>or on Kubernetes

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.509
<v Speaker 1>or even a local Docker desktop and give

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.755
<v Speaker 1>it a freedom to switch back and forth

00:02:09.834 --> 00:02:11.915
<v Speaker 1>whenever you want to do so. Right? You

00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:14.075
<v Speaker 1>can save some cost by staying locally,

00:02:14.235 --> 00:02:15.834
<v Speaker 1>and then you go to AWS whenever you

00:02:15.834 --> 00:02:17.515
<v Speaker 1>need that power. And it really gives you

00:02:17.515 --> 00:02:19.995
<v Speaker 1>the flexibility to, you know, dynamically switch between

00:02:19.995 --> 00:02:21.754
<v Speaker 1>these environments. I think that's the that's the

00:02:21.754 --> 00:02:23.355
<v Speaker 1>true true power of this new project.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.220
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.060
<v Speaker 0>I'm curious. Like,

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.940
<v Speaker 0>you know, obviously, there's been a substantial, I

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.300
<v Speaker 0>would assume, amount of effort and teamwork that's

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.739
<v Speaker 0>been entered us from the lost side to

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.580
<v Speaker 0>try and and make this a product that

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.780
<v Speaker 0>you can open source and put in the

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.785
<v Speaker 0>hands of thousands to tens of thousands or

00:02:39.785 --> 00:02:41.944
<v Speaker 0>hundreds of thousands of developers. Like, what were

00:02:41.944 --> 00:02:44.185
<v Speaker 0>the driving factors that, you know, you're all

00:02:44.185 --> 00:02:46.265
<v Speaker 0>sat in Loft HQ one day drinking your

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:47.385
<v Speaker 0>coffee and you went, you know what? We

00:02:47.385 --> 00:02:49.944
<v Speaker 0>should build this. Like, what was the original

00:02:49.944 --> 00:02:50.825
<v Speaker 0>driving factor then?

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I guess Loft HQ is more like,

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.860
<v Speaker 1>you know, Slack channels and

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.820
<v Speaker 1>Zoom sessions because we're fully distributed.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.580
<v Speaker 1>But, yeah, you're right. I think

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.380
<v Speaker 1>we were, you know, we were thinking about

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.575
<v Speaker 1>how can we you know, obviously, we were

00:03:06.575 --> 00:03:08.895
<v Speaker 1>looking at these solutions, GitPod,

00:03:08.895 --> 00:03:09.695
<v Speaker 1>Codespaces,

00:03:09.695 --> 00:03:11.455
<v Speaker 1>etcetera, and everything that that happened in that

00:03:11.455 --> 00:03:12.015
<v Speaker 1>space

00:03:12.255 --> 00:03:14.895
<v Speaker 1>also for our own team. Right? And, you

00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:16.815
<v Speaker 1>know, we're, like, over 20 people now.

00:03:16.975 --> 00:03:17.615
<v Speaker 1>There's

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 1>folks from the design side reviewing things that

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.050
<v Speaker 1>get changed in the UI.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Then, you know, product wants to have a

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.530
<v Speaker 1>look before things are released.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 1>And then we have the open source community

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.210
<v Speaker 1>contributing to our projects.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.585
<v Speaker 1>And we are thinking, how can we make

00:03:31.585 --> 00:03:33.425
<v Speaker 1>it easier for people to, you know, just

00:03:33.425 --> 00:03:34.625
<v Speaker 1>launch an environment,

00:03:35.105 --> 00:03:37.665
<v Speaker 1>spin up a certain branch, contribute a little

00:03:37.665 --> 00:03:38.865
<v Speaker 1>bit? And,

00:03:39.745 --> 00:03:41.425
<v Speaker 1>yeah, we were we were looking at code

00:03:41.425 --> 00:03:44.065
<v Speaker 1>spaces because we're using, you know, repositories on

00:03:44.065 --> 00:03:46.920
<v Speaker 1>GitHub or open source projects on GitHub, obviously.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.120
<v Speaker 1>But then,

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.000
<v Speaker 1>you know, locking people into into that very

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.480
<v Speaker 1>specific environment. I mean, the experience of launching

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.720
<v Speaker 1>it is great if you are on GitHub.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.880
<v Speaker 1>Right?

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:59.035
<v Speaker 1>But what if you're not on GitHub? Or

00:03:59.035 --> 00:03:59.915
<v Speaker 1>what if you are,

00:04:00.635 --> 00:04:03.035
<v Speaker 1>you know, if you don't wanna pay

00:04:03.115 --> 00:04:05.035
<v Speaker 1>for that premium that essentially

00:04:05.275 --> 00:04:07.915
<v Speaker 1>they charge for these environments and you just

00:04:07.915 --> 00:04:10.269
<v Speaker 1>wanna have that experience locally or you just

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.349
<v Speaker 1>wanna have that experience in your own Kubernetes

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:14.510
<v Speaker 1>clusters and EKS. Right?

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.149
<v Speaker 1>We were asking us these questions, and we

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:18.750
<v Speaker 1>didn't really find a great answer for that

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.470
<v Speaker 1>anywhere.

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:21.709
<v Speaker 1>So we just started

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.389
<v Speaker 1>building things internally. I think, you know, our

00:04:24.885 --> 00:04:27.365
<v Speaker 1>CTO, Fabian, and and my cofounder, he's

00:04:28.085 --> 00:04:30.325
<v Speaker 1>you know, he just sometimes just pulls things

00:04:30.325 --> 00:04:32.245
<v Speaker 1>together over a weekend, and that was the

00:04:32.245 --> 00:04:34.005
<v Speaker 1>same thing with DevPod. And that was, like,

00:04:34.005 --> 00:04:36.565
<v Speaker 1>an initial prototype. And that's already, like, I

00:04:36.565 --> 00:04:38.005
<v Speaker 1>don't know, five or six months,

00:04:38.485 --> 00:04:40.405
<v Speaker 1>you know, ago at this point. And,

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.020
<v Speaker 1>you know, it it seemed very promising and

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.340
<v Speaker 1>exciting, and we're like, okay. Maybe we should,

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.500
<v Speaker 1>you know, invest some time here and actually

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.659
<v Speaker 1>build a legit open source project out of

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:51.900
<v Speaker 1>this. And, yeah, that's what we did. And

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.740
<v Speaker 1>and, you know, now we're presenting it to

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.780
<v Speaker 1>the world. We had a little bit of

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.335
<v Speaker 1>a, you know, private better kind of session

00:04:57.335 --> 00:04:59.735
<v Speaker 1>a few weeks ago with some of our

00:04:59.735 --> 00:05:02.935
<v Speaker 1>customers because they've expressed interest in in this

00:05:02.935 --> 00:05:04.694
<v Speaker 1>topic, and we're like, oh, even better. You

00:05:04.694 --> 00:05:07.014
<v Speaker 1>know, people that are already using our tooling

00:05:07.014 --> 00:05:08.535
<v Speaker 1>would see additional value here.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.140
<v Speaker 1>So let's let's invest some time and and

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.420
<v Speaker 1>build this thing and get it off the

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.900
<v Speaker 1>ground.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.180
<v Speaker 1>Nice.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.500
<v Speaker 0>I love how I started the conversation with

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.340
<v Speaker 0>you must have invested a serious amount of

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.260
<v Speaker 0>effort and people time and everything, and you're

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.860
<v Speaker 0>like, yeah. One person built it over a

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.295
<v Speaker 0>weekend. At least, you know, the proof of

00:05:23.295 --> 00:05:23.935
<v Speaker 0>concept.

00:05:24.415 --> 00:05:25.855
<v Speaker 0>It does all the best I can. Was

00:05:25.855 --> 00:05:26.655
<v Speaker 1>the version.

00:05:27.375 --> 00:05:29.055
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And that was the alpha version zero,

00:05:29.055 --> 00:05:31.375
<v Speaker 1>I think. But, yeah, I think now,

00:05:31.535 --> 00:05:33.855
<v Speaker 1>obviously, there's there's, you know, more parts of

00:05:33.855 --> 00:05:36.815
<v Speaker 1>our engineering team involved. So let let's definitely

00:05:36.815 --> 00:05:38.919
<v Speaker 1>give credit to to all of the folks

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:40.680
<v Speaker 1>that have contributed internally.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.240
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, most exciting thing is actually we've

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.600
<v Speaker 1>already seen the first

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.240
<v Speaker 1>you know, DevPod has this provider concept,

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.080
<v Speaker 1>and from

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.800
<v Speaker 1>Pulumi

00:05:50.575 --> 00:05:53.455
<v Speaker 1>has, over the weekend, apparently, created a scale

00:05:53.455 --> 00:05:54.095
<v Speaker 1>way

00:05:54.415 --> 00:05:56.895
<v Speaker 1>provider for for DevPod. So we even see

00:05:56.895 --> 00:05:59.695
<v Speaker 1>the first, like, bigger community contributions.

00:05:59.775 --> 00:06:01.935
<v Speaker 1>It was super surprising. We made the repository

00:06:01.935 --> 00:06:04.175
<v Speaker 1>public, I think, three or four hours before,

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.910
<v Speaker 1>you know, announcing it to the public just

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.389
<v Speaker 1>to make sure we test everything, upgrade procedures,

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:10.669
<v Speaker 1>and how how all of that works with

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:11.950
<v Speaker 1>the public repository.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:13.790
<v Speaker 1>And then we got the first pull request

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.390
<v Speaker 1>even before the press release.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 1>Like, dang it. Like, people are onto this.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:20.190
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:06:21.005 --> 00:06:24.045
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, obviously, with Rawkode Live, I'm gonna

00:06:24.045 --> 00:06:25.965
<v Speaker 0>try and use DevPod. We're gonna work through

00:06:25.965 --> 00:06:27.565
<v Speaker 0>what that process looks like and show people

00:06:27.565 --> 00:06:29.325
<v Speaker 0>how to get started. But I have one

00:06:29.325 --> 00:06:30.765
<v Speaker 0>more question before we do that if you're

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:32.765
<v Speaker 0>happy to answer it. And I'm curious. Right?

00:06:32.765 --> 00:06:33.005
<v Speaker 0>Looking

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.520
<v Speaker 0>at the the loft portfolio of open source

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.080
<v Speaker 0>projects, you've got v cluster that I can

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.800
<v Speaker 0>run-in my Kubernetes clusters to facilitate virtual clusters

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.320
<v Speaker 0>for multiple use cases,

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:45.720
<v Speaker 0>which I think ties in quite nicely maybe

00:06:45.885 --> 00:06:48.045
<v Speaker 0>with what we're gonna see with DevPod. And

00:06:48.045 --> 00:06:50.205
<v Speaker 0>then we also have DevSpace, which also kind

00:06:50.205 --> 00:06:51.085
<v Speaker 0>of is

00:06:51.485 --> 00:06:53.325
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if it's tangential or not,

00:06:53.325 --> 00:06:55.485
<v Speaker 0>but it's very close to what DevPod's doing

00:06:55.485 --> 00:06:57.645
<v Speaker 0>and where it provides development environments for software

00:06:57.645 --> 00:06:59.725
<v Speaker 0>to point to Kubernetes, maybe more. I'm not

00:06:59.725 --> 00:07:02.140
<v Speaker 0>that familiar. So I'm curious about how do

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.660
<v Speaker 0>these work together?

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.740
<v Speaker 0>Is there a grand plan there to kinda

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.580
<v Speaker 0>take over that developer experience? Do I need

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.420
<v Speaker 0>to use all three? What does that look

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:09.900
<v Speaker 0>like?

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That's a that's a very good question.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.140
<v Speaker 1>Actually, a lot of our

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.535
<v Speaker 1>community members who are already familiar with DevSpace,

00:07:17.535 --> 00:07:19.375
<v Speaker 1>when we presented DevPod to them, they had

00:07:19.375 --> 00:07:21.055
<v Speaker 1>that exact same question. Isn't there a lot

00:07:21.055 --> 00:07:23.375
<v Speaker 1>of overlap here? Right? But

00:07:24.015 --> 00:07:26.815
<v Speaker 1>DevPod is kind of under DevSpace.

00:07:26.815 --> 00:07:30.095
<v Speaker 1>So DevSpace is the tool that deploys your

00:07:30.289 --> 00:07:33.650
<v Speaker 1>containers to Kubernetes and creates this hot reloading

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:34.530
<v Speaker 1>workflow

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.370
<v Speaker 1>for these containers. Right?

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.810
<v Speaker 1>What DevPod does is it launches

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.530
<v Speaker 1>the environment to then start your IDE in.

00:07:43.045 --> 00:07:45.445
<v Speaker 1>So it is a layer lower when you're

00:07:45.445 --> 00:07:47.845
<v Speaker 1>thinking about what do I need to develop

00:07:47.845 --> 00:07:49.365
<v Speaker 1>an an application.

00:07:49.445 --> 00:07:51.285
<v Speaker 1>You know, you do need an IDE. You

00:07:51.285 --> 00:07:53.365
<v Speaker 1>do need a, you know, a linter.

00:07:53.685 --> 00:07:55.925
<v Speaker 1>You don't need a debugger. You do need

00:07:55.925 --> 00:07:57.045
<v Speaker 1>all these things locally,

00:07:58.470 --> 00:07:59.030
<v Speaker 1>and

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.110
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to get rid of that by

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.910
<v Speaker 1>essentially moving that into a DevPod. So it's

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:05.670
<v Speaker 1>very, very likely that if you're working with

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:08.390
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes and you love to work with DevSpace

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.550
<v Speaker 1>or another tool like Scaffold or, you know,

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.390
<v Speaker 1>any of these other tools out there, you

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.685
<v Speaker 1>would launch a DevPod, and then you launch

00:08:14.685 --> 00:08:15.565
<v Speaker 1>DevSpace

00:08:15.565 --> 00:08:17.885
<v Speaker 1>DevSpace from within that DevPod.

00:08:18.285 --> 00:08:19.805
<v Speaker 1>That's how it would typically

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:21.085
<v Speaker 1>work together.

00:08:21.325 --> 00:08:24.285
<v Speaker 1>But DevPod is a little broader than DevSpace

00:08:24.285 --> 00:08:26.845
<v Speaker 1>because even if you don't if if Kubernetes

00:08:26.845 --> 00:08:28.205
<v Speaker 1>is not your target environment,

00:08:28.669 --> 00:08:30.350
<v Speaker 1>you can launch a DevPod

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.750
<v Speaker 1>and work directly in there on top of,

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:34.030
<v Speaker 1>you know, Docker

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:37.230
<v Speaker 1>and without Kubernetes, right, which is something that

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:38.750
<v Speaker 1>DevSpace doesn't do at all.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:40.270
<v Speaker 1>Nice.

00:08:40.934 --> 00:08:42.855
<v Speaker 0>Alright. That makes sense to me, you know,

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:44.775
<v Speaker 0>especially even the tie in NV cluster where

00:08:44.775 --> 00:08:46.695
<v Speaker 0>you give your developers the ability to provision

00:08:46.695 --> 00:08:49.335
<v Speaker 0>virtual clusters and then, you know, big huge

00:08:49.335 --> 00:08:52.215
<v Speaker 0>dev Kubernetes cluster where they can then have

00:08:52.215 --> 00:08:54.135
<v Speaker 0>their dev pods where they run their DevSpace.

00:08:54.135 --> 00:08:56.055
<v Speaker 0>I think I understand that flow. Think it

00:08:56.055 --> 00:08:58.350
<v Speaker 0>makes sense. And I think it I mean,

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.670
<v Speaker 0>it's very interesting to me personally. One, I'm

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:02.269
<v Speaker 0>a developer advocate and I travel to a

00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:04.190
<v Speaker 0>lot of events and I I travel with

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:05.230
<v Speaker 0>a MacBook Air.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:08.110
<v Speaker 0>It's not slow, but for a dev environment,

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:08.990
<v Speaker 0>it's also not great.

00:09:09.545 --> 00:09:11.305
<v Speaker 0>And also for the last what Yeah. Three

00:09:11.305 --> 00:09:12.904
<v Speaker 0>years, I've had an m one or m

00:09:12.904 --> 00:09:15.865
<v Speaker 0>two MacBook and I've gotta say, you I

00:09:15.865 --> 00:09:18.505
<v Speaker 0>run into nothing but problems, especially compiling Go

00:09:18.505 --> 00:09:20.745
<v Speaker 0>and Rust and, you know, I'm pulling container

00:09:20.745 --> 00:09:23.330
<v Speaker 0>images which are only built for AMD sixty

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:24.690
<v Speaker 0>four and I'm pulling my head out going

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.610
<v Speaker 0>there has to be a better way. I

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:28.450
<v Speaker 0>can already see the draw to have a

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:29.970
<v Speaker 0>tool like DevPod

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.290
<v Speaker 0>where I can get an environment. Now, you

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:33.570
<v Speaker 0>said you can run it locally and that's

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:34.930
<v Speaker 0>great, but I I think for me, I'm

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:36.930
<v Speaker 0>gonna be like, okay. I wanna spin up

00:09:37.555 --> 00:09:39.954
<v Speaker 0>a scale way or an AWS instance. Use

00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:41.795
<v Speaker 0>that as my DevBox and have it managed

00:09:41.795 --> 00:09:43.475
<v Speaker 0>for me with the tools that I need.

00:09:43.475 --> 00:09:45.154
<v Speaker 0>And I'm hoping that's what we're we're gonna

00:09:45.154 --> 00:09:45.954
<v Speaker 0>see today.

00:09:46.274 --> 00:09:46.755
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:09:47.714 --> 00:09:50.115
<v Speaker 1>That's a repeatability we're we're aiming we're aiming

00:09:50.115 --> 00:09:50.915
<v Speaker 1>for with DevPod.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:55.070
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Alright. Shall we start having some fun?

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:58.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I'm excited. I know you always take

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:00.030
<v Speaker 1>these tools apart, so I'm I'm really excited

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.110
<v Speaker 1>to to see what you're doing with DevPod

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:02.510
<v Speaker 1>this time.

00:10:04.475 --> 00:10:07.115
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, I've hopefully, you everyone can see

00:10:07.115 --> 00:10:09.995
<v Speaker 0>my screen now. The website is available if

00:10:09.995 --> 00:10:13.195
<v Speaker 0>people wanna check that out at devpod.sh.

00:10:13.195 --> 00:10:14.955
<v Speaker 0>So go there for all the documentation,

00:10:14.955 --> 00:10:17.595
<v Speaker 0>links to download DevPod, and link to the

00:10:17.595 --> 00:10:19.195
<v Speaker 0>GitHub repository

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:19.850
<v Speaker 0>too.

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.010
<v Speaker 0>It's a nice website, you know. It's it's

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:26.250
<v Speaker 0>superficial things go. They're also important. It's nice

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.769
<v Speaker 0>when you have a developer tool that has

00:10:27.769 --> 00:10:29.850
<v Speaker 0>a shiny website for people to kinda understand

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.185
<v Speaker 0>what the use case is. I'm not gonna

00:10:32.185 --> 00:10:34.025
<v Speaker 0>spend any time on this. I just kinda

00:10:34.025 --> 00:10:36.185
<v Speaker 0>wanna go straight to the documentation

00:10:36.505 --> 00:10:38.025
<v Speaker 0>and see what we can do.

00:10:38.425 --> 00:10:40.265
<v Speaker 0>Now, I did cheat a little bit

00:10:40.585 --> 00:10:42.985
<v Speaker 0>mostly because I was curious last week and

00:10:42.985 --> 00:10:44.905
<v Speaker 0>I wanted to see what DevPod was and

00:10:44.905 --> 00:10:46.585
<v Speaker 0>I'm always curious to see when things prepared.

00:10:46.585 --> 00:10:49.279
<v Speaker 0>I agree. So I I had installed DevPod,

00:10:50.079 --> 00:10:52.959
<v Speaker 0>but I haven't done anything with it. So

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:53.920
<v Speaker 0>here we go.

00:10:54.959 --> 00:10:56.800
<v Speaker 0>And this is our DevPod UI.

00:10:57.199 --> 00:10:58.800
<v Speaker 1>Hold on. I haven't set up any providers

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.800
<v Speaker 0>except for I think I clicked the docker

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.445
<v Speaker 0>one, but that's where we are. But I'm

00:11:03.445 --> 00:11:06.325
<v Speaker 0>assuming step one is DevPod doesn't do anything

00:11:06.325 --> 00:11:08.645
<v Speaker 0>without one of those providers. So we need

00:11:08.645 --> 00:11:10.565
<v Speaker 0>to configure one or more so that we

00:11:10.565 --> 00:11:14.245
<v Speaker 0>have the ability to create the developer environments.

00:11:14.565 --> 00:11:17.110
<v Speaker 0>Correct? That's correct. Yes. Nice.

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:20.550
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's see. Yeah. I did add the

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:23.270
<v Speaker 0>Docker one. So I don't wanna use this,

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:25.270
<v Speaker 0>but I'm assuming it just runs containers

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.670
<v Speaker 0>and my Docker daemon, is Docker desktop. Right?

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.830
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:11:28.475 --> 00:11:30.635
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Yeah. Correct. Yeah. It just connects to

00:11:30.635 --> 00:11:32.555
<v Speaker 1>your local Docker daemon to kinda spin up

00:11:32.555 --> 00:11:35.115
<v Speaker 1>a, you know, DevPod as a container.

00:11:36.555 --> 00:11:38.795
<v Speaker 1>And then I think it gives you access

00:11:38.795 --> 00:11:39.675
<v Speaker 1>to the local

00:11:39.915 --> 00:11:41.515
<v Speaker 1>Docker as well, so you can run Docker

00:11:41.515 --> 00:11:43.755
<v Speaker 1>builds, etcetera, even inside that DevPod.

00:11:44.519 --> 00:11:46.839
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea behind it. If you use

00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:48.279
<v Speaker 1>one of the other providers,

00:11:48.759 --> 00:11:51.800
<v Speaker 1>there's providers that provision VMs. We call them

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.000
<v Speaker 1>machine providers.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.320
<v Speaker 1>That would be like AWS

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.199
<v Speaker 1>or

00:11:56.965 --> 00:11:58.805
<v Speaker 1>Google Cloud and and things like that where

00:11:58.805 --> 00:12:01.525
<v Speaker 1>you actually spin up a VM. And then

00:12:01.525 --> 00:12:02.725
<v Speaker 1>it would

00:12:02.725 --> 00:12:03.525
<v Speaker 1>deploy

00:12:03.685 --> 00:12:06.245
<v Speaker 1>Docker inside that VM

00:12:06.405 --> 00:12:09.125
<v Speaker 1>and then stand up the DevPod agent inside

00:12:09.125 --> 00:12:11.685
<v Speaker 1>that VM and then launch a DevPod container

00:12:11.685 --> 00:12:14.300
<v Speaker 1>in there. So whether you're using the local

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.339
<v Speaker 1>Docker provider or one of the machine remote

00:12:17.339 --> 00:12:18.140
<v Speaker 1>providers,

00:12:18.459 --> 00:12:20.940
<v Speaker 1>we're always launching Docker inside of it and

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.100
<v Speaker 1>then always launching the DevPod as a container

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:23.580
<v Speaker 1>essentially.

00:12:25.915 --> 00:12:26.555
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:12:27.835 --> 00:12:30.395
<v Speaker 0>That makes sense, I guess. So I guess

00:12:30.395 --> 00:12:32.395
<v Speaker 0>we should show the local Docker one, which

00:12:32.395 --> 00:12:34.315
<v Speaker 0>means I'll need to start Docker.

00:12:35.835 --> 00:12:37.435
<v Speaker 0>Is there anything else in the UI that

00:12:37.435 --> 00:12:38.580
<v Speaker 0>we need to kind of play with right

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:39.700
<v Speaker 0>now, or are we just gonna wait for

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.300
<v Speaker 0>Docker to start up and create our first

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:42.020
<v Speaker 0>workspace?

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I think that should work. You can

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.940
<v Speaker 1>hit create workspace here. I think even while

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.500
<v Speaker 1>it's loading, we can explore what

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.700
<v Speaker 1>happens over here.

00:12:53.485 --> 00:12:54.845
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. The first thing is you have to

00:12:54.845 --> 00:12:57.005
<v Speaker 1>enter the source. Right? You either select a

00:12:57.005 --> 00:12:59.165
<v Speaker 1>folder locally or you type in a git

00:12:59.165 --> 00:13:00.125
<v Speaker 1>repository,

00:13:00.365 --> 00:13:03.005
<v Speaker 1>wherever you have a dev container JSON or

00:13:03.005 --> 00:13:03.885
<v Speaker 1>something ready.

00:13:04.685 --> 00:13:06.365
<v Speaker 1>And then on the right hand side, see

00:13:06.365 --> 00:13:08.670
<v Speaker 1>links for, like, you know, Python or Node.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Js, kind of quick starts.

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.870
<v Speaker 1>Microsoft has these quick starts for

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:15.470
<v Speaker 1>GitHub

00:13:15.709 --> 00:13:16.830
<v Speaker 1>code spaces,

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:18.990
<v Speaker 1>and, you know, we are essentially using these

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:20.270
<v Speaker 1>examples

00:13:20.504 --> 00:13:23.305
<v Speaker 1>without any modification to show people, hey, this

00:13:23.305 --> 00:13:24.824
<v Speaker 1>is just like Codespaces.

00:13:24.824 --> 00:13:26.105
<v Speaker 1>I should use the same

00:13:26.504 --> 00:13:28.504
<v Speaker 1>definition. That's why it works out of the

00:13:28.504 --> 00:13:31.384
<v Speaker 1>box. But works of any repository, essentially, especially

00:13:31.384 --> 00:13:33.144
<v Speaker 1>if you have the dev container JSON

00:13:33.384 --> 00:13:34.584
<v Speaker 1>configured out in there.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.400
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So, I mean, what I did type

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.040
<v Speaker 0>there was my Contrail project, but I don't

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.600
<v Speaker 0>believe we have a dev container JSON.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.280
<v Speaker 0>No. We don't. Is that a problem?

00:13:48.295 --> 00:13:51.735
<v Speaker 1>I actually think it may guess

00:13:51.815 --> 00:13:52.134
<v Speaker 1>what

00:13:52.695 --> 00:13:54.855
<v Speaker 1>There is a cargo.com. The right image would

00:13:54.855 --> 00:13:57.014
<v Speaker 1>be. If that helps. I mean, we can

00:13:57.014 --> 00:13:58.695
<v Speaker 1>we can always try it and and check

00:13:58.695 --> 00:14:00.774
<v Speaker 1>it out if it works or not.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:04.360
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.000
<v Speaker 0>I always like to just see what happens.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.240
<v Speaker 0>So hey. Look. I detected that. I know

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.360
<v Speaker 0>this is really small. I don't think I

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.040
<v Speaker 0>can zoom in on a Mac app, but

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.400
<v Speaker 0>at least I'm I don't know how to

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.480
<v Speaker 0>do that. But it does say detective project

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.520
<v Speaker 0>language rust,

00:14:16.815 --> 00:14:18.815
<v Speaker 0>and it is pulling down dev containers Rust

00:14:18.815 --> 00:14:19.935
<v Speaker 0>latest. So

00:14:20.415 --> 00:14:21.935
<v Speaker 0>I guess it work. I can't promise you

00:14:21.935 --> 00:14:23.695
<v Speaker 1>that the application will actually launch in there

00:14:23.695 --> 00:14:25.855
<v Speaker 1>because it's it just takes, like, a default,

00:14:25.855 --> 00:14:27.215
<v Speaker 1>like, Rust image. Right?

00:14:28.655 --> 00:14:30.575
<v Speaker 1>If you have a dev dev container JSON,

00:14:30.575 --> 00:14:33.070
<v Speaker 1>you can obviously specify all of these things.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:34.510
<v Speaker 1>But we're trying our best to kind of

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.990
<v Speaker 1>guess what you need. That's

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:38.510
<v Speaker 1>the that's the approach here.

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:40.510
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I think this might work.

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:42.430
<v Speaker 0>It also says it's downloading

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:43.630
<v Speaker 0>Versus Code.

00:14:45.105 --> 00:14:47.025
<v Speaker 0>So this is now open my local Versus

00:14:47.025 --> 00:14:48.545
<v Speaker 0>Code, and it's setting up

00:14:50.305 --> 00:14:51.745
<v Speaker 0>SSH remote

00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:55.745
<v Speaker 0>container session. Yeah. Correct. Yeah. It it essentially

00:14:55.745 --> 00:14:58.305
<v Speaker 1>created that DevPod inside the container, and then

00:14:58.305 --> 00:14:59.505
<v Speaker 1>it connected you

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.320
<v Speaker 1>to that via SSH. You see that on

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.920
<v Speaker 1>the left bottom corner that it says the

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.480
<v Speaker 1>SSH connection there. Yep.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:07.600
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.640
<v Speaker 0>So I'm well, I don't have my macros,

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.560
<v Speaker 0>but that's okay. That's probably my fault.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.040
<v Speaker 0>I don't know how to type. There we

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.725
<v Speaker 0>go. So this is

00:15:21.285 --> 00:15:21.925
<v Speaker 0>yeah.

00:15:22.165 --> 00:15:25.365
<v Speaker 0>Linux machine. And because it's local desktop, we're

00:15:25.365 --> 00:15:25.925
<v Speaker 0>getting

00:15:26.404 --> 00:15:27.685
<v Speaker 0>AMD sixty four.

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:31.820
<v Speaker 0>And in theory, I should just be able

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.340
<v Speaker 1>to run a cargo build. Right?

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:36.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Fingers crossed.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.620
<v Speaker 0>Well, I can actually already see that I

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.700
<v Speaker 0>have Rust analyzer in my Versus code, and

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.895
<v Speaker 0>it's actually kind of doing all the fetch

00:15:42.895 --> 00:15:44.335
<v Speaker 0>and stuff at the moment. So we'll give

00:15:44.335 --> 00:15:46.255
<v Speaker 0>that a second. So maybe we can dive

00:15:46.255 --> 00:15:47.215
<v Speaker 0>into actually

00:15:47.615 --> 00:15:50.495
<v Speaker 0>what kind of happened here. So we added

00:15:50.495 --> 00:15:52.335
<v Speaker 0>a new workspace to DevPod.

00:15:52.735 --> 00:15:54.335
<v Speaker 0>We now have this thing where I can

00:15:54.335 --> 00:15:56.015
<v Speaker 0>just open it. That's there forever now. Right?

00:15:56.015 --> 00:15:58.089
<v Speaker 0>Even if I close this, I can assume

00:15:58.089 --> 00:15:59.769
<v Speaker 0>it. I can just restart this whenever I

00:15:59.769 --> 00:16:00.250
<v Speaker 0>want.

00:16:01.129 --> 00:16:03.689
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Open is just gonna reconnect the IDE,

00:16:03.689 --> 00:16:05.610
<v Speaker 1>right, to this environment.

00:16:05.769 --> 00:16:07.850
<v Speaker 1>And if you hit the three little dots,

00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:10.410
<v Speaker 1>you also see it says, like, start with,

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:12.329
<v Speaker 1>which essentially lets you open it with other

00:16:12.329 --> 00:16:12.889
<v Speaker 1>IDEs

00:16:13.185 --> 00:16:15.265
<v Speaker 1>in case like, the default one you selected

00:16:15.265 --> 00:16:16.785
<v Speaker 1>for your Docker provider

00:16:17.265 --> 00:16:18.545
<v Speaker 1>was Docker desktop

00:16:19.185 --> 00:16:21.585
<v Speaker 1>sorry, Versus Code on the desktop. But you

00:16:21.585 --> 00:16:23.265
<v Speaker 1>could also save Versus Code in a browser,

00:16:23.265 --> 00:16:24.545
<v Speaker 1>and then it would just connect you to

00:16:24.545 --> 00:16:25.185
<v Speaker 1>that one.

00:16:25.825 --> 00:16:27.185
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'm gonna try it.

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:31.390
<v Speaker 0>It's got a light color theme by default.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:32.510
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure how I feel about that,

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:33.070
<v Speaker 0>but

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:36.430
<v Speaker 0>that's Versus Code's problem, not yours.

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:38.190
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Here we go.

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:39.310
<v Speaker 0>This is neat.

00:16:40.764 --> 00:16:43.644
<v Speaker 0>See, I I went through a little phase

00:16:43.644 --> 00:16:45.885
<v Speaker 0>of trying just, like, to work from a

00:16:45.885 --> 00:16:47.725
<v Speaker 0>Chromebook for so long and could never get

00:16:47.725 --> 00:16:49.404
<v Speaker 0>it to work. And it feels like this

00:16:49.404 --> 00:16:51.165
<v Speaker 0>may have been the missing thing that I

00:16:51.165 --> 00:16:51.805
<v Speaker 0>needed,

00:16:52.045 --> 00:16:54.764
<v Speaker 0>like, Versus Code browser support at a remote

00:16:54.764 --> 00:16:57.080
<v Speaker 0>container with the tools that I need. That

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.760
<v Speaker 0>would've been pretty cool. Yeah. I mean, you

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.040
<v Speaker 1>won't believe it, but one of the first

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.120
<v Speaker 1>issues that were opened were, like, can you

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.720
<v Speaker 1>support iPads as well?

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.720
<v Speaker 1>And we're, like, dang it. Now we gotta

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.480
<v Speaker 1>create an iPad app for this.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.200
<v Speaker 0>People do love like, I the amount of

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.895
<v Speaker 0>times I see people with their iPads at

00:17:11.895 --> 00:17:13.734
<v Speaker 0>conferences and they've got a little keyboard on

00:17:13.734 --> 00:17:15.415
<v Speaker 0>it which I I have tried so hard

00:17:15.415 --> 00:17:17.414
<v Speaker 0>to be able to type on is impossible.

00:17:18.055 --> 00:17:19.575
<v Speaker 0>But they do seem to use

00:17:19.895 --> 00:17:22.215
<v Speaker 0>like a a web based Versus code and

00:17:22.215 --> 00:17:24.390
<v Speaker 0>and try to do stuff. So, yeah.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Alright. Not not for me. Don't they

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.869
<v Speaker 1>have the

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:29.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if they have, like, a

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:30.870
<v Speaker 1>keyboard you can attach with the iPads as

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:32.550
<v Speaker 1>well, like, you know, like the Surface

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:33.990
<v Speaker 1>ones have for Microsoft.

00:17:37.415 --> 00:17:39.975
<v Speaker 0>I thought you well, there's just MagSafe attachment,

00:17:39.975 --> 00:17:41.415
<v Speaker 0>but it does give you a USB c

00:17:41.415 --> 00:17:43.575
<v Speaker 0>slot. You can go nuts, I suppose. Oh,

00:17:43.575 --> 00:17:44.215
<v Speaker 1>okay.

00:17:44.934 --> 00:17:45.735
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:17:45.975 --> 00:17:47.014
<v Speaker 0>So that's,

00:17:47.015 --> 00:17:48.455
<v Speaker 0>you know, that's kinda cool. We're now building

00:17:48.455 --> 00:17:50.215
<v Speaker 0>our application. It looks like it's gonna build

00:17:50.215 --> 00:17:52.310
<v Speaker 0>because it's 75%

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:53.910
<v Speaker 0>through, and we didn't get an error from

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:55.350
<v Speaker 0>Versus Code to see that the rust I

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.190
<v Speaker 0>know how your build failed. So I'm assuming

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:58.630
<v Speaker 0>in a few moments, we all have went

00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:59.190
<v Speaker 0>from

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:00.710
<v Speaker 0>zero

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:02.070
<v Speaker 0>tooling

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.510
<v Speaker 0>to an IDE with rust support and an

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:06.710
<v Speaker 0>application that compiles.

00:18:07.435 --> 00:18:09.195
<v Speaker 0>Well, I think that's pretty cool.

00:18:10.635 --> 00:18:12.395
<v Speaker 0>But the UI is not the only way

00:18:12.395 --> 00:18:13.915
<v Speaker 0>to do this. Right? When I was in

00:18:13.915 --> 00:18:14.875
<v Speaker 0>the settings,

00:18:15.675 --> 00:18:17.435
<v Speaker 0>I did see add CLI to path and

00:18:17.435 --> 00:18:18.715
<v Speaker 0>I've got a green tech which means I

00:18:18.715 --> 00:18:21.059
<v Speaker 0>have the CLI. So I'm assuming if I

00:18:21.059 --> 00:18:22.740
<v Speaker 0>want to, I don't really need to work

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.419
<v Speaker 0>with the UI at all.

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Actually, what the UI does

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:30.740
<v Speaker 1>under the hood, whenever you click any kind

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.380
<v Speaker 1>of button to create something, it actually just

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.794
<v Speaker 1>runs the CLI command under the hood. The

00:18:35.794 --> 00:18:37.554
<v Speaker 1>adding to your path is really just more

00:18:37.554 --> 00:18:39.715
<v Speaker 1>of a convenience thing, so you can also

00:18:39.715 --> 00:18:41.475
<v Speaker 1>access the CLI directly.

00:18:41.794 --> 00:18:43.955
<v Speaker 1>But, yeah, every everything ties back to a

00:18:43.955 --> 00:18:45.715
<v Speaker 1>CLI command under the hood.

00:18:47.315 --> 00:18:47.715
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:50.529
<v Speaker 0>Fill up my CLI.

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:58.529
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So I can just do that. There

00:18:58.529 --> 00:18:59.169
<v Speaker 0>we go.

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:00.370
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:19:04.505 --> 00:19:06.585
<v Speaker 0>So shall we try a different provider?

00:19:09.385 --> 00:19:11.705
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I can see the the help page.

00:19:11.865 --> 00:19:13.305
<v Speaker 0>So I know I should probably be, like,

00:19:13.305 --> 00:19:14.980
<v Speaker 0>going through your get started, guys. I'm trying

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:16.660
<v Speaker 0>to be a bit more pragmatic here, but

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:17.619
<v Speaker 0>I also just

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.580
<v Speaker 0>wanted to play with it. So,

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:22.740
<v Speaker 0>we're kinda seeing the browser, and we've seen

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:24.580
<v Speaker 0>Versus code. I I don't use any of

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.659
<v Speaker 0>these other things. I'm not that fast.

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:28.900
<v Speaker 0>So let's see if we can manage some

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:29.380
<v Speaker 0>providers.

00:19:30.765 --> 00:19:32.205
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I'm just seeing we do have a

00:19:32.205 --> 00:19:34.125
<v Speaker 1>Vim quick start because that was another question

00:19:34.125 --> 00:19:35.565
<v Speaker 1>that came up in a in a previous

00:19:35.565 --> 00:19:37.245
<v Speaker 1>livestream, and I'm like, I don't know how

00:19:37.245 --> 00:19:39.165
<v Speaker 1>to connect this to Vim. Like, oh, I

00:19:39.165 --> 00:19:40.365
<v Speaker 1>guess we have a quick start for that

00:19:40.365 --> 00:19:41.005
<v Speaker 1>as well.

00:19:42.205 --> 00:19:44.285
<v Speaker 1>Vim?

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.020
<v Speaker 1>Which I guess makes sense. Like, if you

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.700
<v Speaker 1>scroll down, it probably just says, like, connect

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:50.980
<v Speaker 1>via SSH and then

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:56.420
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

00:19:58.355 --> 00:19:58.834
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:19:59.955 --> 00:20:03.554
<v Speaker 0>That's Aliases. Right? Is is that integration to

00:20:03.794 --> 00:20:05.394
<v Speaker 1>to connect to it.

00:20:07.554 --> 00:20:10.355
<v Speaker 0>I'm curious if that's modified my SSH config

00:20:10.355 --> 00:20:12.520
<v Speaker 0>or my, yeah, I guess it has done

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:13.320
<v Speaker 0>probably.

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.560
<v Speaker 0>I guess we'll find out when I spin

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.400
<v Speaker 0>up a remote provider because it probably won't

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.000
<v Speaker 0>do anything if I don't have one.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.160
<v Speaker 0>So let's see if we can get that

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.000
<v Speaker 0>working. In fact, for the build.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:23.880
<v Speaker 0>Ah,

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:24.440
<v Speaker 0>close.

00:20:27.985 --> 00:20:29.264
<v Speaker 0>What did I miss?

00:20:32.145 --> 00:20:33.665
<v Speaker 0>I'm sure I've got some oh, I probably

00:20:33.665 --> 00:20:36.385
<v Speaker 0>have like an open SSL dependency or something

00:20:36.385 --> 00:20:38.705
<v Speaker 0>that's needed. So let's close that for now.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:40.960
<v Speaker 0>So DevPod

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.080
<v Speaker 0>list,

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.000
<v Speaker 0>DevPods

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.519
<v Speaker 0>dot, I suppose.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.840
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm. Cool.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.480
<v Speaker 0>Alright. DevPod

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.240
<v Speaker 0>provider

00:20:53.695 --> 00:20:54.575
<v Speaker 0>add.

00:20:56.575 --> 00:20:57.455
<v Speaker 0>And then

00:21:00.895 --> 00:21:02.095
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You'd essentially

00:21:02.575 --> 00:21:04.335
<v Speaker 1>so, typically, you

00:21:04.575 --> 00:21:06.700
<v Speaker 1>need the provider specified

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:07.419
<v Speaker 1>in,

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:09.580
<v Speaker 1>you know, some kind of repository.

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.259
<v Speaker 1>I think there are default providers. You can

00:21:11.259 --> 00:21:12.940
<v Speaker 1>see that here, like, at docker

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:16.940
<v Speaker 1>and at AWS. Right? That's, the default providers.

00:21:17.419 --> 00:21:19.740
<v Speaker 1>But you could also point it at a

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:20.700
<v Speaker 1>repository

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:22.795
<v Speaker 1>or at a YAML file

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:25.755
<v Speaker 1>like the scale web provider that Engen

00:21:26.315 --> 00:21:28.635
<v Speaker 1>wrote, and then it would essentially pull the

00:21:28.635 --> 00:21:30.155
<v Speaker 1>specification from there.

00:21:32.875 --> 00:21:33.675
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.740
<v Speaker 1>If you in this provider, if you go

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:38.460
<v Speaker 1>to the,

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.460
<v Speaker 1>like, the gcloud,

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:42.700
<v Speaker 1>like, we just map gcloud to the actual

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:43.980
<v Speaker 1>repository.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.780
<v Speaker 1>Right? If you look at the releases here

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:47.900
<v Speaker 1>on the right hand side,

00:21:49.235 --> 00:21:50.914
<v Speaker 1>you see that there's one release of this

00:21:50.914 --> 00:21:51.634
<v Speaker 1>provider.

00:21:52.195 --> 00:21:53.794
<v Speaker 1>And in that provider,

00:21:54.195 --> 00:21:56.034
<v Speaker 1>in the assets, if you scroll down,

00:21:57.715 --> 00:21:59.794
<v Speaker 1>I think yeah. If you click show all

00:21:59.794 --> 00:22:03.280
<v Speaker 1>assets, it should share provider YAML. That's essentially

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.039
<v Speaker 1>the file that specifies

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.559
<v Speaker 1>how this provider

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.559
<v Speaker 1>is being run

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.000
<v Speaker 1>within DevPod.

00:22:14.475 --> 00:22:16.554
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So Yeah. It's like, like, the name,

00:22:16.554 --> 00:22:17.835
<v Speaker 1>the version. Right?

00:22:18.715 --> 00:22:20.715
<v Speaker 1>And then a whole bunch of commands, available

00:22:20.715 --> 00:22:21.515
<v Speaker 1>options,

00:22:21.515 --> 00:22:24.155
<v Speaker 1>like, region, etcetera. Like, everything that you've seen

00:22:24.155 --> 00:22:25.674
<v Speaker 1>in the in the UI, when there's a

00:22:25.674 --> 00:22:27.850
<v Speaker 1>drop down show you, you know, which region

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:29.930
<v Speaker 1>you can select, right, it essentially comes from

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:31.529
<v Speaker 1>this provider YAML file.

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:35.769
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Well,

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:39.690
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna very quickly off screen in another

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:42.410
<v Speaker 0>window, make sure my Google Cloud is authenticated

00:22:42.385 --> 00:22:43.904
<v Speaker 0>against the correct account,

00:22:44.225 --> 00:22:45.984
<v Speaker 0>not one of my customers' accounts,

00:22:46.385 --> 00:22:48.144
<v Speaker 0>and then I'll add the provider.

00:22:49.505 --> 00:22:52.544
<v Speaker 0>But I seen why am I doing this?

00:22:52.544 --> 00:22:55.025
<v Speaker 0>Because I seen when we were here

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.000
<v Speaker 0>that it said, be aware

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.640
<v Speaker 0>authentication is tangent obtain just in the g

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.080
<v Speaker 0>cloud CLI. And so I just wanna make

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.120
<v Speaker 0>sure that Yes.

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.600
<v Speaker 0>I'm on the right account before I do

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.320
<v Speaker 0>anything

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.280
<v Speaker 0>terrible.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.840
<v Speaker 0>And my customers Yeah. There's two options to

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.164
<v Speaker 1>authenticate it. I think the the safest and

00:23:12.164 --> 00:23:14.565
<v Speaker 1>the default option is to just use g

00:23:14.565 --> 00:23:16.724
<v Speaker 1>cloud CLI because, you know, whatever your

00:23:17.605 --> 00:23:18.485
<v Speaker 1>authentication

00:23:18.485 --> 00:23:20.565
<v Speaker 1>mechanism is with Google Cloud, it has it

00:23:20.565 --> 00:23:21.284
<v Speaker 1>in your,

00:23:22.485 --> 00:23:24.245
<v Speaker 1>you know, in your key chain or in

00:23:24.245 --> 00:23:27.390
<v Speaker 1>your in your, you know, Microsoft store

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:29.790
<v Speaker 1>that they have for Windows. Yep. So all

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:31.630
<v Speaker 1>that is safe, but you can also provide

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:34.030
<v Speaker 1>it with, you know, service account token and

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:34.830
<v Speaker 1>things like that

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:37.870
<v Speaker 1>if you would wanna specifically do that. But

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:40.670
<v Speaker 1>you we typically recommend just authenticate with the

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:44.165
<v Speaker 1>AWS CLI, g cloud CLI, and then the

00:23:44.165 --> 00:23:46.965
<v Speaker 1>DevPod CLI will essentially call that other CLI.

00:23:47.285 --> 00:23:48.005
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:23:48.085 --> 00:23:49.605
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That makes sense to me.

00:23:50.165 --> 00:23:50.965
<v Speaker 0>So

00:23:52.165 --> 00:23:54.645
<v Speaker 0>let's do DevPod provider ad.

00:23:55.765 --> 00:23:56.965
<v Speaker 0>Let's pull in a provider,

00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.950
<v Speaker 0>and

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:01.909
<v Speaker 0>I have a project called Rawkode Academy.

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:05.830
<v Speaker 0>I'm done.

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:07.669
<v Speaker 0>So

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:09.510
<v Speaker 0>I do a list.

00:24:11.835 --> 00:24:13.595
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Okay. So Docker is set to the

00:24:13.595 --> 00:24:14.955
<v Speaker 0>default and

00:24:16.155 --> 00:24:17.915
<v Speaker 0>from the docs we see Actually, it made

00:24:17.915 --> 00:24:20.315
<v Speaker 1>Google Cloud your default. Yeah. So in the

00:24:20.315 --> 00:24:22.235
<v Speaker 1>CLI, I think it

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:25.130
<v Speaker 1>yeah. It it does the latest one as

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:26.250
<v Speaker 1>as default.

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:28.170
<v Speaker 1>If you do it in the UI, there's

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:30.090
<v Speaker 1>a little checkbox that is, like, default checked,

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:31.850
<v Speaker 1>and you can uncheck it. That would set

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:33.450
<v Speaker 1>the false flag for this one.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:34.410
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah.

00:24:36.554 --> 00:24:38.715
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. If you click on add provider, you'll

00:24:38.715 --> 00:24:39.674
<v Speaker 1>see that as well.

00:24:40.554 --> 00:24:41.995
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of funny in the UI when

00:24:41.995 --> 00:24:43.755
<v Speaker 1>you click add provider, just click on one

00:24:43.755 --> 00:24:46.394
<v Speaker 1>of them. It's now loading the provider YAML.

00:24:46.394 --> 00:24:47.995
<v Speaker 1>That's why it takes like a second. Right?

00:24:47.995 --> 00:24:50.075
<v Speaker 1>If you switch to another one, it will

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.480
<v Speaker 1>load again for just a second because it

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:53.800
<v Speaker 1>always pulls it live from from GitHub.

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.680
<v Speaker 0>Oh, so you have the ability to really

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.680
<v Speaker 0>tweak and modify this without having to push

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.160
<v Speaker 0>updates to desktop applications all the time. That's

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.725
<v Speaker 0>pretty neat. Exactly.

00:25:02.804 --> 00:25:04.405
<v Speaker 1>That is the whole idea. And if you

00:25:04.405 --> 00:25:06.565
<v Speaker 1>click on this plus symbol there, that's the

00:25:06.565 --> 00:25:08.404
<v Speaker 1>way to add your custom providers.

00:25:08.485 --> 00:25:09.924
<v Speaker 1>So you can write a provider, put it

00:25:09.924 --> 00:25:11.765
<v Speaker 1>in a git repository, and it will essentially

00:25:11.765 --> 00:25:12.884
<v Speaker 1>pull it from there.

00:25:13.445 --> 00:25:14.804
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, let's find Angen.

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:21.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That's choice provider. I I don't know.

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:23.149
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a scale account?

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:25.630
<v Speaker 1>I do have a scale account. So

00:25:26.429 --> 00:25:27.389
<v Speaker 1>Oh, nice.

00:25:27.549 --> 00:25:28.750
<v Speaker 0>DevPod provider scale.

00:25:30.705 --> 00:25:32.705
<v Speaker 0>So how much code is that? I mean,

00:25:33.665 --> 00:25:35.905
<v Speaker 0>seven commits. I'm assuming He actually went the

00:25:35.905 --> 00:25:38.625
<v Speaker 1>fancy route. So the simple route is to

00:25:38.625 --> 00:25:41.265
<v Speaker 1>just have a provider YAML file that then

00:25:41.265 --> 00:25:41.585
<v Speaker 1>just,

00:25:42.649 --> 00:25:44.730
<v Speaker 1>like, literally has, like, batch commands in it,

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:47.130
<v Speaker 1>right, to call, like, g cloud, you know,

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:50.009
<v Speaker 1>create a VM, etcetera, right, via the CLI.

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:51.529
<v Speaker 1>But he went the fancy route by actually

00:25:51.529 --> 00:25:53.610
<v Speaker 1>making it a Golang based provider. So I

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:55.049
<v Speaker 1>was, like, super impressed when I opened this

00:25:55.049 --> 00:25:56.490
<v Speaker 1>up, and I'm like, oh, wow. This is

00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:56.890
<v Speaker 1>legit.

00:26:00.115 --> 00:26:00.835
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:26:01.075 --> 00:26:02.755
<v Speaker 0>So while I add this provider, we do

00:26:02.755 --> 00:26:04.515
<v Speaker 0>have a question from Russell at the chat,

00:26:04.515 --> 00:26:05.794
<v Speaker 0>so let me pop that up.

00:26:06.355 --> 00:26:09.475
<v Speaker 0>Russell is asking that he's in a reference

00:26:09.475 --> 00:26:10.915
<v Speaker 0>to open Versus code,

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:13.210
<v Speaker 0>And he's curious if that is

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:16.490
<v Speaker 0>the one the real code, but the open

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:18.570
<v Speaker 0>source one without the Microsoft metrics.

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:20.890
<v Speaker 0>And if so, do you have custom config

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:22.410
<v Speaker 0>as the last time he tried to use

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:25.265
<v Speaker 0>code OSS and needed a flag to enable

00:26:25.265 --> 00:26:26.865
<v Speaker 0>it to connect to dev containers.

00:26:28.065 --> 00:26:29.505
<v Speaker 0>Does that make sense? That's why I think

00:26:30.145 --> 00:26:30.865
<v Speaker 1>With the regular

00:26:31.745 --> 00:26:33.665
<v Speaker 1>yeah. I think the regular Versus code you

00:26:33.665 --> 00:26:35.024
<v Speaker 1>run on your desktop,

00:26:35.745 --> 00:26:38.225
<v Speaker 1>I I haven't tried it with

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:41.190
<v Speaker 1>code OSS, just with the regular Versus code.

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:43.750
<v Speaker 1>But I think what you are aiming at

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:45.110
<v Speaker 1>is, like, the browser

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:48.150
<v Speaker 1>based version. Because I think we got an

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:49.750
<v Speaker 1>issue about this as well a couple of

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:52.550
<v Speaker 1>days ago where folks have requested

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:54.150
<v Speaker 1>for us to use, like, the,

00:26:54.815 --> 00:26:57.774
<v Speaker 1>you know, the the non open source version

00:26:57.855 --> 00:26:59.855
<v Speaker 1>in the browser. Because they are apparently, I

00:26:59.855 --> 00:27:01.695
<v Speaker 1>didn't know that either before the issue was

00:27:01.695 --> 00:27:04.895
<v Speaker 1>open, that there are differences between the pure

00:27:04.895 --> 00:27:06.975
<v Speaker 1>open source Versus code, and, apparently, there's some

00:27:06.975 --> 00:27:07.695
<v Speaker 1>other version of it.

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:10.490
<v Speaker 1>And we run the pure open source one

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:11.850
<v Speaker 1>in the browser apparently.

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:14.330
<v Speaker 1>But locally, it's whatever you have in your,

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:16.169
<v Speaker 1>you know, whatever your Versus code

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:18.250
<v Speaker 1>says when when you have it in the

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:18.810
<v Speaker 1>path. Right?

00:27:20.205 --> 00:27:22.205
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Actually, I think there is some weird

00:27:22.205 --> 00:27:24.044
<v Speaker 0>things with the open source one. I don't

00:27:24.044 --> 00:27:25.245
<v Speaker 0>think you can access to a lot of

00:27:25.245 --> 00:27:27.804
<v Speaker 0>the extensions because it uses a different extension

00:27:27.804 --> 00:27:30.284
<v Speaker 0>marketplace rather than the official Versus Code one.

00:27:30.284 --> 00:27:31.565
<v Speaker 0>But I don't know if that's changed. There's

00:27:31.565 --> 00:27:32.924
<v Speaker 0>been a while since I looked into that.

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:34.990
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:36.750
<v Speaker 0>Let's add this provider.

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:38.110
<v Speaker 0>So click go.

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:41.710
<v Speaker 0>Oh, he's broke it.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:47.150
<v Speaker 0>His provider dot YAML seems to be incorrect.

00:27:48.705 --> 00:27:50.304
<v Speaker 0>Is that expected? Interesting.

00:27:52.065 --> 00:27:54.625
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we have to point it. Oh, yeah.

00:27:54.625 --> 00:27:56.705
<v Speaker 1>Can you just do the release

00:27:56.945 --> 00:27:57.745
<v Speaker 1>asset?

00:27:57.745 --> 00:27:58.225
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:27:58.865 --> 00:27:59.825
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we need that.

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:04.149
<v Speaker 0>Copy a link to the provider dot YAML?

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:06.149
<v Speaker 1>I think so.

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:12.310
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. So it can either be a

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:14.550
<v Speaker 0>URL or a local path to provider file.

00:28:15.265 --> 00:28:17.585
<v Speaker 0>Or okay. So maybe actually, what I should

00:28:17.585 --> 00:28:18.784
<v Speaker 0>have done is just do

00:28:19.345 --> 00:28:20.065
<v Speaker 0>this.

00:28:26.145 --> 00:28:27.985
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. There we go. Oh, perfect.

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.800
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So we could add some scale away

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.880
<v Speaker 0>credentials here, but I have already configured my

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.679
<v Speaker 0>Google account. So let's let's go with that

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.080
<v Speaker 0>make my life a little bit easier for

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:39.640
<v Speaker 0>today.

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:41.399
<v Speaker 0>So

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.080
<v Speaker 0>now we need a project.

00:28:45.115 --> 00:28:47.034
<v Speaker 0>Let's pick one of those ones

00:28:48.715 --> 00:28:50.794
<v Speaker 0>that were the example ones with the dev

00:28:50.794 --> 00:28:52.234
<v Speaker 0>container dot JSON.

00:28:53.034 --> 00:28:54.635
<v Speaker 0>So do you have a a language of

00:28:54.635 --> 00:28:54.955
<v Speaker 0>choice?

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh, it seems like you're a Rust fan.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.919
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an expert, though. Yeah.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.600
<v Speaker 0>Let's do it. Alright. The UI is, like,

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.200
<v Speaker 1>the the desktop project

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.320
<v Speaker 1>is written

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.240
<v Speaker 1>in Rust as well as far as I

00:29:11.465 --> 00:29:13.625
<v Speaker 1>as I know. I actually I I was

00:29:13.625 --> 00:29:15.225
<v Speaker 0>very nosy, and I went to look at

00:29:15.225 --> 00:29:15.945
<v Speaker 0>the code.

00:29:16.345 --> 00:29:18.184
<v Speaker 0>And I've seen issues in Tauri,

00:29:18.825 --> 00:29:20.825
<v Speaker 0>which is Yeah. This really cool framework for

00:29:20.825 --> 00:29:23.145
<v Speaker 0>building desktop applications with, like, a Rust tool

00:29:23.145 --> 00:29:25.305
<v Speaker 0>chain underneath it. So, yeah, I was very

00:29:25.305 --> 00:29:26.905
<v Speaker 0>excited to see that. I think it's awesome.

00:29:27.809 --> 00:29:29.570
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Yeah. I was a little skeptical in

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:32.370
<v Speaker 1>the beginning when the engineering team suggested that

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:35.330
<v Speaker 1>because there's other, like, more, I guess, mature

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:38.450
<v Speaker 1>frameworks at this point. But I'm super happy

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:40.130
<v Speaker 1>with with the result and, like, the team

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:41.169
<v Speaker 1>said it was, like, a lot of fun

00:29:41.169 --> 00:29:42.404
<v Speaker 1>to this. And they have a lot of

00:29:42.404 --> 00:29:45.044
<v Speaker 1>cool features, like, regarding, like, auto updates and

00:29:45.044 --> 00:29:46.404
<v Speaker 1>things like that baked in.

00:29:46.725 --> 00:29:48.804
<v Speaker 1>Seems to be a very, very smooth experience.

00:29:49.764 --> 00:29:52.005
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Definitely. It seems to be gaining quite

00:29:52.005 --> 00:29:53.365
<v Speaker 0>a lot of momentum too. I think a

00:29:53.365 --> 00:29:55.044
<v Speaker 0>lot of people are are struggling with Electron

00:29:55.044 --> 00:29:57.100
<v Speaker 0>these days because, like, the overhead of running

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.259
<v Speaker 0>electron apps is just getting worse and worse.

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.860
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure how Versus code Yeah. To

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:02.380
<v Speaker 0>keep their editors snappy, but

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:04.700
<v Speaker 0>I don't I don't I I struggle with

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:06.860
<v Speaker 0>electron apps these days. So Tari seems to

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:09.275
<v Speaker 0>be a pretty good approach. Plus, because it's

00:30:09.275 --> 00:30:11.595
<v Speaker 0>written in Rust, you can actually use WebAssembly

00:30:11.595 --> 00:30:13.355
<v Speaker 0>plug in models as well, which just makes

00:30:13.355 --> 00:30:14.715
<v Speaker 0>it even cooler. So

00:30:15.434 --> 00:30:16.715
<v Speaker 0>yeah. Very cool project.

00:30:17.434 --> 00:30:19.434
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Now the team was really proud of,

00:30:19.434 --> 00:30:21.515
<v Speaker 1>like, getting the size down. And I think

00:30:21.515 --> 00:30:24.759
<v Speaker 1>it's, like, under 30 megabytes now to download

00:30:24.759 --> 00:30:27.079
<v Speaker 1>DevPod, and it's quite slim.

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.480
<v Speaker 0>Wow. Some of the command line applications I

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.079
<v Speaker 0>build are bigger than that. So

00:30:32.519 --> 00:30:33.320
<v Speaker 0>that's great.

00:30:41.135 --> 00:30:44.415
<v Speaker 0>So this right now is creating a VM

00:30:44.415 --> 00:30:46.015
<v Speaker 0>on Google Cloud. Right?

00:30:46.655 --> 00:30:48.335
<v Speaker 0>So I'm assuming this may take just a

00:30:48.335 --> 00:30:49.135
<v Speaker 0>few seconds.

00:30:49.455 --> 00:30:51.935
<v Speaker 0>And I'm assuming, please correct me if I'm

00:30:51.935 --> 00:30:54.010
<v Speaker 0>wrong, that you're just stuffing a whole bunch

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:56.570
<v Speaker 0>of user data into, like, the cloud config

00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:59.450
<v Speaker 0>of some kinds to kinda boot that bootstrap

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:00.570
<v Speaker 0>it, get it to a point where it

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:01.370
<v Speaker 0>can function.

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So we have this DevPod agent that

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:07.770
<v Speaker 1>gets injected into the VM,

00:31:08.445 --> 00:31:11.885
<v Speaker 1>and then we launch docker inside the or

00:31:11.885 --> 00:31:14.284
<v Speaker 1>install docker within the VM.

00:31:14.445 --> 00:31:17.085
<v Speaker 1>And then we launch the container that you're

00:31:17.085 --> 00:31:19.884
<v Speaker 1>then connecting to inside that VM as well.

00:31:20.445 --> 00:31:21.005
<v Speaker 1>And

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:24.919
<v Speaker 1>we essentially connect through that DevPod agent

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.559
<v Speaker 1>to that container. That's like essentially giving us

00:31:27.559 --> 00:31:29.240
<v Speaker 1>just like SSH connection

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.640
<v Speaker 1>to the machine and then to the container

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:33.320
<v Speaker 1>that runs on that machine.

00:31:34.115 --> 00:31:36.755
<v Speaker 0>And how's the authentication handled between that agent

00:31:36.755 --> 00:31:38.035
<v Speaker 0>and my local machine?

00:31:39.235 --> 00:31:41.635
<v Speaker 1>I think that's such a, a SSH keypad

00:31:41.635 --> 00:31:42.835
<v Speaker 1>that gets generated

00:31:43.315 --> 00:31:44.195
<v Speaker 1>locally.

00:31:44.595 --> 00:31:46.755
<v Speaker 1>And we, like, we inject that into the

00:31:46.755 --> 00:31:48.915
<v Speaker 1>VM, right, with the with the agent.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:50.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:55.019
<v Speaker 1>And then regular, you know, I think the

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:57.260
<v Speaker 1>first, like, connecting with the machine is just

00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:58.140
<v Speaker 1>like regular

00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:01.020
<v Speaker 1>g cloud commands or, like, we're using, I

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:01.740
<v Speaker 1>think, the

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.540
<v Speaker 1>four four g cloud and AWS, etcetera. We're

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:07.095
<v Speaker 1>not, like, having to call the CLI directly.

00:32:07.095 --> 00:32:08.695
<v Speaker 1>I think we kind of use their client

00:32:08.695 --> 00:32:10.215
<v Speaker 1>libraries under the hood

00:32:10.455 --> 00:32:11.815
<v Speaker 1>or a mix of both,

00:32:12.295 --> 00:32:15.255
<v Speaker 1>whatever is available. Like, Kubernetes, obviously, you know,

00:32:16.135 --> 00:32:17.015
<v Speaker 1>GoClient,

00:32:17.015 --> 00:32:18.215
<v Speaker 1>etcetera, just connects to it.

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:21.250
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:32:21.809 --> 00:32:22.370
<v Speaker 0>Well,

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:23.970
<v Speaker 0>let's

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:26.130
<v Speaker 0>let's dig a little deeper on this. Right?

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:26.690
<v Speaker 0>So

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:28.770
<v Speaker 0>it's it's just my local Versus Code, which

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:31.090
<v Speaker 0>I love. Right? Browser ones are fine, but

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:32.930
<v Speaker 0>I spent a lot of time crafting my

00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:35.125
<v Speaker 0>config and my extensions for Versus Code. That's

00:32:35.125 --> 00:32:35.684
<v Speaker 0>a really strong

00:32:36.485 --> 00:32:37.845
<v Speaker 0>I'm I'm happy with this.

00:32:38.565 --> 00:32:40.565
<v Speaker 0>I could open this terminal here, and I

00:32:40.565 --> 00:32:42.804
<v Speaker 0>can do cargo run, and we should see

00:32:42.804 --> 00:32:44.885
<v Speaker 0>hello world. Right? But I gotta be honest.

00:32:44.885 --> 00:32:46.965
<v Speaker 0>I do hate this terminal in Versus Code.

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.280
<v Speaker 0>Can I do, a DevPod SSH?

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:51.880
<v Speaker 0>Is that a thing?

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.799
<v Speaker 1>What do mean DevPod SSH?

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.480
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well well.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:32:59.800
<v Speaker 0>Like, can I just can I use my

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.800
<v Speaker 0>own terminal? Oh, you mean, like, outside in

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:04.695
<v Speaker 1>your terminal? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That

00:33:07.575 --> 00:33:09.015
<v Speaker 1>would be the that would be the VIM

00:33:09.015 --> 00:33:10.135
<v Speaker 1>extension. Right?

00:33:11.015 --> 00:33:13.255
<v Speaker 1>To do it that way. Obviously, it's just

00:33:13.255 --> 00:33:15.174
<v Speaker 0>because the VIM extension said

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:17.030
<v Speaker 0>in fact, let's split this. Right? Because the

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:19.110
<v Speaker 0>VIM extension told me to do SSH

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:20.789
<v Speaker 0>workspace

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:23.510
<v Speaker 0>demo dot DevPod,

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:28.230
<v Speaker 0>which also works, which is also very cool.

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:28.789
<v Speaker 0>Right?

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:30.790
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming

00:33:31.805 --> 00:33:34.125
<v Speaker 0>I didn't really wanna show my SSH config,

00:33:34.125 --> 00:33:36.285
<v Speaker 0>but it should be okay, I think. I'm

00:33:36.285 --> 00:33:39.165
<v Speaker 0>assuming something's just yeah. You're just injecting something.

00:33:39.165 --> 00:33:40.684
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's just being added.

00:33:40.925 --> 00:33:43.085
<v Speaker 0>Correct. Okay. Good. And there's the SSH keys,

00:33:43.085 --> 00:33:45.005
<v Speaker 0>so we can actually see how that authentication

00:33:45.005 --> 00:33:48.045
<v Speaker 0>is handled and there's a DevPod directory with

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:48.419
<v Speaker 0>the keys available.

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.659
<v Speaker 0>So that's pretty neat.

00:33:51.299 --> 00:33:52.980
<v Speaker 0>But this is this this to me is

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:54.979
<v Speaker 0>the ideal workflow. Right? I've got

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:57.780
<v Speaker 0>what is now a Linux machine AMD sixty

00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:58.419
<v Speaker 0>four.

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:00.659
<v Speaker 0>We've got

00:34:01.539 --> 00:34:02.820
<v Speaker 0>three cores

00:34:03.075 --> 00:34:05.154
<v Speaker 0>and 16 gig of RAM. Not bad. I'm

00:34:05.154 --> 00:34:07.154
<v Speaker 0>hoping we can tweak that. And I've got

00:34:07.154 --> 00:34:09.074
<v Speaker 0>my own Versus code with my own extensions.

00:34:09.074 --> 00:34:10.835
<v Speaker 0>I can have been in the terrible terminal

00:34:10.835 --> 00:34:12.435
<v Speaker 0>and just work the way that I want.

00:34:12.435 --> 00:34:14.114
<v Speaker 0>So that means I can say hello

00:34:14.514 --> 00:34:15.395
<v Speaker 0>from

00:34:15.635 --> 00:34:16.114
<v Speaker 0>Linux.

00:34:16.599 --> 00:34:19.080
<v Speaker 0>And now my days of problems

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:21.880
<v Speaker 0>oh, I didn't put into the right word

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:22.440
<v Speaker 0>there.

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:26.040
<v Speaker 0>Where

00:34:26.119 --> 00:34:29.000
<v Speaker 0>would my app be? Let's let's see. Workspace

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:29.880
<v Speaker 0>is Rust demo.

00:34:33.055 --> 00:34:35.055
<v Speaker 0>Now we could do cargo run. I know

00:34:35.055 --> 00:34:36.895
<v Speaker 0>my days of having problems with my m

00:34:36.895 --> 00:34:39.215
<v Speaker 0>two Mac and pulling containers and stuff. And

00:34:39.215 --> 00:34:40.415
<v Speaker 0>you told me this gives me a Docker

00:34:40.415 --> 00:34:41.775
<v Speaker 0>daemon. Oh, it doesn't.

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.559
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Yeah. I'm not sure if you actually

00:34:46.559 --> 00:34:47.840
<v Speaker 1>have access from

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:50.719
<v Speaker 1>in here. Because I'm in a container, right,

00:34:50.719 --> 00:34:52.159
<v Speaker 0>rather than being

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:55.359
<v Speaker 1>Yes. On the host. But you can I

00:34:55.359 --> 00:34:56.960
<v Speaker 1>I think with g cloud, you could go

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.040
<v Speaker 1>into the VM directly, and you would essentially

00:34:59.040 --> 00:34:59.680
<v Speaker 1>see it there?

00:35:00.695 --> 00:35:02.295
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I wonder if there's a call for

00:35:02.295 --> 00:35:04.535
<v Speaker 0>maybe having a flag, like DevPod

00:35:04.535 --> 00:35:07.015
<v Speaker 0>SSH where I do Rust demo, but I

00:35:07.015 --> 00:35:09.095
<v Speaker 0>see dash dash host or something.

00:35:09.975 --> 00:35:12.455
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. There's actually a command because we had

00:35:12.455 --> 00:35:13.895
<v Speaker 1>to debug something.

00:35:14.455 --> 00:35:15.815
<v Speaker 1>Let me try to

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:18.170
<v Speaker 1>open the help page.

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:23.130
<v Speaker 1>Actually, go into the machine. We have a

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:25.050
<v Speaker 1>helper command for this as well.

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:28.330
<v Speaker 0>Oh, there was a DevPod machine command. Right?

00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:29.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah.

00:35:30.545 --> 00:35:32.945
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You can run DevPod machine SSH,

00:35:32.945 --> 00:35:34.465
<v Speaker 1>and that will drop you into the machine.

00:35:34.465 --> 00:35:36.065
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That's what I was looking for. Well,

00:35:36.065 --> 00:35:38.065
<v Speaker 0>the machine name is different. So let's do

00:35:38.065 --> 00:35:38.785
<v Speaker 0>a list.

00:35:39.185 --> 00:35:41.105
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no. I don't have machines. Yeah. The

00:35:41.105 --> 00:35:42.305
<v Speaker 1>machine name, that's something really

00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:45.470
<v Speaker 1>So it created one VM right now, and

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:46.990
<v Speaker 1>you saw that took, like, about a minute

00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:48.510
<v Speaker 1>or so to create that VM.

00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:49.390
<v Speaker 1>And,

00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:53.470
<v Speaker 1>obviously, that's something we can't change. Right? It

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:55.150
<v Speaker 1>always gonna take some time to start a

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:55.390
<v Speaker 1>VM.

00:35:56.075 --> 00:35:58.394
<v Speaker 1>So what we're actually doing is by default,

00:35:58.394 --> 00:36:00.555
<v Speaker 1>we're reusing the machine for different

00:36:00.795 --> 00:36:01.595
<v Speaker 1>DevPods.

00:36:01.595 --> 00:36:03.994
<v Speaker 1>Right? So you can have multiple workspaces.

00:36:04.555 --> 00:36:06.315
<v Speaker 1>And as long as you both if you're

00:36:06.315 --> 00:36:09.035
<v Speaker 1>using the Google Cloud provider again for another

00:36:09.035 --> 00:36:12.180
<v Speaker 1>workspace, it will create a second container on

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:13.460
<v Speaker 1>that very same machine.

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:15.780
<v Speaker 1>So the machine is shared by default.

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:17.540
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:18.660
<v Speaker 0>So yeah.

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:21.060
<v Speaker 0>There were two things interesting

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:22.100
<v Speaker 0>here. One,

00:36:23.145 --> 00:36:25.785
<v Speaker 0>I was already in the machine and I

00:36:25.785 --> 00:36:28.425
<v Speaker 0>ran DevPod machine. So DevPod was available inside

00:36:28.425 --> 00:36:29.705
<v Speaker 0>the machine, which is cool.

00:36:31.225 --> 00:36:32.665
<v Speaker 0>But when I came off of it, I

00:36:32.665 --> 00:36:35.385
<v Speaker 0>then was able to DevPod machine SSH onto

00:36:35.385 --> 00:36:37.145
<v Speaker 0>the Rust demo one, and I know I

00:36:37.145 --> 00:36:38.585
<v Speaker 0>can run Docker commands to see that.

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:41.890
<v Speaker 0>But I guess this is gonna be really

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:44.130
<v Speaker 0>good for most workflows unless one of my

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:45.890
<v Speaker 0>workflows says I wanna build Docker

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:47.650
<v Speaker 0>container images.

00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:49.810
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm. And I guess maybe there's a different

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:51.810
<v Speaker 0>dev container set up for doing something like

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:53.410
<v Speaker 0>that. But I guess that's not terribly important

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:55.145
<v Speaker 0>for right now. But I do like that

00:36:55.145 --> 00:36:56.505
<v Speaker 0>I have access to the machine.

00:36:57.545 --> 00:36:58.585
<v Speaker 0>This is a

00:37:03.065 --> 00:37:05.625
<v Speaker 0>this is a three core six hyper threaded

00:37:05.625 --> 00:37:08.345
<v Speaker 0>machine with 16 gig of RAM. Do I

00:37:08.345 --> 00:37:09.305
<v Speaker 0>get to configure that?

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So in the if you open the

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:16.290
<v Speaker 1>UI real quick, you'll see that you can

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:17.810
<v Speaker 1>configure the provider.

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:19.330
<v Speaker 1>And,

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:22.210
<v Speaker 1>you know, it's just essentially defined in the

00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:23.810
<v Speaker 1>yeah. If you hit that edit button there.

00:37:25.935 --> 00:37:26.735
<v Speaker 0>Ah.

00:37:27.695 --> 00:37:29.535
<v Speaker 1>And there you can define the machine.

00:37:29.855 --> 00:37:32.175
<v Speaker 1>Right now, we have this only for the

00:37:32.175 --> 00:37:32.895
<v Speaker 1>provider,

00:37:33.055 --> 00:37:35.055
<v Speaker 1>but what we actually wanna allow you to

00:37:35.055 --> 00:37:37.215
<v Speaker 1>do is change it for the workspaces as

00:37:37.215 --> 00:37:39.340
<v Speaker 1>well. And you see on the bottom, actually,

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:41.340
<v Speaker 1>the reuse machine right now is not checked.

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:43.340
<v Speaker 1>So you would always create a new machine.

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:45.740
<v Speaker 1>If you have the reuse machine, the second

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:47.660
<v Speaker 1>workspace would be using the same

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:49.180
<v Speaker 1>same machine again.

00:37:51.155 --> 00:37:53.395
<v Speaker 0>Ah, got it. Yeah. So I guess if

00:37:53.395 --> 00:37:53.875
<v Speaker 0>I

00:37:54.835 --> 00:37:57.235
<v Speaker 0>you say we used and configured us to

00:37:57.235 --> 00:37:58.195
<v Speaker 0>be like a,

00:37:58.835 --> 00:38:00.995
<v Speaker 0>you know, n two standard 16, which is

00:38:00.995 --> 00:38:02.355
<v Speaker 0>probably I'm not sure off the top of

00:38:02.355 --> 00:38:04.035
<v Speaker 0>my head, but probably a decent size machine.

00:38:04.035 --> 00:38:06.270
<v Speaker 0>I could reuse that for multiple projects and

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:08.030
<v Speaker 0>always get the create that Correct.

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:10.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You can also expand these, like, agent

00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:12.910
<v Speaker 1>options there, if you go back to that

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:13.550
<v Speaker 1>screen.

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:16.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's where you can see things like

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:19.150
<v Speaker 1>inject docker credentials and check grid credentials,

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:21.855
<v Speaker 1>etcetera, you know. And there's probably more options

00:38:21.855 --> 00:38:24.575
<v Speaker 1>to come. That's essentially what that agent that

00:38:24.575 --> 00:38:26.495
<v Speaker 1>lives on the VM is gonna inject into

00:38:26.495 --> 00:38:28.015
<v Speaker 1>the respective containers.

00:38:29.295 --> 00:38:32.015
<v Speaker 0>Ah, so it's gonna consume my local docker

00:38:32.015 --> 00:38:34.335
<v Speaker 0>and get credentials and put them. Alright. Okay.

00:38:34.335 --> 00:38:34.735
<v Speaker 0>Got it.

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:37.020
<v Speaker 0>How does it know

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:39.740
<v Speaker 0>if it's inactive? Like, if I quit the

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:42.380
<v Speaker 0>GUI, does it still does the inactivity kill?

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:42.620
<v Speaker 0>Or

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:46.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. So that's really interesting. The inactivity

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:49.845
<v Speaker 1>is actually managed by the agent that that

00:38:49.845 --> 00:38:52.085
<v Speaker 1>is running on the VM.

00:38:52.245 --> 00:38:54.245
<v Speaker 1>So what you're doing when you're SSH ing

00:38:54.245 --> 00:38:56.965
<v Speaker 1>is you're connecting to that agent. Right? So

00:38:56.965 --> 00:38:59.445
<v Speaker 1>that agent sees all the SSH connections

00:38:59.845 --> 00:39:02.165
<v Speaker 1>to the machine or to the workspaces on

00:39:02.165 --> 00:39:04.730
<v Speaker 1>the machine, and it essentially sees when there

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:05.770
<v Speaker 1>are no connections.

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:08.810
<v Speaker 1>And that's what this timeout is. So if

00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:10.890
<v Speaker 1>you would, you know, throw your laptop out

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:13.210
<v Speaker 1>of the window now, right, there's nothing running

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:15.050
<v Speaker 1>and no connection, nothing needs to be client

00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:15.770
<v Speaker 1>side, right,

00:39:16.605 --> 00:39:18.045
<v Speaker 1>Then five minutes later,

00:39:18.605 --> 00:39:20.845
<v Speaker 1>the agent would still it turns itself off.

00:39:20.845 --> 00:39:22.285
<v Speaker 1>Right? It turns the machine off that it's

00:39:22.285 --> 00:39:24.445
<v Speaker 1>running on, basically. That's what it does.

00:39:25.005 --> 00:39:26.605
<v Speaker 0>Nice. So it's it's yeah. It's like a

00:39:26.605 --> 00:39:28.525
<v Speaker 0>pulse or some sort of health check. And

00:39:28.525 --> 00:39:29.885
<v Speaker 0>if we're not checking in to see that

00:39:29.885 --> 00:39:31.809
<v Speaker 0>we're doing something on that machine, it's just

00:39:31.809 --> 00:39:33.890
<v Speaker 0>gonna stop itself, which I guess is good

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:35.089
<v Speaker 0>if you do start using some of the

00:39:35.089 --> 00:39:38.049
<v Speaker 0>chunky hardware. It's like the prices get wildly

00:39:38.049 --> 00:39:38.930
<v Speaker 0>expensive. So

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:41.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And I think that's a core benefit

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:43.890
<v Speaker 1>of of DevPod. Right? We we actively wanna

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:45.445
<v Speaker 1>encourage people to have

00:39:46.244 --> 00:39:48.885
<v Speaker 1>machines in different environments. Right? You can have,

00:39:48.885 --> 00:39:50.645
<v Speaker 1>as I said, one in, like, your local

00:39:50.645 --> 00:39:53.285
<v Speaker 1>minikube or your local docker,

00:39:53.525 --> 00:39:55.525
<v Speaker 1>and, you know, you can run simple things

00:39:55.525 --> 00:39:56.964
<v Speaker 1>there. And then if you need to do,

00:39:56.964 --> 00:39:58.885
<v Speaker 1>like, your integration tests or an end to

00:39:58.885 --> 00:40:01.360
<v Speaker 1>end test or, you know, something more complex,

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:03.440
<v Speaker 1>work on, like, real data,

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:06.400
<v Speaker 1>then you're just connecting to your AWS provider.

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.560
<v Speaker 1>But then you switch back to Docker again,

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.800
<v Speaker 1>you know, three hours later, and we don't

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.800
<v Speaker 1>want you to have to manually, like, remember,

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.405
<v Speaker 1>oh, I forgot to pause this. It ran

00:40:14.405 --> 00:40:16.885
<v Speaker 1>overnight. You know, that kind of thing. That's

00:40:16.885 --> 00:40:18.565
<v Speaker 1>why we added that automation there.

00:40:19.205 --> 00:40:19.925
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:40:20.485 --> 00:40:22.725
<v Speaker 0>We have another question from Russell in the

00:40:22.725 --> 00:40:24.244
<v Speaker 0>chat, so I'm gonna pop that up. But

00:40:24.244 --> 00:40:25.445
<v Speaker 0>Russell is asking

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:28.210
<v Speaker 0>if it's possible to share or reuse those

00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:30.930
<v Speaker 0>machines across multiple people within the team or

00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:32.609
<v Speaker 0>if it's local to the single user.

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:35.170
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could, but I would not

00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:38.105
<v Speaker 1>recommend it, to be honest. Because what we're

00:40:38.105 --> 00:40:40.025
<v Speaker 1>doing like you saw, you can SSH into

00:40:40.025 --> 00:40:42.585
<v Speaker 1>the machine. Right? And if we're injecting your

00:40:42.585 --> 00:40:44.744
<v Speaker 1>Git credentials and things like that into the

00:40:44.744 --> 00:40:48.025
<v Speaker 1>machine, right, it's probably not ideal to to

00:40:48.025 --> 00:40:49.945
<v Speaker 1>to share those kind of secrets.

00:40:50.505 --> 00:40:51.545
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Good call.

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:56.150
<v Speaker 1>So I think there's nothing that would stop

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:58.550
<v Speaker 1>you, right, except for your security team, I

00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:59.030
<v Speaker 1>guess.

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:03.349
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Well, most organizations are unfortunate enough to

00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:05.270
<v Speaker 0>have a security team. So it's alright.

00:41:06.765 --> 00:41:08.845
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if that's fortunate or unfortunate.

00:41:08.845 --> 00:41:10.285
<v Speaker 0>I guess it goes either way depending on

00:41:10.285 --> 00:41:12.445
<v Speaker 0>where your where your concerns lie.

00:41:12.924 --> 00:41:15.005
<v Speaker 0>This is a pretty cool project.

00:41:15.325 --> 00:41:17.484
<v Speaker 0>I I can see myself using this. I

00:41:17.484 --> 00:41:19.005
<v Speaker 0>mean, obviously, I'm gonna have to go write

00:41:19.005 --> 00:41:21.510
<v Speaker 0>an Equinix metal provider now so that I

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:23.990
<v Speaker 0>can get some chunky mail and start using

00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:25.910
<v Speaker 0>this for all of my machines.

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:28.310
<v Speaker 0>But I I definitely I really understand and

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:29.990
<v Speaker 0>appreciate the value proposition.

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:33.430
<v Speaker 0>I like the pluggable provider model. It's very

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:33.990
<v Speaker 0>configurable.

00:41:34.925 --> 00:41:36.445
<v Speaker 0>And if I can write an Equinix mail

00:41:36.445 --> 00:41:38.525
<v Speaker 0>provider with just some YAML, then good. I

00:41:38.525 --> 00:41:39.965
<v Speaker 0>don't know if I've I'm gonna go down

00:41:39.965 --> 00:41:41.484
<v Speaker 0>the the complicated

00:41:41.484 --> 00:41:43.725
<v Speaker 0>smart route like Angen did, but, you know,

00:41:43.725 --> 00:41:45.405
<v Speaker 0>it's nice to have an option, I suppose.

00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. For sure. Yeah. We were actually you

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:50.910
<v Speaker 1>know, after we saw that that gateway provider,

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:52.110
<v Speaker 1>we were like, hey. We should

00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:54.350
<v Speaker 1>have some kind of live session where someone

00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:55.950
<v Speaker 1>codes and provide it in an hour or

00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:57.550
<v Speaker 1>something like that, you know, when we just

00:41:57.550 --> 00:42:00.270
<v Speaker 1>stream it. Because it's relatively easy, and there

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:01.815
<v Speaker 1>there have been requests for,

00:42:01.895 --> 00:42:03.495
<v Speaker 1>you know, OVH and

00:42:04.135 --> 00:42:06.375
<v Speaker 1>and Hetzner and all of these, like, you

00:42:06.375 --> 00:42:07.415
<v Speaker 1>know, smaller

00:42:07.415 --> 00:42:09.974
<v Speaker 1>cloud providers. And I I think that's the

00:42:09.974 --> 00:42:12.135
<v Speaker 1>beauty of DevPod. Right? You're not restricted to

00:42:12.135 --> 00:42:14.215
<v Speaker 1>to these big environments. You're not restricted to

00:42:14.215 --> 00:42:16.260
<v Speaker 1>us creating this for you. You can just

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:18.420
<v Speaker 1>create it whenever whenever you need it.

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:21.700
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Definitely. I think we're in a quite

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:24.020
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if it's a fortunate time,

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:24.900
<v Speaker 0>but, you know, there are a lot of

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:27.140
<v Speaker 0>these smaller cloud providers whose pricing is getting

00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:30.125
<v Speaker 0>very competitive. And it was opens up even

00:42:30.125 --> 00:42:32.204
<v Speaker 0>to smaller teams, the ability to have these

00:42:32.204 --> 00:42:34.045
<v Speaker 0>remote dev environments and kind of give their

00:42:34.045 --> 00:42:36.365
<v Speaker 0>developer teams a bit more velocity and, you

00:42:36.365 --> 00:42:37.724
<v Speaker 0>know, the tooling that they need and the

00:42:37.724 --> 00:42:39.325
<v Speaker 0>hardware that they need without having to ship

00:42:39.325 --> 00:42:40.925
<v Speaker 0>them a new laptop every twelve months or

00:42:40.925 --> 00:42:43.724
<v Speaker 0>whatever. So it's

00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:44.430
<v Speaker 0>it's definitely interesting time.

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:47.550
<v Speaker 0>I'm looking at the Absolutely. I think even

00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:49.310
<v Speaker 1>even us, I mean, we're we're we just

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:51.150
<v Speaker 1>looked at the prices for, like, using it

00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:53.230
<v Speaker 1>internally. Right? And we're like, why wouldn't we

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:55.230
<v Speaker 1>use one of the cheaper cloud providers? Right?

00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:56.990
<v Speaker 1>Like, our dev environments don't need to be

00:42:57.615 --> 00:43:00.255
<v Speaker 1>in AWS because they typically they cost, like,

00:43:00.255 --> 00:43:02.015
<v Speaker 1>three times as much as as one of

00:43:02.015 --> 00:43:04.495
<v Speaker 1>the local providers, and and it just works

00:43:04.495 --> 00:43:05.295
<v Speaker 1>the same way.

00:43:05.615 --> 00:43:06.575
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. For sure.

00:43:07.695 --> 00:43:10.095
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, that's awesome. I love this project.

00:43:10.095 --> 00:43:11.455
<v Speaker 0>Thank you for coming on and and kinda

00:43:11.455 --> 00:43:13.370
<v Speaker 0>walking us through it. Is there before we

00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:15.210
<v Speaker 0>finish, is there anything that we haven't covered

00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:16.490
<v Speaker 0>that you think would be good to show

00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:17.370
<v Speaker 0>to the audience?

00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:20.970
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a whole bunch more settings,

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:22.730
<v Speaker 1>but I think people will probably explore them.

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:24.970
<v Speaker 1>I think, you know, by clicking through the

00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:27.805
<v Speaker 1>UI, things things usually get a lot lot

00:43:27.805 --> 00:43:29.645
<v Speaker 1>lot easier to kind of find out what's

00:43:29.645 --> 00:43:30.685
<v Speaker 1>what's going on.

00:43:31.645 --> 00:43:33.725
<v Speaker 1>I think one thing I haven't tried out

00:43:33.725 --> 00:43:36.285
<v Speaker 1>myself is working with the IntelliJ suite.

00:43:36.445 --> 00:43:38.125
<v Speaker 1>So I gotta I gotta try that, you

00:43:38.125 --> 00:43:40.000
<v Speaker 1>know, the JetBrains IDs. I'm not sure if

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.760
<v Speaker 1>if it seems like you have Versus Code

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:43.359
<v Speaker 1>guy as well.

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:47.039
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I've I I really I have a

00:43:47.039 --> 00:43:49.039
<v Speaker 0>rule about not running Java on any of

00:43:49.039 --> 00:43:51.359
<v Speaker 0>my machines, so that rules out the entire

00:43:51.359 --> 00:43:52.160
<v Speaker 0>IntelliJ

00:43:53.705 --> 00:43:54.585
<v Speaker 0>project.

00:43:54.585 --> 00:43:56.025
<v Speaker 0>I'm

00:43:56.345 --> 00:43:58.185
<v Speaker 0>I'm not frustrated with Versus Code, but, you

00:43:58.185 --> 00:44:00.025
<v Speaker 0>know, I always keep my eyes on upcoming

00:44:00.025 --> 00:44:01.705
<v Speaker 0>editors. So you'll see that when I'm on

00:44:01.705 --> 00:44:03.945
<v Speaker 0>the the CLI, I do use Helix, which

00:44:03.945 --> 00:44:06.185
<v Speaker 0>I think is really interesting alternative to them.

00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:08.260
<v Speaker 0>And I've been keeping a close eye on

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:09.460
<v Speaker 0>Zed as well,

00:44:09.859 --> 00:44:11.380
<v Speaker 0>but I don't think they have

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:13.859
<v Speaker 0>any support for this sort of dev container

00:44:13.859 --> 00:44:14.660
<v Speaker 0>workflow.

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:16.579
<v Speaker 0>So yeah. It'd probably be Versus code for

00:44:16.579 --> 00:44:19.059
<v Speaker 0>me for the foreseeable future, but always hoping

00:44:19.059 --> 00:44:20.900
<v Speaker 0>to find a new cool project.

00:44:21.455 --> 00:44:23.935
<v Speaker 0>And I actually think Zed uses Tauri as

00:44:23.935 --> 00:44:26.575
<v Speaker 0>well, the Rust desktop framework underneath the hood.

00:44:27.295 --> 00:44:28.575
<v Speaker 1>Oh, cool.

00:44:28.735 --> 00:44:30.255
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I think given the, you know, I

00:44:30.255 --> 00:44:31.135
<v Speaker 1>think DevContainer.

00:44:31.135 --> 00:44:33.215
<v Speaker 1>Json as a as a open source kind

00:44:33.215 --> 00:44:35.695
<v Speaker 1>of standard that Microsoft wants to to push,

00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:38.740
<v Speaker 1>I think pretty much any anyone building an

00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:40.980
<v Speaker 1>IDE or, you know, even doing some in

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:41.780
<v Speaker 1>browser

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:45.619
<v Speaker 1>things. Right? They essentially will look at that

00:44:45.619 --> 00:44:47.619
<v Speaker 1>standard and try to kind of comply with

00:44:47.619 --> 00:44:50.165
<v Speaker 1>it or have this, like, SSH capability that

00:44:50.165 --> 00:44:52.085
<v Speaker 1>is required to to then connect to these

00:44:52.085 --> 00:44:53.685
<v Speaker 1>dev container environments.

00:44:54.085 --> 00:44:55.925
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a that's something we're banking

00:44:55.925 --> 00:44:57.205
<v Speaker 1>on. Right? That this

00:44:57.605 --> 00:44:59.605
<v Speaker 1>this will be the standard, and I'm quite

00:44:59.605 --> 00:45:02.005
<v Speaker 1>hopeful that we don't have, like I think

00:45:02.005 --> 00:45:03.605
<v Speaker 1>right now, there's, like, five or six, like,

00:45:03.605 --> 00:45:06.540
<v Speaker 1>different competing standards, And we we looked at

00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:07.580
<v Speaker 1>the space and,

00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:09.580
<v Speaker 1>you know, I we can implement

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:10.460
<v Speaker 1>other,

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:13.020
<v Speaker 1>you know, standards as well if as long

00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:15.340
<v Speaker 1>as it opens to us, of course. But

00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:17.900
<v Speaker 1>DevContainer was already there and it's in

00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:20.095
<v Speaker 1>you know, it's GitHub pushing it and make

00:45:20.095 --> 00:45:21.215
<v Speaker 1>it so easy for you to add it

00:45:21.215 --> 00:45:22.415
<v Speaker 1>to a repository

00:45:22.735 --> 00:45:24.255
<v Speaker 1>so that we were like, okay. This is

00:45:24.255 --> 00:45:25.935
<v Speaker 1>the first one that we wanna build on.

00:45:25.935 --> 00:45:27.775
<v Speaker 1>But I can also see us build on

00:45:27.775 --> 00:45:29.935
<v Speaker 1>on other different standards there as well and

00:45:29.935 --> 00:45:31.940
<v Speaker 1>kind of be like the glue between the

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:34.340
<v Speaker 1>IDE, the cloud provider, and

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:37.060
<v Speaker 1>that essentially workspace definition that lives in your

00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:39.140
<v Speaker 1>Git repository. That's really the three things we're

00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:41.300
<v Speaker 1>trying to get together here.

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:43.700
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I think a really

00:45:44.175 --> 00:45:45.775
<v Speaker 0>interest in approach. Not that I wanna fill

00:45:45.775 --> 00:45:47.855
<v Speaker 0>up your feature backlog by any means, but

00:45:48.495 --> 00:45:50.735
<v Speaker 0>if if you can detect in the absence

00:45:50.735 --> 00:45:52.655
<v Speaker 0>of, like, a Versus code dev container dot

00:45:52.655 --> 00:45:54.895
<v Speaker 0>JSON, if there was, like, a a shell

00:45:54.895 --> 00:45:57.135
<v Speaker 0>dot next, you know, next is still a

00:45:57.135 --> 00:45:59.295
<v Speaker 0>very it's not popular, but it's a very

00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:01.800
<v Speaker 0>good tool for building development environments.

00:46:02.039 --> 00:46:03.720
<v Speaker 0>And if you could just bootstrap

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:06.680
<v Speaker 0>a machine with the Next system and then

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:08.440
<v Speaker 0>create a Next shell with that,

00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:10.599
<v Speaker 0>that would be a very interesting idea for

00:46:10.599 --> 00:46:12.599
<v Speaker 0>me. And I think Next is getting a

00:46:12.599 --> 00:46:14.839
<v Speaker 0>bit more popularity especially in the container space

00:46:15.204 --> 00:46:16.964
<v Speaker 0>as people are looking for tools to build

00:46:16.964 --> 00:46:19.525
<v Speaker 0>container images that aren't necessarily Docker in the

00:46:19.525 --> 00:46:20.325
<v Speaker 0>Docker file.

00:46:20.565 --> 00:46:21.684
<v Speaker 0>And Next seems to be a bit of

00:46:21.684 --> 00:46:24.005
<v Speaker 0>a rising contender there too. But that's that's

00:46:24.005 --> 00:46:26.724
<v Speaker 0>a segue Yeah. Definitely saw some some requests

00:46:26.724 --> 00:46:29.380
<v Speaker 1>in that direction on the on Twitter as

00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:31.460
<v Speaker 1>well once we, you know, once we launch

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:32.260
<v Speaker 1>DevPod.

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:33.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh, there's one more thing I wanted to

00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:34.340
<v Speaker 1>mention.

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:36.660
<v Speaker 1>If you wanna make it like, if you're,

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:38.260
<v Speaker 1>like, a open source maintainer like we are

00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:39.780
<v Speaker 1>and you wanna make it super easy for

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:42.785
<v Speaker 1>people to open a project with DevPod, we

00:46:42.785 --> 00:46:44.945
<v Speaker 1>also have this, like, open in DevPod button,

00:46:44.945 --> 00:46:48.065
<v Speaker 1>you know, where we register, like, the DevPod

00:46:48.065 --> 00:46:50.545
<v Speaker 1>protocol. Right? So you have this, like, DevPod

00:46:50.545 --> 00:46:52.705
<v Speaker 1>link that kind of, like, Zoom opens up

00:46:52.705 --> 00:46:55.425
<v Speaker 1>your the application and have has everything prefilled.

00:46:55.770 --> 00:46:57.130
<v Speaker 1>The only thing you need to have is

00:46:57.130 --> 00:46:59.690
<v Speaker 1>DevPod installed and at least one provider

00:46:59.930 --> 00:47:02.010
<v Speaker 1>to kind of, you know, spin that environment

00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:04.010
<v Speaker 1>up. And then we hope that will be,

00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:05.850
<v Speaker 1>you know, happening in more and more repositories

00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:08.170
<v Speaker 1>that these links get added as long as

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:10.235
<v Speaker 1>there is, like, a, you know, a dev

00:47:10.235 --> 00:47:12.075
<v Speaker 1>container JSON file in there. Or even if

00:47:12.075 --> 00:47:14.075
<v Speaker 1>not, as we've seen, right, it may work,

00:47:14.075 --> 00:47:16.395
<v Speaker 1>but it may require some tweaking of chunks

00:47:16.395 --> 00:47:17.035
<v Speaker 1>to

00:47:17.595 --> 00:47:19.435
<v Speaker 1>get the to get the project to actually

00:47:19.435 --> 00:47:19.995
<v Speaker 1>build.

00:47:20.475 --> 00:47:23.435
<v Speaker 1>Nice. That's something really, really cool we added

00:47:23.435 --> 00:47:25.650
<v Speaker 1>right from the start too. Yeah. That's a

00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:27.329
<v Speaker 0>nice touch. It just kinda makes it a

00:47:27.329 --> 00:47:28.930
<v Speaker 0>lot easier for people, especially if you go

00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:30.609
<v Speaker 0>to that read me of a project and

00:47:30.609 --> 00:47:32.930
<v Speaker 0>you're considering, well, maybe I'll clone this and

00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:34.210
<v Speaker 0>see if I can build it and do

00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:35.890
<v Speaker 0>some hacking on it. Like, just that one

00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:37.809
<v Speaker 0>click button to get that environment that you

00:47:37.809 --> 00:47:39.410
<v Speaker 0>know is guaranteed to work is,

00:47:40.135 --> 00:47:42.135
<v Speaker 0>yeah, a very strong selling point.

00:47:42.775 --> 00:47:43.495
<v Speaker 0>Let's

00:47:43.575 --> 00:47:45.495
<v Speaker 0>finish If you wanna contribute to DevPod, there's

00:47:45.495 --> 00:47:46.695
<v Speaker 1>a button there as well.

00:47:47.415 --> 00:47:50.215
<v Speaker 1>So definitely encouraging folks to do that.

00:47:51.015 --> 00:47:51.495
<v Speaker 0>Sweet.

00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:54.050
<v Speaker 0>Let's finish with a a couple of questions

00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:55.730
<v Speaker 0>then and then I'll let you go

00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:57.890
<v Speaker 0>and enjoy the rest of your day.

00:47:58.530 --> 00:47:59.170
<v Speaker 0>But

00:47:59.730 --> 00:48:01.250
<v Speaker 0>you lost just a week ago.

00:48:02.370 --> 00:48:03.730
<v Speaker 0>What is the response

00:48:04.035 --> 00:48:06.515
<v Speaker 0>been like? Are are people happy? You already

00:48:06.515 --> 00:48:09.075
<v Speaker 0>mentioned someone maybe talked about next on Twitter.

00:48:09.474 --> 00:48:11.315
<v Speaker 0>Just tell me about what you've seen from

00:48:11.315 --> 00:48:12.835
<v Speaker 0>the people that have been reacting to the

00:48:12.835 --> 00:48:13.395
<v Speaker 0>story.

00:48:14.674 --> 00:48:16.755
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. We've definitely seen a lot of, I

00:48:16.755 --> 00:48:19.900
<v Speaker 1>think, you know, positive responses. I think the

00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:21.740
<v Speaker 1>you know, when I compare to the vCosta

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:23.180
<v Speaker 1>launch, I think vCosta

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:25.340
<v Speaker 1>obviously being a much more

00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:28.380
<v Speaker 1>narrow project with Kubernetes multitenancy.

00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:28.860
<v Speaker 1>Right?

00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:30.940
<v Speaker 1>It took way long to get that kind

00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:34.005
<v Speaker 1>of, like, I guess, virality that DevPod already

00:48:34.005 --> 00:48:35.925
<v Speaker 1>got within a couple of days. I mean,

00:48:35.925 --> 00:48:37.845
<v Speaker 1>it's been, like, pretty much exactly one week

00:48:37.845 --> 00:48:38.645
<v Speaker 1>at this point

00:48:39.045 --> 00:48:40.645
<v Speaker 1>since since launching it.

00:48:40.964 --> 00:48:43.605
<v Speaker 1>And, you know, there's, like, over 800 GitHub

00:48:43.605 --> 00:48:45.925
<v Speaker 1>stars. We were in we ran GitHub trending.

00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:49.600
<v Speaker 1>There were a couple of, you know, threats

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:52.240
<v Speaker 1>on Hacker News and on Reddit going on

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:54.400
<v Speaker 1>that were very, very vibrant. And,

00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:57.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah, I think the the biggest thing for

00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:00.080
<v Speaker 1>us was see that people already contribute to

00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:02.105
<v Speaker 1>the project. Right? There have been, like, quite

00:49:02.105 --> 00:49:03.385
<v Speaker 1>a few pull requests,

00:49:03.785 --> 00:49:05.785
<v Speaker 1>quite a bit of issues open up. We

00:49:05.785 --> 00:49:07.545
<v Speaker 1>fixed a lot of bug. Apologies to all

00:49:07.545 --> 00:49:10.505
<v Speaker 1>the Linux users who tried it initially

00:49:10.505 --> 00:49:12.585
<v Speaker 1>because, apparently, the desktop app just showed a

00:49:12.585 --> 00:49:14.505
<v Speaker 1>white window when you open it up on

00:49:14.505 --> 00:49:16.025
<v Speaker 1>Linux. I guess we could have tested that

00:49:16.025 --> 00:49:16.345
<v Speaker 1>better.

00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:18.710
<v Speaker 1>But we got that fixed in the first

00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:21.590
<v Speaker 1>two days as well. So I think very,

00:49:21.590 --> 00:49:22.869
<v Speaker 1>very exciting to see a lot of people

00:49:22.869 --> 00:49:24.710
<v Speaker 1>just, like, get hands on experience with it,

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:26.470
<v Speaker 1>you know, because I think a lot of

00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:27.190
<v Speaker 1>projects,

00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:30.310
<v Speaker 1>you know, people may find it interesting. They

00:49:30.310 --> 00:49:31.994
<v Speaker 1>they give it a GitHub star, and that

00:49:31.994 --> 00:49:34.315
<v Speaker 1>may not actually try it. But given that

00:49:34.315 --> 00:49:36.395
<v Speaker 1>we've seen these error reports and feature requests,

00:49:36.395 --> 00:49:37.835
<v Speaker 1>we know that people actually gave it a

00:49:37.835 --> 00:49:38.795
<v Speaker 1>shot and

00:49:39.194 --> 00:49:41.275
<v Speaker 1>found some bugs or, you know, really liked

00:49:41.275 --> 00:49:43.515
<v Speaker 1>the project and and gave us that feedback.

00:49:43.515 --> 00:49:45.830
<v Speaker 1>And ton ton of people joined on on

00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:47.350
<v Speaker 1>Slack as well. We have a Slack channel

00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:49.110
<v Speaker 1>on Slack.love.sh,

00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:51.030
<v Speaker 1>not just for DevPod, but for all of

00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.910
<v Speaker 1>our projects.

00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:54.870
<v Speaker 1>Yep. And there's some vibrant discussions on vCosta,

00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:55.430
<v Speaker 1>but

00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:58.230
<v Speaker 1>I didn't expect the DevPod Slack channel to

00:49:58.230 --> 00:50:00.565
<v Speaker 1>have such a, you know, like a lot

00:50:00.565 --> 00:50:02.565
<v Speaker 1>of discussions going on, like, three days in

00:50:02.565 --> 00:50:04.725
<v Speaker 1>or so. That was kinda crazy to see.

00:50:05.445 --> 00:50:06.325
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:50:06.965 --> 00:50:09.205
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, last question then. It's like,

00:50:09.845 --> 00:50:11.445
<v Speaker 0>I know you're on the weekend. It's probably

00:50:11.445 --> 00:50:13.810
<v Speaker 0>a difficult one, but what what's next? What's

00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:15.090
<v Speaker 0>on the road map for DevPod? What do

00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:17.010
<v Speaker 0>you expect to be shipping feature wise in

00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:19.010
<v Speaker 0>the next, you know, six weeks, six months?

00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:20.450
<v Speaker 0>Do you have an idea what the future

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:21.090
<v Speaker 0>holds?

00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I think the biggest thing

00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:25.170
<v Speaker 1>that

00:50:26.065 --> 00:50:29.265
<v Speaker 1>I really wanna prioritize pretty highly is these,

00:50:29.265 --> 00:50:30.385
<v Speaker 1>like, making these,

00:50:30.705 --> 00:50:32.385
<v Speaker 1>you know, provider options

00:50:32.385 --> 00:50:34.865
<v Speaker 1>available on the workspace. Like you said earlier,

00:50:34.865 --> 00:50:36.625
<v Speaker 1>hey. For this one, I want a separate

00:50:36.625 --> 00:50:38.545
<v Speaker 1>machine with more CPU.

00:50:38.545 --> 00:50:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Right? Right now, you kind of have to

00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:42.100
<v Speaker 1>always, like, modify the provider

00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:44.340
<v Speaker 1>before you create a workspace. It's a little

00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:46.260
<v Speaker 1>bit of, like, a you know,

00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:48.340
<v Speaker 1>you know, the UX could be better on

00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:50.340
<v Speaker 1>that end, and I think that's I think

00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:52.660
<v Speaker 1>that's definitely a high priority among a whole

00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:54.900
<v Speaker 1>bunch of other UX

00:50:54.285 --> 00:50:56.204
<v Speaker 1>base where just people told us, oh, I

00:50:56.204 --> 00:50:58.365
<v Speaker 1>gotta click five times here and run this

00:50:58.365 --> 00:51:00.444
<v Speaker 1>command to make this this work. Couldn't this

00:51:00.444 --> 00:51:01.245
<v Speaker 1>be easier?

00:51:01.565 --> 00:51:03.725
<v Speaker 1>I think fleshing out these things will be

00:51:04.125 --> 00:51:06.540
<v Speaker 1>will be a pretty high priority

00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:08.700
<v Speaker 1>going forward. And then, obviously, adding more and

00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:10.860
<v Speaker 1>more providers. I think we've had a lot

00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:13.180
<v Speaker 1>of requests for, like, hey. I want, you

00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:15.340
<v Speaker 1>know, to make this work in Hetzner, etcetera.

00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:17.660
<v Speaker 1>Right? So we're planning to have these sessions

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:19.420
<v Speaker 1>where we just, you know, actively do that

00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:21.305
<v Speaker 1>with the team just like stream while we're

00:51:21.305 --> 00:51:23.944
<v Speaker 1>coding it. Maybe ideally get someone from on

00:51:23.944 --> 00:51:25.785
<v Speaker 1>the team or, you know, from Equinix on

00:51:25.785 --> 00:51:28.105
<v Speaker 1>the team or someone who wants to participate

00:51:28.105 --> 00:51:30.585
<v Speaker 1>in that session. And then, you know, that

00:51:30.585 --> 00:51:32.265
<v Speaker 1>will hopefully show more and more people how

00:51:32.265 --> 00:51:34.664
<v Speaker 1>to create these providers themselves as well, and

00:51:34.664 --> 00:51:35.625
<v Speaker 1>that would be a lot of fun.

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:37.660
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:40.780
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, thank you again for joining me.

00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:42.700
<v Speaker 0>DevPod looks like a a really cool tool.

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:44.940
<v Speaker 0>I'm looking forward to trying I'm definitely going

00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:47.180
<v Speaker 0>to be working on the Equinix metal provider

00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:48.860
