00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.120
<v Speaker 0>Hello and welcome back to the Rawkode Academy.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.200
<v Speaker 0>I'm your host David Flanagan,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.440
<v Speaker 0>also known across the Internet as Rawkode.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.000
<v Speaker 0>Today is another episode of Rawkode live where

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.680
<v Speaker 0>we take a look at open source software

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.195
<v Speaker 0>within the cloud native DevOps cloud world

00:02:03.515 --> 00:02:05.275
<v Speaker 0>and try to help you solve some challenges

00:02:05.275 --> 00:02:07.995
<v Speaker 0>with interest in software. Today is no exception.

00:02:07.995 --> 00:02:11.035
<v Speaker 0>We're tackling the wonderful world of secrets and

00:02:11.035 --> 00:02:13.355
<v Speaker 0>secret operations and secrets management.

00:02:13.755 --> 00:02:15.355
<v Speaker 0>And today, we're taking a look at a

00:02:15.355 --> 00:02:17.115
<v Speaker 0>project called Infisical,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.239
<v Speaker 0>And I'm joined by Vlad from the Infisical

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.239
<v Speaker 0>team to walk us through it. Hey, Vlad.

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:21.960
<v Speaker 0>How are you?

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Hey.

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.720
<v Speaker 1>Doing great. How are you? Yeah. Not too

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.079
<v Speaker 0>bad. This is always the highlight of my

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:28.200
<v Speaker 0>day, but I get to take a look

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.534
<v Speaker 0>at some awesome open source software. So before

00:02:31.534 --> 00:02:33.614
<v Speaker 0>we talk about Infisical, could you please take

00:02:33.614 --> 00:02:35.614
<v Speaker 0>a moment to introduce yourself and tell everyone

00:02:35.614 --> 00:02:36.335
<v Speaker 0>about you?

00:02:36.815 --> 00:02:39.135
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. Of course. My name is Vlad.

00:02:39.135 --> 00:02:40.415
<v Speaker 1>Thanks so much for having me. My name

00:02:40.415 --> 00:02:42.655
<v Speaker 1>is Vlad. I'm one of the cofounders of

00:02:42.655 --> 00:02:43.215
<v Speaker 1>Infisical,

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.830
<v Speaker 1>one of the first maintainers

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.390
<v Speaker 1>as well of the open source project.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.750
<v Speaker 1>And, yep, previously,

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.110
<v Speaker 1>I worked at,

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.390
<v Speaker 1>which is now one of the largest neobanks

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.925
<v Speaker 1>in Europe. I also worked at Figma.

00:02:59.165 --> 00:03:00.765
<v Speaker 1>I I think a lot of developers probably

00:03:00.765 --> 00:03:04.045
<v Speaker 1>know Figma. It's a very popular design tool.

00:03:04.605 --> 00:03:06.125
<v Speaker 1>And yeah. And and now I'm building in

00:03:06.125 --> 00:03:07.405
<v Speaker 1>physical. I I guess

00:03:07.724 --> 00:03:11.390
<v Speaker 1>I'll answer more questions about it. Yeah. Yeah.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.310
<v Speaker 0>We can get into that definitely.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.710
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's a good lineage you've got. At

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.790
<v Speaker 0>Figma, I think you're right. Everybody's heard of

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 0>it.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. What's interesting is

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.270
<v Speaker 0>I I like WebAssembly a lot, and I

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.190
<v Speaker 0>always go into conferences and talk about it.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.390
<v Speaker 0>And I'm like, who's used WebAssembly?

00:03:25.775 --> 00:03:27.535
<v Speaker 0>They always nobody ever puts their hands up.

00:03:27.535 --> 00:03:28.735
<v Speaker 0>And I'm like, well, you're just using it.

00:03:28.735 --> 00:03:30.495
<v Speaker 0>You don't know. Like, Infisq is always the

00:03:30.495 --> 00:03:32.415
<v Speaker 0>example. Like, if it's like their their platform

00:03:32.415 --> 00:03:34.175
<v Speaker 0>is made possible, I believe, through a lot

00:03:34.175 --> 00:03:36.495
<v Speaker 0>of WebAssembly. Anyway, I digress. It is. And

00:03:36.495 --> 00:03:38.655
<v Speaker 1>and Figma was one of the first users

00:03:38.655 --> 00:03:41.615
<v Speaker 1>and and, like, proponents of it ever. So

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:42.150
<v Speaker 1>yeah.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.630
<v Speaker 0>Amazing what you can do with web technologies.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.110
<v Speaker 0>So Yeah. Let's take a look at your

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.430
<v Speaker 0>current let's talk about your your new project

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.470
<v Speaker 0>and physicall.

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.910
<v Speaker 0>First,

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.855
<v Speaker 0>you're a brave person tackling secrets. Right? I

00:03:55.855 --> 00:03:57.855
<v Speaker 0>mean, that to me is a scary thing.

00:03:57.855 --> 00:04:00.334
<v Speaker 0>I I would never, in my right mind,

00:04:00.334 --> 00:04:01.855
<v Speaker 0>think I'm gonna sit down and make the

00:04:01.855 --> 00:04:03.455
<v Speaker 0>world secure by creating

00:04:03.455 --> 00:04:05.535
<v Speaker 0>a secrets management platform. So maybe you could

00:04:05.535 --> 00:04:06.975
<v Speaker 0>give us a bit of history of why

00:04:06.975 --> 00:04:09.269
<v Speaker 0>you decided to tackle this problem. It is

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.189
<v Speaker 1>well well, first of all, yes. It's a

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:13.430
<v Speaker 1>it's a scary problem, but, also, it is

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.389
<v Speaker 1>one of the biggest problems that developers and

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.269
<v Speaker 1>companies and different engineering organizations

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.550
<v Speaker 1>and teams face.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.030
<v Speaker 1>And and and it's one of those problems

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.944
<v Speaker 1>that they're they kinda you know, like, first

00:04:24.944 --> 00:04:26.465
<v Speaker 1>of all, there is no perfect solution for

00:04:26.465 --> 00:04:27.185
<v Speaker 1>it yet.

00:04:28.064 --> 00:04:28.625
<v Speaker 1>And

00:04:29.025 --> 00:04:31.185
<v Speaker 1>because all the solutions that are available have

00:04:31.185 --> 00:04:32.625
<v Speaker 1>certain kind of limitations.

00:04:34.064 --> 00:04:34.705
<v Speaker 1>And

00:04:34.865 --> 00:04:36.865
<v Speaker 1>developers are also not really willing to build

00:04:36.865 --> 00:04:38.865
<v Speaker 1>a solution in house just because of high

00:04:38.865 --> 00:04:39.905
<v Speaker 1>how high

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.650
<v Speaker 1>the stakes are

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.810
<v Speaker 1>for it. And and which is why we

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.410
<v Speaker 1>decided to build Infisical,

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.889
<v Speaker 1>which is, you know, a single platform,

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:49.169
<v Speaker 1>source

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.889
<v Speaker 1>that you're able to use for managing your

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:53.090
<v Speaker 1>application

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.770
<v Speaker 1>and infrastructure credentials

00:04:55.985 --> 00:04:58.544
<v Speaker 1>across, well, all of your infrastructure, across your

00:04:58.544 --> 00:04:59.665
<v Speaker 1>engineering teams,

00:05:00.065 --> 00:05:01.505
<v Speaker 1>with your teammates,

00:05:01.665 --> 00:05:03.265
<v Speaker 1>and and so on.

00:05:03.745 --> 00:05:04.465
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:05:04.785 --> 00:05:06.945
<v Speaker 0>This is a space, you know, as I

00:05:06.945 --> 00:05:09.960
<v Speaker 0>go back five years and was predominantly either

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.560
<v Speaker 0>crazy enterprise

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.720
<v Speaker 0>call us pricing. Right? You know, tools. I

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.400
<v Speaker 0>think CyberArk was probably one of the bigger

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.960
<v Speaker 0>ones.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.720
<v Speaker 0>Or or Vault, which is open source, but

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.840
<v Speaker 0>is notoriously

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.955
<v Speaker 0>difficult to operate. And trust me, I I

00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:24.475
<v Speaker 0>have tried many times and I'm sure you

00:05:24.475 --> 00:05:25.915
<v Speaker 0>maybe have in the past as well.

00:05:26.395 --> 00:05:30.235
<v Speaker 0>It's it's very difficult. And Infisical seems to

00:05:30.395 --> 00:05:31.755
<v Speaker 0>come out of that from a different point

00:05:31.755 --> 00:05:33.514
<v Speaker 0>of view. It's it's not scary. It doesn't

00:05:33.514 --> 00:05:33.915
<v Speaker 0>seem

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.100
<v Speaker 0>challenging to operate. I guess that's something that

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.380
<v Speaker 0>you set out from the start to be

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.620
<v Speaker 0>like, let's make this different. Is that a

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.340
<v Speaker 0>fair assumption?

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.820
<v Speaker 1>It it it is. And and how we

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.660
<v Speaker 1>view so something that I'll also say is

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.275
<v Speaker 1>how we view Infisical as we try to

00:05:48.275 --> 00:05:50.595
<v Speaker 1>center it around the trend of security shift

00:05:50.595 --> 00:05:51.235
<v Speaker 1>left.

00:05:51.475 --> 00:05:54.195
<v Speaker 1>And this is ultimately a trend where, you

00:05:54.195 --> 00:05:57.074
<v Speaker 1>you know, in the early days, predominantly security

00:05:57.074 --> 00:05:59.475
<v Speaker 1>was the responsibility of a single team within

00:05:59.475 --> 00:06:00.195
<v Speaker 1>the organization,

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.110
<v Speaker 1>which is basically the security team.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.830
<v Speaker 1>But right now, what's happening is that you

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.830
<v Speaker 1>see companies like Mercedes

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:08.630
<v Speaker 1>or

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:09.750
<v Speaker 1>Uber

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 1>or AstraZeneca,

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.030
<v Speaker 1>they they are using secret managers and, you

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.615
<v Speaker 1>know, like, some of those companies that you

00:06:17.615 --> 00:06:19.775
<v Speaker 1>mentioned, and yet their their secrets are still

00:06:19.775 --> 00:06:20.495
<v Speaker 1>leaked.

00:06:20.975 --> 00:06:22.735
<v Speaker 1>So they're kinda, like, not

00:06:23.055 --> 00:06:25.294
<v Speaker 1>protected against those kind of

00:06:25.854 --> 00:06:26.655
<v Speaker 1>disasters.

00:06:28.095 --> 00:06:29.694
<v Speaker 1>And and, obviously, for them, it's very high

00:06:29.694 --> 00:06:31.090
<v Speaker 1>stakes. For AstraZeneca,

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.010
<v Speaker 1>they have lots of medical data and and

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.810
<v Speaker 1>and so on.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.210
<v Speaker 1>And so what's happening is that developers

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.370
<v Speaker 1>are kinda, like, kept outside the loop, and

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.450
<v Speaker 1>they don't have the right tools to actually

00:06:43.515 --> 00:06:46.315
<v Speaker 1>act responsibly and and code securely and follow

00:06:46.315 --> 00:06:47.755
<v Speaker 1>these secure practices.

00:06:48.155 --> 00:06:49.835
<v Speaker 1>And so this is what we provide within

00:06:49.835 --> 00:06:51.915
<v Speaker 1>Infisical. And and our goal

00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:53.755
<v Speaker 1>and kinda, like, our

00:06:54.075 --> 00:06:56.155
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it is that you can build

00:06:56.155 --> 00:06:57.995
<v Speaker 1>the most secure tool ever,

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.500
<v Speaker 1>could be Vault. But if it's so hard

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.380
<v Speaker 1>to operate,

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.780
<v Speaker 1>developers are just not going to use it,

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.620
<v Speaker 1>and they're gonna find ways around it.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:07.860
<v Speaker 1>So, ultimately,

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.100
<v Speaker 1>it's not reaching its goal.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.620
<v Speaker 1>And and this is what we want to

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.275
<v Speaker 1>solve within Infisical. We want to provide a

00:07:13.275 --> 00:07:14.475
<v Speaker 1>very simple solution,

00:07:14.715 --> 00:07:16.635
<v Speaker 1>and we want to provide all these kinda,

00:07:16.635 --> 00:07:19.675
<v Speaker 1>like, leftmost tools for developers

00:07:19.915 --> 00:07:22.235
<v Speaker 1>to operate secrets. You know, whether it's CLI

00:07:22.235 --> 00:07:24.635
<v Speaker 1>or secret scanning products that we provide or

00:07:24.635 --> 00:07:26.075
<v Speaker 1>some other secret sharing features,

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.759
<v Speaker 1>you should be able to do it within

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:31.080
<v Speaker 1>physical in just one platform.

00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:34.199
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I resonate with what you just said

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:35.479
<v Speaker 0>there a lot. You know, I'm in the

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:37.240
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes space. I've been there for a while

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.520
<v Speaker 0>and, you know, we

00:07:39.615 --> 00:07:42.335
<v Speaker 0>vault was never part of anyone's Kubernetes cluster.

00:07:42.415 --> 00:07:43.855
<v Speaker 0>And maybe now, but it wasn't for the

00:07:43.855 --> 00:07:46.335
<v Speaker 0>last seven years. And instead, we came up

00:07:46.335 --> 00:07:48.415
<v Speaker 0>with these workaround solutions to the point we

00:07:48.415 --> 00:07:50.335
<v Speaker 0>have tools like SOPS from Mozilla,

00:07:50.655 --> 00:07:52.735
<v Speaker 0>where we actually just encrypt everything in the

00:07:52.735 --> 00:07:55.240
<v Speaker 0>story and get. And then key management becomes

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.080
<v Speaker 0>a challenge after that, and our secrets become

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.000
<v Speaker 0>very static. Right? We can't work with them

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.160
<v Speaker 0>with SDKs. Like, one of the coolest features,

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.080
<v Speaker 0>but in physical, it's okay to use. We

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.919
<v Speaker 0>can do really cool things with our our

00:08:04.919 --> 00:08:06.295
<v Speaker 0>secret properties.

00:08:07.015 --> 00:08:09.335
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Throwing things that get encrypted. I never

00:08:09.335 --> 00:08:11.895
<v Speaker 0>resonated with me. I hated it. And I

00:08:11.895 --> 00:08:14.135
<v Speaker 0>think that's just because vault was notoriously difficult

00:08:14.135 --> 00:08:16.295
<v Speaker 0>and people didn't wanna take that that burden

00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:16.855
<v Speaker 0>on.

00:08:17.415 --> 00:08:17.975
<v Speaker 0>So

00:08:18.295 --> 00:08:20.870
<v Speaker 0>yeah. I'm hoping people will be excited with

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.710
<v Speaker 0>what they're gonna see about Infisical.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.590
<v Speaker 0>But before we jump into the demo, I

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:26.949
<v Speaker 0>think you tell us about the name. Where

00:08:26.949 --> 00:08:27.990
<v Speaker 0>did that come from?

00:08:28.949 --> 00:08:30.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.510
<v Speaker 1>the name actually doesn't doesn't mean much. What

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:35.715
<v Speaker 1>what it means is it means kinda like

00:08:35.715 --> 00:08:39.315
<v Speaker 1>infinite and physical. So it's in physical

00:08:39.715 --> 00:08:41.955
<v Speaker 1>or or beyond physical.

00:08:42.275 --> 00:08:43.955
<v Speaker 1>You know, we are operating a lot of

00:08:43.955 --> 00:08:45.315
<v Speaker 1>these credentials

00:08:45.315 --> 00:08:46.355
<v Speaker 1>and and everything.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.100
<v Speaker 1>And yeah.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.500
<v Speaker 1>But but that's kinda it's kinda like a

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.860
<v Speaker 1>combination of engineering and DevOps and and these

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:55.580
<v Speaker 1>kinds of

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.220
<v Speaker 1>things. Yeah. It it was it was also

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.865
<v Speaker 1>I must say, was it was available in

00:09:00.865 --> 00:09:03.105
<v Speaker 1>a .com domain, and we wanted the .com

00:09:03.105 --> 00:09:03.904
<v Speaker 1>domain.

00:09:05.185 --> 00:09:07.185
<v Speaker 0>Always a big part of starting a company.

00:09:07.185 --> 00:09:09.105
<v Speaker 0>Right? Is what could all.org do you get?

00:09:09.505 --> 00:09:11.425
<v Speaker 0>Right. Yeah. Your your infinity logo works with

00:09:11.425 --> 00:09:13.024
<v Speaker 0>the name, and, of course, the DevOps cycle

00:09:13.024 --> 00:09:14.625
<v Speaker 0>loop is also that kind of infinity thing.

00:09:14.625 --> 00:09:16.379
<v Speaker 0>So I guess there's a lot. If you

00:09:16.379 --> 00:09:17.980
<v Speaker 0>wanna make up a really compelling story, it's

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:19.339
<v Speaker 0>definitely waiting there for you.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:20.380
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.420
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Shall we get hands on and show

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.100
<v Speaker 0>people how they can get started and what

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.740
<v Speaker 0>Infisical is? You happy for that? Yeah. Yeah.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.459
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. Perfect. Let me just clear,

00:09:31.019 --> 00:09:33.555
<v Speaker 1>you know, a kinda like a sample

00:09:34.035 --> 00:09:35.555
<v Speaker 1>and physical project.

00:09:36.435 --> 00:09:37.075
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm.

00:09:38.515 --> 00:09:40.835
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Are you able to see my screen?

00:09:40.915 --> 00:09:43.075
<v Speaker 1>It's a it's a very, indeed. Yeah. It's

00:09:43.075 --> 00:09:43.635
<v Speaker 0>live. Go

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:47.730
<v Speaker 1>Perfect. So I I created a, you know,

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:49.650
<v Speaker 1>a Rawkode organization

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.810
<v Speaker 1>here, and right now, we're in the project

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:52.690
<v Speaker 1>call server

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:54.690
<v Speaker 1>just for folks to understand.

00:09:56.125 --> 00:09:58.685
<v Speaker 1>And so, ultimately, when you are in the

00:09:58.685 --> 00:09:59.885
<v Speaker 1>Infisical project,

00:10:00.285 --> 00:10:01.245
<v Speaker 1>the first

00:10:01.485 --> 00:10:04.365
<v Speaker 1>difference that you see from, you know, traditional

00:10:04.365 --> 00:10:05.885
<v Speaker 1>secret management solutions

00:10:06.205 --> 00:10:07.965
<v Speaker 1>is that we have this concept

00:10:08.205 --> 00:10:09.245
<v Speaker 1>of environments.

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.310
<v Speaker 1>So in this case, you see that in

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.150
<v Speaker 1>this project, we have development staging

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:15.950
<v Speaker 1>and, you know, three different production environments, such

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:18.430
<v Speaker 1>as prod Asia, prod US, and prod EU.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.510
<v Speaker 1>And these are highly customizable.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:22.590
<v Speaker 1>You know, we see a lot of engineering

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:24.774
<v Speaker 1>teams have, for example, like a preprode environments

00:10:24.774 --> 00:10:28.774
<v Speaker 1>or multiple staging environments or some some teams

00:10:28.774 --> 00:10:31.894
<v Speaker 1>have different development environments for features they are

00:10:31.894 --> 00:10:32.615
<v Speaker 1>developing

00:10:33.815 --> 00:10:34.455
<v Speaker 1>and so on.

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:38.710
<v Speaker 1>So, yeah, this environment concept is is very

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:41.350
<v Speaker 1>common across, you know, like, how engineering teams

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.670
<v Speaker 1>organize their secrets and their applications.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:45.910
<v Speaker 1>And and this screen gives you a bird's

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:48.070
<v Speaker 1>eye view of everything that's happening. You can

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:49.910
<v Speaker 1>immediately know if a secret is missing in

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.110
<v Speaker 1>a particular environment

00:10:51.644 --> 00:10:53.805
<v Speaker 1>or if if if the secret is there,

00:10:53.805 --> 00:10:55.805
<v Speaker 1>but the value is not specified yet.

00:10:56.125 --> 00:10:58.125
<v Speaker 1>You can immediately see it on the screen.

00:10:59.565 --> 00:11:00.365
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:11:01.084 --> 00:11:03.005
<v Speaker 0>What what are the red squares at the

00:11:03.005 --> 00:11:04.605
<v Speaker 0>top for Asia and EU?

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.019
<v Speaker 1>These are just telling you, you know, you're

00:11:07.019 --> 00:11:09.579
<v Speaker 1>missing two secrets compared to other environments. Alright.

00:11:09.579 --> 00:11:11.180
<v Speaker 1>So if you're you you see we're missing

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.779
<v Speaker 1>email, SMTP. We're missing Stripe publishable key. So

00:11:14.779 --> 00:11:16.220
<v Speaker 1>then it just tells you, hey. Like, be

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.819
<v Speaker 1>careful. There is, like, two secrets missing.

00:11:18.555 --> 00:11:21.915
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Nice. Yep. Because, ultimately, like, why why

00:11:21.915 --> 00:11:25.195
<v Speaker 1>this view exists is because we've seen times

00:11:25.195 --> 00:11:27.755
<v Speaker 1>and times, you know, when developers are deploying

00:11:27.755 --> 00:11:29.595
<v Speaker 1>something and then they accidentally

00:11:29.595 --> 00:11:30.875
<v Speaker 1>forgot to specify

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:35.149
<v Speaker 1>a certain environment variable or secrets or configuration.

00:11:36.509 --> 00:11:38.029
<v Speaker 1>And then they're, you know, they're trying to

00:11:38.029 --> 00:11:40.029
<v Speaker 1>figure out why their deployments don't work, and

00:11:40.029 --> 00:11:41.949
<v Speaker 1>and this feature makes these things much, much

00:11:41.949 --> 00:11:42.509
<v Speaker 1>easier.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.430
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's one of the things I've noticed

00:11:44.595 --> 00:11:47.634
<v Speaker 0>from exploring Infisical and going through the documentation.

00:11:47.634 --> 00:11:49.475
<v Speaker 0>It's not you don't you're not just encouraging

00:11:49.475 --> 00:11:51.555
<v Speaker 0>people just to put the secret material in

00:11:51.555 --> 00:11:53.555
<v Speaker 0>it. You're like, just get rid of your

00:11:53.555 --> 00:11:56.194
<v Speaker 0>ENV file. Just put everything into Infisical, and

00:11:56.194 --> 00:11:58.194
<v Speaker 0>then you have this level of visibility of

00:11:58.194 --> 00:11:59.920
<v Speaker 0>what's missing and what's not and so forth.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.520
<v Speaker 0>And I I like that approach. Yes.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.320
<v Speaker 1>It it it could be anything. So now

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.720
<v Speaker 1>if we go into any particular environment,

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.520
<v Speaker 1>so we can go so what you see

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.960
<v Speaker 1>here is, you know, a set of key

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:11.600
<v Speaker 1>value pairs,

00:12:13.265 --> 00:12:15.904
<v Speaker 1>but the value itself can be anything. It

00:12:15.904 --> 00:12:18.065
<v Speaker 1>could be a multiline secret, for example, like

00:12:18.065 --> 00:12:20.144
<v Speaker 1>a JSON file. It could be an SSH

00:12:20.144 --> 00:12:21.024
<v Speaker 1>certificate.

00:12:22.144 --> 00:12:25.105
<v Speaker 1>And in in physical, kinda, like, automatically parse

00:12:25.105 --> 00:12:26.704
<v Speaker 1>it for you in the right format,

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.910
<v Speaker 1>But it could also be a configuration.

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:33.590
<v Speaker 1>It it it yeah. It's really anything that

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:36.630
<v Speaker 1>you might that differentiates your environment,

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.350
<v Speaker 1>yeah, across different environments.

00:12:40.465 --> 00:12:41.265
<v Speaker 1>Next.

00:12:41.665 --> 00:12:42.305
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:12:42.625 --> 00:12:44.625
<v Speaker 1>And so now we are you can see

00:12:44.625 --> 00:12:46.225
<v Speaker 1>we're in the development environment.

00:12:47.025 --> 00:12:49.265
<v Speaker 1>And here, it's kinda like a deeper view

00:12:49.265 --> 00:12:51.105
<v Speaker 1>into any particular environment.

00:12:51.585 --> 00:12:52.705
<v Speaker 1>There is a lot of features

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:54.090
<v Speaker 1>that are

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.050
<v Speaker 1>embedded into it. So for example, if you

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:58.410
<v Speaker 1>take the DB URL,

00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:59.850
<v Speaker 1>you can see that the value is a

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:01.530
<v Speaker 1>MongoDB access token.

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:04.410
<v Speaker 1>And the cool thing about it is that

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:07.964
<v Speaker 1>it's actually able to reference other secrets. So

00:13:07.964 --> 00:13:09.084
<v Speaker 1>in this case, you can see that we

00:13:09.084 --> 00:13:12.125
<v Speaker 1>are referencing database password and database username.

00:13:12.204 --> 00:13:14.444
<v Speaker 1>So every time we update database password and

00:13:14.444 --> 00:13:15.644
<v Speaker 1>database username,

00:13:15.725 --> 00:13:17.485
<v Speaker 1>it will actually be propagated

00:13:17.725 --> 00:13:18.685
<v Speaker 1>to,

00:13:18.764 --> 00:13:20.845
<v Speaker 1>you know, all the other mentions of this

00:13:20.845 --> 00:13:23.420
<v Speaker 1>particular sequence. And and right now, you know,

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.740
<v Speaker 1>we are querying it from this particular environment.

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:26.940
<v Speaker 1>We could also

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.420
<v Speaker 1>query it from

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.300
<v Speaker 1>reference it from other environments. So in this

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:33.980
<v Speaker 1>case, we're you're doing it from staging.

00:13:35.715 --> 00:13:37.715
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, it it it it's really up

00:13:37.715 --> 00:13:38.755
<v Speaker 1>to you on how you want to set

00:13:38.755 --> 00:13:40.275
<v Speaker 1>it up. Yeah.

00:13:40.995 --> 00:13:41.715
<v Speaker 0>I like that.

00:13:42.915 --> 00:13:45.235
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And and this feature, you know, a

00:13:45.235 --> 00:13:47.315
<v Speaker 1>lot of engineers using us, they like it

00:13:47.315 --> 00:13:49.910
<v Speaker 1>a lot because, ultimately, you know, it automates

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:52.710
<v Speaker 1>a lot of things. It allows them to

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:54.870
<v Speaker 1>just update the secret once,

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:57.030
<v Speaker 1>and the values will be propagated everywhere it's

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:57.750
<v Speaker 1>being used.

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:00.390
<v Speaker 1>So it becomes very convenient.

00:14:02.245 --> 00:14:04.325
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And and there's lots of other things.

00:14:04.325 --> 00:14:06.325
<v Speaker 1>So for example, you can add tags

00:14:06.645 --> 00:14:07.605
<v Speaker 1>to your

00:14:08.005 --> 00:14:10.405
<v Speaker 1>secrets. If you have hundreds or we have

00:14:10.405 --> 00:14:12.405
<v Speaker 1>some teams have thousands or tens of thousands

00:14:12.405 --> 00:14:12.965
<v Speaker 1>of secrets,

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.200
<v Speaker 1>then this becomes very convenient because they can

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.600
<v Speaker 1>just filter or search for those later on.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.000
<v Speaker 1>You can also add comments

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.760
<v Speaker 1>to your secrets.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.960
<v Speaker 1>So, you know, if you're onboarding new people

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.875
<v Speaker 1>to your team or you just want to

00:14:27.875 --> 00:14:30.275
<v Speaker 1>remember how to generate a certain encryption key,

00:14:30.275 --> 00:14:31.795
<v Speaker 1>then you can just specify it here. You

00:14:31.795 --> 00:14:33.635
<v Speaker 1>can think of it as metadata fields,

00:14:34.595 --> 00:14:36.675
<v Speaker 1>and you will always kinda, like, have it

00:14:36.675 --> 00:14:37.635
<v Speaker 1>nearby.

00:14:38.835 --> 00:14:39.315
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.500
<v Speaker 1>let's see. What else? Another thing that that

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.220
<v Speaker 1>people like a lot is this feature called

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.100
<v Speaker 1>overwrites.

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:50.380
<v Speaker 1>So

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 1>by default,

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.660
<v Speaker 1>all these

00:14:54.155 --> 00:14:55.835
<v Speaker 1>all these secrets

00:14:55.835 --> 00:14:56.795
<v Speaker 1>are shared

00:14:57.035 --> 00:14:57.915
<v Speaker 1>across

00:14:58.475 --> 00:15:01.435
<v Speaker 1>users or machines that have access to a

00:15:01.435 --> 00:15:02.635
<v Speaker 1>particular environment.

00:15:03.435 --> 00:15:05.195
<v Speaker 1>But with the override feature,

00:15:05.515 --> 00:15:08.235
<v Speaker 1>for example, let's say I'm a developer and

00:15:08.235 --> 00:15:10.290
<v Speaker 1>and I'm working on a new feature. There

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:12.210
<v Speaker 1>is a certain for example, I update my

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:13.330
<v Speaker 1>SendGrid ID

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.650
<v Speaker 1>to another value. Now I can just click

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:17.570
<v Speaker 1>this button, and it's gonna override it with

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:20.130
<v Speaker 1>my personal value without affecting the workflows for

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:21.170
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the team.

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:24.524
<v Speaker 1>And so this is useful for either, you

00:15:24.524 --> 00:15:27.084
<v Speaker 1>know, like local development when you constantly have

00:15:27.084 --> 00:15:28.365
<v Speaker 1>to update these values

00:15:28.764 --> 00:15:31.165
<v Speaker 1>to try out new things, or this is

00:15:31.165 --> 00:15:33.485
<v Speaker 1>also useful for highly sensitive things like database

00:15:33.485 --> 00:15:35.485
<v Speaker 1>password and database username. They will likely be

00:15:35.485 --> 00:15:36.685
<v Speaker 1>unique for every engineer,

00:15:37.589 --> 00:15:39.190
<v Speaker 1>So then you can just override them with

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:40.390
<v Speaker 1>their personal values.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:43.589
<v Speaker 0>I guess, yeah, if you're, like, a platform

00:15:43.589 --> 00:15:45.350
<v Speaker 0>team, you could provide the key with an

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:47.110
<v Speaker 0>empty value, and then everyone has to go

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:48.630
<v Speaker 0>in and provide their override.

00:15:49.029 --> 00:15:51.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Exactly. So, like, what we see people

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:53.405
<v Speaker 1>do is either provide it with an empty

00:15:53.405 --> 00:15:55.405
<v Speaker 1>value or, for example, in this case, you

00:15:55.405 --> 00:15:57.965
<v Speaker 1>see the value is just username, and then,

00:15:57.965 --> 00:15:59.485
<v Speaker 1>you know, I have to go ahead and

00:15:59.485 --> 00:16:01.005
<v Speaker 1>change it with Vlad. There is also a

00:16:01.005 --> 00:16:02.685
<v Speaker 1>comment that says override.

00:16:03.565 --> 00:16:05.805
<v Speaker 1>So you you like, people kinda know that

00:16:05.805 --> 00:16:06.765
<v Speaker 1>they have to override it.

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:08.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Flick.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:10.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:12.260
<v Speaker 1>And

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.460
<v Speaker 1>yeah. Let's see. Everything is obviously version controlled,

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.060
<v Speaker 1>so you're able to see how the secret

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.580
<v Speaker 1>value has been changing over time.

00:16:20.394 --> 00:16:23.355
<v Speaker 1>And this also ties into the point of

00:16:23.355 --> 00:16:25.035
<v Speaker 1>time recovery functionality.

00:16:25.515 --> 00:16:27.834
<v Speaker 1>So you can every time you make a

00:16:27.834 --> 00:16:30.714
<v Speaker 1>change with your secrets in any particular environment,

00:16:30.954 --> 00:16:33.435
<v Speaker 1>you can go always go back in time

00:16:33.435 --> 00:16:35.834
<v Speaker 1>and just roll back with a single button.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.460
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, here you can, you know, inspect

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.300
<v Speaker 1>the changes. And this is very useful if

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.060
<v Speaker 1>you make an error or you just want

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:43.860
<v Speaker 1>to see

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.980
<v Speaker 1>what has happened in this particular snapshot for

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.580
<v Speaker 1>debugging purposes, for example.

00:16:50.535 --> 00:16:52.615
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Cool. I guess it also gives you

00:16:52.615 --> 00:16:54.855
<v Speaker 0>visibility into, like, if someone on the team,

00:16:54.855 --> 00:16:57.575
<v Speaker 0>their machine was compromised and someone updated

00:16:57.894 --> 00:16:58.935
<v Speaker 0>values,

00:16:59.095 --> 00:17:01.255
<v Speaker 0>then you would have full visibility into how

00:17:01.255 --> 00:17:01.894
<v Speaker 0>to handle that.

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:04.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So this one is actually even more

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:07.190
<v Speaker 1>than that. You would you should look into

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:08.069
<v Speaker 1>audit logs

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:10.230
<v Speaker 1>because Infisical automatically,

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:13.190
<v Speaker 1>you know, logs all of these different events.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:16.390
<v Speaker 1>And, you know, it you can filter it

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:18.069
<v Speaker 1>by source. You know? So, like, are you

00:17:18.135 --> 00:17:20.454
<v Speaker 1>is it happening through the SDKs or web

00:17:20.454 --> 00:17:21.575
<v Speaker 1>or CLI,

00:17:21.974 --> 00:17:22.934
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.

00:17:23.815 --> 00:17:25.655
<v Speaker 1>And here it's asked, you know, like, who

00:17:25.655 --> 00:17:27.894
<v Speaker 1>is the actor, whether it's user or machine,

00:17:28.055 --> 00:17:30.375
<v Speaker 1>which user, for example, or which machine,

00:17:30.615 --> 00:17:31.975
<v Speaker 1>what's the source.

00:17:32.215 --> 00:17:33.655
<v Speaker 1>For example, right now, we're looking at in

00:17:33.655 --> 00:17:35.549
<v Speaker 1>web, and this is my I p v

00:17:35.549 --> 00:17:36.350
<v Speaker 1>six address.

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:40.590
<v Speaker 1>And here, like, some metadata fields that are

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:42.190
<v Speaker 1>specific to every event.

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:44.510
<v Speaker 1>So, yes, here, you would be able to

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:45.950
<v Speaker 1>see, you know, like, everything

00:17:46.815 --> 00:17:48.654
<v Speaker 1>that that could be happening.

00:17:48.894 --> 00:17:50.975
<v Speaker 0>Oh, so if someone's machine was compromised, you

00:17:50.975 --> 00:17:52.815
<v Speaker 0>could literally come into here, filter by the

00:17:52.815 --> 00:17:55.294
<v Speaker 0>user, and get every read from a certain

00:17:55.294 --> 00:17:56.894
<v Speaker 0>point of time, and then you know to

00:17:56.894 --> 00:17:58.575
<v Speaker 0>have to go and re rotate all of

00:17:58.575 --> 00:17:59.294
<v Speaker 0>those credentials.

00:17:59.899 --> 00:18:03.579
<v Speaker 1>Yes. Exactly. So you're you're able to rotate

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:06.859
<v Speaker 1>either manually or we have automatic rotation.

00:18:08.139 --> 00:18:08.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:10.860
<v Speaker 0>Very cool. So you're able you're able to

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.779
<v Speaker 1>see it all here. You you're also able

00:18:12.779 --> 00:18:15.805
<v Speaker 1>to integrate it with your logging solution.

00:18:16.765 --> 00:18:18.684
<v Speaker 1>If you're using, like, a SIEM or something,

00:18:19.325 --> 00:18:20.205
<v Speaker 1>then,

00:18:20.445 --> 00:18:22.925
<v Speaker 1>yes, this would be very helpful for for

00:18:22.925 --> 00:18:24.925
<v Speaker 1>these kind of, like, compliance use cases.

00:18:25.485 --> 00:18:25.805
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Let's see. So while

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:33.090
<v Speaker 1>we're still at it, so something that I'll

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:34.610
<v Speaker 1>also say is by default,

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:37.090
<v Speaker 1>the structure of Secrets and Infisical is very

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:38.770
<v Speaker 1>flat, and this is because,

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:41.250
<v Speaker 1>you know, when we see engineers

00:18:41.524 --> 00:18:43.284
<v Speaker 1>start using Infisical,

00:18:43.365 --> 00:18:45.284
<v Speaker 1>this is kinda like what they want

00:18:46.005 --> 00:18:48.565
<v Speaker 1>because they don't need all this complexity

00:18:48.965 --> 00:18:51.605
<v Speaker 1>that traditionally been with, like, different path and

00:18:51.605 --> 00:18:53.284
<v Speaker 1>and so on in secret management.

00:18:53.445 --> 00:18:56.644
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes, you know, when teams

00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:58.470
<v Speaker 1>become larger and and their projects and and

00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:59.909
<v Speaker 1>products become larger,

00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:02.390
<v Speaker 1>then there starts to they start to have

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:04.630
<v Speaker 1>the need for for folders. And this is

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:05.990
<v Speaker 1>basically functionality

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:09.350
<v Speaker 1>of organizing secrets in the in the particular

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:10.070
<v Speaker 1>directories.

00:19:10.735 --> 00:19:12.974
<v Speaker 1>You can nest these folders infinitely.

00:19:13.455 --> 00:19:15.615
<v Speaker 1>So, really, you are able to create the

00:19:15.615 --> 00:19:16.414
<v Speaker 1>structure

00:19:17.695 --> 00:19:20.815
<v Speaker 1>that works for your use case. It's very,

00:19:20.815 --> 00:19:22.255
<v Speaker 1>very highly customizable.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.920
<v Speaker 0>Is there, from your experience, a preferred approach

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.240
<v Speaker 0>to how to use folders or go flat?

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.760
<v Speaker 0>Do you see something that works better, or

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.360
<v Speaker 0>is it purely down to the team and

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.240
<v Speaker 0>what they're doing?

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.240
<v Speaker 1>It's really down to the team.

00:19:35.875 --> 00:19:38.275
<v Speaker 1>It it also really depends. For example, some

00:19:38.275 --> 00:19:41.155
<v Speaker 1>teams are changing to Infisical from existing secret

00:19:41.155 --> 00:19:43.875
<v Speaker 1>managers, so they've already been using something before.

00:19:43.875 --> 00:19:45.635
<v Speaker 1>So then they are trying to imitate the

00:19:45.635 --> 00:19:46.274
<v Speaker 1>structure

00:19:46.914 --> 00:19:49.075
<v Speaker 1>from those secret managers into Infisical.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.940
<v Speaker 1>So yeah. And and then they're very easily

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:53.539
<v Speaker 1>able to do that with folders.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.180
<v Speaker 1>But but, really, you know, like, one thing

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:58.179
<v Speaker 1>that we see is, for example,

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.820
<v Speaker 1>split by microservices

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.140
<v Speaker 1>or kinda, like, split by functionalities,

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:03.780
<v Speaker 1>for example, like

00:20:04.655 --> 00:20:08.015
<v Speaker 1>billing or email or some people also put

00:20:08.015 --> 00:20:10.495
<v Speaker 1>kinda, like, more sensitive secrets into a specific

00:20:10.495 --> 00:20:12.735
<v Speaker 1>folder, and then they are able to access

00:20:12.735 --> 00:20:13.934
<v Speaker 1>control this folder

00:20:14.335 --> 00:20:15.455
<v Speaker 1>much easier.

00:20:16.495 --> 00:20:18.415
<v Speaker 1>For example, there could be a folder with

00:20:18.415 --> 00:20:19.375
<v Speaker 1>encryption keys

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.360
<v Speaker 1>and and kinda like very few people on

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.040
<v Speaker 1>the team would get access to that.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:26.960
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.760
<v Speaker 0>folders can also be a means of splitting

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.400
<v Speaker 0>up the the RBAC across the project.

00:20:33.035 --> 00:20:35.275
<v Speaker 0>If if it's flat, everybody has access to

00:20:35.275 --> 00:20:37.754
<v Speaker 0>to everything. But if you bring in folders,

00:20:37.835 --> 00:20:39.835
<v Speaker 0>you can change the policies across the folders,

00:20:39.835 --> 00:20:41.195
<v Speaker 0>if I understood that correctly.

00:20:41.355 --> 00:20:43.674
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yes. Yes. Definitely. And I I can

00:20:43.674 --> 00:20:45.275
<v Speaker 1>also show you how it works in in

00:20:45.275 --> 00:20:45.835
<v Speaker 1>a few minutes.

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:50.150
<v Speaker 1>But, yes, the the RBAC access controls, you're

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:51.749
<v Speaker 1>you're able to integrate them

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:53.830
<v Speaker 1>very well with folders.

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:55.350
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Nice.

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:56.389
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:57.350
<v Speaker 1>And

00:20:57.670 --> 00:20:59.990
<v Speaker 1>yeah. So, actually, access control is a huge

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:02.625
<v Speaker 1>part, obviously, of Infisical, you know, just because

00:21:02.625 --> 00:21:04.625
<v Speaker 1>of the nature of of secret management.

00:21:05.745 --> 00:21:07.985
<v Speaker 1>But before we move on to that, I

00:21:07.985 --> 00:21:10.305
<v Speaker 1>I wanna show you another feature

00:21:10.625 --> 00:21:11.825
<v Speaker 1>that people

00:21:11.825 --> 00:21:14.145
<v Speaker 1>are usually very excited about. So here, you

00:21:14.145 --> 00:21:15.265
<v Speaker 1>can see that we are in the prod

00:21:15.265 --> 00:21:15.985
<v Speaker 1>Asia environment.

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:19.410
<v Speaker 1>And here, we have this green icon

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:20.929
<v Speaker 1>that says

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:23.010
<v Speaker 1>prod US. And and what this means is

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:25.010
<v Speaker 1>actually an important icon.

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:28.210
<v Speaker 1>So what's

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:29.410
<v Speaker 1>happening is that

00:21:30.245 --> 00:21:33.684
<v Speaker 1>we actually inside our prod Asia environment, we

00:21:33.684 --> 00:21:35.845
<v Speaker 1>are inheriting the secrets from the prod US

00:21:35.845 --> 00:21:39.205
<v Speaker 1>environment. So prod US becomes our core production

00:21:39.205 --> 00:21:39.924
<v Speaker 1>environment,

00:21:40.245 --> 00:21:41.764
<v Speaker 1>and then the rest of the secrets is

00:21:41.764 --> 00:21:44.164
<v Speaker 1>actually being overridden. So they are unique for

00:21:44.164 --> 00:21:47.160
<v Speaker 1>prod Asia. Some secrets will be equivalent, like

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.720
<v Speaker 1>the same across two environments. Some secrets will

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.440
<v Speaker 1>be different,

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.440
<v Speaker 1>and and this is what you can see

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:52.999
<v Speaker 1>here.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:54.999
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. There are a lot of other use

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.865
<v Speaker 1>cases for it. Sometimes it's with some kind

00:21:59.865 --> 00:22:02.345
<v Speaker 1>of preview environments or staging environments or pre

00:22:02.345 --> 00:22:03.544
<v Speaker 1>prod environments.

00:22:04.345 --> 00:22:06.505
<v Speaker 1>Kinda like having the score environment could be

00:22:06.505 --> 00:22:08.905
<v Speaker 1>very handsy. So what takes precedence here? The

00:22:08.905 --> 00:22:10.424
<v Speaker 0>imports or the secrets

00:22:10.745 --> 00:22:11.225
<v Speaker 0>below it?

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.680
<v Speaker 1>The the secrets afterwards. Right. Right. You you

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.360
<v Speaker 1>can kinda see here, you know, if if

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.200
<v Speaker 1>it's present in the dashboard, it means that

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.799
<v Speaker 1>the secret is being overridden

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.200
<v Speaker 1>by specific Asian secrets.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.480
<v Speaker 0>Very cool. Yeah. I like that. I don't

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.804
<v Speaker 0>think I really fully comprehended how that works,

00:22:27.804 --> 00:22:29.404
<v Speaker 0>but I have used the imports. I have

00:22:29.404 --> 00:22:30.205
<v Speaker 0>microservices,

00:22:30.205 --> 00:22:31.885
<v Speaker 0>and I realized that I was copying the

00:22:31.885 --> 00:22:34.205
<v Speaker 0>same three tokens all the time in all

00:22:34.205 --> 00:22:35.245
<v Speaker 0>of them. And then I end up just

00:22:35.245 --> 00:22:36.684
<v Speaker 0>creating a folder at the top and then

00:22:36.684 --> 00:22:38.700
<v Speaker 0>import that into each microservice. And it worked

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:40.139
<v Speaker 0>really well. But yeah.

00:22:40.539 --> 00:22:42.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. The this is what people do as

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:44.860
<v Speaker 1>well. Because so for example, you know, some

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.779
<v Speaker 1>people might have a folder

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:48.619
<v Speaker 1>with, for example,

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:49.740
<v Speaker 1>email,

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.500
<v Speaker 1>like SendGrid related secrets,

00:22:51.895 --> 00:22:53.815
<v Speaker 1>And then they need to import the same

00:22:53.815 --> 00:22:55.815
<v Speaker 1>folder into all of their environments. So they

00:22:55.975 --> 00:22:58.294
<v Speaker 1>then they're able to take this folder from,

00:22:58.855 --> 00:23:01.255
<v Speaker 1>let's say, the core environment. They have it

00:23:01.255 --> 00:23:03.655
<v Speaker 1>in physical and import it everywhere everywhere else.

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:06.140
<v Speaker 1>So then, you know, if they need to

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:07.660
<v Speaker 1>update the secret, they only update it once

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.419
<v Speaker 1>and it gets propagated everywhere.

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:11.740
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Nice. I like that.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.060
<v Speaker 1>Let's see. So we can probably move on

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:17.100
<v Speaker 1>to the access controls.

00:23:17.565 --> 00:23:19.565
<v Speaker 1>So in in Infisical, how you can think

00:23:19.565 --> 00:23:21.965
<v Speaker 1>about it is we have the concept of

00:23:21.965 --> 00:23:23.004
<v Speaker 1>identities,

00:23:23.885 --> 00:23:27.004
<v Speaker 1>and these identities could either be humans or

00:23:27.085 --> 00:23:27.804
<v Speaker 1>machines.

00:23:28.845 --> 00:23:32.284
<v Speaker 1>So for for example, humans, you know, it's

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.880
<v Speaker 1>any developer, any DevOps engineer

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.000
<v Speaker 1>who has access to the Infisical dashboards

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:37.800
<v Speaker 1>or

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.160
<v Speaker 1>also, you know, API or CLI or all

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.280
<v Speaker 1>the other formats

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.520
<v Speaker 1>that we provide for accessing secrets.

00:23:46.135 --> 00:23:49.255
<v Speaker 1>But identities could also be machines. And so

00:23:49.255 --> 00:23:52.055
<v Speaker 1>machine identities are useful for, for example, managing

00:23:52.055 --> 00:23:55.095
<v Speaker 1>CICD pipelines or your production environments

00:23:55.975 --> 00:23:57.975
<v Speaker 1>or, you know, something more automated.

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:00.740
<v Speaker 1>So you you basically, how you can think

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.180
<v Speaker 1>of it is is people are kinda like

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:03.620
<v Speaker 1>more manual workflows,

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:06.580
<v Speaker 1>and machines are much more automated workflows.

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:08.820
<v Speaker 1>But the nice part about it is that

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:10.180
<v Speaker 1>they're kinda equivalent,

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:12.179
<v Speaker 1>and both of them have the role

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:13.860
<v Speaker 1>that can be assigned to it.

00:24:14.585 --> 00:24:16.905
<v Speaker 1>And then this role gives them the corresponding

00:24:16.905 --> 00:24:19.784
<v Speaker 1>set of permissions for accessing specific environments

00:24:21.305 --> 00:24:22.424
<v Speaker 1>and and so on.

00:24:22.985 --> 00:24:25.225
<v Speaker 1>Some roles are available by default,

00:24:25.705 --> 00:24:28.265
<v Speaker 1>but you're actually able to create any role,

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.280
<v Speaker 1>the any custom role that you want. And

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:34.840
<v Speaker 1>you're able to specify, for example, in the

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.400
<v Speaker 1>prod Asia environment for these specific secrets,

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:41.000
<v Speaker 1>people are only able to maybe create new

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.240
<v Speaker 1>secrets, but they can't view or modify or

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.440
<v Speaker 1>delete the existing ones.

00:24:45.475 --> 00:24:46.114
<v Speaker 1>So,

00:24:47.315 --> 00:24:49.875
<v Speaker 1>yeah, they very you know, again, very, very

00:24:49.875 --> 00:24:51.715
<v Speaker 1>highly customizable roles.

00:24:51.715 --> 00:24:52.434
<v Speaker 1>You can do

00:24:53.155 --> 00:24:55.955
<v Speaker 1>you can manage roles or project members or

00:24:55.955 --> 00:24:56.515
<v Speaker 1>environments

00:24:56.899 --> 00:24:58.979
<v Speaker 1>or service tokens with them

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:02.100
<v Speaker 1>and, yeah, make sure that people have the

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.339
<v Speaker 1>right set of permissions or machines.

00:25:05.139 --> 00:25:05.779
<v Speaker 1>Nice.

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:07.219
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:09.539
<v Speaker 1>I I I know you were also like,

00:25:09.539 --> 00:25:11.825
<v Speaker 1>you I think you had some kinda, like,

00:25:11.825 --> 00:25:15.425
<v Speaker 1>suggestions about more, like, attribute based access controls,

00:25:15.425 --> 00:25:16.865
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly.

00:25:18.065 --> 00:25:19.905
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That comes back to kind of my

00:25:19.905 --> 00:25:23.665
<v Speaker 0>mono repository use case where Yeah. You know,

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:26.550
<v Speaker 0>I I think for my situation and I

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:28.070
<v Speaker 0>don't know how niche that is versus what

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:29.830
<v Speaker 0>you see from all your actual customers and

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:30.549
<v Speaker 0>such. But,

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:33.430
<v Speaker 0>you know, I think there's rules to access

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:35.510
<v Speaker 0>secrets, which I mean, you've got rules. Right?

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:36.790
<v Speaker 0>But like say,

00:25:37.615 --> 00:25:40.174
<v Speaker 0>a DevOps person, they're always gonna need access

00:25:40.174 --> 00:25:43.855
<v Speaker 0>to secrets tagged with cloud or infra or

00:25:43.855 --> 00:25:46.335
<v Speaker 0>whatever. And I just figured that approach scales

00:25:46.335 --> 00:25:47.934
<v Speaker 0>better for a mono repository

00:25:48.015 --> 00:25:49.375
<v Speaker 0>where I can't I don't wanna have to

00:25:49.375 --> 00:25:51.215
<v Speaker 0>be configured loads of paths all the time.

00:25:52.414 --> 00:25:52.735
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:56.110
<v Speaker 1>It it could work. So we you know,

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:58.109
<v Speaker 1>we've been thinking about it a lot,

00:25:58.509 --> 00:26:00.269
<v Speaker 1>and and we are actually right now soon

00:26:00.429 --> 00:26:02.349
<v Speaker 1>we will be releasing the revamp

00:26:02.429 --> 00:26:03.870
<v Speaker 1>to access controls.

00:26:05.404 --> 00:26:07.804
<v Speaker 1>And so and and, you know, it's access

00:26:07.804 --> 00:26:09.804
<v Speaker 1>controls as well as all the other adjacent

00:26:09.804 --> 00:26:10.924
<v Speaker 1>features to it.

00:26:12.845 --> 00:26:15.005
<v Speaker 1>And maybe I can talk about two of

00:26:15.005 --> 00:26:16.764
<v Speaker 1>them in a bit.

00:26:17.245 --> 00:26:19.620
<v Speaker 1>But, yes, I I think there is definitely

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:21.860
<v Speaker 1>a lot of room for this kinda, like,

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:23.700
<v Speaker 1>tag based or attribute based

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.299
<v Speaker 1>access controls. There is also a lot of

00:26:27.299 --> 00:26:29.299
<v Speaker 1>rules that you can

00:26:30.375 --> 00:26:32.695
<v Speaker 1>add on top of that. For example, you

00:26:32.695 --> 00:26:35.895
<v Speaker 1>know, if a user is accessing secrets

00:26:36.215 --> 00:26:38.695
<v Speaker 1>from a particular IP address, then they get

00:26:38.695 --> 00:26:40.135
<v Speaker 1>a role x.

00:26:40.135 --> 00:26:41.735
<v Speaker 1>But if they're accessing it from a different

00:26:41.735 --> 00:26:43.655
<v Speaker 1>IP address or from a different network, then

00:26:43.655 --> 00:26:44.535
<v Speaker 1>they get a role y.

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:47.860
<v Speaker 1>So these kind of, like,

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:51.300
<v Speaker 1>changing roles is also a very, very interesting

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:52.020
<v Speaker 1>concept.

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:56.740
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I guess you you've you've got people

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.500
<v Speaker 0>using this d n d. I'm sure you

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.955
<v Speaker 0>use it yourselves, d n d. Like, it's

00:27:00.955 --> 00:27:02.715
<v Speaker 0>it's like that video. I don't know if

00:27:02.715 --> 00:27:03.995
<v Speaker 0>you ever seen it. It went viral on

00:27:03.995 --> 00:27:06.155
<v Speaker 0>Twitter maybe last year. And it's like the

00:27:06.395 --> 00:27:08.875
<v Speaker 0>the designer watching someone play with their product

00:27:08.875 --> 00:27:10.635
<v Speaker 0>and it's like the box with the star

00:27:10.635 --> 00:27:12.155
<v Speaker 0>hole and the circle hole and the square

00:27:12.155 --> 00:27:13.675
<v Speaker 0>hole and they put all the shapes in

00:27:13.675 --> 00:27:15.915
<v Speaker 0>the one hole and they're like Yeah. With

00:27:15.915 --> 00:27:16.960
<v Speaker 0>that. It's like,

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.559
<v Speaker 0>you know, when you have an open source

00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:20.320
<v Speaker 0>project, the people are always gonna think we

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.479
<v Speaker 0>are the wonderful ways to use it. So

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.200
<v Speaker 0>it's just nice and refreshing when

00:27:25.519 --> 00:27:28.480
<v Speaker 0>people take on board ideas and and talk

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.559
<v Speaker 0>about them. So, yeah, I'm excited to see

00:27:30.559 --> 00:27:31.279
<v Speaker 0>what he's come up with.

00:27:32.315 --> 00:27:34.555
<v Speaker 1>No. It it it it's gonna be very

00:27:34.555 --> 00:27:36.315
<v Speaker 1>cool. So so one thing that we also

00:27:36.315 --> 00:27:39.515
<v Speaker 1>already have is something called secret approvals. I

00:27:39.515 --> 00:27:40.875
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you

00:27:41.755 --> 00:27:43.595
<v Speaker 1>if you had a look into that before.

00:27:43.595 --> 00:27:45.035
<v Speaker 1>But, basically, how it works is

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:47.140
<v Speaker 1>so you see, we are right now in

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:48.900
<v Speaker 1>the Prod US environment. And in the Prod

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:51.300
<v Speaker 1>US environment, there is this lock icon, and

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.299
<v Speaker 1>it says that it's protected by policy,

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:54.420
<v Speaker 1>prod US.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:56.900
<v Speaker 1>So now if, you know, as an engineer,

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.380
<v Speaker 1>if I want to update secrets in this

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:00.180
<v Speaker 1>particular environment,

00:28:00.925 --> 00:28:01.965
<v Speaker 1>it actually

00:28:02.525 --> 00:28:05.325
<v Speaker 1>one process might change. Instead, it will work

00:28:05.325 --> 00:28:07.725
<v Speaker 1>similar to how you commit or raise a

00:28:07.725 --> 00:28:08.924
<v Speaker 1>PR in Git.

00:28:09.165 --> 00:28:11.005
<v Speaker 1>You know? So before merging your code to

00:28:11.005 --> 00:28:13.245
<v Speaker 1>main, it has to be approved by one

00:28:13.245 --> 00:28:15.245
<v Speaker 1>or multiple other people on your team.

00:28:16.039 --> 00:28:18.039
<v Speaker 1>And we have the similar concept with secrets.

00:28:18.039 --> 00:28:20.440
<v Speaker 1>You know? Before you merge your changes into

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.919
<v Speaker 1>the production environments, it has to be approved

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.159
<v Speaker 1>by one of the admins on the team

00:28:25.159 --> 00:28:27.559
<v Speaker 1>that you prespecify or maybe multiple admins.

00:28:28.745 --> 00:28:31.065
<v Speaker 1>And here, you see you someone submit a

00:28:31.065 --> 00:28:33.144
<v Speaker 1>request, then I'm able to approve or reject

00:28:33.144 --> 00:28:33.704
<v Speaker 1>it

00:28:34.345 --> 00:28:37.144
<v Speaker 1>depending on, you know, if if it makes

00:28:37.144 --> 00:28:39.384
<v Speaker 1>sense or not. And

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.799
<v Speaker 1>you these policies, you know, they can be

00:28:41.799 --> 00:28:42.519
<v Speaker 1>specified

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.640
<v Speaker 1>very freely. You can specify who is able

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.679
<v Speaker 1>to make changes for or approve changes for

00:28:48.679 --> 00:28:50.840
<v Speaker 1>every particular environment and how many approvals you

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:51.399
<v Speaker 1>need

00:28:52.039 --> 00:28:53.640
<v Speaker 1>and so on. And and, actually, how this

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.919
<v Speaker 1>feature started is

00:28:56.135 --> 00:28:57.254
<v Speaker 1>one of our

00:28:58.615 --> 00:28:59.494
<v Speaker 1>customers,

00:28:59.495 --> 00:29:01.654
<v Speaker 1>she used to be a

00:29:02.215 --> 00:29:04.615
<v Speaker 1>head of infrastructure in in a very large

00:29:04.615 --> 00:29:06.934
<v Speaker 1>company, and they had this

00:29:07.895 --> 00:29:10.695
<v Speaker 1>error twice where they updated secrets

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:12.429
<v Speaker 1>and

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:15.549
<v Speaker 1>like, a one of the production environments.

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:19.149
<v Speaker 1>And they they made a mistake accidentally because

00:29:19.149 --> 00:29:20.990
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't a second person to kinda, like,

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:23.230
<v Speaker 1>look over the change, and then the production

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:25.184
<v Speaker 1>went down twice. So first of all, like,

00:29:25.184 --> 00:29:28.304
<v Speaker 1>this approval functionality is good for compliance and

00:29:28.304 --> 00:29:30.465
<v Speaker 1>making sure that nothing goes into production

00:29:31.184 --> 00:29:32.465
<v Speaker 1>that's unwanted,

00:29:32.465 --> 00:29:34.145
<v Speaker 1>but, also, it just gives you another set

00:29:34.145 --> 00:29:34.945
<v Speaker 1>of eyes

00:29:35.184 --> 00:29:37.025
<v Speaker 1>to make sure that everything is stable.

00:29:38.059 --> 00:29:40.140
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I like that that pull request format

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.460
<v Speaker 0>for making changes. That's very cool. I I

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:43.420
<v Speaker 0>I'd

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:44.860
<v Speaker 0>seen the thing in the menu bar. I'd

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:46.059
<v Speaker 0>never clicked on it because I'm a team

00:29:46.059 --> 00:29:47.500
<v Speaker 0>of one. So I just I was like,

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:49.179
<v Speaker 0>I don't know what that is. And but,

00:29:49.179 --> 00:29:50.460
<v Speaker 0>yeah, I can see how that's really gonna

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:52.774
<v Speaker 0>be beneficial for larger teams that are that

00:29:52.774 --> 00:29:54.615
<v Speaker 0>are working. Yeah. And and and you know

00:29:54.615 --> 00:29:56.534
<v Speaker 1>what? Actually, I feel like we hear this

00:29:56.534 --> 00:29:57.174
<v Speaker 1>a lot,

00:29:57.815 --> 00:29:59.735
<v Speaker 1>and I think we're gonna be unifying this

00:29:59.735 --> 00:30:02.294
<v Speaker 1>in the larger, you know, access control tab,

00:30:02.455 --> 00:30:04.455
<v Speaker 1>which is gonna be, like, universal, all the

00:30:04.455 --> 00:30:06.294
<v Speaker 1>things around access controls

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:08.209
<v Speaker 1>and in physical

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:11.090
<v Speaker 1>that that that you might need. And there

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:13.250
<v Speaker 1>is another thing, another feature that will be

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:14.609
<v Speaker 1>coming out very soon

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:15.649
<v Speaker 1>here,

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:18.690
<v Speaker 1>and it will probably be called temporary access.

00:30:19.294 --> 00:30:21.934
<v Speaker 1>And how it works is, you know, sometimes

00:30:21.934 --> 00:30:25.695
<v Speaker 1>imagine you have your deployments on Tuesday,

00:30:25.934 --> 00:30:27.934
<v Speaker 1>and there is a team of engineers who

00:30:27.934 --> 00:30:29.455
<v Speaker 1>needs to have access

00:30:29.695 --> 00:30:33.215
<v Speaker 1>to the preprode environments for these specific hours

00:30:33.455 --> 00:30:34.575
<v Speaker 1>on this specific day.

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:37.340
<v Speaker 1>So what you're able to do within Infisical

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:38.139
<v Speaker 1>is

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:40.860
<v Speaker 1>you're able to set up a schedule or

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:42.620
<v Speaker 1>as an admin, you can just kinda, like,

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:44.220
<v Speaker 1>issue this temporary access.

00:30:45.179 --> 00:30:47.580
<v Speaker 1>And then on this specific time for a

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:49.420
<v Speaker 1>specific number of period of time,

00:30:50.095 --> 00:30:52.575
<v Speaker 1>the these specific engineers will get access to

00:30:52.575 --> 00:30:53.454
<v Speaker 1>this environment.

00:30:53.774 --> 00:30:55.695
<v Speaker 1>And after the access expires,

00:30:55.695 --> 00:30:58.014
<v Speaker 1>you can specify for secrets to be automatically

00:30:58.014 --> 00:30:58.974
<v Speaker 1>rotated.

00:30:59.375 --> 00:31:00.174
<v Speaker 1>So

00:31:01.375 --> 00:31:02.095
<v Speaker 0>That's cool.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:06.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So this kinda, like, temporary access is

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.320
<v Speaker 1>is something that we see a lot of

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.919
<v Speaker 1>teams want,

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.960
<v Speaker 1>you know, from the smallest teams

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.600
<v Speaker 1>kinda like startups to very large

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.440
<v Speaker 1>corporations as well.

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.040
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.

00:31:18.775 --> 00:31:20.934
<v Speaker 0>I can imagine a scenario where

00:31:21.335 --> 00:31:23.735
<v Speaker 0>there's some sort of incident and data you

00:31:23.735 --> 00:31:26.535
<v Speaker 0>know, developers who don't normally access production database,

00:31:26.535 --> 00:31:28.295
<v Speaker 0>whether it might be PII or whatever, can

00:31:28.295 --> 00:31:30.375
<v Speaker 0>elevate their permissions. And then as soon as

00:31:30.375 --> 00:31:32.295
<v Speaker 0>they're finished with that incident, it all gets

00:31:32.295 --> 00:31:33.815
<v Speaker 0>rotated to behind the scenes, and then they

00:31:33.815 --> 00:31:34.830
<v Speaker 0>lose their access.

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:36.190
<v Speaker 0>That's Yeah. Powerful.

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:36.990
<v Speaker 0>Powerful.

00:31:37.309 --> 00:31:39.309
<v Speaker 1>Be because there are those kinda, like, high

00:31:39.309 --> 00:31:40.509
<v Speaker 1>stakes situation

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:43.150
<v Speaker 1>where, you know, if if developers don't have

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:44.830
<v Speaker 1>access to that, then they kinda, like, can't

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:45.309
<v Speaker 1>do much.

00:31:47.185 --> 00:31:48.705
<v Speaker 0>But Although, they'll ways around

00:31:48.945 --> 00:31:50.625
<v Speaker 0>it, and then they'll break the entire process.

00:31:50.625 --> 00:31:51.905
<v Speaker 0>Right? You have to find a way that

00:31:51.905 --> 00:31:54.465
<v Speaker 0>is allows people to do their job, but

00:31:54.465 --> 00:31:56.625
<v Speaker 0>in a way that does keep security first

00:31:56.625 --> 00:31:57.184
<v Speaker 0>and,

00:31:57.585 --> 00:32:00.010
<v Speaker 0>you know, front and center. Right? And and

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:01.529
<v Speaker 0>I think that's really important.

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:03.850
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Exactly. And

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:05.370
<v Speaker 1>and and this is one of those features

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:07.370
<v Speaker 1>around security shift left

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:10.170
<v Speaker 1>that I've been talking about because traditionally, what's

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:12.970
<v Speaker 1>happening is that, you know, in traditional secret

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:13.450
<v Speaker 1>managers,

00:32:13.945 --> 00:32:17.145
<v Speaker 1>if if something like this happens, then the

00:32:17.785 --> 00:32:20.265
<v Speaker 1>the engineer on the or, like, the team

00:32:20.265 --> 00:32:22.184
<v Speaker 1>that's responsible for secret management,

00:32:22.425 --> 00:32:24.265
<v Speaker 1>they somehow try to find a way to

00:32:24.265 --> 00:32:27.465
<v Speaker 1>give particular secrets access to these specific engineers.

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:30.450
<v Speaker 1>But then what's happening is that they somehow

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:32.610
<v Speaker 1>get a hold of those secrets, then they

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:35.810
<v Speaker 1>store them potentially in unwanted places like Slack

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:38.210
<v Speaker 1>or or Notes or whatever it is.

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:41.785
<v Speaker 1>And, you know, it it's much more better

00:32:41.945 --> 00:32:44.105
<v Speaker 1>it's much, much better to store everything in

00:32:44.105 --> 00:32:46.985
<v Speaker 1>Infisical and rotate them at the right schedule.

00:32:48.105 --> 00:32:48.665
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:32:49.465 --> 00:32:51.145
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Very cool feature.

00:32:51.865 --> 00:32:54.025
<v Speaker 0>So I guess Yeah. You've mentioned that there's

00:32:54.025 --> 00:32:55.710
<v Speaker 0>there's a few things that's coming up and

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:56.830
<v Speaker 0>you're working on that are going to be

00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:58.350
<v Speaker 0>deployed soon.

00:32:59.789 --> 00:33:01.950
<v Speaker 0>Maybe you could, like what what does soon

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:04.190
<v Speaker 0>mean for Infisical? Do you just release every

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:06.110
<v Speaker 0>month? Do you release every quarter? Is it

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:07.149
<v Speaker 0>every day? Like

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:10.110
<v Speaker 1>So yeah. Right. Let maybe I can stop

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:10.350
<v Speaker 1>sharing.

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.840
<v Speaker 1>It's alright. Everybody's

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.600
<v Speaker 0>done that before. It's one of the most

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.600
<v Speaker 0>frustrating things about where that button is. So

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:34.120
<v Speaker 0>don't worry about it whatsoever.

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:35.640
<v Speaker 1>I accidentally

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.505
<v Speaker 1>decided to hang up. I'm done with this

00:33:38.505 --> 00:33:40.345
<v Speaker 0>guy. I'm away. Yeah.

00:33:42.185 --> 00:33:44.265
<v Speaker 1>At least the reconnect button was right there,

00:33:44.265 --> 00:33:46.825
<v Speaker 1>so I was able to reconnect immediately

00:33:48.265 --> 00:33:49.865
<v Speaker 1>when I realized what happened.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.800
<v Speaker 1>But yeah. So so, actually, that's a that's

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.200
<v Speaker 1>a really interesting question because previously, we used

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.440
<v Speaker 1>to be on on a rolling release schedule.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.320
<v Speaker 1>So we were, you know, basically releasing features,

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.200
<v Speaker 1>you know, after testing them out thoroughly

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:04.400
<v Speaker 1>as we go.

00:34:05.155 --> 00:34:09.074
<v Speaker 1>Right now, we are actually moving more towards

00:34:09.074 --> 00:34:11.235
<v Speaker 1>kinda like a scheduled release schedule.

00:34:11.395 --> 00:34:13.315
<v Speaker 1>Think it's going to be around monthly.

00:34:13.554 --> 00:34:15.475
<v Speaker 1>Mhmm. And we're gonna have kinda like a

00:34:15.475 --> 00:34:17.155
<v Speaker 1>particular day every month

00:34:17.475 --> 00:34:19.635
<v Speaker 1>that we are releasing features.

00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:21.710
<v Speaker 1>And,

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:23.630
<v Speaker 1>yeah, that that that's how it works. So

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:24.989
<v Speaker 1>for example, with

00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:28.030
<v Speaker 1>with the feature around temporary access, I think

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:29.710
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna be releasing it for around two

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:30.270
<v Speaker 1>weeks or so.

00:34:32.445 --> 00:34:33.085
<v Speaker 1>And

00:34:33.805 --> 00:34:35.805
<v Speaker 1>yeah. So you you the you know, our

00:34:35.805 --> 00:34:38.045
<v Speaker 1>team is actually moving very, very quickly.

00:34:38.364 --> 00:34:39.725
<v Speaker 1>If you I don't know if you are

00:34:39.725 --> 00:34:41.805
<v Speaker 1>keeping up with our development on GitHub and

00:34:41.805 --> 00:34:43.245
<v Speaker 1>and so on, but you can see, you

00:34:43.245 --> 00:34:45.325
<v Speaker 1>know, like, how many commits and PRs we're

00:34:45.325 --> 00:34:45.725
<v Speaker 1>merging.

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:47.620
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:48.420
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:51.540
<v Speaker 0>Is there are you talking about the demo?

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:52.659
<v Speaker 0>Do you want me to throw more questions

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:53.699
<v Speaker 0>there, or do wanna show a few more

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:54.500
<v Speaker 0>things? Yeah.

00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:56.260
<v Speaker 1>I I mean,

00:34:56.739 --> 00:34:57.780
<v Speaker 1>let's

00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:59.620
<v Speaker 1>continue with the demo then.

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Let me

00:35:06.345 --> 00:35:06.985
<v Speaker 1>yeah.

00:35:07.305 --> 00:35:08.905
<v Speaker 1>Can you see it again? Yeah. It's back

00:35:08.905 --> 00:35:13.065
<v Speaker 0>up. Yeah. Perfect. So, obviously, the most important

00:35:13.065 --> 00:35:14.744
<v Speaker 1>part

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:16.390
<v Speaker 1>about Infisical is is, you know, how you

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:18.310
<v Speaker 1>actually access these secrets

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:19.510
<v Speaker 1>across your

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:21.110
<v Speaker 1>applications.

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.630
<v Speaker 1>So

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:25.110
<v Speaker 1>and within Infisical, we provide a lot of

00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:27.190
<v Speaker 1>different ways. So first of all, we have

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:28.310
<v Speaker 1>the integrations,

00:35:28.595 --> 00:35:30.674
<v Speaker 1>you know, with all the different clouds and

00:35:30.674 --> 00:35:32.035
<v Speaker 1>and developer tools,

00:35:33.075 --> 00:35:34.755
<v Speaker 1>or let's say not all of them, but

00:35:34.755 --> 00:35:36.434
<v Speaker 1>but a large part of them and and

00:35:36.434 --> 00:35:38.275
<v Speaker 1>certainly some of the most

00:35:38.515 --> 00:35:39.394
<v Speaker 1>popular ones.

00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:43.330
<v Speaker 1>And so an example for that could be

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Vercel

00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:48.210
<v Speaker 1>or, you know, Heroku or actions or CircleCI

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:49.890
<v Speaker 1>or,

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:52.130
<v Speaker 1>you know, any anything else that you see

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:54.130
<v Speaker 1>on this dashboard, and, potentially, there is more

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:54.930
<v Speaker 1>in the documentation.

00:35:56.015 --> 00:35:58.415
<v Speaker 1>But how it works is is, for example,

00:35:58.415 --> 00:36:00.895
<v Speaker 1>let's take GitHub or Vercel as an example.

00:36:02.575 --> 00:36:06.255
<v Speaker 1>You can integrate Infisical with your Infisical projects,

00:36:06.255 --> 00:36:07.935
<v Speaker 1>and every time you update a secret in

00:36:07.935 --> 00:36:10.095
<v Speaker 1>Infisical, it will actually be propagated

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:11.520
<v Speaker 1>to

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.800
<v Speaker 1>these projects. So what happens is that you're

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.880
<v Speaker 1>able to create a central source of truth

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.240
<v Speaker 1>for

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:19.600
<v Speaker 1>your secrets

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.520
<v Speaker 1>and make sure that there's no discrepancies,

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.444
<v Speaker 1>like, for for your secrets across all the

00:36:26.444 --> 00:36:28.684
<v Speaker 1>different platforms, whether it's GitHub or Vercel or

00:36:28.684 --> 00:36:30.924
<v Speaker 1>Subabase or, you know, any other platforms that

00:36:30.924 --> 00:36:31.885
<v Speaker 1>you might be using.

00:36:32.444 --> 00:36:33.005
<v Speaker 1>And,

00:36:33.565 --> 00:36:34.765
<v Speaker 1>yeah, and and and what we see a

00:36:34.765 --> 00:36:36.525
<v Speaker 1>lot is we see, for example, a lot

00:36:36.525 --> 00:36:38.980
<v Speaker 1>of teams with, you know, like, example, hundred

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:40.740
<v Speaker 1>different Heroku applications,

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.140
<v Speaker 1>and then they are able to centralize everything

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:44.260
<v Speaker 1>in Infisical

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:46.660
<v Speaker 1>and, you know, in a in a very

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:49.300
<v Speaker 1>nice looking dashboards with all the different environments

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:51.300
<v Speaker 1>compared to each other.

00:36:53.105 --> 00:36:55.664
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Have you tried creating an integration yet?

00:36:55.664 --> 00:36:56.705
<v Speaker 1>I'm not I'm not sure.

00:36:57.105 --> 00:36:58.785
<v Speaker 0>I have. It's one of the main selling

00:36:58.785 --> 00:37:01.265
<v Speaker 0>points for me of centralizing my secrets. You

00:37:01.265 --> 00:37:02.385
<v Speaker 0>know, the fact that I could put everything

00:37:02.385 --> 00:37:03.984
<v Speaker 0>into this product, and then I don't have

00:37:03.984 --> 00:37:05.585
<v Speaker 0>to worry about copy and paste and and

00:37:05.585 --> 00:37:07.424
<v Speaker 0>to get up actions or claim their workers

00:37:07.424 --> 00:37:09.610
<v Speaker 0>and so forth. Just being able to pick

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:11.290
<v Speaker 0>that up and then it automatically does the

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:11.770
<v Speaker 0>same.

00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:13.930
<v Speaker 0>It it it's such a nice feature, and

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:16.650
<v Speaker 0>it encourages me to have better security posture.

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:18.010
<v Speaker 0>I'm not going for the back door of

00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:19.690
<v Speaker 0>saying, well, I'm just gonna store this password

00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:21.130
<v Speaker 0>on my desktop because I need to for

00:37:21.130 --> 00:37:22.685
<v Speaker 0>the next day, I'm deploying in two weeks

00:37:22.685 --> 00:37:24.605
<v Speaker 0>or whatever. Like, I I just have confidence

00:37:24.605 --> 00:37:26.605
<v Speaker 0>now that if I put them here, they're

00:37:26.605 --> 00:37:27.885
<v Speaker 0>in the right place and they get to

00:37:27.885 --> 00:37:29.565
<v Speaker 0>the right place. And that's very cool.

00:37:30.125 --> 00:37:32.605
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. No. Exactly. And and this becomes very

00:37:32.605 --> 00:37:35.005
<v Speaker 1>handy kinda like the more services you're using

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:38.540
<v Speaker 1>and the more applications you have, the more

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:40.140
<v Speaker 1>of a problem it becomes.

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:42.700
<v Speaker 1>And especially,

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:44.220
<v Speaker 1>you know, like, if you start having a

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:45.100
<v Speaker 1>larger team,

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.020
<v Speaker 1>then Infisical's

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:49.340
<v Speaker 1>integrations become very handy because you have a

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:52.380
<v Speaker 1>single source of truth and and

00:37:51.425 --> 00:37:53.025
<v Speaker 1>everything stays secure.

00:37:53.425 --> 00:37:55.985
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I've also found that in some cases,

00:37:56.145 --> 00:37:58.145
<v Speaker 0>well, the other way, like, instead of trying

00:37:58.145 --> 00:37:59.665
<v Speaker 0>to sync things somewhere,

00:37:59.984 --> 00:38:03.345
<v Speaker 0>like, the the JavaScript SDK is also so

00:38:03.345 --> 00:38:05.750
<v Speaker 0>good that I'm finding in my applications. I'm

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:07.830
<v Speaker 0>actually just trying to fetch the secrets

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:09.670
<v Speaker 0>where they're needed well.

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:11.430
<v Speaker 0>And then all it means I only have

00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:13.110
<v Speaker 0>to sync one thing to these different services

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:14.630
<v Speaker 0>and then the apps can fetch whatever they

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:17.350
<v Speaker 0>need beyond that. It does expose a little

00:38:17.350 --> 00:38:19.815
<v Speaker 0>bit of risk because my tokens probably have

00:38:19.815 --> 00:38:21.415
<v Speaker 0>access to too much for the application that

00:38:21.415 --> 00:38:22.055
<v Speaker 0>they need.

00:38:22.535 --> 00:38:24.135
<v Speaker 0>But, you know, based on the access control

00:38:24.135 --> 00:38:25.575
<v Speaker 0>stuff that you're talking about and things that

00:38:25.575 --> 00:38:27.735
<v Speaker 0>are going to come, that will get tidied

00:38:27.735 --> 00:38:28.775
<v Speaker 0>up into a course. So

00:38:29.735 --> 00:38:31.415
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And and you can also, for example,

00:38:31.415 --> 00:38:33.975
<v Speaker 1>restrict the IP addresses

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:34.260
<v Speaker 1>and

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:37.060
<v Speaker 1>do a lot of different things around

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:40.820
<v Speaker 1>security in this sense. Yeah. I like the

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:41.700
<v Speaker 0>flexibility,

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:43.780
<v Speaker 0>and it just you know, you can tackle

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:45.460
<v Speaker 0>each of these problems in many different ways

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.620
<v Speaker 0>within Infisical. It's again, it comes down to

00:38:47.715 --> 00:38:49.395
<v Speaker 0>what works best for the team, what they're

00:38:49.395 --> 00:38:51.075
<v Speaker 0>trying to do, and that's the approach they

00:38:51.075 --> 00:38:51.955
<v Speaker 0>should be taking.

00:38:53.155 --> 00:38:54.115
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

00:38:56.675 --> 00:38:59.155
<v Speaker 1>And so so these are kinda like, you

00:38:59.155 --> 00:39:02.115
<v Speaker 1>know, the integrations on the cloud and all

00:39:02.115 --> 00:39:03.315
<v Speaker 1>the different platform

00:39:03.819 --> 00:39:05.020
<v Speaker 1>type of things.

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:08.140
<v Speaker 1>Something that's also

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:11.020
<v Speaker 1>very helpful, and and, you know, it it's

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:14.220
<v Speaker 1>admittedly helpful for a different set of developers,

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:18.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's a lot of different infrastructure integrations.

00:39:18.645 --> 00:39:21.685
<v Speaker 1>So starting from managing your secrets in Docker

00:39:21.845 --> 00:39:25.205
<v Speaker 1>to Kubernetes to Terraform to Ansible

00:39:25.765 --> 00:39:28.645
<v Speaker 1>or, you know, Jenkins pipelines,

00:39:29.125 --> 00:39:30.885
<v Speaker 1>it it could really be anything, and it

00:39:30.885 --> 00:39:33.205
<v Speaker 1>depends on how the the team.

00:39:34.029 --> 00:39:35.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh, sorry. I just realized that you're probably

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:38.030
<v Speaker 1>not able to see my screen No. Anymore.

00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:40.910
<v Speaker 1>Right. But I switched to a different tab.

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:42.430
<v Speaker 1>Hold on. Let me maybe

00:39:44.589 --> 00:39:47.309
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna hang up again. I'm just

00:39:47.309 --> 00:39:49.825
<v Speaker 1>gonna stop sharing and change

00:39:49.825 --> 00:39:51.185
<v Speaker 1>the tab.

00:39:52.865 --> 00:39:54.545
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Can you see it now?

00:39:56.385 --> 00:39:58.145
<v Speaker 0>Yes. We see the Terraform.

00:39:58.385 --> 00:40:00.785
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Perfect. Yeah. No. What I

00:40:00.785 --> 00:40:02.545
<v Speaker 1>what I was just gonna tell you, it's,

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:05.190
<v Speaker 1>for example, with Terraform, you're able to provision

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:07.910
<v Speaker 1>different secrets and other resources. And in physical,

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:09.910
<v Speaker 1>you can, for example, create a physical project

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:12.310
<v Speaker 1>and so on. So all of these automations

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:13.270
<v Speaker 1>are possible.

00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:16.390
<v Speaker 1>We have multiple ways to integrate with Kubernetes.

00:40:17.205 --> 00:40:19.125
<v Speaker 1>But, ultimately, what they allow you to do

00:40:19.125 --> 00:40:21.445
<v Speaker 1>is they allow you to kinda, like, stay

00:40:21.445 --> 00:40:23.605
<v Speaker 1>up to date with all the latest secret

00:40:23.605 --> 00:40:24.245
<v Speaker 1>versions.

00:40:24.405 --> 00:40:26.165
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as you update a secret

00:40:26.565 --> 00:40:29.060
<v Speaker 1>and you're in physical instance, it will actually

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:32.020
<v Speaker 1>be automatically propagated to your applications, and your

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:33.700
<v Speaker 1>applications will be redeployed.

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:35.940
<v Speaker 1>So you don't need to think about the

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:39.300
<v Speaker 1>deployment aspect yourself, and and this is

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:41.540
<v Speaker 1>probably, like, one of for teams that are

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:43.460
<v Speaker 1>using Kubernetes, I think this is one of

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:43.940
<v Speaker 1>the most

00:40:44.625 --> 00:40:45.985
<v Speaker 1>loved features

00:40:46.145 --> 00:40:47.345
<v Speaker 1>often physical.

00:40:47.665 --> 00:40:49.025
<v Speaker 0>Yes. Now one of the first things I

00:40:49.025 --> 00:40:51.345
<v Speaker 0>install into my Kubernetes clusters is the is

00:40:51.345 --> 00:40:52.305
<v Speaker 0>the operator. So

00:40:52.945 --> 00:40:54.625
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And,

00:40:55.905 --> 00:40:59.500
<v Speaker 1>yeah, and and another kinda, like, tangential

00:40:59.579 --> 00:41:02.460
<v Speaker 1>thing feature is Infisical Agent.

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:07.020
<v Speaker 1>And, basically, it works similar to a sidecar,

00:41:07.339 --> 00:41:09.500
<v Speaker 1>which is render which is able to render

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:10.220
<v Speaker 1>your secrets

00:41:10.795 --> 00:41:13.595
<v Speaker 1>according to a specific template. So you you,

00:41:13.595 --> 00:41:15.355
<v Speaker 1>you know, you specify a template here,

00:41:15.595 --> 00:41:17.675
<v Speaker 1>and whatever your application is,

00:41:18.315 --> 00:41:19.675
<v Speaker 1>it's able to

00:41:19.835 --> 00:41:21.755
<v Speaker 1>to get those secrets.

00:41:22.395 --> 00:41:23.915
<v Speaker 1>And you don't need to change any code

00:41:23.915 --> 00:41:26.420
<v Speaker 1>logic internally in your application.

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:28.500
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I hadn't seen that before, but that's

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:29.220
<v Speaker 0>pretty cool.

00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:32.099
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I guess because it's fairly new. It's

00:41:32.099 --> 00:41:34.340
<v Speaker 1>probably, like, a couple months old.

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:38.635
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. But but I guess what I'm trying

00:41:38.635 --> 00:41:40.714
<v Speaker 1>to say is that within Infisical and and

00:41:40.714 --> 00:41:44.155
<v Speaker 1>ultimately for any secret management solution you're using,

00:41:44.555 --> 00:41:47.275
<v Speaker 1>it will only be useful if it's able

00:41:47.275 --> 00:41:48.395
<v Speaker 1>to integrate

00:41:48.395 --> 00:41:48.795
<v Speaker 1>with,

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:51.420
<v Speaker 1>you know, like, ideally,

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:53.820
<v Speaker 1>all of your all of the tools, infrastructure,

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:55.500
<v Speaker 1>developer tools that you're using.

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:57.740
<v Speaker 1>But, you know, but at least, like, a

00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:59.580
<v Speaker 1>very, very large majority of those.

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:03.235
<v Speaker 1>And which is why we take these integrations

00:42:03.235 --> 00:42:07.075
<v Speaker 1>very seriously. And whatever the engineering teams out

00:42:07.075 --> 00:42:08.915
<v Speaker 1>there could be using, you know, whether it's

00:42:08.915 --> 00:42:12.275
<v Speaker 1>Ansible or or diff all the different other

00:42:12.275 --> 00:42:13.075
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure

00:42:13.075 --> 00:42:15.555
<v Speaker 1>tools, TeamCity, GitHub Actions, GitLab,

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:18.890
<v Speaker 1>you know, and and Jenkins is a very,

00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:20.330
<v Speaker 1>very popular one as well,

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:23.770
<v Speaker 1>then they should be able to do that

00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:24.890
<v Speaker 1>within Infisical.

00:42:25.289 --> 00:42:27.210
<v Speaker 1>And they they should be able to simplify

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:29.930
<v Speaker 1>secret management there. And while simplifying,

00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:31.369
<v Speaker 1>they will also make it more secure

00:42:31.775 --> 00:42:33.935
<v Speaker 1>because their developers will now be,

00:42:35.375 --> 00:42:38.495
<v Speaker 1>you know, more much more likely to use

00:42:38.495 --> 00:42:41.055
<v Speaker 1>a simple solution for secret management in this

00:42:41.055 --> 00:42:42.335
<v Speaker 1>particular environment.

00:42:42.655 --> 00:42:43.375
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Definitely.

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:47.270
<v Speaker 1>And,

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:49.030
<v Speaker 1>yeah, I mean, there is quite a lot

00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:49.670
<v Speaker 1>of things

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:51.910
<v Speaker 1>that are other to Infisical.

00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:54.630
<v Speaker 1>So one of the maybe I can stop

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:56.790
<v Speaker 1>sharing at this point. You know, one one

00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:57.990
<v Speaker 1>of the things that I

00:42:58.415 --> 00:43:00.495
<v Speaker 1>how we view Infisical

00:43:01.135 --> 00:43:04.895
<v Speaker 1>is it's a single platform for managing secrets.

00:43:05.615 --> 00:43:08.095
<v Speaker 1>And what this could mean is

00:43:08.895 --> 00:43:09.695
<v Speaker 1>also

00:43:10.494 --> 00:43:12.015
<v Speaker 1>secret scanning functionalities.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.120
<v Speaker 1>So if if you are or are not

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.640
<v Speaker 1>familiar with secret scanning,

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.240
<v Speaker 1>it's, you know,

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:21.000
<v Speaker 1>a set of tools that prevents your secrets

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.440
<v Speaker 1>from being leaked.

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:24.760
<v Speaker 1>And one of the very common examples for

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:26.840
<v Speaker 1>that is hard coding secrets into Git.

00:43:27.705 --> 00:43:29.865
<v Speaker 1>So what we do within Infisical is using

00:43:29.865 --> 00:43:31.065
<v Speaker 1>our CLI,

00:43:31.385 --> 00:43:33.305
<v Speaker 1>we are able to prevent commits

00:43:34.425 --> 00:43:36.905
<v Speaker 1>that have hard coded secrets inside them.

00:43:37.305 --> 00:43:40.425
<v Speaker 1>So we have an algorithm embedded there. It

00:43:40.425 --> 00:43:41.785
<v Speaker 1>runs locally on your machine,

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:44.900
<v Speaker 1>and it's able to identify any hard coded

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:45.780
<v Speaker 1>secrets

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:48.900
<v Speaker 1>and kinda, like, warn you. It's like, hey.

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:51.059
<v Speaker 1>Be careful. You're about to commit this to

00:43:51.059 --> 00:43:52.500
<v Speaker 1>Git, and then it's gonna be in your

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:53.540
<v Speaker 1>Git history,

00:43:53.859 --> 00:43:55.940
<v Speaker 1>which is not a good security,

00:43:59.115 --> 00:44:00.475
<v Speaker 1>you know, you know, which is not a

00:44:00.475 --> 00:44:02.635
<v Speaker 1>good action to do from the security standpoint.

00:44:03.035 --> 00:44:05.355
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So is that algorithm detecting

00:44:05.515 --> 00:44:07.755
<v Speaker 0>any secret string or secrets that you have

00:44:07.755 --> 00:44:08.955
<v Speaker 0>in your Infisical

00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:12.150
<v Speaker 1>It's anything. It's anything. So it's able to

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:15.030
<v Speaker 1>pattern match. It's able to identify 50 different

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:17.350
<v Speaker 1>secret types, you know, from, you know, like,

00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:18.550
<v Speaker 1>different AWS

00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:21.430
<v Speaker 1>access tokens to API keys and SendGrid

00:44:21.845 --> 00:44:22.565
<v Speaker 1>or

00:44:22.724 --> 00:44:24.165
<v Speaker 1>whatever whatever it is.

00:44:24.885 --> 00:44:27.125
<v Speaker 1>But, yes, it's able to it's kinda, like,

00:44:27.125 --> 00:44:29.845
<v Speaker 1>able to pattern match and identify those secrets

00:44:30.404 --> 00:44:32.805
<v Speaker 1>and prevent you from leaking those. So even

00:44:32.805 --> 00:44:34.964
<v Speaker 1>if the secrets are not in Infisical yet,

00:44:34.964 --> 00:44:36.005
<v Speaker 1>we will catch those.

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:37.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:44:39.029 --> 00:44:42.549
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And definitely one of the kinda, like,

00:44:42.549 --> 00:44:46.150
<v Speaker 1>future directions as well for expansion for Infisical,

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:47.829
<v Speaker 1>you know, working on the in the secret

00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:49.430
<v Speaker 1>man the secret scanning realm

00:44:50.015 --> 00:44:52.015
<v Speaker 1>because that's something that a lot of engineers

00:44:52.015 --> 00:44:53.935
<v Speaker 1>like. You know, you have a single solution

00:44:53.935 --> 00:44:54.495
<v Speaker 1>for

00:44:55.295 --> 00:44:58.255
<v Speaker 1>that kinda, like, combines these functionalities together.

00:44:59.375 --> 00:45:00.735
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Nice.

00:45:01.375 --> 00:45:01.935
<v Speaker 0>Let's

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.200
<v Speaker 0>kinda change page a little bit to something

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:05.880
<v Speaker 0>we haven't really touched on yet. So we

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:07.320
<v Speaker 0>said at the start that this is all

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:08.200
<v Speaker 0>open source.

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:10.200
<v Speaker 0>There is a cloud product. People can go

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.120
<v Speaker 0>and sign up and just let you manage

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:13.320
<v Speaker 0>everything for them.

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:16.200
<v Speaker 0>But as they wanted to self host, that

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.320
<v Speaker 0>is an option. Like,

00:45:18.005 --> 00:45:20.965
<v Speaker 0>what is involved there, and how does, you

00:45:20.965 --> 00:45:22.885
<v Speaker 0>know, how does Infisical keep people from doing

00:45:22.885 --> 00:45:25.365
<v Speaker 0>anything silly? What's the encryption technology under the

00:45:25.365 --> 00:45:27.285
<v Speaker 0>hood? Is it using cloud KMS? Does it

00:45:27.285 --> 00:45:29.045
<v Speaker 0>provide their own keys? Maybe you could shed

00:45:29.045 --> 00:45:30.325
<v Speaker 0>a lit a bit more light on that.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So so first of

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:35.640
<v Speaker 1>all, actually, the self hosting so we have

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.640
<v Speaker 1>we provide all the self hosting instructions within

00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:38.840
<v Speaker 1>our documentation.

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:42.440
<v Speaker 1>And we so, admittedly, we used to have

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:43.560
<v Speaker 1>very, very thorough instructions

00:45:44.445 --> 00:45:47.565
<v Speaker 1>because we very recently migrated from MongoDB to

00:45:47.565 --> 00:45:49.885
<v Speaker 1>Postgres. And right now, we don't have everything

00:45:49.885 --> 00:45:52.205
<v Speaker 1>kinda, like, on par with how it used

00:45:52.205 --> 00:45:53.645
<v Speaker 1>to be for Mongo yet.

00:45:54.205 --> 00:45:56.205
<v Speaker 1>But, you know, we are we are adding

00:45:56.205 --> 00:45:57.325
<v Speaker 1>them over time.

00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:00.420
<v Speaker 1>And there are kinda, like, a number of

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:02.580
<v Speaker 1>different architectures that we do recommend

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:05.220
<v Speaker 1>people to self host depending on their use

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:07.060
<v Speaker 1>cases. You know, if, typically,

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:09.780
<v Speaker 1>if if if it's kinda like a solar

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:11.380
<v Speaker 1>project, that's one architecture

00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:13.964
<v Speaker 1>that's being recommended. If it's, like, a huge

00:46:13.964 --> 00:46:14.685
<v Speaker 1>bank,

00:46:15.085 --> 00:46:17.244
<v Speaker 1>then it it's a different one. And we,

00:46:17.244 --> 00:46:19.325
<v Speaker 1>for example, have, like, a Kubernetes deployment with

00:46:19.325 --> 00:46:20.685
<v Speaker 1>Helm charts available

00:46:21.325 --> 00:46:23.244
<v Speaker 1>and, you know, all the steps that people

00:46:23.244 --> 00:46:25.805
<v Speaker 1>need to take to to deploy and and

00:46:25.805 --> 00:46:27.484
<v Speaker 1>create this highly available environment.

00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:29.890
<v Speaker 1>And,

00:46:30.210 --> 00:46:32.210
<v Speaker 1>yes, and and and also,

00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:34.530
<v Speaker 1>like, we provide different instructions for how to

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:36.210
<v Speaker 1>actually secure your environment.

00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:39.490
<v Speaker 1>So how it works is that, you know,

00:46:39.490 --> 00:46:41.810
<v Speaker 1>for well, how to secure in your environment,

00:46:41.810 --> 00:46:44.075
<v Speaker 1>but also how to secure the data within

00:46:44.075 --> 00:46:44.875
<v Speaker 1>Infisical.

00:46:44.875 --> 00:46:47.595
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, you know, we kinda like as

00:46:47.595 --> 00:46:49.435
<v Speaker 1>part of our security posture.

00:46:49.674 --> 00:46:51.674
<v Speaker 1>The goal of Infisical is to secure the

00:46:51.674 --> 00:46:52.234
<v Speaker 1>data

00:46:52.954 --> 00:46:53.835
<v Speaker 1>within

00:46:54.555 --> 00:46:55.275
<v Speaker 1>Infisical,

00:46:56.830 --> 00:46:58.590
<v Speaker 1>but the kinda, like, the

00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:01.550
<v Speaker 1>part of securing the environment often physical is

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:03.550
<v Speaker 1>mostly on the team who is self hosting

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:04.110
<v Speaker 1>it.

00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:07.070
<v Speaker 1>So we we we can kinda, like, advise

00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:09.390
<v Speaker 1>on that, but we can be responsible for

00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:11.470
<v Speaker 1>that because it's ultimately

00:47:12.055 --> 00:47:14.295
<v Speaker 1>the responsibility of the self hosting team.

00:47:15.895 --> 00:47:17.895
<v Speaker 1>And yeah. But but, you know, the setup

00:47:17.895 --> 00:47:20.135
<v Speaker 1>is very simple. We actually it's I guess

00:47:20.135 --> 00:47:22.295
<v Speaker 1>it's a very interesting story because when we

00:47:22.295 --> 00:47:25.335
<v Speaker 1>started out, there used to be kinda like

00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:26.620
<v Speaker 1>so many different encryption keys

00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:28.060
<v Speaker 1>and

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:30.460
<v Speaker 1>other things that people had to specify when

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:32.140
<v Speaker 1>they were self hosting and physical.

00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:35.500
<v Speaker 1>And we actually narrowed it down and made

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:37.580
<v Speaker 1>it kinda like much, much, much simpler.

00:47:38.225 --> 00:47:40.145
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of these things are being

00:47:40.145 --> 00:47:41.265
<v Speaker 1>generated automatically

00:47:41.265 --> 00:47:43.905
<v Speaker 1>now, and you just need to specify a

00:47:43.905 --> 00:47:45.345
<v Speaker 1>single encryption key.

00:47:46.705 --> 00:47:47.265
<v Speaker 1>And,

00:47:47.665 --> 00:47:49.505
<v Speaker 1>yeah, that that's that's how it works. It's

00:47:49.505 --> 00:47:50.065
<v Speaker 1>very, very simple.

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:52.790
<v Speaker 0>Nice. I like simple. I like that you

00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:54.310
<v Speaker 0>don't have to get six people in six

00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:57.030
<v Speaker 0>different countries standing underneath a solar eclipse at

00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:58.790
<v Speaker 0>the same time chanting some sort of magic

00:47:58.790 --> 00:48:00.550
<v Speaker 0>phrase just to get it to build up.

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:01.830
<v Speaker 0>Very cool. Yeah.

00:48:05.214 --> 00:48:05.935
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:48:06.175 --> 00:48:09.375
<v Speaker 0>So Infisical is simple. It's not simple. It's

00:48:09.375 --> 00:48:11.694
<v Speaker 0>open source. It can be simple to install.

00:48:11.694 --> 00:48:13.214
<v Speaker 0>The complexity is there if you wanna go

00:48:13.214 --> 00:48:15.055
<v Speaker 0>to the documentations. In fact, the sample works

00:48:15.055 --> 00:48:17.135
<v Speaker 0>for you, and people can get started right

00:48:17.135 --> 00:48:20.260
<v Speaker 0>away. You've already kinda covered on what is

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:22.020
<v Speaker 0>coming up with a few things, but is

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:23.140
<v Speaker 0>there any larger

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:25.540
<v Speaker 0>or longer term initiatives that you're working on

00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:27.220
<v Speaker 0>at Infisical that people should be excited about

00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:28.740
<v Speaker 0>that you wanna go and share with them

00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:33.205
<v Speaker 0>today? Yeah. Honestly, there's just so many things

00:48:33.205 --> 00:48:35.045
<v Speaker 1>happening at the same time.

00:48:35.685 --> 00:48:37.845
<v Speaker 1>So first of all, for the integrations that

00:48:37.845 --> 00:48:40.565
<v Speaker 1>we are that I showed you, something that

00:48:40.565 --> 00:48:43.605
<v Speaker 1>we will be releasing soon is bidirectional

00:48:43.605 --> 00:48:44.245
<v Speaker 1>integrations.

00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:45.850
<v Speaker 1>So,

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:48.970
<v Speaker 1>you you know, sometimes what happens is that

00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:50.890
<v Speaker 1>even though Infisical is the main source of

00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:52.090
<v Speaker 1>truth for Infisical,

00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:55.210
<v Speaker 1>some engineer on the team decides

00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:57.290
<v Speaker 1>to, for some reason, to update the secret

00:48:57.290 --> 00:48:58.010
<v Speaker 1>in Heroku.

00:48:58.295 --> 00:49:00.135
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens is there there becomes

00:49:00.135 --> 00:49:01.095
<v Speaker 1>discrepancy.

00:49:01.335 --> 00:49:03.815
<v Speaker 1>So with bidirectional integrations, you'll actually be able

00:49:03.815 --> 00:49:06.215
<v Speaker 1>to specify, you know, what's the behavior

00:49:06.615 --> 00:49:09.175
<v Speaker 1>that you want to follow in case these

00:49:09.175 --> 00:49:10.135
<v Speaker 1>discrepancies appear.

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:12.560
<v Speaker 1>And and there is a lot of other

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:15.360
<v Speaker 1>things that we'll be releasing for improving integrations.

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:16.880
<v Speaker 1>You you can kind of think of it

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:18.640
<v Speaker 1>as the integration v two

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:20.160
<v Speaker 1>stage,

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:23.200
<v Speaker 1>and, you know, they're they'll become much more

00:49:24.315 --> 00:49:25.115
<v Speaker 1>customizable

00:49:25.115 --> 00:49:27.275
<v Speaker 1>if if you want them to be customizable.

00:49:27.275 --> 00:49:27.515
<v Speaker 1>But

00:49:28.715 --> 00:49:31.515
<v Speaker 1>yeah. So that's another thing. The other thing

00:49:31.515 --> 00:49:33.195
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be coming out,

00:49:33.835 --> 00:49:36.155
<v Speaker 1>and and that's what we've been working

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:39.200
<v Speaker 1>for, like, quite a long time now is

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:40.960
<v Speaker 1>different authentication methods

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:44.320
<v Speaker 1>for how you can authenticate Infisical

00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:46.800
<v Speaker 1>both on the user and on the machine

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:47.360
<v Speaker 1>level.

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:50.720
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, I mean I mean, there is

00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:53.405
<v Speaker 1>lots and lots of stuff around it.

00:49:53.645 --> 00:49:55.885
<v Speaker 1>You know, we already support, for example, on

00:49:55.885 --> 00:49:59.245
<v Speaker 1>the user level, a lot of different authentication

00:49:59.245 --> 00:50:01.485
<v Speaker 1>methods starting from, you know, very simple, like,

00:50:01.485 --> 00:50:02.605
<v Speaker 1>email and password

00:50:03.165 --> 00:50:03.965
<v Speaker 1>to

00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:07.970
<v Speaker 1>SAML SSO to OIDC to LDAP to

00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:11.090
<v Speaker 1>all all kinda like it's a lot of

00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:11.890
<v Speaker 1>different things.

00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:16.130
<v Speaker 1>But there is much more to be added

00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:19.545
<v Speaker 1>and also a lot on the machine level.

00:50:19.545 --> 00:50:22.185
<v Speaker 1>For for example, Kubernetes authentication is something that

00:50:22.185 --> 00:50:23.225
<v Speaker 1>we'll be adding and

00:50:24.265 --> 00:50:24.985
<v Speaker 1>so on.

00:50:25.625 --> 00:50:27.225
<v Speaker 1>Another functionality,

00:50:27.225 --> 00:50:28.745
<v Speaker 1>and and this is gonna be kinda like

00:50:28.745 --> 00:50:29.785
<v Speaker 1>another part,

00:50:29.945 --> 00:50:32.025
<v Speaker 1>Infisical, and and maybe it would come a

00:50:32.025 --> 00:50:32.425
<v Speaker 1>little later.

00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:36.150
<v Speaker 1>But, ultimately, it's the secret sharing functionality.

00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:39.670
<v Speaker 1>And how we view it is that, you

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:42.310
<v Speaker 1>know, even though you have in physical your

00:50:42.310 --> 00:50:43.270
<v Speaker 1>secret management

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:44.630
<v Speaker 1>platform,

00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:47.875
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you have these situations where you,

00:50:47.954 --> 00:50:48.994
<v Speaker 1>as a developer,

00:50:48.994 --> 00:50:51.474
<v Speaker 1>have to send something confidential

00:50:51.474 --> 00:50:52.195
<v Speaker 1>to

00:50:52.434 --> 00:50:55.075
<v Speaker 1>either another person on your team or maybe

00:50:55.075 --> 00:50:57.875
<v Speaker 1>to your clients or whatever it is.

00:50:58.674 --> 00:50:59.714
<v Speaker 1>And then you would be able to use

00:50:59.714 --> 00:51:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Infisical to basically generate encrypted links

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:05.760
<v Speaker 1>or and and it's kinda like a secret

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:09.040
<v Speaker 1>sharing infrastructure for these sensitive credentials.

00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:10.880
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:13.119
<v Speaker 0>Wow. Based on all of those things that

00:51:13.119 --> 00:51:14.640
<v Speaker 0>you have coming up, I'm assuming nobody in

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:16.160
<v Speaker 0>your team has a minute to sleep because

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:18.055
<v Speaker 0>that is a lot of things that you're

00:51:18.055 --> 00:51:19.575
<v Speaker 0>working on. Yeah.

00:51:20.375 --> 00:51:22.375
<v Speaker 1>We we borderlines on sleep.

00:51:22.535 --> 00:51:23.095
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:51:25.015 --> 00:51:27.735
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, I hope based on everything that

00:51:27.735 --> 00:51:29.655
<v Speaker 0>people have seen and what they've heard is

00:51:29.655 --> 00:51:31.575
<v Speaker 0>that they're excited and they're all gonna go

00:51:31.575 --> 00:51:33.470
<v Speaker 0>check out in physical at the next available

00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:34.110
<v Speaker 0>option.

00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:36.910
<v Speaker 0>Any last words for people before we wrap

00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:37.550
