00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.159
<v Speaker 0>Do you know what a production,

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.600
<v Speaker 0>real world, server side WebAssembly application

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.280
<v Speaker 0>looks like? The truth is not many do.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.679
<v Speaker 0>Server side WebAssembly is still at the cutting

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:12.960
<v Speaker 0>edge of cloud computing.

00:00:13.455 --> 00:00:17.055
<v Speaker 0>And there just aren't enough, perhaps any, examples

00:00:17.135 --> 00:00:20.575
<v Speaker 0>of real world production grade server side WebAssembly

00:00:20.575 --> 00:00:21.375
<v Speaker 0>applications.

00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:23.294
<v Speaker 0>That was until now.

00:00:23.615 --> 00:00:24.414
<v Speaker 0>Justin,

00:00:24.415 --> 00:00:27.055
<v Speaker 0>a senior solutions engineer at Fermion,

00:00:27.055 --> 00:00:30.150
<v Speaker 0>has built himself his own social network using

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.549
<v Speaker 0>Spin. So join us as we explore the

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:34.790
<v Speaker 0>code base, add a new feature, and talk

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.910
<v Speaker 0>about the experience of writing real world production

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.989
<v Speaker 0>grade server side WebAssembly applications using Spin. Click
