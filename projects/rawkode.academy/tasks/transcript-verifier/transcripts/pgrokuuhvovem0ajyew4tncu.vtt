00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:07.680
<v Speaker 0>Hello,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.920
<v Speaker 0>and welcome to the first tutorial on the

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.440
<v Speaker 0>complete guide to Teleport.

00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:13.955
<v Speaker 0>In this tutorial, we'll be taking a look

00:00:13.955 --> 00:00:15.954
<v Speaker 0>at three ways to install Teleport

00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:18.195
<v Speaker 0>on Debian, on Red Hat,

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:20.835
<v Speaker 0>as to any other Linux operating system using

00:00:20.835 --> 00:00:21.555
<v Speaker 0>curl.

00:00:22.195 --> 00:00:23.555
<v Speaker 0>In the following tutorial,

00:00:23.555 --> 00:00:25.075
<v Speaker 0>we'll look at Docker. So if you're looking

00:00:25.075 --> 00:00:26.035
<v Speaker 0>at containers,

00:00:26.195 --> 00:00:27.474
<v Speaker 0>jump to tutorial two.

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.560
<v Speaker 0>Let's get started.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.360
<v Speaker 0>Throughout these tutorials and workshops, we'll be relying

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.399
<v Speaker 0>on the Teleport documentation as much as possible.

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.120
<v Speaker 0>The Teleport documentation is fantastic. And if you

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.760
<v Speaker 0>ever run into trouble, I recommend checking there

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.824
<v Speaker 0>first and then maybe follow-up with a YouTube

00:00:44.824 --> 00:00:45.545
<v Speaker 0>comment.

00:00:45.785 --> 00:00:46.425
<v Speaker 0>Thanks.

00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:49.625
<v Speaker 0>So let's start with Debian based distributions.

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:53.065
<v Speaker 0>We have here a tab for Debian

00:00:53.065 --> 00:00:54.265
<v Speaker 0>with four commands.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.980
<v Speaker 0>Now you'll see here that this relies on

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.340
<v Speaker 0>both curl and apt dash add dash repository.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.140
<v Speaker 0>If these are not available on your Debian

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.180
<v Speaker 0>based distribution,

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.820
<v Speaker 0>you will have to run an apt update

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.820
<v Speaker 0>and an apt install curl

00:01:09.015 --> 00:01:12.055
<v Speaker 0>and software dash properties dash common.

00:01:12.375 --> 00:01:15.174
<v Speaker 0>This should make the tools required available.

00:01:18.055 --> 00:01:19.975
<v Speaker 0>We're going to start by copying the curl

00:01:19.975 --> 00:01:22.455
<v Speaker 0>command and dropping it onto our Debian machine.

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.090
<v Speaker 0>And because I'm running as a root user,

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.929
<v Speaker 0>I do not need the sudo at the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:28.369
<v Speaker 0>start of the second command.

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.409
<v Speaker 0>This is going to import the GPG key

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.170
<v Speaker 0>that will allow us to consume

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.729
<v Speaker 0>the Teleport repository in a secure fashion.

00:01:37.135 --> 00:01:38.895
<v Speaker 0>Next, we're going to use the apt add

00:01:38.895 --> 00:01:42.655
<v Speaker 0>repository helper to add the Teleport repository to

00:01:42.655 --> 00:01:43.615
<v Speaker 0>our system.

00:01:47.615 --> 00:01:49.774
<v Speaker 0>And when we add the new repository with

00:01:49.774 --> 00:01:52.015
<v Speaker 0>this helper, it will automatically run the apt

00:01:52.015 --> 00:01:54.149
<v Speaker 0>update for us automatically.

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:56.390
<v Speaker 0>So we can actually skip the next line

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.990
<v Speaker 0>in the Teleport documentation

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.070
<v Speaker 0>and go straight to the app install.

00:02:11.505 --> 00:02:12.305
<v Speaker 0>Voila.

00:02:12.625 --> 00:02:14.785
<v Speaker 0>We now have Teleport installed on a Debian

00:02:14.785 --> 00:02:15.985
<v Speaker 0>based distribution.

00:02:17.905 --> 00:02:18.625
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:20.385
<v Speaker 0>Let's take a look at the Red Hat

00:02:20.385 --> 00:02:21.025
<v Speaker 0>version there.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.170
<v Speaker 0>If we jump back over to the documentation

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.090
<v Speaker 0>and click on the Red Hat tab,

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.170
<v Speaker 0>we can see that we need access to

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.730
<v Speaker 0>the YUM config manager to be able to

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.810
<v Speaker 0>add our Teleport repository.

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.609
<v Speaker 0>To get that, you'll need to YUM install

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:37.450
<v Speaker 0>yum dash utils.

00:02:38.944 --> 00:02:40.625
<v Speaker 0>From there, we can copy

00:02:40.785 --> 00:02:42.145
<v Speaker 0>this first command,

00:02:43.665 --> 00:02:46.465
<v Speaker 0>and this will add our Teleport repository to

00:02:46.465 --> 00:02:47.745
<v Speaker 0>our yum configuration.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.520
<v Speaker 0>Next, we do a YUM install Teleport.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.960
<v Speaker 0>We've had to click yes twice. Once to

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.200
<v Speaker 0>confirm we want to install Teleport, the second

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.800
<v Speaker 0>one to confirm that we wanted to import

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.995
<v Speaker 0>the key from that repository.

00:03:07.315 --> 00:03:09.875
<v Speaker 0>Now the installation is running, and in just

00:03:09.875 --> 00:03:11.875
<v Speaker 0>a moment's time, we will have Teleport installed

00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:13.315
<v Speaker 0>on a Red Hat system.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.110
<v Speaker 0>And that's it. Voila.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.190
<v Speaker 0>So, well, I really appreciate

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.030
<v Speaker 0>what repositories provided for Debian distributions or Debian

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.910
<v Speaker 0>based distributions and Red Hat based distributions.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.990
<v Speaker 0>Sometimes you just wanna install it yourself,

00:03:33.615 --> 00:03:35.775
<v Speaker 0>or maybe you're just running another

00:03:35.775 --> 00:03:36.895
<v Speaker 0>more esoteric

00:03:36.895 --> 00:03:37.775
<v Speaker 0>distribution.

00:03:38.095 --> 00:03:39.935
<v Speaker 0>In fact, I'm a pretty big fan of

00:03:39.935 --> 00:03:40.575
<v Speaker 0>Arch.

00:03:41.215 --> 00:03:42.415
<v Speaker 0>So let's take a look at how we

00:03:42.415 --> 00:03:45.215
<v Speaker 0>can install Teleport without the package repositories.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.470
<v Speaker 0>On the installation instructions, I've clicked on ARM

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.670
<v Speaker 0>64 ARM v eight instructions. Now these aren't

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.030
<v Speaker 0>specific to ARM.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.590
<v Speaker 0>However, they are highlighting that we can use

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.270
<v Speaker 0>curl commands to install Teleport.

00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:01.025
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna copy this first one, which downloads

00:04:01.025 --> 00:04:02.864
<v Speaker 0>the SHA two fifty six. This is the

00:04:02.864 --> 00:04:04.705
<v Speaker 0>checksum for the binary that we are about

00:04:04.705 --> 00:04:05.505
<v Speaker 0>to download.

00:04:06.065 --> 00:04:07.665
<v Speaker 0>When I paste it though, I'm gonna make

00:04:07.665 --> 00:04:08.705
<v Speaker 0>a small change

00:04:09.265 --> 00:04:12.224
<v Speaker 0>because this isn't an ARM 64

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.470
<v Speaker 0>machine. It is a standard AMD sixty four

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.110
<v Speaker 0>machine.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.070
<v Speaker 0>However, because it's Arch Linux, we can't leverage

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.670
<v Speaker 0>those package repositories.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.870
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to download that checksum.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.470
<v Speaker 0>Next, we can copy the curl command

00:04:27.265 --> 00:04:29.585
<v Speaker 0>for downloading a binary artifact.

00:04:29.585 --> 00:04:32.225
<v Speaker 0>And, again, we're going to replace ARM 64

00:04:32.225 --> 00:04:33.265
<v Speaker 0>with AND

00:04:33.665 --> 00:04:34.385
<v Speaker 0>64.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.830
<v Speaker 0>Now that we have the TARBOL downloaded, we

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.069
<v Speaker 0>can copy the SHA sum command to verify

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:51.870
<v Speaker 0>and validate that the checksum and the TARBOL

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:52.750
<v Speaker 0>match.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.909
<v Speaker 0>This command is slightly different on R's Linux.

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:59.955
<v Speaker 0>The command is SHA sum SHA two five

00:04:59.955 --> 00:05:01.795
<v Speaker 0>six sum, and it doesn't need us to

00:05:01.795 --> 00:05:02.995
<v Speaker 0>tell it the size.

00:05:06.035 --> 00:05:07.475
<v Speaker 0>Oh, and we have to update the ARM

00:05:07.475 --> 00:05:09.875
<v Speaker 0>64 to EMT 64.

00:05:10.195 --> 00:05:11.475
<v Speaker 0>I was bound to forget it once.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.310
<v Speaker 0>What we can see here is that the

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.150
<v Speaker 0>ShaSM we downloaded here

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:18.430
<v Speaker 0>matches

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.070
<v Speaker 0>the shadow we get on the tarball.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.910
<v Speaker 0>That's exactly what we want.

00:05:27.805 --> 00:05:31.085
<v Speaker 0>Lastly, we can extract our downloaded tarball,

00:05:35.885 --> 00:05:38.285
<v Speaker 0>c d into the Teleport directory,

00:05:38.764 --> 00:05:40.685
<v Speaker 0>and run the installation script.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.440
<v Speaker 0>Voila. Teleport installed on any Linux distribution

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.720
<v Speaker 0>using curl,

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.560
<v Speaker 0>something to check the Chasms,

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.240
<v Speaker 0>and one helper install script.

00:05:58.025 --> 00:05:59.625
<v Speaker 0>Now that we've seen three different ways to

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:02.185
<v Speaker 0>install Teleport, let's actually kick the tires on

00:06:02.185 --> 00:06:03.785
<v Speaker 0>it and make sure it works.

00:06:05.305 --> 00:06:06.905
<v Speaker 0>Without any configuration,

00:06:06.905 --> 00:06:09.384
<v Speaker 0>we can run Teleport start on any of

00:06:09.384 --> 00:06:10.425
<v Speaker 0>these installations

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.900
<v Speaker 0>and get a Teleport server running.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.180
<v Speaker 0>Because there is no TLS configuration provided by

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.780
<v Speaker 0>me, the end user,

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.020
<v Speaker 0>it's going to generate some certs that may

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.060
<v Speaker 0>be considered insecure or unsafe by your browser.

00:06:24.695 --> 00:06:26.455
<v Speaker 0>In the workshop coming up in just a

00:06:26.455 --> 00:06:28.215
<v Speaker 0>few days' time, you will see how to

00:06:28.215 --> 00:06:30.295
<v Speaker 0>provision and use the built in support for

00:06:30.295 --> 00:06:33.175
<v Speaker 0>Let's Encrypt to get real x five zero

00:06:33.175 --> 00:06:36.215
<v Speaker 0>nine certificates that are trusted by all browsers.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.550
<v Speaker 0>If you also get this screen,

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.830
<v Speaker 0>Chrome allows you to type this is unsafe

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.615
<v Speaker 0>anywhere on the page, and it will accept

00:06:56.255 --> 00:06:58.255
<v Speaker 0>the untrusted certificate.

00:07:05.775 --> 00:07:06.415
<v Speaker 0>And perfect.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.710
<v Speaker 0>We now have a Teleport login screen that

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.270
<v Speaker 0>will allow us to access this Teleport service.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.470
<v Speaker 0>But wait, we haven't created any users.

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:17.870
<v Speaker 0>We can add our first user from the

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:18.910
<v Speaker 0>Linux system

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.550
<v Speaker 0>by using the t c t l command.

00:07:26.035 --> 00:07:28.355
<v Speaker 0>The t c l command has a subcommand

00:07:28.355 --> 00:07:31.155
<v Speaker 0>called users and a following subcommand called add.

00:07:31.235 --> 00:07:32.675
<v Speaker 0>We can provide the name of the user

00:07:32.675 --> 00:07:33.955
<v Speaker 0>that we wish to add.

00:07:34.835 --> 00:07:36.115
<v Speaker 0>We're gonna have to assign

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.100
<v Speaker 0>some roles and privileges to this user. Now

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.460
<v Speaker 0>you don't have to worry about this right

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.220
<v Speaker 0>now. We will cover this in a future

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.660
<v Speaker 0>tutorial and workshop.

00:08:02.595 --> 00:08:04.995
<v Speaker 0>After adding user, you will be presented with

00:08:04.995 --> 00:08:05.795
<v Speaker 0>an ephemeral

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.040
<v Speaker 0>short lived token that will allow you to

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.040
<v Speaker 0>register and create your first user.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.720
<v Speaker 0>I have to change the container

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.000
<v Speaker 0>to localhost

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:19.880
<v Speaker 0>for this to work.

00:08:23.285 --> 00:08:25.205
<v Speaker 0>Now we just have to set a password

00:08:25.205 --> 00:08:26.885
<v Speaker 0>and configure 2FA.

00:08:27.285 --> 00:08:29.845
<v Speaker 0>Teleport is secure by default and in fact

00:08:29.845 --> 00:08:32.725
<v Speaker 0>cannot be misconfigured to not support 2FA.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.700
<v Speaker 0>So you're gonna wanna use Google Authenticator,

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:41.059
<v Speaker 0>1Password, that word in, or even Authy. Whatever

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:43.140
<v Speaker 0>you wanna use, you can configure.

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:47.300
<v Speaker 0>Teleport does support hardware tokens as a 2FA,

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.060
<v Speaker 0>and this will be covered in future sessions.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:14.139
<v Speaker 0>1Password provides support for scanning this QR code

00:09:14.139 --> 00:09:15.660
<v Speaker 0>directly through the extension.

00:09:26.705 --> 00:09:29.025
<v Speaker 0>And now we have created and logged in

00:09:29.025 --> 00:09:30.465
<v Speaker 0>to our Teleport server.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.420
<v Speaker 0>So now that we have access, let's see

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.340
<v Speaker 0>what we can do with Teleport.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:38.180
<v Speaker 0>First, I'll zoom in a little bit to

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:39.780
<v Speaker 0>make it a little bit more legible.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.340
<v Speaker 0>We start off on a server screen.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.580
<v Speaker 0>This lists all of the nodes which have

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.500
<v Speaker 0>a Teleport agent running within your cluster.

00:09:47.355 --> 00:09:49.435
<v Speaker 0>There is a connect button that when clicked

00:09:49.435 --> 00:09:51.595
<v Speaker 0>allows you to SSH

00:09:51.755 --> 00:09:53.595
<v Speaker 0>securely with auditing

00:09:53.595 --> 00:09:55.755
<v Speaker 0>to any machine within the cluster.

00:09:56.555 --> 00:09:58.715
<v Speaker 0>You have access to whatever users you're configured

00:09:58.715 --> 00:10:00.880
<v Speaker 0>access to. If you remember when I ran

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.360
<v Speaker 0>a tctl user to ads command, I gave

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.000
<v Speaker 0>myself dash dash logins equals root.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.640
<v Speaker 0>We haven't discussed user management yet, but we

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.720
<v Speaker 0>will do this soon in a future session.

00:10:12.835 --> 00:10:15.235
<v Speaker 0>If I click connect as root, we get

00:10:15.235 --> 00:10:16.835
<v Speaker 0>a web based SSH

00:10:16.835 --> 00:10:17.715
<v Speaker 0>terminal.

00:10:18.195 --> 00:10:20.355
<v Speaker 0>From here, I can run commands.

00:10:20.755 --> 00:10:22.915
<v Speaker 0>I can ask who I am and I

00:10:22.915 --> 00:10:24.835
<v Speaker 0>can look to see which other processes are

00:10:24.835 --> 00:10:26.115
<v Speaker 0>running within the system.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.080
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to click exit, and we'll let

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.040
<v Speaker 0>that go away.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.240
<v Speaker 0>Now, we haven't configured this Teleport with much

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.520
<v Speaker 0>more at the moment,

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.920
<v Speaker 0>but what I will say is that there

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.120
<v Speaker 0>is a lot coming

00:10:41.235 --> 00:10:43.154
<v Speaker 0>when we look at application

00:10:43.154 --> 00:10:44.035
<v Speaker 0>management,

00:10:44.435 --> 00:10:45.475
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes

00:10:45.555 --> 00:10:46.755
<v Speaker 0>and databases.

00:10:48.274 --> 00:10:52.195
<v Speaker 0>Teleport provides primitive for securely managing with protocol

00:10:52.195 --> 00:10:52.915
<v Speaker 0>awareness,

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.200
<v Speaker 0>access to Postgres,

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.080
<v Speaker 0>MongoDB,

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.680
<v Speaker 0>and more coming soon.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.040
<v Speaker 0>It has first class support for hooking into

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.280
<v Speaker 0>your Kubernetes system and giving people access to

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.480
<v Speaker 0>the clusters as required.

00:11:05.694 --> 00:11:08.334
<v Speaker 0>You can also proxy any application running within

00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:10.574
<v Speaker 0>a Kubernetes cluster or on any bare metal

00:11:10.574 --> 00:11:11.295
<v Speaker 0>node

00:11:11.375 --> 00:11:14.014
<v Speaker 0>provided you can tell Teleport where that application

00:11:14.014 --> 00:11:14.574
<v Speaker 0>is.

00:11:14.894 --> 00:11:17.055
<v Speaker 0>You can distribute access to that as an

00:11:17.055 --> 00:11:18.815
<v Speaker 0>ephemeral fashion or persistent,

00:11:19.134 --> 00:11:21.530
<v Speaker 0>giving people what they need access to in

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:23.610
<v Speaker 0>a really easy, simple fashion.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:26.890
<v Speaker 0>What we can see just now in this

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:30.810
<v Speaker 0>unconfigured Teleport though, is activity and auditing.

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:33.290
<v Speaker 0>If I click on activity here

00:11:34.275 --> 00:11:36.275
<v Speaker 0>and active sessions, you'll see that we don't

00:11:36.275 --> 00:11:38.275
<v Speaker 0>actually have an active session right now.

00:11:38.915 --> 00:11:41.235
<v Speaker 0>But let's just change that and open our

00:11:41.235 --> 00:11:42.675
<v Speaker 0>new root session.

00:11:43.715 --> 00:11:46.035
<v Speaker 0>We'll jump back over to here, click on

00:11:46.035 --> 00:11:47.475
<v Speaker 0>active sessions, and you can see

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.790
<v Speaker 0>the session is now listed here. We can

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.870
<v Speaker 0>see the ID, we can see the user

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:55.030
<v Speaker 0>and the IP address, and the note that

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.910
<v Speaker 0>was accessed.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:57.830
<v Speaker 0>And if I wanted, I could click the

00:11:57.830 --> 00:11:59.990
<v Speaker 0>join the session to get a second tab

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:02.550
<v Speaker 0>typing in real time with my collaborator.

00:12:03.384 --> 00:12:04.745
<v Speaker 0>If I move over here,

00:12:05.545 --> 00:12:07.625
<v Speaker 0>you can see every single thing, even when

00:12:07.625 --> 00:12:08.904
<v Speaker 0>I don't hit return,

00:12:09.144 --> 00:12:10.825
<v Speaker 0>that is happening in this session.

00:12:12.505 --> 00:12:14.505
<v Speaker 0>More importantly than that is we get full

00:12:14.505 --> 00:12:17.420
<v Speaker 0>auditability of everything happening in this system. You

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.500
<v Speaker 0>can see when the user was created.

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:22.139
<v Speaker 0>You can see when sessions are started.

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.300
<v Speaker 0>You can click on it for more information

00:12:24.459 --> 00:12:27.019
<v Speaker 0>to see which login was used

00:12:27.819 --> 00:12:29.819
<v Speaker 0>and which user initiated the session.

00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:32.685
<v Speaker 0>You can see when they disconnected,

00:12:32.685 --> 00:12:34.445
<v Speaker 0>you can see when a session ends,

00:12:34.925 --> 00:12:36.444
<v Speaker 0>and you can even see when a user

00:12:36.444 --> 00:12:38.204
<v Speaker 0>joins an active session.

00:12:39.004 --> 00:12:41.404
<v Speaker 0>There is a wealth of information here for

00:12:41.404 --> 00:12:42.764
<v Speaker 0>the next time you have

00:12:43.165 --> 00:12:44.444
<v Speaker 0>any risky situation.

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.020
<v Speaker 0>And my favorite feature,

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.620
<v Speaker 0>session recording.

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.700
<v Speaker 0>Teleport records all of the activity on the

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.620
<v Speaker 0>sessions, allowing you to play it back as

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:57.540
<v Speaker 0>everywhere a movie even though it's not.

00:12:58.425 --> 00:13:00.185
<v Speaker 0>We can click play on a session here

00:13:00.185 --> 00:13:02.585
<v Speaker 0>and see every command that I executed

00:13:02.745 --> 00:13:04.425
<v Speaker 0>at the start of this demo.

00:13:05.625 --> 00:13:07.705
<v Speaker 0>More than that, you can see that there's

00:13:07.705 --> 00:13:09.865
<v Speaker 0>a slider that allows us to roll this

00:13:09.865 --> 00:13:12.584
<v Speaker 0>back to whatever stage of the history we

00:13:12.584 --> 00:13:12.825
<v Speaker 0>want.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.800
<v Speaker 0>And one last thing,

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.680
<v Speaker 0>you can copy and paste anything

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.960
<v Speaker 0>from the recording.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.760
<v Speaker 0>So that is my high level overview of

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.320
<v Speaker 0>Teleport.

00:13:27.935 --> 00:13:30.334
<v Speaker 0>You've seen how to install Teleport on Debian,

00:13:30.334 --> 00:13:31.774
<v Speaker 0>Rata, and with Curl.

00:13:32.495 --> 00:13:34.334
<v Speaker 0>You've seen how to start the server and

00:13:34.334 --> 00:13:35.695
<v Speaker 0>create your first user.

00:13:36.415 --> 00:13:38.334
<v Speaker 0>We've done a high level exploration of the

00:13:38.334 --> 00:13:40.975
<v Speaker 0>user interface and discussed briefly some of the

00:13:40.975 --> 00:13:42.495
<v Speaker 0>features we're gonna be looking at in this

00:13:42.495 --> 00:13:42.735
<v Speaker 0>course.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.540
<v Speaker 0>Join us for our workshop.

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.660
<v Speaker 0>In just a few days' time, we will

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.100
<v Speaker 0>be taking a look at all of these

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.700
<v Speaker 0>features in much

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.820
<v Speaker 0>more detail in a live hands on fashion.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:56.420
<v Speaker 0>We'll see you soon.
