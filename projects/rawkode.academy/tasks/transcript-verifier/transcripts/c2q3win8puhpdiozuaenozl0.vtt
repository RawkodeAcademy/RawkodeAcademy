00:01:53.765 --> 00:01:54.485
<v Speaker 0>Hello?

00:02:00.485 --> 00:02:01.525
<v Speaker 0>I'm so confused.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.199
<v Speaker 0>Hold on a second, please. Professional stream going

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.920
<v Speaker 0>on here.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.360
<v Speaker 0>You

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.400
<v Speaker 0>know, during the intro, I heard my intro

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.320
<v Speaker 0>music playing over the top of itself and

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.920
<v Speaker 0>it was very much confusing myself to the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.285
<v Speaker 0>point where I muted it because I was

00:02:20.285 --> 00:02:22.045
<v Speaker 0>concerned that it was playing twice.

00:02:22.685 --> 00:02:24.205
<v Speaker 0>I then proceeded to ask my guest if

00:02:24.205 --> 00:02:25.965
<v Speaker 0>he had the YouTube page open and I

00:02:25.965 --> 00:02:26.765
<v Speaker 0>guess what?

00:02:27.005 --> 00:02:29.645
<v Speaker 0>It was me. So I was listening to

00:02:29.645 --> 00:02:31.405
<v Speaker 0>my intro video while trying to talk to

00:02:31.405 --> 00:02:33.005
<v Speaker 0>you and introduce the show and now I

00:02:33.005 --> 00:02:35.020
<v Speaker 0>feel like an absolute ass. However,

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.940
<v Speaker 0>we're gonna get things kicked off today because

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.380
<v Speaker 0>things go wrong all the time and it's

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.220
<v Speaker 0>usually my fault as I always always say

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.180
<v Speaker 0>on the stream.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.740
<v Speaker 0>So today oh, hello. Welcome back to the

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.820
<v Speaker 0>Rawkode Academy. My name is David Flanagan.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.740
<v Speaker 0>You will know me as Rawkode. And today

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.725
<v Speaker 0>we are taking a look at Kubescape. It

00:02:49.725 --> 00:02:52.125
<v Speaker 0>is a Kubernetes open source tool providing multi

00:02:52.125 --> 00:02:52.845
<v Speaker 0>cloud Kubernetes

00:02:53.485 --> 00:02:55.645
<v Speaker 0>single pane of glass.

00:02:55.645 --> 00:02:57.805
<v Speaker 0>As we see in the title graphic, we're

00:02:57.805 --> 00:03:00.285
<v Speaker 0>going to show you how to secure your

00:03:00.285 --> 00:03:01.725
<v Speaker 0>clusters like the NSA.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.600
<v Speaker 0>Now,

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.280
<v Speaker 0>as you can tell by my mistakes in

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.440
<v Speaker 0>the first minus thirty seconds of the show,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 0>I am not smart enough to guide us

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.040
<v Speaker 0>through this today. However, we are joined by

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.600
<v Speaker 0>someone who is. So let me please introduce

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.680
<v Speaker 0>our guest, Ben from Armelsec.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.640
<v Speaker 0>Hey, man. How's it going?

00:03:17.385 --> 00:03:20.185
<v Speaker 1>Hi. Hi, David. Thanks for having me. See,

00:03:20.185 --> 00:03:21.944
<v Speaker 0>you must be feeling very confident now that

00:03:21.944 --> 00:03:23.545
<v Speaker 0>I've made all the mistakes in the first

00:03:23.545 --> 00:03:25.385
<v Speaker 0>ten seconds. Right? That takes the pressure off.

00:03:25.385 --> 00:03:25.865
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:03:26.584 --> 00:03:28.424
<v Speaker 1>Well, that's just just the beginning of the

00:03:28.424 --> 00:03:30.025
<v Speaker 1>show. You will see my mistakes in a

00:03:30.025 --> 00:03:30.584
<v Speaker 1>few minutes.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.650
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Awesome. Well, thank you so much for

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.890
<v Speaker 0>joining us today. And for anyone who's not

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.569
<v Speaker 0>familiar with you, doesn't follow you on Twitter,

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.329
<v Speaker 0>can you share a little bit of information

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.290
<v Speaker 0>about Ben?

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.409
<v Speaker 1>So yeah. Okay. I will try to keep

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.090
<v Speaker 1>it short. Okay. So

00:03:45.535 --> 00:03:46.575
<v Speaker 1>I'm a

00:03:46.815 --> 00:03:50.175
<v Speaker 1>cybersecurity veteran, okay, coming into the cloud native

00:03:50.815 --> 00:03:51.455
<v Speaker 1>space,

00:03:51.695 --> 00:03:53.695
<v Speaker 1>like, few for a few years now.

00:03:55.695 --> 00:03:57.615
<v Speaker 1>Mostly, you know, we're working in ARMOR,

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.230
<v Speaker 1>which is a startup

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:00.350
<v Speaker 1>we've

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.430
<v Speaker 1>founded two years ago.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.549
<v Speaker 1>We're working on Kubernetes security

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:06.670
<v Speaker 1>and improving

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.710
<v Speaker 1>the security

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.709
<v Speaker 1>of applications in Kubernetes.

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:13.265
<v Speaker 1>And what I can I can tell you

00:04:13.265 --> 00:04:15.985
<v Speaker 1>by myself that I'm the VP engineering here?

00:04:15.985 --> 00:04:17.665
<v Speaker 1>But, you know, as a small startup, you

00:04:17.745 --> 00:04:19.105
<v Speaker 1>most of the things you are doing, you're

00:04:19.105 --> 00:04:20.464
<v Speaker 1>you're doing everything.

00:04:20.545 --> 00:04:23.025
<v Speaker 1>So you're also washing the dishes at the

00:04:23.025 --> 00:04:23.985
<v Speaker 1>office and

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.660
<v Speaker 1>everything. So I'm a father of beyond the

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.940
<v Speaker 1>time, I'm a father of four,

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.460
<v Speaker 1>and I love to play chess.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.340
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Thank you for sharing all that with

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.740
<v Speaker 0>us.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.460
<v Speaker 0>I always like to ask a question where

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.055
<v Speaker 0>we have security focused people on, and it's

00:04:40.215 --> 00:04:42.215
<v Speaker 0>is Kubernetes secure by default?

00:04:42.375 --> 00:04:43.895
<v Speaker 0>What's your opinions on that?

00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:45.095
<v Speaker 1>So,

00:04:46.615 --> 00:04:48.935
<v Speaker 1>actually, this is really good question. Okay? I

00:04:48.935 --> 00:04:50.935
<v Speaker 1>know that you're you've asked someone else, but,

00:04:50.935 --> 00:04:52.535
<v Speaker 1>you know, this is something always first of

00:04:52.535 --> 00:04:54.215
<v Speaker 1>all, I'm a fan. Okay? So

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.660
<v Speaker 1>of your show. And and Kubernetes,

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.340
<v Speaker 1>I have to tell tell you that one

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.220
<v Speaker 1>of the most interesting things about Kubernetes that

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.700
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.540
<v Speaker 1>really gave the people behind Kubernetes gave a

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.820
<v Speaker 1>real thought of security.

00:05:09.205 --> 00:05:09.845
<v Speaker 1>Okay?

00:05:10.645 --> 00:05:13.765
<v Speaker 1>And and this not this this doesn't mean

00:05:13.765 --> 00:05:16.725
<v Speaker 1>that that Kubernetes is secured by itself, okay,

00:05:16.725 --> 00:05:19.125
<v Speaker 1>because there is nothing which is secured by

00:05:19.125 --> 00:05:19.925
<v Speaker 1>itself today.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.640
<v Speaker 1>But but I really do think that many

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.120
<v Speaker 1>things, okay, for many years, okay, which, you

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.840
<v Speaker 1>know, we've been laughing at different

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.600
<v Speaker 1>technologies.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Web servers, CGI bins, if you remember,

00:05:34.595 --> 00:05:37.075
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that. Okay. That's how funny

00:05:37.075 --> 00:05:40.035
<v Speaker 1>was that how they didn't thought of security

00:05:40.675 --> 00:05:42.995
<v Speaker 1>from the beginning or not just from the

00:05:42.995 --> 00:05:44.435
<v Speaker 1>beginning, in the middle either.

00:05:45.475 --> 00:05:48.275
<v Speaker 1>But but in Kubernetes, they really gave it

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.680
<v Speaker 1>serious thought and many things are in there.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.480
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't mean that everything is fine,

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.440
<v Speaker 1>but this is really good. I mean, it's

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.920
<v Speaker 1>it's really great to work with Kubernetes because

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.840
<v Speaker 1>you feel that really the thought is there

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.360
<v Speaker 1>and and the good start is there.

00:06:03.545 --> 00:06:05.625
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Definitely. 100%.

00:06:05.625 --> 00:06:07.705
<v Speaker 0>I think, you know, when people talk to

00:06:07.705 --> 00:06:10.505
<v Speaker 0>me, they're making typically, they're migrating to Kubernetes,

00:06:10.505 --> 00:06:12.185
<v Speaker 0>and they're doing that with security is one

00:06:12.185 --> 00:06:13.625
<v Speaker 0>of those tenants that they really hope to

00:06:13.625 --> 00:06:15.545
<v Speaker 0>get because, hey, it's it's in a container.

00:06:15.545 --> 00:06:17.520
<v Speaker 0>Right? Like, what bad things can happen And

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.160
<v Speaker 0>I schedule everything in containers. But as with

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.720
<v Speaker 0>all tools, every tool in the world is

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.480
<v Speaker 0>that it's easy to go down a path

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.040
<v Speaker 0>of misconfiguration and breaking stuff, or even just

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.280
<v Speaker 0>done right ignoring best practices and going into

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.155
<v Speaker 0>the security context and going wild on it,

00:06:31.155 --> 00:06:33.155
<v Speaker 0>right? Like, it all comes down to individual

00:06:33.155 --> 00:06:33.715
<v Speaker 0>users. And

00:06:34.115 --> 00:06:35.795
<v Speaker 0>I think that's why I'm really excited to

00:06:35.795 --> 00:06:37.955
<v Speaker 0>kind of introduce people to Kubescape today because

00:06:37.955 --> 00:06:39.315
<v Speaker 0>it's going to bring a lot of these

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:42.275
<v Speaker 0>misconfigurations and bad practices front and center and

00:06:42.275 --> 00:06:43.315
<v Speaker 0>show people like,

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.280
<v Speaker 0>maybe you need to look at why you're

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.880
<v Speaker 0>doing this and maybe there's a better way

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.080
<v Speaker 0>to it. So can you I've said Kubescape,

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.200
<v Speaker 0>like, three times now, so we might as

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.480
<v Speaker 0>well tell people what it is. Could you

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.560
<v Speaker 0>give us the the description of what is

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.600
<v Speaker 0>Kubescape, please?

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.600
<v Speaker 1>So Kubescape

00:06:58.945 --> 00:07:01.425
<v Speaker 1>is our open source project. Okay? We've

00:07:01.825 --> 00:07:04.305
<v Speaker 1>we started, like, in the last summer,

00:07:05.025 --> 00:07:05.745
<v Speaker 1>which is

00:07:06.385 --> 00:07:08.705
<v Speaker 1>a tool scanning your cluster

00:07:09.265 --> 00:07:11.345
<v Speaker 1>against misconfigurations

00:07:11.345 --> 00:07:13.425
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning. And and

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:15.800
<v Speaker 1>not just saying in the beginning, okay, because

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.400
<v Speaker 1>we have a long way to go and

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.560
<v Speaker 1>we have many exciting things going on.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.480
<v Speaker 1>But the really, really basic is checking your

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.000
<v Speaker 1>cluster and checking your YAML files and Helm

00:07:28.225 --> 00:07:29.905
<v Speaker 1>charts before deployment,

00:07:30.385 --> 00:07:31.985
<v Speaker 1>checking them against

00:07:31.985 --> 00:07:35.185
<v Speaker 1>the best practices security best practices. And we've

00:07:35.265 --> 00:07:38.065
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned NSA and and really NSA was

00:07:38.065 --> 00:07:38.945
<v Speaker 1>was

00:07:39.185 --> 00:07:41.425
<v Speaker 1>a really good starting point for us. Okay?

00:07:41.425 --> 00:07:41.665
<v Speaker 1>Because,

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.280
<v Speaker 1>you know, NSA CISA

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.639
<v Speaker 1>framework

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:49.479
<v Speaker 1>was released somewhere in August, I think,

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.120
<v Speaker 1>where actually, you know, NSA,

00:07:52.919 --> 00:07:55.000
<v Speaker 1>you know, created this great document. Okay? It's

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.240
<v Speaker 1>telling people what is the what can be

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.565
<v Speaker 1>the problems with with the Kubernetes misconfigurations

00:08:00.565 --> 00:08:02.565
<v Speaker 1>and and, you know,

00:08:03.205 --> 00:08:06.885
<v Speaker 1>we created a a standard, okay, practical standard.

00:08:06.885 --> 00:08:09.045
<v Speaker 1>And and I'm telling practical because

00:08:09.285 --> 00:08:10.005
<v Speaker 1>because

00:08:10.245 --> 00:08:11.925
<v Speaker 1>many of you might know that there are

00:08:11.925 --> 00:08:14.670
<v Speaker 1>many other p standards like PCI,

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.950
<v Speaker 1>SOC two, and stuff like that, are giving

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:21.390
<v Speaker 1>you very, very high level, you know, ideas,

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.950
<v Speaker 1>okay, of what should be the goal, but

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:26.270
<v Speaker 1>doesn't give, you know for us engineers,

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:27.470
<v Speaker 1>they they don't really give,

00:08:28.705 --> 00:08:29.505
<v Speaker 1>you know,

00:08:30.705 --> 00:08:33.424
<v Speaker 1>explicit, you know, instructions what to actually do

00:08:33.424 --> 00:08:36.304
<v Speaker 1>with it. And NSA, I think they took

00:08:36.304 --> 00:08:38.544
<v Speaker 1>this to the next level because they actually

00:08:38.544 --> 00:08:39.745
<v Speaker 1>told you things like,

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.280
<v Speaker 1>guys,

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.000
<v Speaker 1>okay,

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.120
<v Speaker 1>encrypt

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.320
<v Speaker 1>your etcd,

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.240
<v Speaker 1>okay, which is, you know, it's something that

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.080
<v Speaker 1>the engineer can do with it. Okay? So

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.120
<v Speaker 1>and and we created

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.920
<v Speaker 1>Kubescape around this framework.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.155
<v Speaker 1>And, literally, we sold, you know, the very

00:08:59.035 --> 00:09:01.675
<v Speaker 1>very big early success came with it, and

00:09:01.675 --> 00:09:04.875
<v Speaker 1>we added more more frameworks around the cubescape

00:09:04.875 --> 00:09:05.755
<v Speaker 1>ever since.

00:09:06.555 --> 00:09:09.195
<v Speaker 1>And and it's really we got

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.360
<v Speaker 1>I cannot, you know, emphasis it enough. We

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.960
<v Speaker 1>got a huge love back,

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.279
<v Speaker 1>okay, from the from the community.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.640
<v Speaker 1>And

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.760
<v Speaker 1>and we really got awesome feedback, okay, on

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.800
<v Speaker 1>on how people are using this tool and

00:09:23.915 --> 00:09:26.235
<v Speaker 1>how they it helps them to find their

00:09:26.235 --> 00:09:27.515
<v Speaker 1>security issues

00:09:27.675 --> 00:09:30.235
<v Speaker 1>even, you know, before, but also within the

00:09:30.235 --> 00:09:30.955
<v Speaker 1>cluster,

00:09:31.995 --> 00:09:34.235
<v Speaker 1>and how this can the this improves their

00:09:34.235 --> 00:09:35.515
<v Speaker 1>security posture.

00:09:36.395 --> 00:09:36.955
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:09:37.779 --> 00:09:38.740
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.420
<v Speaker 0>I I I can understand

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.420
<v Speaker 0>why there's a lot of love for Kubescape.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.020
<v Speaker 0>Haven't been playing with it and poking at

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.779
<v Speaker 0>it over the last kinda couple of weeks.

00:09:45.779 --> 00:09:48.180
<v Speaker 0>Like, I'm really excited to dive into it

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.779
<v Speaker 0>more and and share that with everybody. So

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:50.420
<v Speaker 0>yeah. Definitely.

00:09:51.315 --> 00:09:54.115
<v Speaker 0>We do have our first question from Mozz.

00:09:54.355 --> 00:09:55.715
<v Speaker 0>So, if you are watching us live, we

00:09:55.715 --> 00:09:57.475
<v Speaker 0>do encourage questions. Please get them into the

00:09:57.475 --> 00:09:58.915
<v Speaker 0>chat, we'll do our best to answer them.

00:09:59.155 --> 00:10:01.635
<v Speaker 0>Mozz, your question is very generic and I'll

00:10:01.635 --> 00:10:03.395
<v Speaker 0>give Ben the opportunity to answer it. But

00:10:03.395 --> 00:10:06.115
<v Speaker 0>if you want to, you know, follow-up with

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:07.570
<v Speaker 0>maybe a few more specifics about what your

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:09.410
<v Speaker 0>friends are struggling with, that would be great.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:11.890
<v Speaker 0>But most does ask, many of my cybersecurity

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:14.370
<v Speaker 0>friends are struggling to adopt Kubernetes and cloud

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.610
<v Speaker 0>native. Do you have any advice for them?

00:10:18.894 --> 00:10:21.214
<v Speaker 1>Wow. That that is great. I waved net

00:10:21.214 --> 00:10:23.214
<v Speaker 0>there. But Yeah. Yeah.

00:10:23.454 --> 00:10:24.735
<v Speaker 1>So I

00:10:25.615 --> 00:10:27.135
<v Speaker 1>I think I understand

00:10:27.694 --> 00:10:30.334
<v Speaker 1>where most is coming from, and and this

00:10:30.334 --> 00:10:32.540
<v Speaker 1>has been, I think, that that many

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.260
<v Speaker 1>of us see. Okay? And it it's it's

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.540
<v Speaker 1>really coming from

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.899
<v Speaker 1>the, you know, the big not just pressure,

00:10:39.899 --> 00:10:41.820
<v Speaker 1>but but the big scape of of, you

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:45.100
<v Speaker 1>know, landscape of of things today's cybersecurity

00:10:46.635 --> 00:10:48.475
<v Speaker 1>persona needs to look into

00:10:48.875 --> 00:10:51.035
<v Speaker 1>today. And, really, you know, once we had,

00:10:51.035 --> 00:10:51.755
<v Speaker 1>you know,

00:10:52.714 --> 00:10:55.195
<v Speaker 1>VMs and blades and, you know, we know

00:10:55.355 --> 00:10:57.834
<v Speaker 1>knew how to set up a firewall and

00:10:57.834 --> 00:10:59.435
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that, and and

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.940
<v Speaker 1>and these systems are still living. Okay? And

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:05.620
<v Speaker 1>and security person needs to really go into

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.420
<v Speaker 1>take more on himself and learn other things

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:11.140
<v Speaker 1>like cloud native not cloud. Okay. Not just

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.620
<v Speaker 1>cloud native, but cloud cloud native, and then

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:14.260
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes.

00:11:15.194 --> 00:11:15.755
<v Speaker 1>And

00:11:16.235 --> 00:11:19.035
<v Speaker 1>and and I think that that really

00:11:19.595 --> 00:11:21.115
<v Speaker 1>there is no easy

00:11:21.274 --> 00:11:23.355
<v Speaker 1>solution. Okay? I think that the most of

00:11:23.355 --> 00:11:25.355
<v Speaker 1>cyber most cybersecurity

00:11:25.355 --> 00:11:25.834
<v Speaker 1>friends,

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure that we are great professionals,

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:31.510
<v Speaker 1>and and they have all the basics. And

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.230
<v Speaker 1>simply they have to take a few

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.110
<v Speaker 1>you know, take their time and learn it.

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:38.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay? And and

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:41.029
<v Speaker 1>this I think that especially Kubernetes and cloud

00:11:41.029 --> 00:11:41.430
<v Speaker 1>native,

00:11:41.855 --> 00:11:44.175
<v Speaker 1>they they have a wonderful community

00:11:44.654 --> 00:11:46.014
<v Speaker 1>with

00:11:46.735 --> 00:11:49.134
<v Speaker 1>with really people who are ready to answer

00:11:49.134 --> 00:11:50.014
<v Speaker 1>questions

00:11:50.334 --> 00:11:52.095
<v Speaker 1>and and many, many

00:11:52.975 --> 00:11:55.870
<v Speaker 1>places where you have resources and, you know,

00:11:56.029 --> 00:11:57.950
<v Speaker 1>you cannot cheat it. You have to dive

00:11:57.950 --> 00:11:58.589
<v Speaker 1>in

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:01.709
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. To death. Yeah. That's I think that's

00:12:01.709 --> 00:12:03.470
<v Speaker 0>probably one of the most important things, I

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:05.070
<v Speaker 0>think. Like, when you're talking about,

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:07.630
<v Speaker 0>you know, most of them, they're struggling with

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:10.144
<v Speaker 0>this. Right? I mean, the wrong answer is

00:12:10.144 --> 00:12:11.264
<v Speaker 0>to go on your own and try and

00:12:11.264 --> 00:12:13.024
<v Speaker 0>do something bespoke because you think it's safer

00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:15.665
<v Speaker 0>and secure. Like, herd mentality here is really

00:12:15.665 --> 00:12:18.625
<v Speaker 0>important. We have so many active organizations

00:12:18.625 --> 00:12:21.504
<v Speaker 0>and people promoting best practices in the cloud

00:12:21.504 --> 00:12:23.264
<v Speaker 0>data space that you want to go on

00:12:23.264 --> 00:12:25.320
<v Speaker 0>with them and standing on the shoulders of

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.160
<v Speaker 0>everyone else that's doing the hard work upfront.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.920
<v Speaker 0>And I think we're in a really exciting

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.360
<v Speaker 0>time now in the cloud data space where

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.600
<v Speaker 0>there has been a big push on security.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.000
<v Speaker 0>You know, we've got Armorsec pushing Kubescape, we've

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.240
<v Speaker 0>got chain guard doing all the image signing

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.865
<v Speaker 0>stuff with cosign. Like, we're never been in

00:12:39.865 --> 00:12:42.745
<v Speaker 0>such a fortunate position. I mean, you think

00:12:42.745 --> 00:12:45.305
<v Speaker 0>back to Kubernetes in 2037,

00:12:45.305 --> 00:12:47.545
<v Speaker 0>'20 '18, like, wow, that was that was

00:12:47.545 --> 00:12:48.265
<v Speaker 0>scary.

00:12:48.425 --> 00:12:50.425
<v Speaker 0>Where we are now, I think people should

00:12:50.425 --> 00:12:52.740
<v Speaker 0>be excited, hopefully. I I I feel that

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:53.460
<v Speaker 0>should

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:54.340
<v Speaker 0>be excited.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's completely and and and I think

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.540
<v Speaker 1>and really, you know, just just there there

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.380
<v Speaker 1>is something okay, I want to mention something

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.980
<v Speaker 1>that came into my mind just, you know,

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.420
<v Speaker 1>after my answer. That

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.855
<v Speaker 1>yeah. But but because because if you take

00:13:08.015 --> 00:13:09.055
<v Speaker 1>if you, you know,

00:13:09.775 --> 00:13:12.015
<v Speaker 1>think about, you know, all the progress we

00:13:12.015 --> 00:13:14.015
<v Speaker 1>made, okay, in the in the last, you

00:13:14.015 --> 00:13:14.495
<v Speaker 1>know,

00:13:14.895 --> 00:13:17.855
<v Speaker 1>five to ten years. Okay? And the call

00:13:17.935 --> 00:13:20.575
<v Speaker 1>then the whole adoption of infrastructure as a

00:13:20.575 --> 00:13:21.295
<v Speaker 1>code. Okay?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.639
<v Speaker 1>I think that that there is

00:13:25.199 --> 00:13:28.639
<v Speaker 1>really a new mindset, okay, for security personals.

00:13:28.639 --> 00:13:31.680
<v Speaker 1>Okay? They have to adopt. Okay? Because,

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:36.115
<v Speaker 1>you know, the secrets in Kubernetes are not

00:13:36.115 --> 00:13:38.755
<v Speaker 1>coming from, you know, I don't know, from

00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:40.995
<v Speaker 1>just from the air. Okay? They are coming

00:13:40.995 --> 00:13:42.995
<v Speaker 1>from a Git repo. They are coming from

00:13:42.995 --> 00:13:43.714
<v Speaker 1>from

00:13:44.355 --> 00:13:46.115
<v Speaker 1>a script, okay, which is,

00:13:46.514 --> 00:13:49.320
<v Speaker 1>you know, which is stored in some some

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.880
<v Speaker 1>kind of a bucket. Okay? Either it's the

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.440
<v Speaker 1>kit or or or something else. And

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.080
<v Speaker 1>and and this is not the time where

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.320
<v Speaker 1>where we went through with our USB, you

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.280
<v Speaker 1>know, drives and and started to distribute keys

00:14:02.405 --> 00:14:03.685
<v Speaker 1>in the blades.

00:14:04.005 --> 00:14:04.565
<v Speaker 1>So,

00:14:05.365 --> 00:14:07.525
<v Speaker 1>yeah, this is also a change of mindset,

00:14:07.525 --> 00:14:09.285
<v Speaker 1>not just, you know, technicality.

00:14:09.605 --> 00:14:10.885
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. 100%.

00:14:10.885 --> 00:14:12.325
<v Speaker 0>I sometimes look back at some of the

00:14:12.325 --> 00:14:13.925
<v Speaker 0>things I used to do to distribute keys

00:14:13.925 --> 00:14:16.005
<v Speaker 0>and secrets and I'm just absolutely ashamed.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:17.380
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.060
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Thank you.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.380
<v Speaker 0>So thank you for that question, boss.

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:23.780
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully, that helps. If you have anything more

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.700
<v Speaker 0>specific, please drop it into the chat.

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:27.940
<v Speaker 0>And we have a hey from Joshua. Hey,

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.300
<v Speaker 0>Joshua. Thank you for joining us.

00:14:30.105 --> 00:14:32.505
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Ben, you're gonna guide us through a

00:14:32.505 --> 00:14:35.065
<v Speaker 0>look at Kubescape today. So if you can

00:14:35.065 --> 00:14:37.465
<v Speaker 0>get your screen share ready, we'll pop over

00:14:37.465 --> 00:14:39.225
<v Speaker 0>there and then we'll show the audience how

00:14:39.225 --> 00:14:40.345
<v Speaker 0>cool this is. Okay.

00:14:41.065 --> 00:14:42.665
<v Speaker 1>Wait a second. I'm just

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.360
<v Speaker 1>also, I need my technical

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.079
<v Speaker 1>half minute here. Yeah. Take all the time

00:14:48.079 --> 00:14:49.920
<v Speaker 0>you need. No rush. Yeah.

00:14:50.959 --> 00:14:52.800
<v Speaker 1>So so

00:14:59.655 --> 00:15:01.575
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you see my screen.

00:15:01.575 --> 00:15:03.495
<v Speaker 0>Let me pull that up now.

00:15:04.935 --> 00:15:05.975
<v Speaker 0>We can.

00:15:06.215 --> 00:15:09.575
<v Speaker 0>We see a terminal, and you're typing. Awesome.

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:11.490
<v Speaker 1>So yeah, so we are in terminal. I

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:12.930
<v Speaker 1>think this is the best place we can

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:14.210
<v Speaker 1>be. Okay.

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:18.130
<v Speaker 1>So I just wanted to, you know, really

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:20.290
<v Speaker 1>to give you an intro for those who

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:21.730
<v Speaker 1>care about cubescape

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:24.209
<v Speaker 1>who haven't heard or or you're newbies

00:15:26.085 --> 00:15:28.565
<v Speaker 1>for us. So, again, you can find us

00:15:28.565 --> 00:15:31.285
<v Speaker 1>in GitHub or most of cubescape.

00:15:32.725 --> 00:15:34.245
<v Speaker 1>You can see here our project.

00:15:35.205 --> 00:15:35.525
<v Speaker 1>Now

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:41.370
<v Speaker 1>within Project OKA, as I told you, the

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:44.250
<v Speaker 1>simplest, you know, to start with Kubescape is

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.810
<v Speaker 1>is simply installing our CLI tool. So our

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:49.770
<v Speaker 1>CLI Kubescape is, like, is, by default, package

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:52.250
<v Speaker 1>is a CLI tool. And what it does

00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:53.255
<v Speaker 1>is

00:15:53.575 --> 00:15:57.255
<v Speaker 1>it scans your either your your your cluster

00:15:57.415 --> 00:16:00.535
<v Speaker 1>or your YAML files or Helm charts and

00:16:00.855 --> 00:16:03.575
<v Speaker 1>looks for security issues within. So

00:16:04.215 --> 00:16:07.550
<v Speaker 1>we talked about before that that

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:11.310
<v Speaker 1>that we came from the world of what

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:12.830
<v Speaker 1>we of NSA.

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:15.150
<v Speaker 1>So what I meant by this is that

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:17.950
<v Speaker 1>we call we are organizing our what we

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:18.750
<v Speaker 1>call controls,

00:16:18.995 --> 00:16:21.394
<v Speaker 1>which are some something like tests.

00:16:22.115 --> 00:16:24.915
<v Speaker 1>We are organizing them into frameworks. Okay? So

00:16:24.915 --> 00:16:26.675
<v Speaker 1>think about it as groups. Okay? And and

00:16:26.675 --> 00:16:28.435
<v Speaker 1>we have this NSA framework

00:16:28.435 --> 00:16:29.235
<v Speaker 1>containing

00:16:29.875 --> 00:16:32.195
<v Speaker 1>multiple tests or controls as well.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.400
<v Speaker 1>But we have other different frameworks

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.840
<v Speaker 1>like we have the Microsoft Mitra framework

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.280
<v Speaker 1>which is another

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:42.920
<v Speaker 1>another

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.055
<v Speaker 1>approach, okay, other set of of tests

00:16:46.535 --> 00:16:49.175
<v Speaker 1>which was prepared from this every security research

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:50.855
<v Speaker 1>team of Microsoft

00:16:51.175 --> 00:16:51.975
<v Speaker 1>and

00:16:52.455 --> 00:16:53.975
<v Speaker 1>and other sets

00:16:54.695 --> 00:16:56.535
<v Speaker 1>which I will show you later.

00:16:56.775 --> 00:16:58.455
<v Speaker 1>And what you can do is simply, you

00:16:58.455 --> 00:17:00.855
<v Speaker 1>know, download Kubescape with a single liner here.

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:05.150
<v Speaker 1>You can copy paste just as you saw

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:06.749
<v Speaker 1>it before

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:07.789
<v Speaker 1>and

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:10.910
<v Speaker 1>and, you know, install it. So right now,

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:12.509
<v Speaker 1>okay, we have more than

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:16.744
<v Speaker 1>one kind of of application packaging of Kubescape.

00:17:18.185 --> 00:17:20.185
<v Speaker 1>One is what you saw right now, the

00:17:20.185 --> 00:17:22.425
<v Speaker 1>CLI tool. And later, I will if we'll

00:17:22.425 --> 00:17:23.144
<v Speaker 1>have time,

00:17:23.464 --> 00:17:25.545
<v Speaker 1>I will show also that we can install

00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:26.744
<v Speaker 1>it as a cluster component.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.280
<v Speaker 1>But the simplest thing, okay, you can do

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.240
<v Speaker 1>with Kubescape is simply write cubescape

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.159
<v Speaker 1>scan.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.280
<v Speaker 1>Okay. And then what cubescape does is it

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.159
<v Speaker 1>connects

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.775
<v Speaker 1>the cube API from the current context, which

00:17:44.775 --> 00:17:45.735
<v Speaker 1>is configured,

00:17:46.135 --> 00:17:49.254
<v Speaker 1>and simply looks into your your configurations,

00:17:49.255 --> 00:17:50.774
<v Speaker 1>your Kubernetes object,

00:17:51.255 --> 00:17:54.934
<v Speaker 1>and and test them against different tests. So

00:17:55.975 --> 00:17:57.495
<v Speaker 1>in this case, okay, if you this is

00:17:57.495 --> 00:17:58.215
<v Speaker 1>what it took

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:00.840
<v Speaker 1>to run the whole test. It was it

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.360
<v Speaker 1>was, you know you can see that it

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.559
<v Speaker 1>was less than a minute.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.879
<v Speaker 1>And you can see a list of of

00:18:06.039 --> 00:18:08.039
<v Speaker 1>different tests we've ran

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:09.639
<v Speaker 1>here,

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.279
<v Speaker 1>which we again, what we call test is

00:18:12.279 --> 00:18:15.145
<v Speaker 1>in our language is called controls.

00:18:15.465 --> 00:18:18.905
<v Speaker 1>And for example okay. I can bring

00:18:19.705 --> 00:18:22.665
<v Speaker 1>for example, here one test called container host

00:18:22.665 --> 00:18:23.305
<v Speaker 1>port.

00:18:23.865 --> 00:18:26.665
<v Speaker 1>So I'm telling you right now that container

00:18:26.665 --> 00:18:29.545
<v Speaker 1>host port is

00:18:28.649 --> 00:18:30.809
<v Speaker 1>a a control which checks whether,

00:18:31.129 --> 00:18:32.809
<v Speaker 1>the host port was defined

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:34.409
<v Speaker 1>for

00:18:34.809 --> 00:18:36.490
<v Speaker 1>for a given deployment

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:37.529
<v Speaker 1>or workload.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:39.289
<v Speaker 1>And you can see that there is a

00:18:39.289 --> 00:18:41.129
<v Speaker 1>single resource which failed this,

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:42.730
<v Speaker 1>this best practice

00:18:43.315 --> 00:18:44.275
<v Speaker 1>out of

00:18:44.595 --> 00:18:45.475
<v Speaker 1>19.

00:18:46.275 --> 00:18:49.155
<v Speaker 1>And based on these results, okay, we are

00:18:49.155 --> 00:18:50.035
<v Speaker 1>we are

00:18:50.355 --> 00:18:50.995
<v Speaker 1>computing,

00:18:52.195 --> 00:18:54.355
<v Speaker 1>you know, an aggregated risk score

00:18:54.675 --> 00:18:57.470
<v Speaker 1>of your cluster, which in my case, I

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:58.830
<v Speaker 1>just installed

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:03.070
<v Speaker 1>a Minikube here with with

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:05.709
<v Speaker 1>with the Hipster shop application

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:09.630
<v Speaker 1>where I developed and made some, you know,

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:10.349
<v Speaker 1>security

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:11.549
<v Speaker 1>big no nos

00:19:12.055 --> 00:19:13.575
<v Speaker 1>order to be able to show you some

00:19:13.575 --> 00:19:15.335
<v Speaker 1>of the good things. But just going back

00:19:15.335 --> 00:19:16.775
<v Speaker 1>to the what is the output of the

00:19:16.775 --> 00:19:17.815
<v Speaker 1>CLI is

00:19:18.615 --> 00:19:21.174
<v Speaker 1>so, for example, there is another control called,

00:19:21.415 --> 00:19:23.815
<v Speaker 1>writable host pass mount. Okay? So it means

00:19:23.815 --> 00:19:25.529
<v Speaker 1>that it is a it is really bad

00:19:25.529 --> 00:19:28.409
<v Speaker 1>practice from a security perspective to to mount

00:19:28.409 --> 00:19:30.730
<v Speaker 1>host pass and and and also not just

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:32.169
<v Speaker 1>to mount host, but even

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:35.049
<v Speaker 1>to enable writing to that host path.

00:19:35.289 --> 00:19:36.570
<v Speaker 1>So in this case,

00:19:37.529 --> 00:19:38.730
<v Speaker 1>we found, you know,

00:19:40.115 --> 00:19:41.315
<v Speaker 1>four workloads.

00:19:41.875 --> 00:19:44.674
<v Speaker 1>Like, we found Kubescape proxy uses

00:19:45.475 --> 00:19:48.595
<v Speaker 1>host pass now. Okay. We see that ETC

00:19:48.595 --> 00:19:52.115
<v Speaker 1>is using it, Kubescape controller manager, and storage

00:19:52.115 --> 00:19:53.875
<v Speaker 1>provisioner. So it's it's

00:19:54.515 --> 00:19:56.810
<v Speaker 1>you're asking yourself, like, That's a little bit

00:19:56.810 --> 00:20:00.250
<v Speaker 1>strange. Okay? Because these are these are Kubernetes

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:01.050
<v Speaker 1>components.

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:04.730
<v Speaker 1>Okay? And why I'm complaining why Kubescape is

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:06.730
<v Speaker 1>complaining about Kubernetes components.

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:09.850
<v Speaker 1>And it's a it this is a, you

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:11.290
<v Speaker 1>know, this is an approach we took at

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:12.815
<v Speaker 1>the beginning. Okay? Because,

00:20:14.575 --> 00:20:16.414
<v Speaker 1>you know, sometimes in security,

00:20:16.575 --> 00:20:18.015
<v Speaker 1>okay, I think best

00:20:18.415 --> 00:20:21.135
<v Speaker 1>approach is not to hide things, okay, even

00:20:21.135 --> 00:20:24.015
<v Speaker 1>though they are related to the system you're

00:20:24.015 --> 00:20:26.559
<v Speaker 1>working in. So in the in our case,

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:28.159
<v Speaker 1>really, the Kubescape proxy

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.919
<v Speaker 1>requires a host path to be, mounted. Okay?

00:20:31.919 --> 00:20:32.720
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:33.760
<v Speaker 1>in Minikube,

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:34.799
<v Speaker 1>it will work.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.039
<v Speaker 1>Okay? But on the other hand, the control

00:20:37.039 --> 00:20:39.395
<v Speaker 1>needs to list it, okay, because still this

00:20:39.395 --> 00:20:41.475
<v Speaker 1>is this can be in some

00:20:43.794 --> 00:20:46.835
<v Speaker 1>in some context, they this can become an

00:20:46.835 --> 00:20:49.875
<v Speaker 1>attack vector. Okay? A theoretical attack vector. Therefore,

00:20:49.875 --> 00:20:51.794
<v Speaker 1>we are listing it. The the we'll talk

00:20:51.794 --> 00:20:53.635
<v Speaker 1>about a little bit later what we are

00:20:53.635 --> 00:20:55.850
<v Speaker 1>going to do with it. Okay? Because in

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:57.929
<v Speaker 1>Kubescape, it's very important for not just to

00:20:57.929 --> 00:21:00.570
<v Speaker 1>show you, you know, to drive results,

00:21:01.049 --> 00:21:03.130
<v Speaker 1>but also to to help you to work

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:05.289
<v Speaker 1>with them and work your solve your issues.

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:08.245
<v Speaker 1>So we'll get back to it, but I'm

00:21:08.245 --> 00:21:10.005
<v Speaker 1>looking here back to

00:21:10.165 --> 00:21:10.885
<v Speaker 1>other

00:21:12.245 --> 00:21:15.365
<v Speaker 1>other controls, other tests we've we've run here.

00:21:15.685 --> 00:21:17.605
<v Speaker 1>I want to bring you, you know, something

00:21:17.605 --> 00:21:20.005
<v Speaker 1>more interesting. Look. So we have this control

00:21:20.005 --> 00:21:20.565
<v Speaker 1>called

00:21:20.809 --> 00:21:22.809
<v Speaker 1>privileged container, okay, which is one of the

00:21:22.809 --> 00:21:24.490
<v Speaker 1>most basic checks, you know, in the

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:27.690
<v Speaker 1>I think some of you already smiling,

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:29.370
<v Speaker 1>I feel,

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:31.530
<v Speaker 1>here because this is one of the most

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:34.250
<v Speaker 1>basic tests, okay, on any security posture tool,

00:21:34.365 --> 00:21:36.684
<v Speaker 1>okay, checking whether you have privileged containers or

00:21:36.684 --> 00:21:37.965
<v Speaker 1>not in your environment.

00:21:38.365 --> 00:21:40.365
<v Speaker 1>So in this case, you can see that

00:21:40.684 --> 00:21:43.565
<v Speaker 1>that, there is a deployment in the Hipster

00:21:43.565 --> 00:21:44.684
<v Speaker 1>Shop namespace

00:21:44.684 --> 00:21:46.524
<v Speaker 1>called recommendation service,

00:21:46.845 --> 00:21:48.990
<v Speaker 1>which, again, for for the sake of, you

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:51.390
<v Speaker 1>know, demonstrating the capabilities, okay, I've made it

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:51.950
<v Speaker 1>to

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:54.350
<v Speaker 1>a privileged container.

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Any questions? Just

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:01.755
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. David, do you want to answer? Yeah.

00:22:01.755 --> 00:22:03.675
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. We have one question on the chat,

00:22:03.675 --> 00:22:05.035
<v Speaker 0>but I'm gonna be selfish and ask my

00:22:05.035 --> 00:22:06.155
<v Speaker 0>own question first.

00:22:07.755 --> 00:22:09.035
<v Speaker 0>If you just go back down to your

00:22:09.035 --> 00:22:11.275
<v Speaker 0>table, you listed you present a bunch of

00:22:11.275 --> 00:22:13.595
<v Speaker 0>risk percentage scores, and I was curious if

00:22:13.595 --> 00:22:14.715
<v Speaker 0>you could help us interpret those.

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:19.010
<v Speaker 1>Sorry? About what? So it says, like, we

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:20.690
<v Speaker 0>have a risk score on the table of

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:22.690
<v Speaker 0>a % skipped 94,

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:24.210
<v Speaker 0>and does I don't know if those correlate

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:25.890
<v Speaker 0>to the framework risks, which seem to be

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:27.330
<v Speaker 0>in yellow above it. So so

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:29.010
<v Speaker 1>yeah. Okay.

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:30.495
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So

00:22:30.655 --> 00:22:32.895
<v Speaker 1>very good question. So we have

00:22:35.215 --> 00:22:38.495
<v Speaker 1>and we have a a very differentiated risk

00:22:38.495 --> 00:22:40.575
<v Speaker 1>score calculation. Okay? So we what you see

00:22:40.575 --> 00:22:43.520
<v Speaker 1>here, the risk score here means, actually, you

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.320
<v Speaker 1>know, the the the percent of of failed

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.080
<v Speaker 1>resources on a given

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.400
<v Speaker 1>test. Okay? So in this case, you have

00:22:50.559 --> 00:22:53.120
<v Speaker 1>you see that access container service account. Okay.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.040
<v Speaker 1>This means that the the container has access

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.559
<v Speaker 1>to the service account token.

00:22:57.184 --> 00:23:00.304
<v Speaker 1>Out of 41 workloads, 41 of them has

00:23:00.304 --> 00:23:03.505
<v Speaker 1>access to the service account token. Okay? This

00:23:03.505 --> 00:23:05.025
<v Speaker 1>means that %

00:23:05.025 --> 00:23:06.705
<v Speaker 1>have failed. Okay?

00:23:06.945 --> 00:23:10.545
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. But for, for example, let's take something

00:23:10.545 --> 00:23:12.465
<v Speaker 1>with zero

00:23:12.465 --> 00:23:13.909
<v Speaker 1>and interesting

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:15.029
<v Speaker 1>enough

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.870
<v Speaker 1>here.

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:18.630
<v Speaker 1>I think that in this case, the access

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:20.950
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes dashboard is not really interesting

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:23.190
<v Speaker 1>from our point of view because we don't

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:24.549
<v Speaker 1>have Kubernetes dashboard.

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:27.350
<v Speaker 1>But, for example, both in default namespaces.

00:23:27.605 --> 00:23:29.605
<v Speaker 1>Great. So in general, okay, this is

00:23:31.205 --> 00:23:33.765
<v Speaker 1>best practice not to put pods in the

00:23:33.765 --> 00:23:34.965
<v Speaker 1>default namespace.

00:23:35.365 --> 00:23:37.285
<v Speaker 1>And as, you know, as of all the

00:23:37.285 --> 00:23:39.445
<v Speaker 1>pods in my cluster, okay, none of them

00:23:39.445 --> 00:23:39.845
<v Speaker 1>are

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.599
<v Speaker 1>in the default

00:23:41.679 --> 00:23:43.919
<v Speaker 1>names. Therefore, there is a risk of zero

00:23:43.919 --> 00:23:44.559
<v Speaker 1>here.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.799
<v Speaker 1>And the correlation,

00:23:48.799 --> 00:23:52.080
<v Speaker 1>okay, with this framework risk, okay, which you

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.600
<v Speaker 1>can see that you can see here, I

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.240
<v Speaker 1>have

00:23:55.375 --> 00:23:57.375
<v Speaker 1>third 34

00:23:57.535 --> 00:23:59.055
<v Speaker 1>dot 97%

00:23:59.055 --> 00:24:00.495
<v Speaker 1>risk score of NSA.

00:24:00.815 --> 00:24:02.655
<v Speaker 1>So it's a little bit more complex. It's

00:24:02.655 --> 00:24:05.295
<v Speaker 1>not just a simple percent, Jeff, of the

00:24:05.295 --> 00:24:06.735
<v Speaker 1>calculation. Okay? Because

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:10.370
<v Speaker 1>I would be happy, by the way, to

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:11.650
<v Speaker 1>point you to documentation,

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:13.330
<v Speaker 1>but we don't have it here about this

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:15.970
<v Speaker 1>calculation method. But I will try to explain

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:16.929
<v Speaker 1>you and

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:19.490
<v Speaker 1>prevent you from going into the code and

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:21.570
<v Speaker 1>reading it yourself. But the idea is is

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:23.169
<v Speaker 1>as following. Okay? So

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:26.245
<v Speaker 1>we are trying to calculate risk. Okay?

00:24:26.965 --> 00:24:27.685
<v Speaker 1>Accumulative

00:24:27.845 --> 00:24:30.645
<v Speaker 1>aggregated risk for the whole, for framework, for

00:24:30.645 --> 00:24:31.684
<v Speaker 1>whole cluster

00:24:32.005 --> 00:24:35.365
<v Speaker 1>based on what is the first potential outcome.

00:24:35.365 --> 00:24:36.485
<v Speaker 1>Okay? So, for example,

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:40.350
<v Speaker 1>if you have, like, control a and b

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:44.110
<v Speaker 1>and and you have five resources for each,

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:45.870
<v Speaker 1>so we are creating

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:49.070
<v Speaker 1>a a hundred a score of % in

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:51.470
<v Speaker 1>case that every every resource

00:24:51.815 --> 00:24:53.095
<v Speaker 1>on every,

00:24:53.415 --> 00:24:54.934
<v Speaker 1>every of these controls

00:24:55.015 --> 00:24:56.855
<v Speaker 1>is, is failing

00:24:57.415 --> 00:24:58.374
<v Speaker 1>potentially.

00:24:58.375 --> 00:25:00.054
<v Speaker 1>Okay? And also adding,

00:25:00.295 --> 00:25:01.895
<v Speaker 1>you know, adding to the,

00:25:02.375 --> 00:25:05.450
<v Speaker 1>to the equation also the level of the

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:08.010
<v Speaker 1>given control, how the severity of of the

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:11.370
<v Speaker 1>given control. So, for example, privileged container has,

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:12.890
<v Speaker 1>relatively high,

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:14.169
<v Speaker 1>risk,

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:16.010
<v Speaker 1>okay, and high, severity.

00:25:16.505 --> 00:25:18.425
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand, I don't know

00:25:22.105 --> 00:25:24.425
<v Speaker 1>let's take okay. Cluster return networking has a

00:25:24.425 --> 00:25:25.065
<v Speaker 1>medium

00:25:25.625 --> 00:25:26.505
<v Speaker 1>severity.

00:25:26.505 --> 00:25:28.425
<v Speaker 1>So we are adding to the to the

00:25:28.425 --> 00:25:29.705
<v Speaker 1>calculation all these,

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:33.300
<v Speaker 1>you know, things and and creating this cumulative

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:34.179
<v Speaker 1>score.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.220
<v Speaker 1>Okay? And, again, we are taking the worst

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.220
<v Speaker 1>case based on your cluster

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:41.780
<v Speaker 1>if all the controls are failing on all

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:42.500
<v Speaker 1>the resources,

00:25:43.654 --> 00:25:45.335
<v Speaker 1>the the and this is the worst case

00:25:45.335 --> 00:25:46.135
<v Speaker 1>scenario.

00:25:46.135 --> 00:25:46.534
<v Speaker 1>So

00:25:47.015 --> 00:25:49.815
<v Speaker 1>related to this, where are you on this

00:25:49.815 --> 00:25:50.455
<v Speaker 1>scale?

00:25:51.095 --> 00:25:51.654
<v Speaker 1>And,

00:25:52.054 --> 00:25:53.094
<v Speaker 1>yeah, I hope

00:25:53.495 --> 00:25:55.815
<v Speaker 1>I hope I could explain it.

00:25:56.135 --> 00:25:57.815
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That definitely helps. Thank you very much.

00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:01.570
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Joshua's question from the chat.

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:05.410
<v Speaker 0>Joshua asked, is Kubescape able to run on

00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:08.690
<v Speaker 0>managed Kubernetes solutions like EKS and GKE? Because

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:11.294
<v Speaker 0>some other security tools won't or are not

00:26:11.294 --> 00:26:12.334
<v Speaker 0>able to run

00:26:12.654 --> 00:26:14.014
<v Speaker 0>since there's no,

00:26:14.495 --> 00:26:16.974
<v Speaker 0>I guess, unrestricted access to the control plane.

00:26:17.934 --> 00:26:19.054
<v Speaker 1>Yep. So

00:26:19.375 --> 00:26:20.254
<v Speaker 1>definitely.

00:26:20.335 --> 00:26:21.695
<v Speaker 1>So the answer is yes.

00:26:22.174 --> 00:26:24.654
<v Speaker 1>Kubescape as a CLI tool

00:26:25.135 --> 00:26:26.519
<v Speaker 1>is running today.

00:26:27.799 --> 00:26:29.239
<v Speaker 1>We we did some,

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.639
<v Speaker 1>you know, statistics on how many people are

00:26:31.639 --> 00:26:32.759
<v Speaker 1>running, and we are seeing

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.759
<v Speaker 1>some of the something like

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.000
<v Speaker 1>30 to 40,000

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.095
<v Speaker 1>run Kubescapes runs a week.

00:26:39.735 --> 00:26:40.295
<v Speaker 1>And

00:26:41.255 --> 00:26:43.095
<v Speaker 1>and and major

00:26:43.255 --> 00:26:43.735
<v Speaker 1>most

00:26:44.135 --> 00:26:47.495
<v Speaker 1>of those clusters are are managed Kubernetes clusters.

00:26:47.495 --> 00:26:48.775
<v Speaker 1>So they're like,

00:26:49.495 --> 00:26:52.230
<v Speaker 1>as it's all just said, EKS, GKE,

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:56.070
<v Speaker 1>AKS clusters and also OpenShift and and the

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:57.110
<v Speaker 1>DigitalOcean

00:26:57.910 --> 00:26:58.630
<v Speaker 1>clusters.

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Actually, Kubescape by default, it only uses the

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:04.950
<v Speaker 1>Kube API and from any anywhere where you

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:06.855
<v Speaker 1>have access to the Kube API. And and

00:27:06.855 --> 00:27:08.615
<v Speaker 1>right now, you know, I have in this

00:27:08.615 --> 00:27:10.775
<v Speaker 1>console, I have access to the Kube API,

00:27:10.775 --> 00:27:11.495
<v Speaker 1>and I have

00:27:13.175 --> 00:27:14.695
<v Speaker 1>I have the authentication

00:27:15.015 --> 00:27:15.895
<v Speaker 1>credentials to

00:27:16.615 --> 00:27:19.095
<v Speaker 1>if Kubescape can access the Kube API, it's

00:27:19.095 --> 00:27:21.169
<v Speaker 1>it's it can scan your cluster.

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:23.730
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Thank you.

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:25.890
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:27.730
<v Speaker 0>So go back to your demo.

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:29.409
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:31.970
<v Speaker 1>just, you know, I wanted to show you,

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:33.970
<v Speaker 1>and I hope that I have it here.

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:34.529
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:35.410
<v Speaker 1>So

00:27:35.715 --> 00:27:38.434
<v Speaker 1>I have this YAML file, okay, because which

00:27:38.434 --> 00:27:39.394
<v Speaker 1>is, you know, actually

00:27:40.434 --> 00:27:42.595
<v Speaker 1>I hope I have to w get here.

00:27:42.595 --> 00:27:43.955
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So

00:27:44.595 --> 00:27:46.195
<v Speaker 1>so what I wanted to show you that

00:27:46.195 --> 00:27:47.794
<v Speaker 1>just as I scanned,

00:27:47.794 --> 00:27:48.115
<v Speaker 1>you know,

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:50.309
<v Speaker 1>the cluster,

00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:52.789
<v Speaker 1>I can take my YAML file also. Okay?

00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:54.789
<v Speaker 1>Before I'm I'm deploying

00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:58.309
<v Speaker 1>before before

00:27:58.309 --> 00:28:00.789
<v Speaker 1>I'm deploying it to to the cluster,

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:04.230
<v Speaker 1>I can also scan it to not just

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:06.235
<v Speaker 1>the Kubescape API. So and it I think

00:28:06.235 --> 00:28:07.835
<v Speaker 1>it's it was a, you know, it was

00:28:07.835 --> 00:28:08.955
<v Speaker 1>a really important

00:28:09.915 --> 00:28:12.875
<v Speaker 1>decision for us, okay, from a way we've

00:28:12.875 --> 00:28:14.394
<v Speaker 1>designed this architecture,

00:28:14.395 --> 00:28:16.475
<v Speaker 1>okay, and the way we designed this whole

00:28:16.635 --> 00:28:17.835
<v Speaker 1>whole project

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.400
<v Speaker 1>to be to give an answer, not just

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.960
<v Speaker 1>actual deployment and monitoring

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:24.800
<v Speaker 1>a a a part of the things, but

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.280
<v Speaker 1>also what do you want to do beforehand,

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.040
<v Speaker 1>how do you want to prevent things, okay,

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.880
<v Speaker 1>going into your production.

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.554
<v Speaker 1>And, you know, I just run the scan

00:28:33.554 --> 00:28:34.914
<v Speaker 1>on the YAML file, and you can see

00:28:34.914 --> 00:28:37.315
<v Speaker 1>that I got the same table. Okay? So

00:28:37.315 --> 00:28:39.315
<v Speaker 1>some of the controls are skipped because they

00:28:39.315 --> 00:28:41.395
<v Speaker 1>are they are simply not relevant. They don't

00:28:41.395 --> 00:28:44.515
<v Speaker 1>have inputs to those things because the YAML

00:28:44.515 --> 00:28:46.195
<v Speaker 1>files doesn't doesn't

00:28:46.355 --> 00:28:48.195
<v Speaker 1>contain relevant

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.919
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes object.

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.480
<v Speaker 1>But, for example, I can already see, okay,

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.440
<v Speaker 1>that, again,

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.279
<v Speaker 1>that I have here a a component

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:58.879
<v Speaker 1>of workload

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.280
<v Speaker 1>which has host IPC

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.240
<v Speaker 1>privileges.

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.945
<v Speaker 1>Okay? And this means that one of the

00:29:03.945 --> 00:29:05.945
<v Speaker 1>workloads out of the 12 workloads which I

00:29:05.945 --> 00:29:08.585
<v Speaker 1>had this and in the CML file

00:29:08.904 --> 00:29:12.024
<v Speaker 1>is already failing here. Okay? So, for example,

00:29:12.024 --> 00:29:14.585
<v Speaker 1>if if I'm, you know for example, for

00:29:14.585 --> 00:29:15.544
<v Speaker 1>our production

00:29:16.745 --> 00:29:18.264
<v Speaker 1>our own production c

00:29:18.424 --> 00:29:20.610
<v Speaker 1>a c c d, k, we we already

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:23.170
<v Speaker 1>use Kubescape in the delivery pipes

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:26.610
<v Speaker 1>and already looking into the things before they

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:29.730
<v Speaker 1>get to the production environment

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:32.865
<v Speaker 1>and stopping pipes, okay, from delivering, you know,

00:29:32.865 --> 00:29:35.345
<v Speaker 1>problematic things like, in this case, this privileged

00:29:35.345 --> 00:29:37.745
<v Speaker 1>container. It is the very same privileged container

00:29:37.745 --> 00:29:40.545
<v Speaker 1>you saw before in the cluster itself.

00:29:40.865 --> 00:29:43.025
<v Speaker 1>So if you're thinking about, you know, a

00:29:42.865 --> 00:29:43.745
<v Speaker 1>a

00:29:44.225 --> 00:29:44.465
<v Speaker 1>a a

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:47.350
<v Speaker 1>development process and not just, you know, want

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:49.510
<v Speaker 1>to understand what you have right now in

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:50.470
<v Speaker 1>your cluster,

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:52.710
<v Speaker 1>okay, but you also want to add Kubescape

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:55.430
<v Speaker 1>into your whole work process, okay, you can

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:58.070
<v Speaker 1>use it. Okay. We've just this week, okay,

00:29:59.215 --> 00:30:01.935
<v Speaker 1>someone decided to write a GitHub action, okay,

00:30:01.935 --> 00:30:04.175
<v Speaker 1>based for Kubescape, and it's we'll we'll have

00:30:04.335 --> 00:30:05.935
<v Speaker 1>you know, hopefully, by next week, you'll have

00:30:05.935 --> 00:30:08.575
<v Speaker 1>a a published GitHub action also,

00:30:10.255 --> 00:30:13.135
<v Speaker 1>you know, facilitating this test. So you will

00:30:13.135 --> 00:30:15.390
<v Speaker 1>able to add Kubescape

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:16.510
<v Speaker 1>even easier

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:17.950
<v Speaker 1>to your pipes

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:19.550
<v Speaker 1>and your workflows,

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:21.230
<v Speaker 1>and you'll be able to prevent, you know,

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:22.430
<v Speaker 1>security misconfigurations

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:23.470
<v Speaker 1>even before.

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:26.190
<v Speaker 0>I'm curious about

00:30:26.764 --> 00:30:27.484
<v Speaker 0>what,

00:30:29.005 --> 00:30:31.325
<v Speaker 0>you know, what a production pipeline might look

00:30:31.325 --> 00:30:34.284
<v Speaker 0>like here. So, you showed how Kubescape can

00:30:34.284 --> 00:30:36.205
<v Speaker 0>reach the API server and do it in

00:30:36.205 --> 00:30:38.284
<v Speaker 0>cluster stuff. We've also got the ability to

00:30:38.284 --> 00:30:40.284
<v Speaker 0>run it at, like, GitHub action context to

00:30:40.284 --> 00:30:42.125
<v Speaker 0>prevent things ever getting to the cluster.

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:45.400
<v Speaker 0>I mean, should the GitHub action be able

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.919
<v Speaker 0>to block and deploy?

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.920
<v Speaker 0>Is that something that we would encourage for

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:49.559
<v Speaker 0>certain

00:30:49.799 --> 00:30:51.720
<v Speaker 0>profiles or controls?

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.360
<v Speaker 0>And the end cluster stuff, is that something

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.639
<v Speaker 0>that we should be running

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:56.919
<v Speaker 0>regularly?

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.120
<v Speaker 0>Is it something we run

00:30:58.965 --> 00:31:00.885
<v Speaker 0>all the time or just daily? Like, what

00:31:00.885 --> 00:31:02.164
<v Speaker 0>would what would you suggest?

00:31:03.125 --> 00:31:03.684
<v Speaker 1>So

00:31:04.325 --> 00:31:04.885
<v Speaker 1>definitely

00:31:05.125 --> 00:31:07.605
<v Speaker 1>okay. So I'm, you know, today,

00:31:08.085 --> 00:31:09.764
<v Speaker 1>I'm here, you know, as

00:31:10.005 --> 00:31:11.765
<v Speaker 1>on the on one hand, you know, my

00:31:11.765 --> 00:31:13.870
<v Speaker 1>heart is going for the security and and

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:15.390
<v Speaker 1>and cloud native

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:18.030
<v Speaker 1>community and development. But on the other hand,

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:20.990
<v Speaker 1>I also, you know, have I also VP

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:24.190
<v Speaker 1>engineering of of of a company. Right? And

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:26.270
<v Speaker 1>and and this means that I need to

00:31:27.205 --> 00:31:28.165
<v Speaker 1>monitor

00:31:28.405 --> 00:31:30.565
<v Speaker 1>our flows and understand, okay, how to make

00:31:30.565 --> 00:31:33.125
<v Speaker 1>them better, how to make our our our,

00:31:33.125 --> 00:31:34.725
<v Speaker 1>you know, our processes better.

00:31:35.125 --> 00:31:36.805
<v Speaker 1>And, you know, the the

00:31:37.045 --> 00:31:39.685
<v Speaker 1>the idea of shifting left, okay, stopping things,

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:41.870
<v Speaker 1>stopping problems, catching problems,

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:44.510
<v Speaker 1>you know, very, very early, you know, is

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:47.550
<v Speaker 1>is is really important. Okay? And and and

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:49.550
<v Speaker 1>we are really, really committed, not just, you

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:50.029
<v Speaker 1>know,

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:53.150
<v Speaker 1>you know, we are not just talking to

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:54.430
<v Speaker 1>the top, we are trying to walk the

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:55.470
<v Speaker 1>walk, you know. Right? So

00:31:57.485 --> 00:31:58.365
<v Speaker 1>we really

00:31:58.684 --> 00:32:00.605
<v Speaker 1>mean that we want to integrate and bring

00:32:00.605 --> 00:32:01.725
<v Speaker 1>this information

00:32:01.725 --> 00:32:03.244
<v Speaker 1>as early as we can.

00:32:03.804 --> 00:32:05.164
<v Speaker 1>And while I'm talking,

00:32:06.765 --> 00:32:08.924
<v Speaker 1>although this is relatively new machine,

00:32:09.725 --> 00:32:12.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to show you the same thing

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.400
<v Speaker 1>even to make it more even interesting

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:17.800
<v Speaker 1>in

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.520
<v Speaker 1>in Visual Studio Code.

00:32:23.155 --> 00:32:23.794
<v Speaker 1>So

00:32:26.434 --> 00:32:28.514
<v Speaker 1>so we also released

00:32:30.035 --> 00:32:32.355
<v Speaker 1>Kubescape Visual Studio extension.

00:32:34.915 --> 00:32:36.195
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that,

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:39.060
<v Speaker 1>again, I'm installing here, and this is live

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.340
<v Speaker 1>demo, so please, guys,

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:43.620
<v Speaker 1>please give me, you know, just Slack because

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:48.500
<v Speaker 1>hope it will work because I haven't tried

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:50.405
<v Speaker 1>it right now before.

00:32:50.405 --> 00:32:52.645
<v Speaker 1>So what we really try to see, okay,

00:32:52.645 --> 00:32:54.485
<v Speaker 1>to make sure that that that all these

00:32:54.485 --> 00:32:56.245
<v Speaker 1>things are, you know, are

00:32:56.565 --> 00:32:59.125
<v Speaker 1>will, you know, coming with you from the

00:32:59.125 --> 00:32:59.684
<v Speaker 1>very

00:33:00.405 --> 00:33:02.085
<v Speaker 1>point of time where you start to write

00:33:02.085 --> 00:33:05.640
<v Speaker 1>your YAML fry files. You, you know, you

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:08.520
<v Speaker 1>wrote wrote your, you know, your your Helm

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.440
<v Speaker 1>chart and stuff. Okay? And and

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.040
<v Speaker 1>going into

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.200
<v Speaker 1>the direction of of your, you know, dev

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.120
<v Speaker 1>and and staging a production systems.

00:33:17.035 --> 00:33:20.315
<v Speaker 1>And and, you know what, just let's see,

00:33:20.315 --> 00:33:21.674
<v Speaker 1>okay, if it works.

00:33:25.675 --> 00:33:27.355
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So, hopefully, you can

00:33:28.155 --> 00:33:31.460
<v Speaker 1>yeah. The scanning is scanning is working, but

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:33.379
<v Speaker 1>it should also show me

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:35.779
<v Speaker 1>show up also

00:33:36.179 --> 00:33:37.059
<v Speaker 1>during

00:33:37.539 --> 00:33:40.259
<v Speaker 1>yeah. As you can see here Oh, nice.

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.994
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So you can already see here that

00:33:43.075 --> 00:33:45.154
<v Speaker 1>I'm already catching these issues

00:33:45.794 --> 00:33:48.594
<v Speaker 1>right in your editor. So I mean, sorry.

00:33:48.674 --> 00:33:51.634
<v Speaker 1>Not I. Okay? We are catching your issues.

00:33:51.875 --> 00:33:52.514
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.

00:33:53.315 --> 00:33:55.235
<v Speaker 1>But but but, really, you know, the the

00:33:55.235 --> 00:33:57.910
<v Speaker 1>point is here, okay, that to answer your

00:33:57.910 --> 00:33:59.270
<v Speaker 1>question that, yeah,

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:01.590
<v Speaker 1>there's no question, okay, that you need to

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:04.630
<v Speaker 1>scan your your production systems and monitor that.

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Okay?

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:08.469
<v Speaker 1>And maybe, you know, when when we are,

00:34:08.469 --> 00:34:11.989
<v Speaker 1>as engineers, are are dealing with

00:34:10.855 --> 00:34:13.655
<v Speaker 1>security requirements from your our

00:34:14.215 --> 00:34:17.495
<v Speaker 1>chief security officer in in your organization

00:34:17.575 --> 00:34:19.655
<v Speaker 1>or or, you know, you simply need to

00:34:19.655 --> 00:34:22.935
<v Speaker 1>provide some input to your your compliance

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:24.800
<v Speaker 1>preferred compliance

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.320
<v Speaker 1>type, you know, you need to bring in

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:31.040
<v Speaker 1>information. You need to scan your cluster. Okay?

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Because this is actually what you've what you

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:34.160
<v Speaker 1>have.

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.800
<v Speaker 1>But but from a configuration perspective,

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.824
<v Speaker 1>I do believe I do believe that most

00:34:38.984 --> 00:34:41.385
<v Speaker 1>very most of things that can that can

00:34:41.385 --> 00:34:44.105
<v Speaker 1>be caught before needs to be caught before.

00:34:44.105 --> 00:34:46.585
<v Speaker 1>Okay? Yep. It's real and I think it's

00:34:46.585 --> 00:34:47.545
<v Speaker 1>really, really important.

00:34:48.424 --> 00:34:50.264
<v Speaker 1>Also, from a security perspective,

00:34:50.824 --> 00:34:53.300
<v Speaker 1>so you will have security issues, okay, if

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:55.060
<v Speaker 1>your clusters.

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:56.020
<v Speaker 1>Second

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.820
<v Speaker 1>is that, yeah, it is way harder, okay,

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:00.020
<v Speaker 1>to find these issues,

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:02.420
<v Speaker 1>you know, far from you as a developer

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.820
<v Speaker 1>and find them in in the production system.

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay? And you you the access to that,

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:08.845
<v Speaker 1>and you start to scan until you understand

00:35:09.245 --> 00:35:10.365
<v Speaker 1>how it works

00:35:10.525 --> 00:35:12.685
<v Speaker 1>instead of, you know, seeing it within

00:35:12.685 --> 00:35:14.685
<v Speaker 1>your, you know, your your

00:35:15.005 --> 00:35:16.445
<v Speaker 1>development environment.

00:35:17.325 --> 00:35:19.885
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'm gonna follow-up with one thing there,

00:35:19.885 --> 00:35:21.869
<v Speaker 0>but I just wanna Avanash said hello in

00:35:21.869 --> 00:35:24.030
<v Speaker 0>the chat and then Avanash followed up with,

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:25.630
<v Speaker 0>hey. I'm also the person working on the

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:28.430
<v Speaker 0>GitHub action. So nice work, Avanash. Yeah.

00:35:29.069 --> 00:35:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:31.790
<v Speaker 1>This is the great guy I was talking

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:32.270
<v Speaker 1>about.

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:34.510
<v Speaker 0>What I I like what

00:35:35.085 --> 00:35:36.685
<v Speaker 0>what I really resonate with about what you

00:35:36.685 --> 00:35:39.725
<v Speaker 0>said there is that we cannot really frustrating

00:35:39.725 --> 00:35:43.244
<v Speaker 0>position in Kubernetes land. Right? Like, the Kubernetes

00:35:43.244 --> 00:35:46.125
<v Speaker 0>maintainers and contributors made this decision to deprecate

00:35:46.125 --> 00:35:47.165
<v Speaker 0>pod security policies.

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:50.350
<v Speaker 0>The past that they pushed everybody down was,

00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:51.470
<v Speaker 0>well, you should be using

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:54.270
<v Speaker 0>Kiverno or some other in cluster tools to

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:56.910
<v Speaker 0>do mutate and admission and validate and admission

00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:58.990
<v Speaker 0>where you don't really know there's a problem

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:01.150
<v Speaker 0>until

00:35:59.795 --> 00:36:02.435
<v Speaker 0>kubectl apply or your get ops operator starts

00:36:02.435 --> 00:36:05.075
<v Speaker 0>failing. And by that point, you're like, oh,

00:36:05.075 --> 00:36:06.355
<v Speaker 0>right. Well, what what have I got to

00:36:06.355 --> 00:36:08.035
<v Speaker 0>do to get this into my cluster? Right?

00:36:08.035 --> 00:36:09.795
<v Speaker 0>I wanna be able to deploy it. And

00:36:09.795 --> 00:36:12.210
<v Speaker 0>like the Kubescape comes at it with a

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:14.210
<v Speaker 0>multitude of angles, but the most important one

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:16.609
<v Speaker 0>being, can I scan this at pull request

00:36:16.609 --> 00:36:17.250
<v Speaker 0>time,

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:19.410
<v Speaker 0>get something that tells me, hey, this isn't

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:21.330
<v Speaker 0>actually gonna be admitted to the cluster because

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:23.010
<v Speaker 0>of all these things? And then you can

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:24.369
<v Speaker 0>fix them as part of the pull request

00:36:24.369 --> 00:36:25.970
<v Speaker 0>process. It makes things

00:36:26.405 --> 00:36:28.885
<v Speaker 0>a bit easier for new developers or people

00:36:28.885 --> 00:36:29.445
<v Speaker 0>that

00:36:29.685 --> 00:36:32.724
<v Speaker 0>aren't that familiar with this ecosystem and tool

00:36:32.724 --> 00:36:34.964
<v Speaker 0>chain completely. Now, of course, you should still

00:36:34.964 --> 00:36:37.765
<v Speaker 0>have validated mission controllers to block bad things

00:36:37.765 --> 00:36:40.360
<v Speaker 0>again in your cluster, But for the developer's

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:42.680
<v Speaker 0>perspective, you're right. We have to make this

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:45.080
<v Speaker 0>easier for them to learn these constraints and

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.240
<v Speaker 0>controls and how to write better manifest.

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Completely.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.280
<v Speaker 1>And and beyond that, okay, I

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:53.560
<v Speaker 1>what I

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.675
<v Speaker 1>want to show you that I don't know

00:36:55.675 --> 00:36:57.195
<v Speaker 1>if you noticed, okay,

00:36:57.675 --> 00:36:58.555
<v Speaker 1>in this case and

00:36:59.115 --> 00:37:01.595
<v Speaker 1>but, okay, we are this is something, okay,

00:37:01.595 --> 00:37:03.435
<v Speaker 1>that we we also added

00:37:03.915 --> 00:37:06.875
<v Speaker 1>pretty recently, okay, that as you see that

00:37:06.875 --> 00:37:08.474
<v Speaker 1>I'm not just saying that you have an

00:37:08.474 --> 00:37:11.510
<v Speaker 1>issue within your deployment. Okay? And but, also,

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:13.750
<v Speaker 1>I can point you to the the specific

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:17.110
<v Speaker 1>line of of of of of problem. Okay?

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:19.350
<v Speaker 1>So I can explain you that, okay.

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:21.590
<v Speaker 1>And and and it connects you to to

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:23.430
<v Speaker 1>to what you said about the pull request,

00:37:23.505 --> 00:37:25.664
<v Speaker 1>okay, and and improving your, you know, pull

00:37:25.664 --> 00:37:28.704
<v Speaker 1>pull requests and and and also,

00:37:30.384 --> 00:37:31.025
<v Speaker 1>obviously,

00:37:31.184 --> 00:37:34.625
<v Speaker 1>you know, action he's preparing. Okay? GitHub action

00:37:34.625 --> 00:37:37.660
<v Speaker 1>is is preparing that that we really see

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:39.900
<v Speaker 1>this as part of a of a whole

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:41.660
<v Speaker 1>process. Okay? So

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:44.060
<v Speaker 1>to to catch the things and showing you,

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:46.300
<v Speaker 1>okay, that that, you know, this is the

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:47.820
<v Speaker 1>line of problem. Okay?

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.660
<v Speaker 1>This is this is what you need to

00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:51.635
<v Speaker 1>check or this is not what you need

00:37:51.635 --> 00:37:53.875
<v Speaker 1>to say that, well, it's okay. But

00:37:54.755 --> 00:37:57.395
<v Speaker 1>but you need to, you know, create an

00:37:57.395 --> 00:37:58.915
<v Speaker 1>exception, and we'll talk about it in a

00:37:58.915 --> 00:37:59.475
<v Speaker 1>minute.

00:37:59.875 --> 00:38:00.915
<v Speaker 1>What is an exception

00:38:01.234 --> 00:38:02.035
<v Speaker 1>for us?

00:38:03.474 --> 00:38:03.954
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:08.440
<v Speaker 0>So Do you see a feature for this?

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:10.359
<v Speaker 0>Like, I've now got I've got feature requests

00:38:10.359 --> 00:38:11.400
<v Speaker 0>for you. So

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.200
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Like, I want a little light bulb

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.799
<v Speaker 0>in Versus Code to show up and actually

00:38:15.799 --> 00:38:18.599
<v Speaker 0>just fix it for me. Just remediation

00:38:18.759 --> 00:38:20.359
<v Speaker 0>like, hey, you should just set this to

00:38:20.359 --> 00:38:22.815
<v Speaker 0>false or hit there. You can modify your

00:38:22.815 --> 00:38:26.095
<v Speaker 0>service to be cluster IP and, like, be

00:38:26.095 --> 00:38:27.615
<v Speaker 0>able to guide people through how to make

00:38:27.615 --> 00:38:28.335
<v Speaker 0>this better.

00:38:29.055 --> 00:38:30.255
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So

00:38:30.735 --> 00:38:32.655
<v Speaker 1>I know it's it looks like we have,

00:38:32.655 --> 00:38:35.215
<v Speaker 1>you know, premiitated these questions, but actually, you

00:38:35.215 --> 00:38:36.095
<v Speaker 1>know, we have some time.

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:38.670
<v Speaker 1>And, yeah, this is this is something, you

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:40.750
<v Speaker 1>know, we are we are working as right

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:41.230
<v Speaker 1>now.

00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:44.750
<v Speaker 1>We are also to the which if you

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:46.190
<v Speaker 1>know, we are again,

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:47.790
<v Speaker 1>within the engineers,

00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:49.470
<v Speaker 1>okay, what we needed to do in order

00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:52.015
<v Speaker 1>to have these highlights, okay, is actually telling

00:38:52.015 --> 00:38:54.335
<v Speaker 1>you, okay, which, you know, part of the

00:38:54.335 --> 00:38:56.335
<v Speaker 1>YAML file, which, you know, which

00:38:56.735 --> 00:38:57.455
<v Speaker 1>fields

00:38:57.615 --> 00:39:00.415
<v Speaker 1>or fields are are related to this problem.

00:39:00.575 --> 00:39:02.015
<v Speaker 1>And what you're saying is not just, you

00:39:02.015 --> 00:39:04.015
<v Speaker 1>know, not just saying that, okay, the here

00:39:04.015 --> 00:39:06.575
<v Speaker 1>is the problem, but what the actual remediation

00:39:06.575 --> 00:39:07.055
<v Speaker 1>is

00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:08.790
<v Speaker 1>for this problem?

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:11.750
<v Speaker 1>And and this is right now, it's we

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:14.070
<v Speaker 1>are working on this today, more or less.

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:16.470
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. And hopeful and hopefully, you know, I

00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:17.990
<v Speaker 1>don't know when we'll have the light bulb,

00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:19.110
<v Speaker 1>okay, because,

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:22.085
<v Speaker 1>you know, we have to edit also to

00:39:22.085 --> 00:39:24.005
<v Speaker 1>the to the extension here, but but the

00:39:24.005 --> 00:39:25.365
<v Speaker 1>information will be there.

00:39:25.925 --> 00:39:29.525
<v Speaker 1>And, you know, this whole the Kubescape is,

00:39:29.525 --> 00:39:32.005
<v Speaker 1>you know, is is very, transparent. Okay? And

00:39:32.005 --> 00:39:33.765
<v Speaker 1>and, you know, the same output we are

00:39:33.765 --> 00:39:34.885
<v Speaker 1>we are generating here,

00:39:35.859 --> 00:39:37.940
<v Speaker 1>you know, can be taken, integrated into any

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:39.940
<v Speaker 1>other tool. Okay? And

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:42.099
<v Speaker 1>but I wanted to tell you that this

00:39:42.099 --> 00:39:44.740
<v Speaker 1>information is there, and also the fixed information

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:46.900
<v Speaker 1>is what with the live op is going

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.140
<v Speaker 1>to be there. So Awesome. Hopefully, really soon,

00:39:49.775 --> 00:39:50.095
<v Speaker 1>we will have Alright.

00:39:51.135 --> 00:39:52.735
<v Speaker 0>We got a couple more comments there. So

00:39:52.735 --> 00:39:55.055
<v Speaker 0>we have a child from John Luca. You

00:39:55.055 --> 00:39:56.815
<v Speaker 0>may have gone. Long time no see.

00:39:57.535 --> 00:40:00.015
<v Speaker 0>Mozz is in with another great question. Mozz

00:40:00.015 --> 00:40:01.695
<v Speaker 0>is curious if there are any plans for

00:40:01.695 --> 00:40:02.655
<v Speaker 0>Kubescape.

00:40:02.815 --> 00:40:03.695
<v Speaker 0>Now he's asked

00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:06.590
<v Speaker 0>if you're gonna create your own admission controller,

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:07.790
<v Speaker 0>but I'm curious if you plan to do

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:11.070
<v Speaker 0>that or whether provide policies for existing admission

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:12.990
<v Speaker 0>controllers. Is that something that you've thought So,

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:17.365
<v Speaker 1>yeah, we are we are thinking about it

00:40:17.365 --> 00:40:19.605
<v Speaker 1>really hard, okay, because really the

00:40:20.165 --> 00:40:22.245
<v Speaker 1>you know, we haven't talked about it yet,

00:40:22.245 --> 00:40:23.925
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if you guys are

00:40:23.925 --> 00:40:25.365
<v Speaker 1>into it. Okay? I will be happy to

00:40:25.365 --> 00:40:27.525
<v Speaker 1>talk about the controls themselves, which are they

00:40:27.525 --> 00:40:28.805
<v Speaker 1>are written in in

00:40:28.965 --> 00:40:29.925
<v Speaker 1>in Rego,

00:40:29.925 --> 00:40:30.805
<v Speaker 1>and and

00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:34.570
<v Speaker 1>Kubescape was built on on Opa engine. Yeah.

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:35.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay? So

00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:38.570
<v Speaker 1>which is we love it, and it's it's

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:39.530
<v Speaker 1>a great tool.

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:41.770
<v Speaker 1>And as of as you can see today,

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:43.530
<v Speaker 1>we have a big set of of controls

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:44.570
<v Speaker 1>and tests around it.

00:40:45.615 --> 00:40:47.695
<v Speaker 1>And we really think we are giving you

00:40:48.095 --> 00:40:50.335
<v Speaker 1>trying to understand, okay, what will take us

00:40:50.335 --> 00:40:52.575
<v Speaker 1>to to create an admission control. And, you

00:40:52.575 --> 00:40:53.935
<v Speaker 1>know, I I think that this is not

00:40:53.935 --> 00:40:54.895
<v Speaker 1>really the,

00:40:55.215 --> 00:40:57.455
<v Speaker 1>really, the question of really the technicality

00:40:57.455 --> 00:40:59.375
<v Speaker 1>of, you know, of implementing the admission control

00:40:59.375 --> 00:41:00.175
<v Speaker 1>API.

00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:03.430
<v Speaker 1>But, really, we are trying to create an

00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:05.750
<v Speaker 1>open source project which is, you know, which

00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:06.550
<v Speaker 1>is useful.

00:41:07.269 --> 00:41:09.670
<v Speaker 1>And, you know, having this full integration

00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:13.589
<v Speaker 1>with our with our Ragos and and rules

00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:14.549
<v Speaker 1>and controls

00:41:14.925 --> 00:41:15.725
<v Speaker 1>together,

00:41:15.725 --> 00:41:17.725
<v Speaker 1>you know, with Kubescape and this

00:41:18.285 --> 00:41:20.605
<v Speaker 1>and the the GitHub action and the and

00:41:20.605 --> 00:41:23.085
<v Speaker 1>the Versus Code. And together, okay, we have

00:41:23.085 --> 00:41:25.405
<v Speaker 1>an admission control. I think that we are

00:41:25.485 --> 00:41:26.845
<v Speaker 1>we're giving it a serious thought,

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:30.630
<v Speaker 1>but we want to make it right. So

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:32.310
<v Speaker 1>it's really important for us to, you know,

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:35.030
<v Speaker 1>to make something that that is is is

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:37.190
<v Speaker 1>usable and giving, you know, extra,

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:41.350
<v Speaker 1>you know, extra value, okay, for for you

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:42.630
<v Speaker 1>guys, for the whole community.

00:41:44.015 --> 00:41:46.335
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's that's really interesting to know that

00:41:46.335 --> 00:41:48.095
<v Speaker 0>it's using Opa and Regal because I guess

00:41:48.095 --> 00:41:50.815
<v Speaker 0>now, probably not too difficult to take some

00:41:50.815 --> 00:41:52.735
<v Speaker 0>of those policies and deploy them to be

00:41:52.735 --> 00:41:55.135
<v Speaker 0>consumed by gatekeeper right off the bat and

00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:57.790
<v Speaker 0>been able to then provide maybe someone in

00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:59.470
<v Speaker 0>the community is watching and thinking, well, I

00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:00.510
<v Speaker 0>use Kivernal.

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:03.470
<v Speaker 0>Please go and start converting these to Kivernal

00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:05.230
<v Speaker 0>policies as well. Like, we have the artifact

00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:06.990
<v Speaker 0>hub and I'd love to see

00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:09.790
<v Speaker 0>all of these policies available to people regardless

00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:12.365
<v Speaker 0>of admission controllers. That would be awesome. Yeah.

00:42:12.605 --> 00:42:14.765
<v Speaker 1>That that would be great. Really great. And

00:42:14.765 --> 00:42:16.605
<v Speaker 1>and you can see that that the other

00:42:16.605 --> 00:42:18.525
<v Speaker 1>Qscape project in GitHub,

00:42:18.685 --> 00:42:20.285
<v Speaker 1>we have this regular library

00:42:21.725 --> 00:42:25.180
<v Speaker 1>project, okay, where where actually all the controls

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:27.500
<v Speaker 1>you can see, okay, all the controls written

00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:28.700
<v Speaker 1>here in in

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:30.700
<v Speaker 1>Rego

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:33.500
<v Speaker 1>and understand how you can understand how they

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:33.819
<v Speaker 1>work.

00:42:35.545 --> 00:42:37.385
<v Speaker 1>And now let's take this to

00:42:39.545 --> 00:42:40.905
<v Speaker 1>for example, the

00:42:42.585 --> 00:42:43.865
<v Speaker 1>privileged pod.

00:42:44.425 --> 00:42:48.025
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Whatever. Or the almost the IPC privileges.

00:42:48.025 --> 00:42:50.260
<v Speaker 1>So it these are simply, you know,

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:52.260
<v Speaker 1>regular structures

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:53.860
<v Speaker 1>and queries.

00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:58.100
<v Speaker 1>You know, it's it's different actually, it's it's

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:00.260
<v Speaker 1>different from how a little bit how

00:43:01.235 --> 00:43:02.995
<v Speaker 1>Gatekeeper implemented things

00:43:03.155 --> 00:43:05.155
<v Speaker 1>because, you know, we really you know, you

00:43:05.155 --> 00:43:06.355
<v Speaker 1>can see all these

00:43:06.755 --> 00:43:09.235
<v Speaker 1>failed path and fixed path fixed path and

00:43:09.235 --> 00:43:10.755
<v Speaker 1>all the things, you know, we've just showed

00:43:10.755 --> 00:43:12.115
<v Speaker 1>you that to show how

00:43:12.595 --> 00:43:14.540
<v Speaker 1>the regulars are are not just, you know,

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:17.100
<v Speaker 1>identifying the problem, but also telling you

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:19.420
<v Speaker 1>what where the problem is and how to

00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:20.140
<v Speaker 1>fix it.

00:43:21.099 --> 00:43:23.900
<v Speaker 1>Therefore, they are these things that are Reggos

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:25.580
<v Speaker 1>are a little bit different. Okay?

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:28.540
<v Speaker 1>But still, you know, you can this open

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:31.555
<v Speaker 1>source project and as well with the same

00:43:31.555 --> 00:43:32.355
<v Speaker 1>license,

00:43:32.515 --> 00:43:34.275
<v Speaker 1>and and this is what we're using in

00:43:34.275 --> 00:43:35.235
<v Speaker 1>Kubescape.

00:43:35.875 --> 00:43:38.835
<v Speaker 1>So anyone who's interested to, you know, to

00:43:38.835 --> 00:43:40.115
<v Speaker 1>do something with us

00:43:40.515 --> 00:43:42.915
<v Speaker 1>or without us, but using this, let's say,

00:43:43.155 --> 00:43:43.955
<v Speaker 1>is welcome.

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:46.050
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:49.810
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We got away from Thomas Lav. I'll

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:51.170
<v Speaker 0>pop that back off, and I'll let you

00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:52.610
<v Speaker 0>carry on with your demo. But this is

00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:54.210
<v Speaker 0>this is really cool. I like this. I

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:56.450
<v Speaker 0>like what I'm seeing. Yeah. Yeah.

00:43:57.170 --> 00:43:59.185
<v Speaker 1>Thanks. And

00:43:59.825 --> 00:44:02.385
<v Speaker 1>so this is your really what you know,

00:44:02.385 --> 00:44:03.905
<v Speaker 1>Kubescape has

00:44:04.145 --> 00:44:05.665
<v Speaker 1>a few new directions.

00:44:05.744 --> 00:44:08.224
<v Speaker 1>Okay? And I'm also David, I hope you

00:44:08.224 --> 00:44:10.190
<v Speaker 1>agree, but I'm going to use this platform

00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:13.390
<v Speaker 1>also to ask for more contributions here to

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:15.549
<v Speaker 1>to join our community. But I wanted to

00:44:15.549 --> 00:44:18.349
<v Speaker 1>show a a few interesting things. Okay? So

00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:19.790
<v Speaker 1>as I told you before,

00:44:20.109 --> 00:44:20.589
<v Speaker 1>you

00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:21.950
<v Speaker 1>know, Kubescape

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:23.390
<v Speaker 1>is

00:44:23.555 --> 00:44:27.075
<v Speaker 1>started from scanning your API server. Okay? So

00:44:27.075 --> 00:44:29.475
<v Speaker 1>it connected the Kubernetes API,

00:44:29.635 --> 00:44:31.155
<v Speaker 1>talked to the API server,

00:44:31.475 --> 00:44:34.035
<v Speaker 1>you know, got all these, deployment

00:44:34.035 --> 00:44:37.155
<v Speaker 1>and secret and service objects, okay, and and

00:44:37.155 --> 00:44:40.089
<v Speaker 1>and, you know, told you what might wrong

00:44:40.089 --> 00:44:40.890
<v Speaker 1>with them.

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Now

00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:45.610
<v Speaker 1>we understand that

00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:48.250
<v Speaker 1>security is more complex, and security is way

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:51.930
<v Speaker 1>beyond, okay, only the API API server information.

00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:53.849
<v Speaker 1>Okay? All the things we can all the

00:44:53.849 --> 00:44:55.985
<v Speaker 1>objects we can get from the API server.

00:44:56.465 --> 00:44:57.105
<v Speaker 1>And

00:44:58.145 --> 00:45:01.345
<v Speaker 1>we have at least three directions, okay, we

00:45:01.345 --> 00:45:03.745
<v Speaker 1>started already to go into. Okay?

00:45:04.065 --> 00:45:08.385
<v Speaker 1>One is the host running the the the

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:13.020
<v Speaker 1>the Kubernetes nodes. Okay? So we've created you

00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:15.180
<v Speaker 1>can see with in in in our GitHub,

00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:17.260
<v Speaker 1>we've created a project called

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:19.340
<v Speaker 1>host scan host sensor,

00:45:19.579 --> 00:45:21.100
<v Speaker 1>which is actually a

00:45:21.819 --> 00:45:23.895
<v Speaker 1>high privileged daemon set,

00:45:24.215 --> 00:45:25.415
<v Speaker 1>which we're installing

00:45:25.415 --> 00:45:28.535
<v Speaker 1>during the scan on every Kubernetes node.

00:45:28.935 --> 00:45:30.615
<v Speaker 1>And it collects information

00:45:30.775 --> 00:45:31.815
<v Speaker 1>from,

00:45:32.055 --> 00:45:32.935
<v Speaker 1>the host,

00:45:33.415 --> 00:45:35.975
<v Speaker 1>which is hosting the actual Kubernetes node. Okay?

00:45:35.975 --> 00:45:38.375
<v Speaker 1>So we have access to the Linux kernel

00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:41.309
<v Speaker 1>and to, and to the environment which are

00:45:41.309 --> 00:45:42.829
<v Speaker 1>running to correct this node and not just

00:45:42.829 --> 00:45:44.990
<v Speaker 1>the API servers and the containers

00:45:45.069 --> 00:45:45.710
<v Speaker 1>from,

00:45:45.869 --> 00:45:46.830
<v Speaker 1>from inside.

00:45:47.069 --> 00:45:48.990
<v Speaker 1>So, for example, in this case,

00:45:50.109 --> 00:45:52.415
<v Speaker 1>what where it where it can help us.

00:45:52.415 --> 00:45:54.815
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So there there are different controls, okay,

00:45:54.815 --> 00:45:58.255
<v Speaker 1>which can leverage this information. Okay? So, for

00:45:58.255 --> 00:46:00.815
<v Speaker 1>example, I don't know if recall, I don't

00:46:00.815 --> 00:46:04.255
<v Speaker 1>remember the ex exact name of the CBE

00:46:04.255 --> 00:46:06.255
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability which was in the Kubelet,

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:10.810
<v Speaker 1>like, you know, two two months ago or

00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:13.290
<v Speaker 1>something or three months ago in in December.

00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:15.370
<v Speaker 1>And in that case, okay,

00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:17.130
<v Speaker 1>we, as Kubescape,

00:46:17.290 --> 00:46:19.930
<v Speaker 1>we couldn't detect whether the actually, the hosts

00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:22.010
<v Speaker 1>are vulnerable because in order to detect that,

00:46:22.205 --> 00:46:24.285
<v Speaker 1>we also needed to understand what are the

00:46:24.285 --> 00:46:25.725
<v Speaker 1>kernel configurations,

00:46:26.285 --> 00:46:28.045
<v Speaker 1>on that host. And it's not enough to

00:46:28.045 --> 00:46:28.605
<v Speaker 1>read,

00:46:28.925 --> 00:46:30.205
<v Speaker 1>the Kubescape version,

00:46:30.525 --> 00:46:33.005
<v Speaker 1>which is available in node objects of

00:46:33.325 --> 00:46:34.365
<v Speaker 1>the API server.

00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:35.790
<v Speaker 1>And,

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:36.590
<v Speaker 1>also,

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:38.670
<v Speaker 1>beyond that, we've also,

00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:42.590
<v Speaker 1>looking into different, you know, other different things,

00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:44.510
<v Speaker 1>okay, in in the host.

00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:47.710
<v Speaker 1>For example, what is the version of, you

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:50.474
<v Speaker 1>know, of your container runtime and and stuff

00:46:50.474 --> 00:46:51.195
<v Speaker 1>like that.

00:46:51.755 --> 00:46:55.195
<v Speaker 1>And and we collect this information, okay, and

00:46:55.195 --> 00:46:57.915
<v Speaker 1>we leverage this information to tell you more

00:46:57.915 --> 00:46:59.675
<v Speaker 1>about your security posture.

00:47:00.075 --> 00:47:00.795
<v Speaker 1>Now,

00:47:01.195 --> 00:47:02.795
<v Speaker 1>obviously, our host sensor itself

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:05.030
<v Speaker 1>is is a high privileged,

00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:06.310
<v Speaker 1>container

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:07.750
<v Speaker 1>within the cluster.

00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:08.870
<v Speaker 1>And,

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:10.950
<v Speaker 1>therefore, what we are doing, we are installing

00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:13.190
<v Speaker 1>it during the run and rim right away,

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:16.145
<v Speaker 1>after we collect the information, removing it. Okay?

00:47:16.224 --> 00:47:17.665
<v Speaker 1>So this is something this is a one

00:47:17.665 --> 00:47:19.984
<v Speaker 1>time thing in order to to, you know,

00:47:19.984 --> 00:47:21.905
<v Speaker 1>to to collect this information

00:47:22.224 --> 00:47:24.065
<v Speaker 1>and and and tell you what

00:47:25.345 --> 00:47:27.665
<v Speaker 1>what can be your potential security

00:47:27.665 --> 00:47:30.359
<v Speaker 1>problems. We are telling you about your host,

00:47:30.359 --> 00:47:31.880
<v Speaker 1>but but this is it. Okay? And then

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:34.440
<v Speaker 1>we we we remove it right away.

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:35.480
<v Speaker 1>Also,

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:38.839
<v Speaker 1>we have gone to the direction that I'm

00:47:38.839 --> 00:47:40.840
<v Speaker 1>going to open our our

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:41.800
<v Speaker 1>documentation.

00:47:43.674 --> 00:47:47.355
<v Speaker 1>We've also went into the the direction of

00:47:47.355 --> 00:47:49.035
<v Speaker 1>of learning more

00:47:49.115 --> 00:47:52.234
<v Speaker 1>of your cluster from the cloud provider.

00:47:54.315 --> 00:47:54.955
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.

00:47:57.515 --> 00:47:58.635
<v Speaker 1>So

00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:02.510
<v Speaker 1>so your cloud provider today,

00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:04.590
<v Speaker 1>you know, and and there were this is

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:07.230
<v Speaker 1>why I think the question about whether Kubescape

00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:09.710
<v Speaker 1>can scan your your managed clusters

00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:12.855
<v Speaker 1>was a great question. Okay? Because on the

00:48:12.855 --> 00:48:14.695
<v Speaker 1>one hand, yeah, Kubescape can

00:48:15.415 --> 00:48:17.575
<v Speaker 1>scan your cluster. Okay? But on the other

00:48:17.575 --> 00:48:19.975
<v Speaker 1>hand, many information in the Kubernetes parts of

00:48:19.975 --> 00:48:21.575
<v Speaker 1>the Kubernetes control plane

00:48:21.895 --> 00:48:23.655
<v Speaker 1>are hidden from you where you're running a

00:48:23.655 --> 00:48:26.069
<v Speaker 1>managed Kubernetes cluster. Right? So when you are

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:28.789
<v Speaker 1>you're running a GKE cluster on a EKS

00:48:28.789 --> 00:48:30.710
<v Speaker 1>cluster, you can you don't see actually the

00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:32.150
<v Speaker 1>API server pod.

00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay?

00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:35.829
<v Speaker 1>And, for example, if I'm returning here just

00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:38.205
<v Speaker 1>for a second for the test results, you

00:48:38.205 --> 00:48:40.925
<v Speaker 1>can see here that we have a a

00:48:40.925 --> 00:48:43.885
<v Speaker 1>a control called PSP enabled. Okay? Because in

00:48:43.885 --> 00:48:46.285
<v Speaker 1>general, we believe that post security policy is

00:48:46.285 --> 00:48:47.645
<v Speaker 1>an important security,

00:48:48.125 --> 00:48:49.005
<v Speaker 1>facility.

00:48:49.245 --> 00:48:51.165
<v Speaker 1>Although, I know this is deprecated,

00:48:51.165 --> 00:48:53.109
<v Speaker 1>and we are it's going to be swapped

00:48:53.109 --> 00:48:54.870
<v Speaker 1>out to something even better.

00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:58.310
<v Speaker 1>But but when we we can only test

00:48:58.310 --> 00:49:00.790
<v Speaker 1>whether PSPN is enabled using,

00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:03.190
<v Speaker 1>the Kube API when,

00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:06.355
<v Speaker 1>the API server is running as part of

00:49:06.355 --> 00:49:08.515
<v Speaker 1>the Kubernetes cluster, and we can

00:49:08.755 --> 00:49:10.675
<v Speaker 1>find the pod which is running the API

00:49:10.675 --> 00:49:12.755
<v Speaker 1>server and look into its configuration.

00:49:13.075 --> 00:49:15.235
<v Speaker 1>When it is a managed Kubernetes cluster,

00:49:16.515 --> 00:49:18.515
<v Speaker 1>for example, a EKS,

00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay? We don't have this information because we

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.400
<v Speaker 1>don't see the API server plus because it's

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:26.280
<v Speaker 1>something that AWS is taking taking care of.

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:27.160
<v Speaker 1>So

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:31.235
<v Speaker 1>in that case, okay, what we are we

00:49:31.235 --> 00:49:33.795
<v Speaker 1>are doing is, actually, we are connecting we

00:49:33.795 --> 00:49:35.235
<v Speaker 1>have enabled lately

00:49:35.235 --> 00:49:36.995
<v Speaker 1>in, cubescape to

00:49:37.395 --> 00:49:38.915
<v Speaker 1>be able to access,

00:49:39.235 --> 00:49:39.795
<v Speaker 1>the

00:49:40.275 --> 00:49:41.955
<v Speaker 1>API of the Cloud vendor,

00:49:42.355 --> 00:49:44.675
<v Speaker 1>detect which cluster we are running in, whether

00:49:44.675 --> 00:49:46.755
<v Speaker 1>it's an EKS cluster or GK cluster,

00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:48.780
<v Speaker 1>and,

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:52.380
<v Speaker 1>and and, you know, talk to the API

00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:53.740
<v Speaker 1>of the cloud vendor

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:56.700
<v Speaker 1>and and find out whether PSP is enabled

00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:59.500
<v Speaker 1>from the cloud vendor itself or whether ETCD

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:01.895
<v Speaker 1>encryption is is, enabled,

00:50:02.855 --> 00:50:05.735
<v Speaker 1>also get the information from the cloud vendor,

00:50:06.375 --> 00:50:08.775
<v Speaker 1>because this information is not available through the

00:50:08.775 --> 00:50:11.335
<v Speaker 1>Kubescape API. So this is the second, you

00:50:11.335 --> 00:50:14.375
<v Speaker 1>know, the second angle, second data source, okay,

00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:15.869
<v Speaker 1>beyond the,

00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:19.150
<v Speaker 1>beyond the host sensor I told you.

00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:22.030
<v Speaker 1>And third, which is coming out, you know,

00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:22.910
<v Speaker 1>in this month,

00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:25.230
<v Speaker 1>is going to be vulnerability scan.

00:50:25.869 --> 00:50:28.910
<v Speaker 1>We are going to take inform vulnerability scan

00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:31.445
<v Speaker 1>information of your images in your cluster

00:50:32.005 --> 00:50:33.845
<v Speaker 1>and if they are available and

00:50:34.405 --> 00:50:36.485
<v Speaker 1>and use them as, you know, as an

00:50:36.485 --> 00:50:39.765
<v Speaker 1>additional information for writing controls, writing tests. For

00:50:39.925 --> 00:50:41.925
<v Speaker 1>I'm giving you an example, and I will

00:50:41.925 --> 00:50:43.685
<v Speaker 1>stop here because I need to drink something.

00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:46.130
<v Speaker 1>That

00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:48.930
<v Speaker 1>that for example, I I I give you

00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:50.930
<v Speaker 1>a for example, you have a cluster. Okay?

00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:53.570
<v Speaker 1>And and let's say that you're a very,

00:50:53.570 --> 00:50:54.050
<v Speaker 1>very

00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:56.370
<v Speaker 1>security conscious

00:50:57.490 --> 00:51:00.210
<v Speaker 1>DevOps engineer, and you are scanning your images

00:51:01.145 --> 00:51:03.145
<v Speaker 1>for security vulnerabilities.

00:51:03.145 --> 00:51:03.705
<v Speaker 1>Right?

00:51:04.025 --> 00:51:04.984
<v Speaker 1>But

00:51:04.984 --> 00:51:06.505
<v Speaker 1>what do you do with the results? Okay.

00:51:06.505 --> 00:51:08.585
<v Speaker 1>There are different you know, there are love

00:51:08.585 --> 00:51:11.785
<v Speaker 1>images with old, you know, old base images,

00:51:11.785 --> 00:51:14.505
<v Speaker 1>and you have you get every week, you

00:51:14.505 --> 00:51:15.625
<v Speaker 1>get a critical vulnerability.

00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:18.700
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes it doesn't really help, okay, because

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:19.980
<v Speaker 1>it's, you know, it's more,

00:51:20.619 --> 00:51:22.460
<v Speaker 1>you know, it's more like a fog, okay,

00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:24.220
<v Speaker 1>because you have too many so many issues

00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:27.019
<v Speaker 1>that you cannot, you know, you cannot prioritize

00:51:27.019 --> 00:51:30.295
<v Speaker 1>by yourself. So what we're we decided to

00:51:30.295 --> 00:51:32.855
<v Speaker 1>do as a practical step from Kubescape is

00:51:32.855 --> 00:51:35.895
<v Speaker 1>to connect the vulnerability information with the information

00:51:35.895 --> 00:51:36.855
<v Speaker 1>we learn

00:51:37.335 --> 00:51:39.975
<v Speaker 1>from the Kube API. For example,

00:51:40.215 --> 00:51:42.590
<v Speaker 1>you have two

00:51:42.590 --> 00:51:44.990
<v Speaker 1>two deployments. Okay. One deployment

00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:48.350
<v Speaker 1>is is connected to a load balancer,

00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:50.830
<v Speaker 1>you know, in case, let's say, AWS, and

00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:52.510
<v Speaker 1>then it's an application

00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:55.225
<v Speaker 1>load balancer. And the second deployment is an

00:51:55.225 --> 00:51:57.545
<v Speaker 1>internal deployment, okay, which is not,

00:51:57.945 --> 00:52:01.305
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have access from the outside world. So

00:52:01.705 --> 00:52:04.425
<v Speaker 1>it's really clear that that in case that

00:52:04.425 --> 00:52:05.865
<v Speaker 1>the public facing,

00:52:06.345 --> 00:52:06.825
<v Speaker 1>deployment

00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:10.250
<v Speaker 1>has a critical vulnerability is way more,

00:52:11.050 --> 00:52:13.770
<v Speaker 1>way more critical issue than if an internal

00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:14.650
<v Speaker 1>application

00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:16.890
<v Speaker 1>has a critical vulnerability.

00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:19.210
<v Speaker 1>So us as security,

00:52:19.930 --> 00:52:20.650
<v Speaker 1>conscious,

00:52:21.130 --> 00:52:23.315
<v Speaker 1>people, if we want to start to fix

00:52:23.315 --> 00:52:25.555
<v Speaker 1>things, obviously, we have to start to fix

00:52:25.555 --> 00:52:27.635
<v Speaker 1>with the public facing workloads.

00:52:27.635 --> 00:52:30.035
<v Speaker 0>Okay? And this is what what we're going

00:52:30.035 --> 00:52:30.994
<v Speaker 1>to do at,

00:52:31.474 --> 00:52:34.355
<v Speaker 1>in the next step of Kubescape. We're going

00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:36.350
<v Speaker 1>connect we'll update the information together

00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:39.310
<v Speaker 1>with the the Kubernetes information,

00:52:39.310 --> 00:52:40.910
<v Speaker 1>and we'll try to give you

00:52:41.310 --> 00:52:43.870
<v Speaker 1>actionable items. Okay. Things which are you know,

00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:45.310
<v Speaker 1>we are we can say to you, like,

00:52:45.310 --> 00:52:47.310
<v Speaker 1>dude, this is something you have to solve

00:52:47.664 --> 00:52:49.825
<v Speaker 1>now. Well, this is more important than all

00:52:49.825 --> 00:52:52.224
<v Speaker 1>the others. And now I I I'm going

00:52:52.224 --> 00:52:54.224
<v Speaker 1>to sip a little soda.

00:52:54.704 --> 00:52:57.184
<v Speaker 0>Yep. You grab a drink. Alright. Audience, if

00:52:57.184 --> 00:52:59.505
<v Speaker 0>you have any questions I mean, we've covered

00:52:59.505 --> 00:53:01.505
<v Speaker 0>a lot so far about the different integration

00:53:01.505 --> 00:53:03.820
<v Speaker 0>points for Kubescape. Ben has also shared some

00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:05.180
<v Speaker 0>really cool things that seem to be coming

00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:06.780
<v Speaker 0>down the pipe, which I'm very excited about

00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:08.540
<v Speaker 0>as well. But if you have any questions

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:10.380
<v Speaker 0>for anything that we haven't answered yet, feel

00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:12.140
<v Speaker 0>free to drop them into the comments

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:14.220
<v Speaker 0>before we finish up, and we'll do our

00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:15.020
<v Speaker 0>best to answer them.

00:53:16.575 --> 00:53:18.095
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Feeling better, Ben?

00:53:18.575 --> 00:53:21.215
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I'm way better. So what I want

00:53:21.215 --> 00:53:23.055
<v Speaker 0>to what I wanted to show you, okay,

00:53:23.055 --> 00:53:25.695
<v Speaker 1>is is actually, you know, the Kubescape

00:53:26.175 --> 00:53:29.135
<v Speaker 1>hosted the SaaS version, okay, the graphical version

00:53:29.135 --> 00:53:31.569
<v Speaker 1>of the results, okay, which can take to

00:53:31.569 --> 00:53:32.690
<v Speaker 1>to be here with you.

00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:33.730
<v Speaker 1>So

00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:37.569
<v Speaker 1>you can go to portal Arlo Cloud where

00:53:37.569 --> 00:53:40.130
<v Speaker 1>we are hosting, okay, our our Kubescape

00:53:40.210 --> 00:53:41.010
<v Speaker 1>UI.

00:53:41.569 --> 00:53:43.170
<v Speaker 1>You can sign up, you know, with your

00:53:43.170 --> 00:53:44.770
<v Speaker 1>favorite social log in

00:53:46.345 --> 00:53:47.305
<v Speaker 1>on this site,

00:53:47.545 --> 00:53:49.305
<v Speaker 1>and you can what you can do, you

00:53:49.305 --> 00:53:52.585
<v Speaker 1>can stream here your your results into this

00:53:52.825 --> 00:53:55.305
<v Speaker 1>in into this environment.

00:53:56.505 --> 00:53:59.305
<v Speaker 1>And, you know, I'm rerunning, you know,

00:54:00.130 --> 00:54:02.610
<v Speaker 1>are the same Kubescape scan

00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:04.370
<v Speaker 1>command here.

00:54:05.650 --> 00:54:07.330
<v Speaker 1>Just in this case, okay, if I added

00:54:07.330 --> 00:54:08.690
<v Speaker 1>my account ID,

00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:11.890
<v Speaker 1>so I'm uploading it to to my to

00:54:11.890 --> 00:54:12.770
<v Speaker 1>my bucket.

00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:13.730
<v Speaker 1>And,

00:54:15.365 --> 00:54:17.605
<v Speaker 1>you know, I can open right now the

00:54:17.605 --> 00:54:19.285
<v Speaker 1>the results here,

00:54:19.925 --> 00:54:20.965
<v Speaker 1>which should be

00:54:21.605 --> 00:54:23.125
<v Speaker 1>here within a minute.

00:54:24.085 --> 00:54:26.805
<v Speaker 1>And and I I can monitor my cluster,

00:54:26.805 --> 00:54:29.210
<v Speaker 1>you know, in a constant manner, okay, if

00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:31.690
<v Speaker 1>we have used your this mini cube,

00:54:32.089 --> 00:54:34.410
<v Speaker 1>which I've just set set up.

00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:36.970
<v Speaker 1>In this case, then I can see, okay,

00:54:36.970 --> 00:54:38.890
<v Speaker 1>all all the controls.

00:54:38.890 --> 00:54:39.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:43.255
<v Speaker 1>You saw also in the CLI before. You

00:54:43.255 --> 00:54:45.895
<v Speaker 1>can see here, you know, the different frameworks

00:54:45.895 --> 00:54:47.734
<v Speaker 1>which we are running. You can see the

00:54:47.734 --> 00:54:49.255
<v Speaker 1>niche draft framework,

00:54:49.575 --> 00:54:51.175
<v Speaker 1>the NSA framework.

00:54:51.494 --> 00:54:53.095
<v Speaker 1>You can see here the

00:54:53.575 --> 00:54:56.010
<v Speaker 1>we have created a a framework of our

00:54:56.010 --> 00:54:57.850
<v Speaker 1>own, which we call Armor Best, which is

00:54:57.930 --> 00:54:59.690
<v Speaker 1>which contains, I think, the most

00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:01.130
<v Speaker 1>important

00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:02.250
<v Speaker 1>controls

00:55:03.290 --> 00:55:05.210
<v Speaker 1>you you should be running.

00:55:05.370 --> 00:55:06.650
<v Speaker 1>And, you know, what I like to do

00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:09.530
<v Speaker 1>here, okay, is really, you know, just looking

00:55:09.610 --> 00:55:12.305
<v Speaker 1>by severities. Okay? I I like to see,

00:55:12.305 --> 00:55:13.744
<v Speaker 1>okay, my issues, and I see that there

00:55:13.744 --> 00:55:16.464
<v Speaker 1>isn't there are no failed controls here. But,

00:55:16.464 --> 00:55:18.065
<v Speaker 1>for example, okay, I have here a high

00:55:18.065 --> 00:55:20.385
<v Speaker 1>severity issue with this privilege container.

00:55:20.625 --> 00:55:22.384
<v Speaker 1>And, again, this is the same results you

00:55:22.384 --> 00:55:23.904
<v Speaker 1>could see in the in the CLI.

00:55:24.730 --> 00:55:25.290
<v Speaker 1>And

00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:28.090
<v Speaker 1>and, you know, you can see here, actually,

00:55:30.250 --> 00:55:30.810
<v Speaker 1>the

00:55:32.010 --> 00:55:34.010
<v Speaker 1>the results themselves. And and with the same

00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:35.050
<v Speaker 1>in the same UI,

00:55:36.135 --> 00:55:38.935
<v Speaker 1>you can get here also the same information.

00:55:38.935 --> 00:55:41.655
<v Speaker 1>Okay. What is the the problem in the

00:55:41.655 --> 00:55:44.135
<v Speaker 1>YAML file? Okay. You need to you need

00:55:44.135 --> 00:55:47.895
<v Speaker 1>to solve here. Okay. So, again, really important,

00:55:47.895 --> 00:55:49.720
<v Speaker 1>okay, to to give,

00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:52.920
<v Speaker 1>you know, to to the Kubescape users, okay,

00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:53.720
<v Speaker 1>information

00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:56.360
<v Speaker 1>to, you know, to help solve the problems,

00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:58.280
<v Speaker 1>okay, they are having in their

00:55:58.600 --> 00:55:59.400
<v Speaker 1>environment.

00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:01.000
<v Speaker 1>And, you know, you can also there is

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.600
<v Speaker 1>something, okay, I wanted to show here

00:56:03.234 --> 00:56:05.075
<v Speaker 1>that I think is really important. Okay? Because

00:56:05.075 --> 00:56:06.115
<v Speaker 1>if you remember,

00:56:06.755 --> 00:56:07.955
<v Speaker 1>I told you that

00:56:08.595 --> 00:56:10.755
<v Speaker 1>we we can see here two privileged containers.

00:56:10.755 --> 00:56:12.435
<v Speaker 1>Right? You can see an application,

00:56:12.515 --> 00:56:15.395
<v Speaker 1>okay, called recommendation service in the namespace called

00:56:15.395 --> 00:56:16.195
<v Speaker 1>Hipster.

00:56:16.675 --> 00:56:18.195
<v Speaker 1>Right? And

00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:20.940
<v Speaker 1>and you can see here also another called

00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:21.740
<v Speaker 1>Kubescape.

00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:23.500
<v Speaker 1>I think the you know,

00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:26.620
<v Speaker 1>although those who are viewing this stream, okay,

00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:28.620
<v Speaker 1>you already know heard about this.

00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:32.065
<v Speaker 1>And and it's in the Kubescape

00:56:32.705 --> 00:56:33.825
<v Speaker 1>KubeSystem

00:56:34.065 --> 00:56:35.025
<v Speaker 1>namespace.

00:56:35.505 --> 00:56:37.505
<v Speaker 1>And and again, you can see here that,

00:56:37.505 --> 00:56:38.785
<v Speaker 1>for example, in this case,

00:56:39.505 --> 00:56:41.745
<v Speaker 1>we are giving the users, okay,

00:56:42.705 --> 00:56:44.705
<v Speaker 1>a a light bulb, you've just asked,

00:56:45.770 --> 00:56:48.970
<v Speaker 1>that for that that we are recognizing

00:56:48.970 --> 00:56:51.050
<v Speaker 1>that this is usually a common failure. Okay?

00:56:51.050 --> 00:56:53.130
<v Speaker 1>This this test is usually faced because Kubescape

00:56:53.130 --> 00:56:53.770
<v Speaker 1>proxy

00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:54.650
<v Speaker 1>is

00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:57.609
<v Speaker 1>as of today, by design, it's a privileged

00:56:57.609 --> 00:56:59.770
<v Speaker 1>container. It needs to run as a privileged

00:56:59.770 --> 00:57:02.875
<v Speaker 1>container. But what you can do here, okay,

00:57:02.875 --> 00:57:03.595
<v Speaker 1>you can,

00:57:03.994 --> 00:57:07.115
<v Speaker 1>click here or here, okay, and create what

00:57:07.115 --> 00:57:09.194
<v Speaker 1>we call an exception. Okay. We can say

00:57:09.194 --> 00:57:10.155
<v Speaker 1>that, well,

00:57:11.035 --> 00:57:13.435
<v Speaker 1>I understand that this guy this workload have

00:57:13.435 --> 00:57:13.755
<v Speaker 1>failed.

00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:16.150
<v Speaker 1>But next time, I don't want to see

00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:18.310
<v Speaker 1>it as a failed workload. Okay? Because because

00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:20.630
<v Speaker 1>I understand I accept that this is this

00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:23.190
<v Speaker 1>is how it works. Okay? And I asked

00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:25.110
<v Speaker 1>this DevSecOps

00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:27.030
<v Speaker 1>or DevOps engineer

00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:29.350
<v Speaker 1>running this environment. I understand that this should

00:57:29.350 --> 00:57:31.015
<v Speaker 1>be like this. Okay? And I don't want

00:57:31.015 --> 00:57:33.895
<v Speaker 1>this to to affect my risk score. Okay?

00:57:33.895 --> 00:57:36.375
<v Speaker 1>Because I want to see my risk without

00:57:36.375 --> 00:57:36.935
<v Speaker 1>that.

00:57:37.815 --> 00:57:39.495
<v Speaker 1>And in this case, next time, okay, when

00:57:39.495 --> 00:57:41.415
<v Speaker 1>we are going to run Kubescape, okay, we'll

00:57:41.415 --> 00:57:43.495
<v Speaker 1>simply won't see, okay, this failure with the

00:57:43.495 --> 00:57:44.215
<v Speaker 1>Kubescape proxy.

00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:47.970
<v Speaker 1>And and the same goes okay for for

00:57:47.970 --> 00:57:51.010
<v Speaker 1>other so I can create an

00:57:51.010 --> 00:57:53.330
<v Speaker 1>exception for the whole namespace for a given

00:57:53.330 --> 00:57:55.810
<v Speaker 1>control or only for a given workload.

00:57:58.015 --> 00:58:00.095
<v Speaker 1>And and and this, you know through this,

00:58:00.095 --> 00:58:02.255
<v Speaker 1>you know, we are creating a workflow for

00:58:02.255 --> 00:58:03.695
<v Speaker 1>those who are refusing

00:58:03.775 --> 00:58:04.575
<v Speaker 1>clusters

00:58:06.175 --> 00:58:08.575
<v Speaker 1>and and want to, you know, want to

00:58:08.575 --> 00:58:09.375
<v Speaker 1>somewhat

00:58:09.695 --> 00:58:10.575
<v Speaker 1>accept

00:58:10.575 --> 00:58:13.220
<v Speaker 1>or or or, you know, create an exception

00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:16.500
<v Speaker 1>for for for specific workloads or namespaces.

00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:19.060
<v Speaker 1>Obviously, this is also supported in in within

00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:21.300
<v Speaker 1>within our our CLI, just a little bit

00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:23.859
<v Speaker 1>more messy to show it. So I hope

00:58:23.859 --> 00:58:25.859
<v Speaker 1>you forgive me that that I show this

00:58:25.859 --> 00:58:26.180
<v Speaker 1>way.

00:58:27.145 --> 00:58:29.145
<v Speaker 1>Up until now, everything is okay?

00:58:29.785 --> 00:58:30.985
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Great.

00:58:31.465 --> 00:58:34.905
<v Speaker 0>Very cool. I'm curious about the ARMOR best.

00:58:34.905 --> 00:58:36.505
<v Speaker 0>Like, you know, this

00:58:37.065 --> 00:58:40.520
<v Speaker 0>security landscape in Kubernetes is is continually

00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:42.200
<v Speaker 0>evolving ecosystem.

00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:43.880
<v Speaker 0>There's new CVEs all the time and new

00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:46.840
<v Speaker 0>security practices. Like there's a certain level of

00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:49.880
<v Speaker 0>fatigue that a DevOps operator or SRE could

00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:51.960
<v Speaker 0>get from trying to constantly

00:58:52.825 --> 00:58:55.865
<v Speaker 0>fight all these different vulnerabilities and but but

00:58:55.865 --> 00:58:58.265
<v Speaker 0>also allowing their development and their application teams

00:58:58.265 --> 00:59:00.745
<v Speaker 0>to be Yeah. Productive and increasing their velocity.

00:59:00.745 --> 00:59:02.505
<v Speaker 0>Like, is ARMOR best

00:59:02.665 --> 00:59:04.745
<v Speaker 0>a kind of opinionated way to try and

00:59:04.745 --> 00:59:05.945
<v Speaker 0>minimize that fatigue?

00:59:06.930 --> 00:59:07.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So

00:59:08.369 --> 00:59:09.890
<v Speaker 1>yes. First of all,

00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:12.770
<v Speaker 1>I I don't have good news, okay, for

00:59:12.770 --> 00:59:14.849
<v Speaker 1>all those who, you know, who have fatigue.

00:59:14.849 --> 00:59:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay?

00:59:15.890 --> 00:59:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Things won't be much better. Okay?

00:59:19.545 --> 00:59:21.545
<v Speaker 1>And yeah. And you're right. Okay. We are

00:59:21.545 --> 00:59:23.625
<v Speaker 1>trying to, you know, get some get our,

00:59:23.625 --> 00:59:23.945
<v Speaker 1>you know

00:59:24.585 --> 00:59:25.785
<v Speaker 1>not just, you know,

00:59:26.585 --> 00:59:28.744
<v Speaker 1>going after, you know, the NSA and mutual

00:59:28.744 --> 00:59:29.625
<v Speaker 1>recommendations,

00:59:29.625 --> 00:59:31.305
<v Speaker 1>but we are trying to create our own

00:59:31.305 --> 00:59:32.585
<v Speaker 1>own recommendation

00:59:32.585 --> 00:59:33.464
<v Speaker 1>package. Okay?

00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:39.460
<v Speaker 1>But but in in in for the static

00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:42.100
<v Speaker 1>part, okay, and and I I could totally

00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:44.340
<v Speaker 1>relate, you know, to your question, okay,

00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:46.660
<v Speaker 1>that

00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:49.845
<v Speaker 1>that we are trying to battle this this

00:59:49.845 --> 00:59:50.965
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming

00:59:51.285 --> 00:59:53.605
<v Speaker 1>stream of of vulnerabilities

00:59:53.605 --> 00:59:55.685
<v Speaker 1>and issues and information by

00:59:55.925 --> 00:59:59.205
<v Speaker 1>trying to build an open source project, okay,

00:59:59.205 --> 00:59:59.845
<v Speaker 1>which

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:02.970
<v Speaker 1>which can give you enough context to actual

01:00:02.970 --> 01:00:03.930
<v Speaker 1>information

01:00:04.570 --> 01:00:06.890
<v Speaker 1>that you will be able to handle most

01:00:06.890 --> 01:00:08.570
<v Speaker 1>of the things automatically.

01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay? So

01:00:09.850 --> 01:00:11.850
<v Speaker 1>or at least we we are able to

01:00:12.255 --> 01:00:14.734
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying to decide everything for you

01:00:14.734 --> 01:00:17.535
<v Speaker 1>as a as an SRE or DevOps engineer,

01:00:17.535 --> 01:00:19.454
<v Speaker 1>but but give you the most, you know,

01:00:19.454 --> 01:00:21.375
<v Speaker 1>you can have in a single

01:00:21.615 --> 01:00:24.015
<v Speaker 1>plain a pane of glass. Okay. So so

01:00:24.015 --> 01:00:25.750
<v Speaker 1>you have you can,

01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:28.950
<v Speaker 1>you know, can make as much less time

01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:30.390
<v Speaker 1>on this as, you know,

01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:33.509
<v Speaker 1>as you can. Okay. And not, you know,

01:00:33.509 --> 01:00:35.670
<v Speaker 1>not to relate not to stick too much

01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:37.670
<v Speaker 1>around these issues. Okay. Because

01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:39.990
<v Speaker 1>in in general, okay, this is really hard.

01:00:40.025 --> 01:00:42.425
<v Speaker 1>It's really, really hard. Okay? And and and

01:00:42.425 --> 01:00:44.185
<v Speaker 1>everyone understands that the

01:00:44.505 --> 01:00:46.265
<v Speaker 1>security, not just in Kubernetes.

01:00:46.265 --> 01:00:46.825
<v Speaker 1>Okay?

01:00:47.145 --> 01:00:49.145
<v Speaker 1>In in the modern world, security is hard

01:00:49.145 --> 01:00:50.185
<v Speaker 1>for everyone.

01:00:50.745 --> 01:00:52.505
<v Speaker 1>And and that but I do think that

01:00:52.505 --> 01:00:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes is is a great way, okay, and

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:56.000
<v Speaker 1>a great

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:57.040
<v Speaker 1>project,

01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:58.880
<v Speaker 1>okay, which really security

01:00:59.119 --> 01:01:01.119
<v Speaker 1>gives the most it can to to security

01:01:01.119 --> 01:01:03.920
<v Speaker 1>minded people and and help them with that.

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:06.720
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I guess the another way to phrase

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:08.240
<v Speaker 0>this would be if you want a secure

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:10.494
<v Speaker 0>system, just turn it off. If that's not

01:01:10.494 --> 01:01:11.295
<v Speaker 0>an option,

01:01:11.855 --> 01:01:13.215
<v Speaker 0>then use

01:01:13.215 --> 01:01:15.535
<v Speaker 0>these tools, use the armor best as a

01:01:15.535 --> 01:01:17.535
<v Speaker 0>guidance and a compass. But,

01:01:17.615 --> 01:01:20.415
<v Speaker 0>I think what's really important and a paraphrasing

01:01:20.415 --> 01:01:22.575
<v Speaker 0>you still here, but like everybody's,

01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:25.190
<v Speaker 0>it's gonna depend company to company, right? Like

01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:27.670
<v Speaker 0>there is no gold star for what security

01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:30.070
<v Speaker 0>posture is within your organization. You you really

01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:31.510
<v Speaker 0>have to just understand

01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:34.390
<v Speaker 0>what's going on in the software and then

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:36.765
<v Speaker 0>make those judgment calls yourself, I think is

01:01:36.845 --> 01:01:38.765
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Is really important for people to understand.

01:01:38.765 --> 01:01:41.485
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. But but, again okay. So so,

01:01:42.204 --> 01:01:44.125
<v Speaker 1>you know, think about it just a little

01:01:44.125 --> 01:01:46.445
<v Speaker 1>bit for today. Okay. So today, like,

01:01:46.924 --> 01:01:48.365
<v Speaker 1>I think that we

01:01:49.565 --> 01:01:52.330
<v Speaker 1>had in the in the credit security community,

01:01:52.330 --> 01:01:54.970
<v Speaker 1>we, like, we had two security

01:01:54.970 --> 01:01:57.850
<v Speaker 1>issues in the past month. Okay? So,

01:01:58.730 --> 01:02:01.050
<v Speaker 1>again, I'm I'm not good by remembering, you

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:03.210
<v Speaker 1>know, numbers. I know it's quite funny from

01:02:03.210 --> 01:02:04.810
<v Speaker 1>someone who's working in this industry,

01:02:05.355 --> 01:02:05.995
<v Speaker 1>But

01:02:06.315 --> 01:02:07.035
<v Speaker 1>but,

01:02:07.595 --> 01:02:10.075
<v Speaker 1>no, you had one big issue with Argo

01:02:10.075 --> 01:02:14.075
<v Speaker 1>CD. Okay? A directory travel travel so issue,

01:02:14.075 --> 01:02:16.555
<v Speaker 1>okay, which could be exploited by you know,

01:02:16.555 --> 01:02:19.115
<v Speaker 1>if you have Argo CD in your environment

01:02:19.115 --> 01:02:21.710
<v Speaker 1>and you are, you know, you're using some

01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:22.990
<v Speaker 1>malicious

01:02:23.869 --> 01:02:26.990
<v Speaker 1>chart, okay, or or, okay, to pull your

01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:28.270
<v Speaker 1>your stuff from,

01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:30.510
<v Speaker 1>then, you know, someone can

01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:33.070
<v Speaker 1>steal data from your cluster.

01:02:33.765 --> 01:02:36.724
<v Speaker 1>And the second was a container escape vulnerability

01:02:36.724 --> 01:02:38.005
<v Speaker 1>in the Linux kernel,

01:02:38.405 --> 01:02:40.964
<v Speaker 1>which was, you know, reported more than a

01:02:40.964 --> 01:02:41.685
<v Speaker 1>month ago.

01:02:42.005 --> 01:02:44.885
<v Speaker 1>And in both cases okay. So these were

01:02:44.885 --> 01:02:47.924
<v Speaker 1>great cases, I think, to understand, okay, that

01:02:47.924 --> 01:02:50.300
<v Speaker 1>that how complex these things are because

01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:52.220
<v Speaker 1>okay. First of if you don't have Argo

01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:55.020
<v Speaker 1>CD in your your Kubernetes cluster, okay,

01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:57.180
<v Speaker 1>then great. Okay.

01:02:57.580 --> 01:02:59.580
<v Speaker 1>You are not most likely, you are not

01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:01.180
<v Speaker 1>affected by this issue. Okay?

01:03:02.295 --> 01:03:04.615
<v Speaker 1>But most more you know, ArgoCD is is

01:03:04.615 --> 01:03:06.454
<v Speaker 1>a great tool, and and it's going into

01:03:06.454 --> 01:03:09.335
<v Speaker 1>more and more clusters. So many, many people

01:03:09.335 --> 01:03:10.775
<v Speaker 1>were thinking, well,

01:03:11.095 --> 01:03:13.095
<v Speaker 1>I do have a vulnerable ArgoCD

01:03:13.095 --> 01:03:15.494
<v Speaker 1>version. What do I do now? So the

01:03:15.494 --> 01:03:17.990
<v Speaker 1>next step is simply to start, on the

01:03:17.990 --> 01:03:19.750
<v Speaker 1>one hand, update ArgoCD.

01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:20.710
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,

01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:23.109
<v Speaker 1>you know, you have to check whether you've

01:03:23.109 --> 01:03:24.390
<v Speaker 1>been as affected.

01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:26.230
<v Speaker 1>Have you been what are the list of

01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:28.550
<v Speaker 1>of help charts or or GitHub Git

01:03:30.695 --> 01:03:32.455
<v Speaker 1>repositories you've been pulling from.

01:03:32.935 --> 01:03:35.095
<v Speaker 1>And and there use it starts to be

01:03:35.095 --> 01:03:37.175
<v Speaker 1>really hard, okay, because you have to go

01:03:37.175 --> 01:03:37.975
<v Speaker 1>understand.

01:03:38.695 --> 01:03:40.375
<v Speaker 1>If you're managing one cluster,

01:03:40.615 --> 01:03:42.455
<v Speaker 1>you may be able to do even two,

01:03:42.535 --> 01:03:44.535
<v Speaker 1>like, three, four, five, and and

01:03:44.799 --> 01:03:47.039
<v Speaker 1>and, you know, tens or or even hundreds

01:03:47.039 --> 01:03:48.480
<v Speaker 1>of of developers,

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:51.440
<v Speaker 1>this can be start to become very, very,

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:52.160
<v Speaker 1>very hard.

01:03:52.799 --> 01:03:54.720
<v Speaker 1>The same goes for for, you know, for

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.400
<v Speaker 1>the Linux kernel

01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:59.200
<v Speaker 1>container escape issue. Okay? Because

01:03:59.685 --> 01:04:01.765
<v Speaker 1>it was even even harder because,

01:04:02.405 --> 01:04:04.885
<v Speaker 1>you know, everyone who uses Kubernetes most likely

01:04:04.885 --> 01:04:08.565
<v Speaker 1>is running on Linux kernels. So Linux kernels

01:04:08.565 --> 01:04:11.445
<v Speaker 1>are, you know, even more common than than

01:04:11.445 --> 01:04:12.245
<v Speaker 1>ArgoCity.

01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:14.700
<v Speaker 1>So you cannot say that, well, I don't

01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:16.780
<v Speaker 1>have Linux kernel, therefore, I'm fine.

01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:18.940
<v Speaker 1>And

01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:21.500
<v Speaker 1>you start to have, you know, update your

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:23.740
<v Speaker 1>kernel, which is a pain it's a real

01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:25.980
<v Speaker 1>pain. Okay? So it's it's really, really hard,

01:04:26.415 --> 01:04:29.215
<v Speaker 1>Even you're when you're yet running managed clusters.

01:04:29.855 --> 01:04:31.455
<v Speaker 1>And and

01:04:31.455 --> 01:04:33.055
<v Speaker 1>you start to to have a look at,

01:04:33.055 --> 01:04:35.135
<v Speaker 1>okay, how what is the attack angle? Okay?

01:04:35.135 --> 01:04:36.735
<v Speaker 1>How an attacker can get

01:04:37.135 --> 01:04:37.535
<v Speaker 1>to this?

01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:41.550
<v Speaker 1>And there, the privileged containers comes into the,

01:04:42.430 --> 01:04:45.390
<v Speaker 1>know, into the play, okay, because privileged containers

01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:47.230
<v Speaker 1>were more vulnerable to this.

01:04:48.190 --> 01:04:50.349
<v Speaker 1>I can actually tell you that even if

01:04:50.349 --> 01:04:52.270
<v Speaker 1>you're looking into the container landscape,

01:04:52.905 --> 01:04:54.265
<v Speaker 1>okay, actually,

01:04:54.905 --> 01:04:57.225
<v Speaker 1>other container orchestrators,

01:04:57.225 --> 01:04:59.305
<v Speaker 1>okay, which we are right now not pulling

01:04:59.305 --> 01:05:00.905
<v Speaker 1>by by their name,

01:05:01.385 --> 01:05:04.105
<v Speaker 1>were less vulnerable, okay, to this container escape

01:05:04.105 --> 01:05:04.985
<v Speaker 1>than actually

01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:07.780
<v Speaker 1>the the Kubernetes

01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:11.300
<v Speaker 1>because Kubernetes was disabling seccomp by default

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:15.460
<v Speaker 1>and and others weren't. So and this this

01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:17.220
<v Speaker 1>had an effect. So it's really, really hard

01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:19.540
<v Speaker 1>and really, really hard to understand, you know,

01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:20.660
<v Speaker 1>these all these small things.

01:05:21.285 --> 01:05:24.085
<v Speaker 1>And therefore, I think that going forward,

01:05:24.405 --> 01:05:27.125
<v Speaker 1>the only way we can ham handle these

01:05:27.125 --> 01:05:28.805
<v Speaker 1>things and not be overwhelmed

01:05:29.125 --> 01:05:31.765
<v Speaker 1>is to connect more and more information and,

01:05:31.765 --> 01:05:33.045
<v Speaker 1>you know, somehow, you know,

01:05:33.789 --> 01:05:36.270
<v Speaker 1>replicate, you know, the the security,

01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:41.789
<v Speaker 1>you know, all those people who understand security

01:05:41.789 --> 01:05:44.750
<v Speaker 1>really well and understand Kubernetes really well and

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:46.750
<v Speaker 1>and let them code

01:05:47.055 --> 01:05:48.415
<v Speaker 1>this knowledge

01:05:48.494 --> 01:05:52.175
<v Speaker 1>into some regular rule or something like that

01:05:52.335 --> 01:05:54.655
<v Speaker 1>and enable others simply choose just to take

01:05:54.655 --> 01:05:57.694
<v Speaker 1>this information and get whether they have problems

01:05:57.694 --> 01:05:59.694
<v Speaker 1>or get an answer, yes or no, whether

01:05:59.694 --> 01:06:01.055
<v Speaker 1>they have problems or not.

01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:03.460
<v Speaker 1>That's my take.

01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:05.700
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Thank you for sharing that. That was

01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:06.260
<v Speaker 0>great.

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:08.500
<v Speaker 1>So

01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:11.700
<v Speaker 1>another thing, okay, I wanted to show you

01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:12.340
<v Speaker 0>okay. Again,

01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:15.474
<v Speaker 1>live demo. I'm I'm sorry. So we have

01:06:15.474 --> 01:06:17.475
<v Speaker 1>we have we have our own

01:06:18.275 --> 01:06:19.395
<v Speaker 1>image scanning

01:06:20.195 --> 01:06:22.995
<v Speaker 1>facility, okay, you can install in your cluster.

01:06:23.234 --> 01:06:25.155
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to

01:06:25.715 --> 01:06:27.395
<v Speaker 1>for that, what we are doing is we

01:06:27.395 --> 01:06:27.955
<v Speaker 1>are installing

01:06:28.770 --> 01:06:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Kubescape and other Kubescape components

01:06:31.890 --> 01:06:33.890
<v Speaker 1>into your cluster with Helm.

01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:36.130
<v Speaker 1>And this will do two things. One is

01:06:36.130 --> 01:06:39.330
<v Speaker 1>will enable you to scan your images in

01:06:39.330 --> 01:06:40.290
<v Speaker 1>your cluster

01:06:40.610 --> 01:06:41.250
<v Speaker 1>every day.

01:06:42.585 --> 01:06:45.065
<v Speaker 1>And the second thing it it does, it

01:06:45.065 --> 01:06:46.665
<v Speaker 1>also scans your

01:06:47.385 --> 01:06:50.505
<v Speaker 1>your Kube API just as you saw before

01:06:50.505 --> 01:06:52.585
<v Speaker 1>in a constant manner. So in other words,

01:06:52.585 --> 01:06:55.385
<v Speaker 1>if you like Kubescape and want to work

01:06:55.385 --> 01:06:56.105
<v Speaker 1>with it

01:06:56.425 --> 01:06:57.465
<v Speaker 1>in

01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:00.119
<v Speaker 1>a permanent manner. Okay? And and

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:04.520
<v Speaker 1>wait a second. Do I have Helm here?

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:07.640
<v Speaker 1>What a mess.

01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:12.600
<v Speaker 1>What a mess. Okay. Nice. Nice. Yeah. We

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.575
<v Speaker 1>we yeah. We got to this

01:07:15.055 --> 01:07:16.095
<v Speaker 1>at the end.

01:07:19.775 --> 01:07:22.015
<v Speaker 1>Wow. Wow. No. Yeah.

01:07:22.255 --> 01:07:24.815
<v Speaker 0>On arsenal next helm is helm dash bin.

01:07:25.135 --> 01:07:26.735
<v Speaker 0>Helm is actually something else.

01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh, well. A dash bin. Sorry. Dash dash

01:07:30.790 --> 01:07:31.590
<v Speaker 1>bin. Sorry.

01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:34.870
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It may be an AUR. Do you

01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:35.350
<v Speaker 0>have

01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:37.830
<v Speaker 0>an AUR package manager?

01:07:38.550 --> 01:07:39.350
<v Speaker 1>AUR.

01:07:39.350 --> 01:07:41.955
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I I mentioned Like, yeah. Or something.

01:07:41.955 --> 01:07:44.595
<v Speaker 1>Pretty pretty pretty new machine. Oh.

01:07:45.475 --> 01:07:48.275
<v Speaker 1>And haven't been able to to start to

01:07:48.275 --> 01:07:50.595
<v Speaker 1>set up things here. So, yeah, this is

01:07:50.595 --> 01:07:52.515
<v Speaker 1>the but let let me get back, okay,

01:07:52.515 --> 01:07:54.595
<v Speaker 1>because we have enough data. Okay? So let's

01:07:54.515 --> 01:07:56.160
<v Speaker 1>for example, let's say we have we have

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:58.640
<v Speaker 1>installed, okay, this Helm chart, okay,

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:01.520
<v Speaker 1>in in our cluster. Okay? And you will

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:02.880
<v Speaker 1>have daily scans,

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:04.960
<v Speaker 1>okay, of the of your in this case,

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.560
<v Speaker 1>for example, in this G K cluster when

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:08.319
<v Speaker 1>you can see the progress of your cluster

01:08:08.305 --> 01:08:09.345
<v Speaker 1>day by day.

01:08:09.985 --> 01:08:12.065
<v Speaker 1>And and not just that, but we're we're

01:08:12.065 --> 01:08:15.105
<v Speaker 1>starting to have image vulnerability information

01:08:15.105 --> 01:08:17.024
<v Speaker 1>from your cluster. So you're we are installing

01:08:17.024 --> 01:08:20.064
<v Speaker 1>our our vulnerability scanner inside your system. We

01:08:20.064 --> 01:08:23.460
<v Speaker 1>are scanning every every workload looking for for

01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:25.940
<v Speaker 1>image vulnerabilities issues. For example, I want to

01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:27.060
<v Speaker 1>see only critical

01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:28.420
<v Speaker 1>problems,

01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:30.260
<v Speaker 1>for example, with RCEs.

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:34.420
<v Speaker 1>And I can see that, for example, in

01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:37.300
<v Speaker 1>the the same recommendation service we've seen before

01:08:37.505 --> 01:08:38.784
<v Speaker 1>which had

01:08:41.024 --> 01:08:43.344
<v Speaker 1>which which was a privileged component.

01:08:43.665 --> 01:08:45.904
<v Speaker 1>Okay. I can see here that it also

01:08:45.904 --> 01:08:49.344
<v Speaker 1>have, you know, a CV with critical vulnerabilities,

01:08:49.585 --> 01:08:51.425
<v Speaker 1>although it's not an RCE.

01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Having said, it is a problem.

01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:58.300
<v Speaker 1>So, again, this is something you're will relatively

01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:01.100
<v Speaker 1>new. Okay? And and and we are, you

01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:02.860
<v Speaker 1>know, we are still working on it and

01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:04.140
<v Speaker 1>working it more interesting.

01:09:04.854 --> 01:09:06.854
<v Speaker 1>But in order to for you to understand

01:09:06.854 --> 01:09:09.015
<v Speaker 1>that we are adding more and more and

01:09:09.015 --> 01:09:12.135
<v Speaker 1>more information input to to this system to

01:09:12.135 --> 01:09:14.774
<v Speaker 1>have a more interesting, you know, results and

01:09:14.774 --> 01:09:16.054
<v Speaker 1>more helpful results

01:09:16.535 --> 01:09:19.500
<v Speaker 1>for you. Another thing is is our RBAC

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:21.739
<v Speaker 1>visualizer which was, you know, started as a

01:09:21.739 --> 01:09:23.419
<v Speaker 1>pet project for one of us,

01:09:23.979 --> 01:09:24.619
<v Speaker 1>here.

01:09:24.939 --> 01:09:27.499
<v Speaker 1>And we said to ourselves, well, you know,

01:09:27.739 --> 01:09:28.300
<v Speaker 1>guys,

01:09:28.939 --> 01:09:30.859
<v Speaker 1>RBAC in Kubernetes,

01:09:30.859 --> 01:09:32.779
<v Speaker 1>which is, you know, really today a a

01:09:32.779 --> 01:09:33.659
<v Speaker 1>a a a

01:09:34.219 --> 01:09:36.274
<v Speaker 1>part of of of, you know, of Kubernetes

01:09:36.274 --> 01:09:39.234
<v Speaker 1>security because every modern cluster uses

01:09:39.475 --> 01:09:41.474
<v Speaker 1>RBAC authorization

01:09:42.594 --> 01:09:44.755
<v Speaker 1>for it. It it is it is great,

01:09:44.755 --> 01:09:46.915
<v Speaker 1>but it's a mess. It's really hard to

01:09:46.915 --> 01:09:50.229
<v Speaker 1>handle. Okay? So so what we've decided is

01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:52.310
<v Speaker 1>simply, you know, create a a a,

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:54.870
<v Speaker 1>you know, a visualization

01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:57.510
<v Speaker 1>for for what you have for your, you

01:09:57.510 --> 01:09:59.830
<v Speaker 1>know, for, in your cluster, what you see

01:09:59.830 --> 01:10:01.430
<v Speaker 1>in your Rawkode. So in this case, what

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:02.070
<v Speaker 1>you can see here,

01:10:02.784 --> 01:10:04.144
<v Speaker 1>you can see here

01:10:04.545 --> 01:10:07.985
<v Speaker 1>a service account, okay, called Kubesystem

01:10:08.304 --> 01:10:10.224
<v Speaker 1>sorry, Kubesystem default

01:10:10.545 --> 01:10:12.945
<v Speaker 1>service account of the Kubesystem namespace,

01:10:14.224 --> 01:10:16.385
<v Speaker 1>which is bound to the

01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:19.309
<v Speaker 1>cluster admin role,

01:10:19.389 --> 01:10:22.510
<v Speaker 1>okay, which is obviously, it's a pretty high

01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:25.630
<v Speaker 1>privileged role, okay, in in in Kubernetes, which

01:10:25.630 --> 01:10:27.949
<v Speaker 1>is actually the highest privileged role. And you

01:10:27.949 --> 01:10:30.190
<v Speaker 1>can see that that also there is another

01:10:30.190 --> 01:10:32.510
<v Speaker 1>group connected to the same role,

01:10:33.065 --> 01:10:36.185
<v Speaker 1>okay, which is called system masters group.

01:10:36.665 --> 01:10:40.745
<v Speaker 1>And they have, like, access to every resource.

01:10:40.745 --> 01:10:42.425
<v Speaker 1>You can see here the asterisk.

01:10:42.985 --> 01:10:44.824
<v Speaker 1>It can execute every

01:10:45.225 --> 01:10:47.145
<v Speaker 1>work on every resource,

01:10:47.145 --> 01:10:47.465
<v Speaker 1>okay,

01:10:49.770 --> 01:10:51.770
<v Speaker 1>in this cluster. So it we can see

01:10:51.770 --> 01:10:54.250
<v Speaker 1>how, actually, how the map, the mapping of

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:56.570
<v Speaker 1>of the what we call the administrator is

01:10:56.570 --> 01:10:59.370
<v Speaker 1>happening. Okay? But but on their hand, okay,

01:10:59.370 --> 01:11:02.185
<v Speaker 1>we can start, start to, you know, your

01:11:02.185 --> 01:11:04.585
<v Speaker 1>lookup more interesting thing. Okay. We can we

01:11:04.585 --> 01:11:06.665
<v Speaker 1>can so that who has access to Kubernetes

01:11:06.665 --> 01:11:07.465
<v Speaker 1>secrets?

01:11:07.705 --> 01:11:10.425
<v Speaker 1>So we can who can do GET on

01:11:12.425 --> 01:11:13.785
<v Speaker 1>on secrets. Okay?

01:11:16.190 --> 01:11:16.910
<v Speaker 1>And

01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:21.230
<v Speaker 1>asking who can perform. So you're getting a

01:11:21.230 --> 01:11:22.750
<v Speaker 1>graph, okay, of all,

01:11:23.470 --> 01:11:25.790
<v Speaker 1>the roles and cluster roles in in the

01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:28.190
<v Speaker 1>environment who have access to resource

01:11:28.190 --> 01:11:29.150
<v Speaker 1>secrets.

01:11:29.150 --> 01:11:29.470
<v Speaker 1>Okay?

01:11:30.195 --> 01:11:32.034
<v Speaker 1>You can see here that on the one

01:11:32.034 --> 01:11:34.114
<v Speaker 1>hand, where is our

01:11:34.915 --> 01:11:35.874
<v Speaker 1>basic,

01:11:36.835 --> 01:11:38.835
<v Speaker 1>admin role. I forgot. I don't see it

01:11:38.835 --> 01:11:40.114
<v Speaker 1>for now, but, for example,

01:11:40.435 --> 01:11:41.954
<v Speaker 1>we have different roles.

01:11:42.514 --> 01:11:44.514
<v Speaker 1>Let's

01:11:44.514 --> 01:11:47.770
<v Speaker 1>try to layout by by type. Okay. We

01:11:47.770 --> 01:11:49.929
<v Speaker 1>can see here that in the middle, we

01:11:49.929 --> 01:11:51.530
<v Speaker 1>can see here all the roles,

01:11:52.650 --> 01:11:55.210
<v Speaker 1>and we can see all the subjects, okay,

01:11:55.530 --> 01:11:57.210
<v Speaker 1>bound to those roles

01:11:57.449 --> 01:11:58.170
<v Speaker 1>here.

01:11:58.250 --> 01:12:00.010
<v Speaker 1>K. We can see here that we have

01:12:00.010 --> 01:12:00.969
<v Speaker 1>a a user

01:12:01.825 --> 01:12:05.265
<v Speaker 1>called Kubescape controller manager because, obviously, a built

01:12:05.265 --> 01:12:05.824
<v Speaker 1>in

01:12:06.225 --> 01:12:08.705
<v Speaker 1>user in in in Minikube.

01:12:08.945 --> 01:12:11.345
<v Speaker 1>And it has it is bound to to

01:12:11.345 --> 01:12:13.825
<v Speaker 1>to this role called Kubescape controller manager, which

01:12:13.825 --> 01:12:15.745
<v Speaker 1>has update, get, delete, and create

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:18.400
<v Speaker 1>authorization

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.080
<v Speaker 1>over Kubernetes secrets.

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:21.440
<v Speaker 1>Okay?

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:22.400
<v Speaker 1>And

01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:25.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember if I have here something

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:28.080
<v Speaker 1>more interesting, but for let's take

01:12:29.034 --> 01:12:30.234
<v Speaker 1>let's take another,

01:12:30.795 --> 01:12:31.354
<v Speaker 1>query.

01:12:31.755 --> 01:12:34.715
<v Speaker 1>K? For example, we've made some pre built

01:12:34.715 --> 01:12:37.835
<v Speaker 1>queries. For example, who can exec in into

01:12:37.835 --> 01:12:41.195
<v Speaker 1>pods. Okay? Exec exec integration into pods. Okay.

01:12:41.195 --> 01:12:43.195
<v Speaker 1>It's, again, it's an important thing, okay, to

01:12:43.195 --> 01:12:43.514
<v Speaker 1>control.

01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:46.830
<v Speaker 1>And we can see here, okay, that that

01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:48.510
<v Speaker 1>the only one who can do it is

01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:51.230
<v Speaker 1>the, cluster admin. So we are more or

01:12:51.230 --> 01:12:54.030
<v Speaker 1>less fine. Okay? But, for example, if we've

01:12:54.190 --> 01:12:56.590
<v Speaker 1>would if there was some kind of a

01:12:56.910 --> 01:13:00.725
<v Speaker 1>project which which introduces its own authorizations

01:13:00.885 --> 01:13:02.005
<v Speaker 1>into the system,

01:13:02.645 --> 01:13:03.364
<v Speaker 1>okay,

01:13:04.005 --> 01:13:05.285
<v Speaker 1>we see here

01:13:05.445 --> 01:13:07.525
<v Speaker 1>many interesting things because,

01:13:08.645 --> 01:13:10.900
<v Speaker 1>for example, I've we've been talking with a

01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:11.859
<v Speaker 1>lot of users,

01:13:12.099 --> 01:13:13.780
<v Speaker 1>and they said that they started to play

01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:15.219
<v Speaker 1>around, okay, with this,

01:13:15.619 --> 01:13:16.500
<v Speaker 1>with this,

01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:18.659
<v Speaker 1>Rawkode visualizer.

01:13:19.139 --> 01:13:19.780
<v Speaker 1>And

01:13:20.099 --> 01:13:22.579
<v Speaker 1>and it turned out that they found out

01:13:22.579 --> 01:13:26.195
<v Speaker 1>the different RPAK and authorizations were were there

01:13:26.195 --> 01:13:27.954
<v Speaker 1>in in their system,

01:13:28.755 --> 01:13:31.874
<v Speaker 1>which they didn't know, know about before.

01:13:32.195 --> 01:13:32.755
<v Speaker 1>So,

01:13:33.715 --> 01:13:35.955
<v Speaker 1>so it's really, really important, okay, so also

01:13:35.955 --> 01:13:38.480
<v Speaker 1>to know what are the kind of authorizations

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:39.760
<v Speaker 1>you are having in your system. And I

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:42.560
<v Speaker 1>RBAC Visualizer is a great great way to

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:44.160
<v Speaker 1>to start to understand,

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:47.360
<v Speaker 1>what do you have, in your environment.

01:13:49.935 --> 01:13:52.255
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I'm going to stop here also for

01:13:52.255 --> 01:13:53.295
<v Speaker 1>taking questions.

01:13:54.655 --> 01:13:56.895
<v Speaker 0>That is the coolest and most important thing

01:13:56.895 --> 01:13:59.375
<v Speaker 0>I've seen in oil, the rbag visualizer. Like,

01:13:59.375 --> 01:14:02.014
<v Speaker 0>see when we're talking about exploring Kubernetes clusters.

01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:04.420
<v Speaker 0>Like everything in the cluster is primarily two

01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:06.900
<v Speaker 0>dimensional and kubectl get is fine.

01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:10.420
<v Speaker 0>RBAC on other hand, because we've got names

01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:13.300
<v Speaker 0>based objects, cluster based objects, we've the aggregation

01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:15.940
<v Speaker 0>layer for doing, you know, grouping certain permissions.

01:14:16.505 --> 01:14:19.224
<v Speaker 0>You can't well, at least it's very difficult

01:14:19.545 --> 01:14:21.945
<v Speaker 0>to understand who has access to what they

01:14:21.945 --> 01:14:23.545
<v Speaker 0>can do. Now, of course, you can use

01:14:23.545 --> 01:14:25.784
<v Speaker 0>Kubescape control all through AMI and get

01:14:26.025 --> 01:14:28.425
<v Speaker 0>a scope thing from an individual user, but

01:14:28.425 --> 01:14:29.704
<v Speaker 0>being able to look at that across an

01:14:29.704 --> 01:14:32.800
<v Speaker 0>entire cluster, this visualizer is just amazing. Like,

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:34.880
<v Speaker 0>whoever built this is is just is now

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:37.119
<v Speaker 0>my new hero. This is amazing. Yeah. Yeah.

01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:39.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to I I think that's yeah.

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:40.800
<v Speaker 1>It it it it's simply a great

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:44.000
<v Speaker 1>it's a wonder it was a wonderful idea.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.805
<v Speaker 1>Okay. And and and I the credit needs

01:14:46.805 --> 01:14:47.925
<v Speaker 1>to go also to,

01:14:49.045 --> 01:14:51.285
<v Speaker 1>Youssef and and the team from the Ankara

01:14:51.285 --> 01:14:54.005
<v Speaker 1>University who helped us to build it because

01:14:54.005 --> 01:14:55.605
<v Speaker 1>they did an awesome job

01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:59.040
<v Speaker 1>on this. Okay. They're coming from a fraction

01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:00.320
<v Speaker 1>from the graph

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.639
<v Speaker 1>graph theory

01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:03.840
<v Speaker 1>direction,

01:15:04.239 --> 01:15:06.000
<v Speaker 1>and I think that they did made a

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.039
<v Speaker 1>really, really great

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:08.320
<v Speaker 1>tool here.

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:10.935
<v Speaker 1>And I just switched switched to another cluster

01:15:10.935 --> 01:15:12.135
<v Speaker 1>because my

01:15:12.375 --> 01:15:15.494
<v Speaker 1>mini cube was pretty, you know, pretty boring.

01:15:15.494 --> 01:15:15.974
<v Speaker 1>But

01:15:16.534 --> 01:15:19.415
<v Speaker 1>but for example, okay, in this case, okay,

01:15:19.415 --> 01:15:20.775
<v Speaker 1>you can see that in

01:15:22.935 --> 01:15:24.135
<v Speaker 1>let's try who can.

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:28.320
<v Speaker 1>Let's try to pre make query. Okay. Who

01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:30.640
<v Speaker 1>can exit into pods. So we found so

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:33.360
<v Speaker 1>many interesting things, for example, which Google

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:37.760
<v Speaker 1>installs. Okay. In in this case, okay, you

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:40.995
<v Speaker 1>can see that not just cluster admin has

01:15:40.995 --> 01:15:42.355
<v Speaker 1>access to

01:15:43.075 --> 01:15:46.355
<v Speaker 1>to executing into pods, but also there is

01:15:46.355 --> 01:15:48.275
<v Speaker 1>a g k common webhooks

01:15:48.995 --> 01:15:49.635
<v Speaker 1>user

01:15:50.035 --> 01:15:52.755
<v Speaker 1>with the cluster role g k common webhooks

01:15:52.755 --> 01:15:54.920
<v Speaker 1>cluster role, which also have

01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:57.880
<v Speaker 1>access to executing

01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:00.280
<v Speaker 1>into into pods. And, yeah,

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:02.040
<v Speaker 1>this is this

01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:04.360
<v Speaker 1>is great to understand how things are working

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:05.080
<v Speaker 1>around.

01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:06.520
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. For sure.

01:16:07.245 --> 01:16:09.005
<v Speaker 0>What what I like about Kubescape here, I

01:16:09.005 --> 01:16:10.365
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if this is a phrase

01:16:10.365 --> 01:16:13.245
<v Speaker 0>or not at this Kubernetes security industry. Kubescape

01:16:13.245 --> 01:16:15.485
<v Speaker 0>seems like it's a full spectrum tool. Like,

01:16:15.485 --> 01:16:17.725
<v Speaker 0>you know, we've looked at mass configuration. We've

01:16:17.725 --> 01:16:20.440
<v Speaker 0>looked at image scanning. There's the RBAC visualizer,

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:22.040
<v Speaker 0>we have the integration with all these security

01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:22.919
<v Speaker 0>frameworks.

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:26.519
<v Speaker 0>And it's really tackling the security thing from

01:16:26.599 --> 01:16:28.440
<v Speaker 0>all the different angles that people have to

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:30.280
<v Speaker 0>be concerned about with their Kubernetes customers. And

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:32.440
<v Speaker 0>I think that's really important. That single tool

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:33.320
<v Speaker 0>can deliver,

01:16:33.785 --> 01:16:35.385
<v Speaker 0>like like you said in the the market

01:16:35.385 --> 01:16:37.705
<v Speaker 0>message and and and the GitHub repository,

01:16:37.785 --> 01:16:39.784
<v Speaker 0>a single pane of glass for Kubernetes.

01:16:40.585 --> 01:16:41.225
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:16:41.465 --> 01:16:42.105
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:16:42.345 --> 01:16:44.825
<v Speaker 1>And and, yeah, you again, so I I

01:16:44.985 --> 01:16:46.585
<v Speaker 1>you know, I'm not trying to say that

01:16:46.585 --> 01:16:48.585
<v Speaker 1>we've solved all the problems. Okay? We are

01:16:48.585 --> 01:16:49.385
<v Speaker 1>far from them.

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:53.740
<v Speaker 1>And we are also you know, we are

01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:56.700
<v Speaker 1>we are trying to make some something really,

01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:57.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,

01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:01.900
<v Speaker 1>something really new and and very, very useful.

01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:02.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay?

01:17:03.364 --> 01:17:06.324
<v Speaker 1>And, therefore, if, you know, if anyone who's

01:17:06.324 --> 01:17:07.605
<v Speaker 1>here, okay, and

01:17:08.965 --> 01:17:11.445
<v Speaker 1>wants, you know, be involved in the project,

01:17:11.445 --> 01:17:13.364
<v Speaker 1>okay, we are welcoming you know, we have

01:17:13.364 --> 01:17:14.804
<v Speaker 1>a great Discord channel.

01:17:16.085 --> 01:17:18.260
<v Speaker 1>And, also, you know, our GitHub is is

01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:19.300
<v Speaker 1>very, you know,

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:21.219
<v Speaker 1>busy.

01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:23.780
<v Speaker 1>So, we really invite anyone who want to

01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:26.020
<v Speaker 1>join us in the journey, okay, and creating

01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:28.179
<v Speaker 1>this great, open source tool,

01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:30.100
<v Speaker 1>to join our ranks.

01:17:31.235 --> 01:17:31.955
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:17:33.395 --> 01:17:34.915
<v Speaker 0>Should I move back over to just video

01:17:34.915 --> 01:17:36.595
<v Speaker 0>mode? Are we done with the demonstration for

01:17:36.595 --> 01:17:38.915
<v Speaker 0>today? Yeah. We are more than done.

01:17:39.315 --> 01:17:42.275
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Sorry. Awesome. Sweet. I'll I'll make sure

01:17:42.275 --> 01:17:44.355
<v Speaker 0>to include links to the Discord and the

01:17:44.355 --> 01:17:46.230
<v Speaker 0>GitHub repository in the show notes. You know,

01:17:46.230 --> 01:17:48.230
<v Speaker 0>we do like to encourage people. People are

01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:50.070
<v Speaker 0>always watching these videos and asking how can

01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:51.510
<v Speaker 0>they be involved. So it's it's great that

01:17:51.510 --> 01:17:53.910
<v Speaker 0>Kubescape is is actively looking for people to

01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:56.310
<v Speaker 0>come and, I guess, provide suggestions, documentation,

01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:58.550
<v Speaker 0>and code and and just talk. Right? The

01:17:58.550 --> 01:18:01.175
<v Speaker 0>Discord server is there for people to share

01:18:01.175 --> 01:18:02.775
<v Speaker 0>their stories about security.

01:18:03.575 --> 01:18:04.375
<v Speaker 1>Completely.

01:18:04.535 --> 01:18:06.295
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. This is very important.

01:18:06.775 --> 01:18:09.335
<v Speaker 1>Really important. I think that the feedback is

01:18:09.335 --> 01:18:10.054
<v Speaker 1>sometimes

01:18:10.455 --> 01:18:12.055
<v Speaker 1>I know it's, you know, it's a little

01:18:12.055 --> 01:18:13.840
<v Speaker 1>bit funny to hear, but sometimes the good

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:16.320
<v Speaker 1>feedback can even go further than than the

01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:17.679
<v Speaker 1>actual code itself.

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:21.040
<v Speaker 1>It it can be so important to understand,

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:23.280
<v Speaker 1>okay, the how the people are using and

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:26.175
<v Speaker 1>at Kubescape and what are their problems and

01:18:26.175 --> 01:18:27.614
<v Speaker 1>how they want to

01:18:28.335 --> 01:18:30.575
<v Speaker 1>how we can solve another problem they haven't,

01:18:30.575 --> 01:18:33.135
<v Speaker 1>you know, they have which is related or

01:18:33.135 --> 01:18:35.935
<v Speaker 1>or or how did we did things wrong.

01:18:35.935 --> 01:18:38.575
<v Speaker 1>Okay? Because sometimes we might, you know, we

01:18:38.575 --> 01:18:40.820
<v Speaker 1>might did something which wasn't you know, we

01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:42.660
<v Speaker 1>didn't it's right, and we need to fix

01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:43.139
<v Speaker 1>it.

01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:46.659
<v Speaker 1>So any input is where is good input.

01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:49.380
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Last question for you. I forgot to

01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:51.300
<v Speaker 0>ask during the demo because the RBAC visual

01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:54.260
<v Speaker 0>issues the RBAC visualization thing just struck me

01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:56.665
<v Speaker 0>as awesome. But has anything that you've shown

01:18:56.665 --> 01:18:57.225
<v Speaker 0>us

01:18:58.105 --> 01:19:00.345
<v Speaker 0>paid for? Is is this all free?

01:19:01.225 --> 01:19:03.945
<v Speaker 1>So what everything I've shown you is free.

01:19:03.945 --> 01:19:04.505
<v Speaker 1>Okay?

01:19:05.545 --> 01:19:07.945
<v Speaker 1>Even our sales version is free. Okay? We

01:19:07.945 --> 01:19:10.585
<v Speaker 1>have a limitation of

01:19:09.650 --> 01:19:10.849
<v Speaker 1>of notes,

01:19:11.170 --> 01:19:13.409
<v Speaker 1>which can be seen on the ARM website,

01:19:13.409 --> 01:19:15.010
<v Speaker 1>okay, that we have a limitation

01:19:16.210 --> 01:19:18.770
<v Speaker 1>of notes, okay, obviously, because we this can

01:19:18.770 --> 01:19:19.969
<v Speaker 1>be a lot of data

01:19:20.210 --> 01:19:21.170
<v Speaker 1>to handle for us.

01:19:22.575 --> 01:19:24.495
<v Speaker 1>But but, actually, you know, it's

01:19:25.535 --> 01:19:28.735
<v Speaker 1>we we Kubescape is is free, and the

01:19:28.735 --> 01:19:30.975
<v Speaker 1>CLI tool is free. It's going to be

01:19:31.375 --> 01:19:34.015
<v Speaker 1>it's still going to be free forever. And,

01:19:34.015 --> 01:19:37.135
<v Speaker 1>hopefully, you know, fingers crossed that we've submitted

01:19:37.470 --> 01:19:40.270
<v Speaker 1>cubescape for CNCF sandboxing.

01:19:41.150 --> 01:19:43.030
<v Speaker 1>And on the March

01:19:43.030 --> 01:19:43.870
<v Speaker 1>8,

<v Speaker 1>the TOC will sit on it, and, hopefully,

01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:49.550
<v Speaker 1>we'll accept cubescape as a CNCF project. So

01:19:51.125 --> 01:19:53.765
<v Speaker 1>we'll become a a CNCF project hopefully very

01:19:53.765 --> 01:19:54.324
