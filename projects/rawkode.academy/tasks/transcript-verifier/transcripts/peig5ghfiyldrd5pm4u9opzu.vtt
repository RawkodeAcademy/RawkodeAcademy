00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.530
<v Speaker 0>Alright. And welcome back to the Rawkode Academy.

00:01:36.965 --> 00:01:38.485
<v Speaker 0>This is Thursday,

00:01:38.805 --> 00:01:41.445
<v Speaker 0>which typically means it's cluster day, and

00:01:41.525 --> 00:01:43.285
<v Speaker 0>typically it is cluster day. We're doing cluster

00:01:43.285 --> 00:01:45.765
<v Speaker 0>today. We have two wonderful guests joining us

00:01:45.765 --> 00:01:46.405
<v Speaker 0>to

00:01:46.645 --> 00:01:49.685
<v Speaker 0>fix some rather broken Kubernetes clusters.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.110
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to be joined by two guests

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.710
<v Speaker 0>in just a moment, but we do have

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.630
<v Speaker 0>to start with a little bit of housekeeping.

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:57.869
<v Speaker 0>And I was a little bit flustered because

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.789
<v Speaker 0>one of my guests disappeared, but fortunately he's

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.270
<v Speaker 0>just dialed back in. So phew, panic over.

00:02:02.975 --> 00:02:04.975
<v Speaker 0>So before we get started, there are two

00:02:04.975 --> 00:02:07.055
<v Speaker 0>sponsors of Clustard and I wanna thank them

00:02:07.055 --> 00:02:07.775
<v Speaker 0>both.

00:02:08.255 --> 00:02:10.175
<v Speaker 0>Teleport have been sponsoring us for a while

00:02:10.175 --> 00:02:12.415
<v Speaker 0>now. You're definitely no stranger to Teleport. We

00:02:12.415 --> 00:02:14.735
<v Speaker 0>use it every single week on Clustard.

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:17.720
<v Speaker 0>Teleport allows us to use GitHub to SSH

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.560
<v Speaker 0>to all of the machines, which are bare

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.440
<v Speaker 0>metal machines,

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.560
<v Speaker 0>and allows us to pair and collaborate

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.879
<v Speaker 0>via SSH systems, typing them to the same

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.275
<v Speaker 0>terminal to work out what is wrong. Teleport

00:02:28.275 --> 00:02:30.035
<v Speaker 0>is an amazing product that does much more

00:02:30.035 --> 00:02:32.275
<v Speaker 0>than just SSH access. So you should go

00:02:32.275 --> 00:02:34.755
<v Speaker 0>check it out at rockode.lifeteleport

00:02:34.755 --> 00:02:37.474
<v Speaker 0>and support the show. That would be amazing.

00:02:37.474 --> 00:02:39.075
<v Speaker 0>Thank you all very much.

00:02:39.795 --> 00:02:41.715
<v Speaker 0>All right, next up we have Equinix Metal

00:02:41.715 --> 00:02:44.049
<v Speaker 0>who are also sponsored by Clustered as well.

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.370
<v Speaker 0>And they've always prevented the hardware for this,

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.730
<v Speaker 0>so it was a no brainer that they

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.650
<v Speaker 0>wanted to be more involved. And we use

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.810
<v Speaker 0>some pretty chunky machines for Clustered because it

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.250
<v Speaker 0>makes it more fun. We've got tons of

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.489
<v Speaker 0>cores, tons of RAM, bare metal is a

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.045
<v Speaker 0>fantastic way to check out Kubernetes.

00:02:58.045 --> 00:03:01.005
<v Speaker 0>So check out Rawkode. Livemetal.

00:03:01.245 --> 00:03:03.725
<v Speaker 0>Also, if you're already in the Equinix portal

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:05.085
<v Speaker 0>and already know everything that you need to

00:03:05.085 --> 00:03:06.365
<v Speaker 0>know, then just drop it in the voucher

00:03:06.365 --> 00:03:07.565
<v Speaker 0>code Rawkode,

00:03:07.565 --> 00:03:10.605
<v Speaker 0>and this will get you 200 USD

00:03:10.605 --> 00:03:12.569
<v Speaker 0>and credits. This will allow you to spin

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.970
<v Speaker 0>up one of their configurations of machines, depending

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.409
<v Speaker 0>on what size you pick for up to

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:17.530
<v Speaker 0>a hundred hours.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.129
<v Speaker 0>So go have some fun and play with

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.770
<v Speaker 0>that too.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.370
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.010
<v Speaker 0>There's one more thing. We have a competition,

00:03:26.815 --> 00:03:28.095
<v Speaker 0>which I'll get to in a second because

00:03:28.095 --> 00:03:29.135
<v Speaker 0>I've lost this thing.

00:03:29.855 --> 00:03:31.535
<v Speaker 0>Let's introduce a guest first.

<v Speaker 1>Friends, I'm I'm so excited to be joining

00:04:01.795 --> 00:04:04.435
<v Speaker 1>Rawkode stream today. I have wanted to do

00:04:04.995 --> 00:04:07.155
<v Speaker 1>a a clustered stream since probably the first

00:04:07.155 --> 00:04:07.555
<v Speaker 1>episode.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.620
<v Speaker 1>I've been a a huge fan of this

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.180
<v Speaker 1>series.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.820
<v Speaker 1>My name is Lee Kapili. I live here

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.860
<v Speaker 1>in Denver,

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.140
<v Speaker 1>and I have a history of writing software

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.860
<v Speaker 1>to do operations stuff on platform engineering teams,

00:04:20.675 --> 00:04:22.355
<v Speaker 1>places like DIRECTV,

00:04:22.435 --> 00:04:24.035
<v Speaker 1>Beatport, and AT and T.

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:26.914
<v Speaker 1>I did a stint as a developer advocate,

00:04:26.914 --> 00:04:29.794
<v Speaker 1>a developer experience engineer with the Weaveworks team,

00:04:30.035 --> 00:04:32.675
<v Speaker 1>also contributing to the Flux project and Kubernetes

00:04:32.675 --> 00:04:35.634
<v Speaker 1>projects. And now I work with team Tanzu

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.900
<v Speaker 1>on a bunch of cool stuff with a

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.260
<v Speaker 1>bunch of very humbling other developer advocates

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.980
<v Speaker 1>and a staff dev advocate now. So pretty

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.540
<v Speaker 1>stoked about that and stoked to still be

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.820
<v Speaker 1>contributing to this awesome community and breaking stuff

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.340
<v Speaker 1>just as much as I can fix it.

00:04:52.785 --> 00:04:55.105
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Thank you, Lee. Marcus?

00:04:55.825 --> 00:04:56.545
<v Speaker 2>Cool.

00:04:56.785 --> 00:05:00.065
<v Speaker 2>Hey, everyone. I'm Marcus. I'm a platform engineer

00:05:00.065 --> 00:05:01.425
<v Speaker 2>with Giant Swarm.

00:05:01.665 --> 00:05:04.145
<v Speaker 2>I'm based here in The UK.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't really have as much to say

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.680
<v Speaker 2>as leaders.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.400
<v Speaker 2>So let's just crack on.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.680
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Brave guests. Thank you very much. Now

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.600

<v Speaker 0>if you've already entered, go back and check

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.920
<v Speaker 0>the link again now because

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.080
<v Speaker 0>there's a new tweet that you could retweet

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.600
<v Speaker 0>that will get you 100

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.634
<v Speaker 0>extra entries into the vote. We will be

00:05:48.634 --> 00:05:51.275
<v Speaker 0>doing the draw after both clusters are fixed

00:05:51.275 --> 00:05:53.675
<v Speaker 0>or if both clusters are fixed, we're gonna

00:05:53.675 --> 00:05:56.155
<v Speaker 0>find out. So Rawkode.live/1

00:05:56.155 --> 00:05:57.995
<v Speaker 0>will get yourselves a t shirt.

00:05:58.715 --> 00:05:59.355
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:05:59.835 --> 00:06:01.755
<v Speaker 0>Now before we went live, you can go

00:06:01.755 --> 00:06:03.354
<v Speaker 0>right back from center now, Lee. It's all

00:06:03.354 --> 00:06:03.595
<v Speaker 0>good.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.870
<v Speaker 0>We're gonna jump straight over and get these

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.350
<v Speaker 0>things started. Lee is gonna go first.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.390
<v Speaker 0>So I am going to open a session

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:13.030
<v Speaker 0>on

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.270
<v Speaker 0>Marcus control plane.

00:06:18.764 --> 00:06:21.005
<v Speaker 0>Give that just a second. Now I gave

00:06:21.005 --> 00:06:23.485
<v Speaker 0>you both access. I modified your roles using

00:06:23.485 --> 00:06:25.164
<v Speaker 0>the Teleport UI and give you access to

00:06:25.164 --> 00:06:26.764
<v Speaker 0>every single machine. So you should be able

00:06:26.764 --> 00:06:28.765
<v Speaker 0>to see the active session

00:06:28.845 --> 00:06:30.845
<v Speaker 0>and join. I see that you're logged into

00:06:30.845 --> 00:06:31.805
<v Speaker 1>this one now.

00:06:32.365 --> 00:06:32.925
<v Speaker 0>I am here.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.700
<v Speaker 1>These past two days have been the first

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.500
<v Speaker 1>time I've used Teleport ever, and I've been

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.140
<v Speaker 1>really excited getting to learn to use it.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.100
<v Speaker 0>It's such a great tool. I mean, I

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.100
<v Speaker 0>know they sponsor the show, but I I

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.940
<v Speaker 0>would use Teleport regardless. It's amazing.

00:06:48.465 --> 00:06:48.705
<v Speaker 0>So

00:06:49.745 --> 00:06:51.425
<v Speaker 1>Okay. I'm in here.

00:06:51.825 --> 00:06:52.625
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:06:52.865 --> 00:06:54.385
<v Speaker 0>Set up your KubeConfig.

00:06:54.385 --> 00:06:56.225
<v Speaker 0>Check for our control planning. You have forty

00:06:56.225 --> 00:06:57.745
<v Speaker 0>minutes. Best of luck, Lee.

00:06:58.385 --> 00:06:59.265
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:06:59.265 --> 00:07:02.225
<v Speaker 1>Just give me a second here. I'm gonna

00:07:02.225 --> 00:07:03.665
<v Speaker 1>do a little probably a little bit more

00:07:03.665 --> 00:07:06.610
<v Speaker 1>than just setting up my kube config.

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:11.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to pull up my GitHub

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:14.370
<v Speaker 1>on my machine and just get

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:15.090
<v Speaker 1>this

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.090
<v Speaker 1>repository URL.

00:07:18.854 --> 00:07:19.735
<v Speaker 1>Simple.

00:07:20.694 --> 00:07:23.254
<v Speaker 1>Just need a little bit more of a

00:07:23.254 --> 00:07:25.095
<v Speaker 1>ergonomic experience here.

00:07:25.735 --> 00:07:26.695
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:07:28.694 --> 00:07:29.574
<v Speaker 1>Git clone.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:31.570
<v Speaker 1>Paste.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh, did I

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.850
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It does take the terminal. I need

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:38.130
<v Speaker 1>to, like, reset it.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:39.330
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:41.410
<v Speaker 1>Clone.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:42.610
<v Speaker 1>And then

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.995
<v Speaker 0>Wait a minute. So every time we have

00:07:44.995 --> 00:07:47.475
<v Speaker 0>issues with the size, reset is gonna fix

00:07:47.475 --> 00:07:47.955
<v Speaker 0>it?

00:07:49.395 --> 00:07:50.915
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That's one of the things that you

00:07:50.915 --> 00:07:52.835
<v Speaker 1>can do. And I actually learned that, I

00:07:52.835 --> 00:07:54.115
<v Speaker 1>think, from a commenter.

00:07:55.235 --> 00:07:56.755
<v Speaker 1>I may have been doing a little bit

00:07:56.755 --> 00:07:58.915
<v Speaker 1>of studying over the past couple of days

00:07:58.915 --> 00:08:01.090
<v Speaker 1>to get some inspiration and to make sure

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:02.449
<v Speaker 1>that I wasn't gonna do the same things

00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:03.730
<v Speaker 1>as everyone else. So

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:07.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That is they're permanently naughty because

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.889
<v Speaker 0>XDRIP JS has caused us many issues with

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:11.009
<v Speaker 0>shading EarthView.

00:08:11.169 --> 00:08:11.650
<v Speaker 0>So

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.875
<v Speaker 1>fun story here. I'm actually joined in from

00:08:14.875 --> 00:08:17.595
<v Speaker 1>my own terminal using the TSH command line

00:08:17.595 --> 00:08:18.155
<v Speaker 1>tool,

00:08:18.475 --> 00:08:21.995
<v Speaker 1>and I had to recompile it to override

00:08:21.995 --> 00:08:23.755
<v Speaker 1>a behavior that was

00:08:24.155 --> 00:08:26.075
<v Speaker 1>not working with the ACLs.

00:08:26.875 --> 00:08:29.030
<v Speaker 0>Ah, so you've managed did you manage to

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:30.870
<v Speaker 0>fix the TSH join command?

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I fixed it to

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:36.549
<v Speaker 1>a place where they would merge it, but,

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.750
<v Speaker 1>yes, the answer is yes. Marcus, I think

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:40.790
<v Speaker 0>you're in trouble. A

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:41.830
<v Speaker 0>little bit.

00:08:43.715 --> 00:08:46.835
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So so I am I got full

00:08:46.835 --> 00:08:49.075
<v Speaker 1>copy and paste ability right here. I'm I'm

00:08:49.075 --> 00:08:50.995
<v Speaker 1>at home. I'm right here in my WSL

00:08:50.995 --> 00:08:53.235
<v Speaker 1>terminal. Like, we are we're ready to buy.

00:08:53.315 --> 00:08:55.315
<v Speaker 1>So, what do I gotta do here?

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.339
<v Speaker 1>Well, I I

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.500
<v Speaker 1>guess I could try to exec my bash.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.740
<v Speaker 1>I see. Oh, sick. Look at this. Look

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.100
<v Speaker 1>at this. Almost like I'm, like, ready to

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.459
<v Speaker 1>go here now. Alright. And then, let's go

00:09:08.459 --> 00:09:09.980
<v Speaker 1>ahead and just, like,

00:09:11.055 --> 00:09:12.655
<v Speaker 1>do one of these dudes.

00:09:14.575 --> 00:09:16.255
<v Speaker 1>If I can type properly,

00:09:16.815 --> 00:09:18.175
<v Speaker 1>which I cannot

00:09:18.175 --> 00:09:18.975
<v Speaker 1>still.

00:09:20.095 --> 00:09:21.295
<v Speaker 1>Group config.

00:09:21.615 --> 00:09:23.055
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna be

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:25.470
<v Speaker 1>let's get out of the string for a

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:26.110
<v Speaker 1>second,

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Etsy Kubernetes

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:30.990
<v Speaker 1>admin comp.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:34.670
<v Speaker 1>And then I will pop that into a

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:37.895
<v Speaker 1>string, and then let's just echo that and

00:09:37.895 --> 00:09:39.255
<v Speaker 1>append it to

00:09:40.215 --> 00:09:42.055
<v Speaker 1>my bash r c

00:09:44.775 --> 00:09:47.015
<v Speaker 1>d just in case we end end up,

00:09:47.015 --> 00:09:49.815
<v Speaker 1>like, losing a teleport session or something here,

00:09:49.815 --> 00:09:50.855
<v Speaker 1>we have to re log in that I

00:09:50.855 --> 00:09:51.975
<v Speaker 1>don't need to do this

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.420
<v Speaker 1>koop s h. How about that?

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.980
<v Speaker 1>And while we're at it, I'm gonna add

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.500
<v Speaker 1>an alias as well.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.220
<v Speaker 0>Good call. Is it even worth adding an

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.700
<v Speaker 1>alias? K. Marcus has left me access to

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.820
<v Speaker 1>koop c t l. Thank you.

00:10:07.505 --> 00:10:09.025
<v Speaker 1>K. Kubectl,

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:12.465
<v Speaker 1>and then we'll do kubectl

00:10:12.465 --> 00:10:13.665
<v Speaker 1>completions

00:10:15.025 --> 00:10:15.905
<v Speaker 1>dash,

00:10:15.905 --> 00:10:17.745
<v Speaker 1>but that needs to be

00:10:18.945 --> 00:10:20.065
<v Speaker 1>oh, but my

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.820
<v Speaker 1>I see. I need to, like, size my

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:27.380
<v Speaker 1>terminal a little bit better here because yours

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.060
<v Speaker 1>is a bit smaller than mine.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully, I can get this a little closer.

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:33.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:10:39.324 --> 00:10:40.365
<v Speaker 1>K. S k.

00:10:43.725 --> 00:10:44.365
<v Speaker 0>Source.

00:10:45.004 --> 00:10:45.725
<v Speaker 0>K.

00:10:46.365 --> 00:10:48.764
<v Speaker 0>Russell's saying 5% of your time is already

00:10:48.764 --> 00:10:50.685
<v Speaker 0>gone. But sometimes it's worth setting up your

00:10:50.685 --> 00:10:52.560
<v Speaker 0>tools. Right? You mean how much time you

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.240
<v Speaker 1>can save if I have it on times

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.839
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna type k.

00:10:56.079 --> 00:10:57.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And then

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.440
<v Speaker 1>this is another thing I had to reference

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.120
<v Speaker 1>from my own dash r c.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.639
<v Speaker 1>Start kubectl.

00:11:08.515 --> 00:11:09.315
<v Speaker 1>K.

00:11:11.235 --> 00:11:12.435
<v Speaker 1>Completions.

00:11:12.435 --> 00:11:15.315
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. There we go. Completion.

00:11:15.875 --> 00:11:16.675
<v Speaker 1>Cool.

00:11:16.675 --> 00:11:17.475
<v Speaker 1>And then

00:11:18.355 --> 00:11:19.715
<v Speaker 1>might as well

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:23.530
<v Speaker 1>put that in my bash r c as

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:25.850
<v Speaker 1>well. I probably shoulda had that in there

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:27.130
<v Speaker 1>already, but

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:31.210
<v Speaker 1>bash r c.

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:33.130
<v Speaker 0>Toda.

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:34.890
<v Speaker 0>We Oh, you put it in there. Alright.

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:36.325
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Yeah.

00:11:36.485 --> 00:11:37.365
<v Speaker 1>Cube.

00:11:38.325 --> 00:11:39.605
<v Speaker 1>Cool. Alright.

00:11:43.285 --> 00:11:44.565
<v Speaker 1>K. Alright.

00:11:45.845 --> 00:11:48.405
<v Speaker 1>Let's go see where we're at. So

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:49.970
<v Speaker 1>did I not

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.850
<v Speaker 0>I don't think you have exported config.

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:57.730
<v Speaker 1>Does not have the resource

00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:58.850
<v Speaker 1>type node.

00:11:58.850 --> 00:11:59.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Cool.

00:12:01.505 --> 00:12:03.825
<v Speaker 1>Do we have any resource types at all?

00:12:04.465 --> 00:12:06.865
<v Speaker 1>And can I even get maybe, like, the

00:12:06.865 --> 00:12:08.705
<v Speaker 1>cluster info to further

00:12:08.945 --> 00:12:11.185
<v Speaker 1>cluster info dump doesn't have the resource type

00:12:11.185 --> 00:12:11.905
<v Speaker 1>services,

00:12:12.145 --> 00:12:14.225
<v Speaker 1>so we cannot see what the Kubernetes service

00:12:14.225 --> 00:12:16.830
<v Speaker 1>IP address is? At this point, I'm kinda

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:19.470
<v Speaker 1>curious. I might go into the

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:21.390
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:22.350
<v Speaker 1>manifestor

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:24.990
<v Speaker 1>and just check a look at the kube

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:26.430
<v Speaker 1>API server flags.

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Seems reasonable. Right? Because, like, maybe we, like,

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.070
<v Speaker 1>disabled some APIs here or something.

00:12:31.685 --> 00:12:33.445
<v Speaker 1>That's kinda my first guess.

00:12:33.925 --> 00:12:35.605
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that I'm thinking is maybe

00:12:35.605 --> 00:12:38.084
<v Speaker 1>I don't have access to the discovery API,

00:12:38.084 --> 00:12:39.925
<v Speaker 1>so then I don't have access to, like,

00:12:40.005 --> 00:12:41.605
<v Speaker 1>Kube API resources.

00:12:43.125 --> 00:12:44.645
<v Speaker 1>So it could be like an RBAC thing.

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:51.870
<v Speaker 1>Let's

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:52.350
<v Speaker 1>see.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:54.990
<v Speaker 0>If you can use less as a pager,

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:56.670
<v Speaker 0>it just means we can follow your your

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.545
<v Speaker 0>scanning as well. Oh, I see. Yeah. Okay.

00:12:59.545 --> 00:13:01.625
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Because my terminal has its own pager.

00:13:02.745 --> 00:13:04.105
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I can do that.

00:13:05.305 --> 00:13:06.185
<v Speaker 2>Sweet. I

00:13:08.185 --> 00:13:09.065
<v Speaker 1>don't remember to do that.

00:13:09.959 --> 00:13:12.759
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I don't see any I don't remember

00:13:12.759 --> 00:13:14.839
<v Speaker 1>what the flag is to, like, enable particular

00:13:14.839 --> 00:13:17.480
<v Speaker 1>API groups and stuff. I believe it would

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.000
<v Speaker 1>have to be done on the API server

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.480
<v Speaker 1>because that's where all of, like, admission and

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.560
<v Speaker 1>looking up API groups happens, and I don't

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.785
<v Speaker 1>see anything in here that, like, looks super

00:13:25.785 --> 00:13:26.905
<v Speaker 1>out of the ordinary.

00:13:28.345 --> 00:13:30.905
<v Speaker 1>So the next thing that I'm interested in

00:13:30.905 --> 00:13:33.065
<v Speaker 1>is, like, maybe I can ask

00:13:34.425 --> 00:13:35.305
<v Speaker 1>who

00:13:35.465 --> 00:13:36.105
<v Speaker 1>I am.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.200
<v Speaker 1>And I need to find a resource where

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.880
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna, like, give me an error message

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.720
<v Speaker 1>or something that tells me who I am,

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.720
<v Speaker 1>unless I can figure out

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.240
<v Speaker 1>a

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.760
<v Speaker 0>Well, you can run off can I on

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.000
<v Speaker 0>its own, and it'll give you a metric

00:13:53.505 --> 00:13:56.305
<v Speaker 0>normally? No? Well, I thought it did.

00:13:58.625 --> 00:14:01.105
<v Speaker 1>I don't I I don't know what the

00:14:01.105 --> 00:14:03.425
<v Speaker 1>command for that is, but I've seen it

00:14:03.425 --> 00:14:06.145
<v Speaker 1>done before. Maybe chat will chime in. And

00:14:07.505 --> 00:14:08.625
<v Speaker 1>but, I mean, I can

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.090
<v Speaker 1>it's just unfortunate if there's no resources. But

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:14.090
<v Speaker 1>then, actually, you know what's what's special about

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:16.010
<v Speaker 1>this, though, is that resources don't need to

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:19.210
<v Speaker 1>exist in the cluster for you to actually

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:20.970
<v Speaker 1>bind against them in RBAC.

00:14:22.345 --> 00:14:24.905
<v Speaker 1>So I should still be able to, like,

00:14:24.905 --> 00:14:26.745
<v Speaker 1>say, like, can I get pods?

00:14:26.985 --> 00:14:31.065
<v Speaker 1>And this is telling me that this is

00:14:33.865 --> 00:14:34.185
<v Speaker 1>okay.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm not expecting to see an NGINX

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:38.880
<v Speaker 1>server

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.560
<v Speaker 1>error coming back

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:44.080
<v Speaker 1>from anything Kube Huddle related. So

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:48.399
<v Speaker 1>I believe that we are being misdirected to

00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:49.839
<v Speaker 1>someone from the funky.

00:14:51.095 --> 00:14:53.175
<v Speaker 1>Think it's very take a look at the

00:14:53.175 --> 00:14:54.135
<v Speaker 1>kube config.

00:14:54.775 --> 00:14:57.815
<v Speaker 1>That's inside of Etsy Kubernetes manifest admin

00:14:57.815 --> 00:14:58.615
<v Speaker 1>conf

00:14:58.615 --> 00:15:00.855
<v Speaker 1>is, I believe, what we are using.

00:15:01.655 --> 00:15:02.535
<v Speaker 0>It is indeed.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:07.480
<v Speaker 1>So let's cat the admin conf

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.800
<v Speaker 1>or, I guess,

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.520
<v Speaker 1>less the admin conf.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.040
<v Speaker 1>Did I oh. Yeah.

00:15:21.745 --> 00:15:25.265
<v Speaker 1>So that's a server IP that's listening on

00:15:25.265 --> 00:15:26.865
<v Speaker 1>port four four three, which is not the

00:15:26.865 --> 00:15:28.225
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes default.

00:15:28.945 --> 00:15:31.505
<v Speaker 1>But there is something listening on 443, which

00:15:31.505 --> 00:15:35.505
<v Speaker 1>I'm imagining is, like, some NGINX container or

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:35.810
<v Speaker 1>system d unit or something.

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:39.170
<v Speaker 1>And, like, it's worth looking into what that

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:41.329
<v Speaker 1>thing is just to indulge

00:15:41.329 --> 00:15:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Marcus' ego a little bit.

00:15:43.649 --> 00:15:44.290
<v Speaker 1>So

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.490
<v Speaker 1>yeah. I mean, I guess, like, some ways

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:48.769
<v Speaker 1>that I could look at that is if

00:15:48.769 --> 00:15:50.635
<v Speaker 1>I have net stat, then maybe I could,

00:15:50.635 --> 00:15:53.515
<v Speaker 1>like, net stat plant and then grep for

00:15:53.675 --> 00:15:54.555
<v Speaker 1>NGINX.

00:15:55.115 --> 00:15:57.275
<v Speaker 1>And I see that there's an NGINX process

00:15:57.275 --> 00:15:59.995
<v Speaker 1>listening on four four three. Indeed. I don't

00:15:59.995 --> 00:16:02.315
<v Speaker 1>know what necessarily is running that,

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.780
<v Speaker 1>but I could also check to see if

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:18.460
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's a kubectl

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.460
<v Speaker 1>or something.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:12.620
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not.

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:13.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.

00:16:15.835 --> 00:16:20.235
<v Speaker 1>Moxygo says that the kubectl plugin for the

00:16:20.235 --> 00:16:21.915
<v Speaker 1>matrix thing is

00:16:23.915 --> 00:16:26.075
<v Speaker 1>off can I list? Now I'm not even

00:16:26.075 --> 00:16:27.915
<v Speaker 1>gonna try that before we fix the kubectl,

00:16:27.915 --> 00:16:29.755
<v Speaker 1>though. So

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:34.110
<v Speaker 1>just wanna maybe see if I can get

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:37.630
<v Speaker 1>an editor assuming that my Linux server is

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:38.270
<v Speaker 1>working,

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:41.230
<v Speaker 1>which it seems so far, like, apt is

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:43.795
<v Speaker 1>pretty happy with that. So that's good. I

00:16:43.795 --> 00:16:46.035
<v Speaker 1>like this editor. It's like a like, kind

00:16:46.035 --> 00:16:48.835
<v Speaker 1>of nano but bigger. So

00:16:49.235 --> 00:16:50.995
<v Speaker 1>you know? Hence the name micro.

00:16:51.715 --> 00:16:55.075
<v Speaker 1>Micro. Yeah. And so I might just go

00:16:55.075 --> 00:16:58.080
<v Speaker 1>and micro the admin conf and

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.240
<v Speaker 1>add a six here and see if maybe

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:08.319
<v Speaker 1>we are now potentially talking to Kubernetes.

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:12.000
<v Speaker 1>So there's nothing there, and I might then

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.654
<v Speaker 1>go check to see

00:17:14.135 --> 00:17:15.174
<v Speaker 1>if

00:17:16.454 --> 00:17:17.174
<v Speaker 1>oh,

00:17:17.335 --> 00:17:19.014
<v Speaker 1>Crackle config

00:17:19.655 --> 00:17:20.614
<v Speaker 1>sets.

00:17:22.694 --> 00:17:24.375
<v Speaker 1>Was it endpoint?

00:17:24.375 --> 00:17:25.655
<v Speaker 0>Runtime dash endpoint.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.160
<v Speaker 1>Time

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:32.799
<v Speaker 1>dash

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.240
<v Speaker 1>endpoint,

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.840
<v Speaker 1>and then I need to set it to

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.440
<v Speaker 1>Unix socket,

00:17:40.715 --> 00:17:41.755
<v Speaker 1>which is, like,

00:17:42.075 --> 00:17:44.555
<v Speaker 1>var run container

00:17:44.555 --> 00:17:48.155
<v Speaker 1>d container d sock. Cool. Yep.

00:17:49.675 --> 00:17:52.315
<v Speaker 1>So maybe let's go look to see if

00:17:52.315 --> 00:17:53.595
<v Speaker 1>there's some pods here.

00:17:53.915 --> 00:17:54.155
<v Speaker 1>And

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:57.990
<v Speaker 1>it looks like the scheduler and the controller

00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.950
<v Speaker 1>Meowager

00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.990
<v Speaker 1>are

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.710
<v Speaker 1>up, but the API server doesn't oh, here

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:04.950
<v Speaker 1>it is. Okay. But then

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:07.910
<v Speaker 1>the API server was modified.

00:18:08.865 --> 00:18:10.705
<v Speaker 1>I'm just deducing that because

00:18:11.105 --> 00:18:11.985
<v Speaker 1>was

00:18:11.985 --> 00:18:13.905
<v Speaker 1>probably spun up that forty eight hours ago,

00:18:13.905 --> 00:18:14.705
<v Speaker 1>and then here we have

00:18:15.425 --> 00:18:17.105
<v Speaker 1>you know? But does have a state of

00:18:17.105 --> 00:18:18.865
<v Speaker 0>not ready for all of those

00:18:19.345 --> 00:18:19.745
<v Speaker 0>containers.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I don't remember if those are supposed

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.440
<v Speaker 1>to be ready, but that's good to know.

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:25.919
<v Speaker 1>So

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.320
<v Speaker 1>let's go ahead and

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.640
<v Speaker 1>get the containers instead,

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:33.920
<v Speaker 1>which is

00:18:34.825 --> 00:18:36.905
<v Speaker 1>okay. So there's no containers,

00:18:37.465 --> 00:18:38.185
<v Speaker 1>which

00:18:38.345 --> 00:18:39.465
<v Speaker 1>indicates to me

00:18:39.865 --> 00:18:42.265
<v Speaker 1>that if CRI is up,

00:18:42.745 --> 00:18:46.585
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's something in container b that's not

00:18:46.585 --> 00:18:47.865
<v Speaker 1>configured properly

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:50.409
<v Speaker 1>or, you know, we're not able

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:56.409
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. You've missed yourself, Lee.

00:18:59.289 --> 00:19:00.009
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.

00:19:00.169 --> 00:19:01.130
<v Speaker 1>Can you still hear me?

00:19:01.945 --> 00:19:03.305
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. We can hear you now. You were

00:19:03.305 --> 00:19:04.425
<v Speaker 0>muted for a second. My,

00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:07.545
<v Speaker 1>headphones died.

00:19:07.785 --> 00:19:08.585
<v Speaker 1>I

00:19:08.585 --> 00:19:09.225
<v Speaker 1>I

00:19:09.465 --> 00:19:10.985
<v Speaker 1>should have charged this last night, but I

00:19:10.985 --> 00:19:13.465
<v Speaker 1>guess I didn't. Hopefully, audio is okay. It's

00:19:13.465 --> 00:19:14.905
<v Speaker 0>alright. Yeah. Don't worry about it.

00:19:15.705 --> 00:19:16.025
<v Speaker 1>Cool.

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:17.090
<v Speaker 1>So,

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:20.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking since we can't create container sandboxes

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:22.210
<v Speaker 1>and KubernetesM depends on containers,

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:25.090
<v Speaker 1>that's the reason why Kubernetes is not up

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:25.730
<v Speaker 1>right now.

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:27.970
<v Speaker 1>And, we'll have to go and look at

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:29.490
<v Speaker 1>why ContainerD is complaining.

00:19:30.125 --> 00:19:33.325
<v Speaker 1>So I think container d in this setup

00:19:33.325 --> 00:19:35.405
<v Speaker 1>probably runs with the system d unit since

00:19:35.405 --> 00:19:37.245
<v Speaker 1>we're on a Ubuntu system.

00:19:37.485 --> 00:19:39.645
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna, I guess. Yeah. System d is

00:19:39.645 --> 00:19:40.205
<v Speaker 1>our init.

00:19:43.799 --> 00:19:44.600
<v Speaker 1>Russell,

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.760
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned that Kubelet might not be looking

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.200
<v Speaker 1>at the manifest directory.

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.679
<v Speaker 1>But even if Kubelet is not looking at

00:19:50.679 --> 00:19:53.240
<v Speaker 1>the manifest directory, there are pods here that

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.600
<v Speaker 1>are inside of CRI.

00:19:55.425 --> 00:19:57.185
<v Speaker 1>So the Kubelet is

00:19:57.425 --> 00:20:00.385
<v Speaker 1>reporting that that we want, like, an API

00:20:00.385 --> 00:20:01.025
<v Speaker 1>server.

00:20:01.425 --> 00:20:04.545
<v Speaker 1>I haven't checked, like, the the spec here,

00:20:05.185 --> 00:20:07.425
<v Speaker 1>but I'm thinking we can

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:10.810
<v Speaker 1>if maybe we're thinking that the manifestor isn't

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:12.490
<v Speaker 1>up to date or it's looking somewhere else,

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:14.250
<v Speaker 1>we can check that out later. And I'm

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:16.730
<v Speaker 1>gonna keep looking into the container d,

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:18.409
<v Speaker 1>problem potentially,

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:19.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing,

00:20:20.985 --> 00:20:23.544
<v Speaker 1>which if I do, like, a CTR

00:20:23.785 --> 00:20:24.585
<v Speaker 1>CLS

00:20:24.585 --> 00:20:27.865
<v Speaker 1>inside of the Kate's IO namespace,

00:20:28.905 --> 00:20:30.425
<v Speaker 1>assuming that I actually know how to use

00:20:30.425 --> 00:20:31.385
<v Speaker 1>container d,

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:34.585
<v Speaker 1>then here we see

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.640
<v Speaker 1>there are

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.840
<v Speaker 1>image there's containers.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:40.320
<v Speaker 1>But

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.360
<v Speaker 1>so

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.120
<v Speaker 1>what is happening here then? Why are there

00:20:47.935 --> 00:20:48.975
<v Speaker 1>pods

00:20:49.455 --> 00:20:50.415
<v Speaker 1>inside

00:20:51.455 --> 00:20:52.815
<v Speaker 1>of CRI,

00:20:53.615 --> 00:20:55.215
<v Speaker 1>but then there's no

00:20:56.015 --> 00:20:56.975
<v Speaker 1>containers?

00:20:58.255 --> 00:20:59.455
<v Speaker 1>That seems odd to me.

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:01.769
<v Speaker 1>Is that because

00:21:01.929 --> 00:21:04.169
<v Speaker 1>the container v ones are just

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:05.929
<v Speaker 1>hot sandboxes?

00:21:07.049 --> 00:21:08.490
<v Speaker 1>There look to be a bunch of different

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:10.490
<v Speaker 1>images in here in queue, including things from

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Cilium and stuff, so

00:21:13.245 --> 00:21:16.044
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't seem like it would be accurate.

00:21:21.565 --> 00:21:23.325
<v Speaker 1>Running two container runtimes,

00:21:23.325 --> 00:21:25.965
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe the Kubelet is misconfigured.

00:21:26.045 --> 00:21:26.925
<v Speaker 1>That could be a thing.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:32.039
<v Speaker 1>it started containers in container d,

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:33.320
<v Speaker 1>and then

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.360
<v Speaker 1>now it's not. But that also wouldn't explain

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.160
<v Speaker 1>necessarily

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:37.960
<v Speaker 1>why

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.720
<v Speaker 1>I I would assume that there's an API

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.520
<v Speaker 1>server

00:21:43.245 --> 00:21:43.965
<v Speaker 1>running

00:21:45.245 --> 00:21:47.645
<v Speaker 1>here. Although, maybe this is just a container

00:21:47.645 --> 00:21:49.725
<v Speaker 1>that's created, but that is not actually running.

00:21:49.725 --> 00:21:51.804
<v Speaker 1>And since I'm using CTR,

00:21:51.965 --> 00:21:53.725
<v Speaker 1>I haven't gotten the status of this thing.

00:21:53.725 --> 00:21:54.205
<v Speaker 1>So,

00:21:54.925 --> 00:21:56.525
<v Speaker 1>it's not, like, telling me if it's actually

00:21:56.525 --> 00:21:58.820
<v Speaker 1>healthy or not. So I should go immediately

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.540
<v Speaker 0>be stopped as well, right, or paused

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.460
<v Speaker 0>with this functionality

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.220
<v Speaker 0>of the container runtime.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.420
<v Speaker 0>I I think it is to see if

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:08.820
<v Speaker 0>PS showed you any of these processes.

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:12.445
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That's let's let's go down all the

00:22:12.445 --> 00:22:15.085
<v Speaker 1>way to the Linux level. Right? That's the

00:22:15.085 --> 00:22:17.725
<v Speaker 1>kernel. What do you think? Yeah. And

00:22:18.044 --> 00:22:20.605
<v Speaker 1>I tried this earlier with Netstat as well.

00:22:20.605 --> 00:22:22.765
<v Speaker 1>Right? And I didn't see a Kube API

00:22:22.765 --> 00:22:24.605
<v Speaker 1>server that was bound to any port.

00:22:25.799 --> 00:22:26.440
<v Speaker 1>And

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.760
<v Speaker 1>now looking in the process table of the

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:31.080
<v Speaker 1>kernel, it's not showing us that there is,

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.720
<v Speaker 1>like, an API server per se.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:34.599
<v Speaker 1>But

00:22:34.919 --> 00:22:36.359
<v Speaker 1>I'm also not seeing

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.320
<v Speaker 1>the kubelet.

00:22:38.305 --> 00:22:39.985
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's a problem.

00:22:40.305 --> 00:22:42.225
<v Speaker 1>So what's the deal with that? Right? So

00:22:42.225 --> 00:22:42.945
<v Speaker 1>maybe,

00:22:43.265 --> 00:22:46.385
<v Speaker 1>we should go ask, like, system b,

00:22:46.785 --> 00:22:48.385
<v Speaker 1>if it likes

00:22:48.545 --> 00:22:50.785
<v Speaker 1>how it life how its life is, like,

00:22:50.785 --> 00:22:51.025
<v Speaker 1>right now,

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.600
<v Speaker 1>which I think I can just say

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.960
<v Speaker 1>system CTL, and then this gives me a

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.960
<v Speaker 1>tree, but then I need, like, the status.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.200
<v Speaker 1>And

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:04.960
<v Speaker 1>it's

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.720
<v Speaker 1>there's this NGINX service.

00:23:07.255 --> 00:23:10.134
<v Speaker 1>So NGINX is actually an assistant d unit,

00:23:11.015 --> 00:23:13.095
<v Speaker 1>which I guess is a sensible place to

00:23:13.095 --> 00:23:14.374
<v Speaker 1>run NGINX from.

00:23:15.174 --> 00:23:16.455
<v Speaker 1>I'm also seeing

00:23:18.375 --> 00:23:20.695
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing listed under Cron right now.

00:23:21.255 --> 00:23:22.375
<v Speaker 1>And then

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:24.850
<v Speaker 1>we have all these engine x workers processes,

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:26.929
<v Speaker 1>pocket number d.

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:30.289
<v Speaker 1>And then where is where is my Kubelet?

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:32.770
<v Speaker 1>Am I am I missing it? No. I've

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:34.290
<v Speaker 0>had I haven't seen it. And also very

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:37.330
<v Speaker 0>suspicious is the container d three is empty.

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:39.225
<v Speaker 0>And, like, normally, that is huge

00:23:39.625 --> 00:23:40.505
<v Speaker 0>at the top.

00:23:40.905 --> 00:23:43.705
<v Speaker 1>That's that's up. Did I miss it? Yeah.

00:23:43.705 --> 00:23:45.705
<v Speaker 0>It's like the second service and systems like.

00:23:45.705 --> 00:23:47.305
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. I was like, we normally would

00:23:47.305 --> 00:23:49.945
<v Speaker 0>see container d shims and containers and whole

00:23:49.945 --> 00:23:51.145
<v Speaker 0>bunch of stuff,

00:23:51.145 --> 00:23:52.185
<v Speaker 0>but nothing.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.959
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That's a so even

00:23:56.679 --> 00:23:59.080
<v Speaker 1>though system d thinks everything is running and

00:23:59.080 --> 00:23:59.799
<v Speaker 1>healthy

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.359
<v Speaker 1>and that there's no failed units,

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.840
<v Speaker 1>clearly, we have some misconfigurations

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:06.679
<v Speaker 1>here, and I don't see the Kubelet service,

00:24:07.525 --> 00:24:09.285
<v Speaker 1>which, like, normally, you would, you know, like,

00:24:09.285 --> 00:24:11.765
<v Speaker 1>be able to, like, journal a CTL

00:24:11.765 --> 00:24:13.924
<v Speaker 1>and then, like, follow the Kubit log.

00:24:15.765 --> 00:24:18.965
<v Speaker 1>And I I guess there is a Kubit

00:24:18.965 --> 00:24:21.605
<v Speaker 1>log there, but now it says that it

00:24:21.605 --> 00:24:22.005
<v Speaker 1>stopped.

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:26.330
<v Speaker 1>Shutting down.

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:33.450
<v Speaker 1>Kubit service successfully entered the dead state,

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:34.090
<v Speaker 1>and then,

00:24:34.825 --> 00:24:37.625
<v Speaker 1>I guess, did we disable the system d

00:24:37.625 --> 00:24:38.265
<v Speaker 1>unit,

00:24:38.745 --> 00:24:39.465
<v Speaker 1>maybe?

00:24:40.265 --> 00:24:42.025
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know where oh, I guess

00:24:42.025 --> 00:24:45.065
<v Speaker 1>CRI is pointing directly to the container edition,

00:24:45.305 --> 00:24:46.505
<v Speaker 1>so that's why

00:24:46.905 --> 00:24:48.185
<v Speaker 1>Craig Cuddle is working.

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:52.550
<v Speaker 1>And then container d, like, has some residual

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:55.030
<v Speaker 1>stuff in it, but then the Kubelet's not

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:57.750
<v Speaker 1>running. That yeah. Okay. This is making sense.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:00.470
<v Speaker 1>So if I go maybe into,

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:03.910
<v Speaker 1>like, some of the

00:25:04.605 --> 00:25:05.884
<v Speaker 1>system d,

00:25:05.965 --> 00:25:08.365
<v Speaker 1>like, unit tree maybe.

00:25:11.325 --> 00:25:14.605
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe we, like, find here and

00:25:14.605 --> 00:25:18.205
<v Speaker 1>grab for if maybe the Kubelet service was

00:25:18.205 --> 00:25:19.565
<v Speaker 1>just disabled or something.

00:25:23.299 --> 00:25:25.860
<v Speaker 1>Here we have the the

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:27.619
<v Speaker 1>kind of leftovers

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.619
<v Speaker 1>of config.

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:32.980
<v Speaker 1>And since this is here, I'll just go

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:33.700
<v Speaker 1>and check

00:25:34.095 --> 00:25:36.575
<v Speaker 1>that, yeah, this is just a

00:25:37.054 --> 00:25:37.854
<v Speaker 1>normal

00:25:37.855 --> 00:25:40.174
<v Speaker 1>Kubitium Kubelet extra arcs.

00:25:43.775 --> 00:25:45.294
<v Speaker 1>I like your suggestion,

00:25:45.375 --> 00:25:46.655
<v Speaker 1>the FireFlash,

00:25:46.655 --> 00:25:48.255
<v Speaker 1>just to try and start the Kubelet.

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:53.549
<v Speaker 0>So is there is there no

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:55.390
<v Speaker 0>Kubelet

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:56.909
<v Speaker 0>unit file at all?

00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:59.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I don't see the unit file

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:03.070
<v Speaker 1>in in at least inside of the

00:26:03.655 --> 00:26:05.014
<v Speaker 1>system d system.

00:26:05.255 --> 00:26:07.095
<v Speaker 1>Inside of that c system d, there's no

00:26:07.095 --> 00:26:08.455
<v Speaker 1>Kubla unit file.

00:26:10.135 --> 00:26:11.174
<v Speaker 2>There was. Sorry?

00:26:13.255 --> 00:26:16.135
<v Speaker 0>There was. There there was in your list.

00:26:16.135 --> 00:26:19.110
<v Speaker 1>There definitely there definitely was. Yeah. I agree.

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:22.070
<v Speaker 1>Because No. No. I mean, when you looked,

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:23.190
<v Speaker 2>it was listed.

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:25.830
<v Speaker 0>Oh, go go into the system folder.

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:28.550
<v Speaker 0>There should be another

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:31.830
<v Speaker 0>thing in the system directory.

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:26:35.645 --> 00:26:38.285
<v Speaker 1>This this is just the the service directory.

00:26:38.285 --> 00:26:39.804
<v Speaker 0>We'll do an LS system.

00:26:41.645 --> 00:26:43.165
<v Speaker 0>Maybe it's just not showing up for the

00:26:43.165 --> 00:26:45.565
<v Speaker 0>faint grip. Could be like, that just seems

00:26:45.565 --> 00:26:46.445
<v Speaker 0>a bit weird.

00:26:47.405 --> 00:26:49.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Let's

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean, we got

00:26:53.799 --> 00:26:55.320
<v Speaker 0>That'll be inside system.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.320
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Oh, no. It's not there.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.445
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I don't I don't see I mean,

00:27:04.445 --> 00:27:06.925
<v Speaker 1>I would trust the output of find. Right?

00:27:06.925 --> 00:27:07.644
<v Speaker 1>I mean

00:27:08.445 --> 00:27:09.645
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I don't trust the f and

00:27:09.645 --> 00:27:10.684
<v Speaker 0>f clustered. But

00:27:14.045 --> 00:27:14.605
<v Speaker 1>but

00:27:15.405 --> 00:27:17.165
<v Speaker 1>yeah. That's

00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:21.070
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. There should be a Kiplit

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:22.350
<v Speaker 0>dot service,

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:26.350
<v Speaker 0>which is not exactly a simple unit fail

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:28.350
<v Speaker 0>that tells the head to start.

00:27:30.445 --> 00:27:31.404
<v Speaker 1>I

00:27:31.404 --> 00:27:34.125
<v Speaker 1>don't have access to the Kubernetes config that

00:27:34.125 --> 00:27:36.524
<v Speaker 1>was used to create this cluster, do I?

00:27:37.404 --> 00:27:39.164
<v Speaker 1>And, like, normally,

00:27:39.725 --> 00:27:41.885
<v Speaker 1>I would, like, try and get that config

00:27:41.885 --> 00:27:44.365
<v Speaker 1>outside of or, like, out of the Kubernetes

00:27:44.365 --> 00:27:45.325
<v Speaker 1>cluster, but

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:47.700
<v Speaker 1>we don't have a very functional,

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:50.020
<v Speaker 1>cluster at the moment

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.140
<v Speaker 1>because we have no cluster.

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:57.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh, okay. If I have the config

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:57.940
<v Speaker 1>file,

00:27:58.485 --> 00:27:59.924
<v Speaker 1>then I could just

00:28:00.805 --> 00:28:04.165
<v Speaker 1>go and run Kubernetes alpha phase

00:28:04.165 --> 00:28:05.044
<v Speaker 1>Kubelet.

00:28:05.045 --> 00:28:07.284
<v Speaker 0>So if you go to barlib cache

00:28:07.605 --> 00:28:09.445
<v Speaker 0>and grab the dot dev file for the

00:28:09.445 --> 00:28:11.205
<v Speaker 0>Kubelet, you could just unzip it and grab

00:28:11.205 --> 00:28:12.005
<v Speaker 0>the unit file.

00:28:15.789 --> 00:28:18.429
<v Speaker 2>Barrelib cache. You might wanna check the chat.

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:21.789
<v Speaker 1>Check the chat as well.

00:28:24.669 --> 00:28:26.190
<v Speaker 0>Have you have you left the unit fail

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:28.154
<v Speaker 0>somewhere for us, Marcus? And that'll save us

00:28:28.154 --> 00:28:29.354
<v Speaker 0>the the long way.

00:28:30.235 --> 00:28:32.394
<v Speaker 2>I haven't I haven't moved the unit file.

00:28:32.394 --> 00:28:34.394
<v Speaker 2>Have a look what the fire flash is

00:28:34.394 --> 00:28:35.594
<v Speaker 2>is suggested.

00:28:37.914 --> 00:28:39.434
<v Speaker 1>Maybe just try

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.580
<v Speaker 1>start. Yeah. So there's from the old media

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:44.580
<v Speaker 1>package can also live in user lib system

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.300
<v Speaker 1>d. Yeah. Do a system control status, Kipla.

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:49.380
<v Speaker 0>It'll tell you. Like, we don't yeah. I

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:51.380
<v Speaker 0>shouldn't be making this up. It's just system

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:52.980
<v Speaker 0>d can tell us the

00:28:53.575 --> 00:28:55.255
<v Speaker 0>state of the world. There we go.

00:28:55.975 --> 00:28:57.895
<v Speaker 0>But as in lab system d system. Thank

00:28:57.895 --> 00:28:58.615
<v Speaker 0>you, Kevin.

00:28:58.935 --> 00:29:00.935
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It just says that it was disabled.

00:29:00.935 --> 00:29:02.375
<v Speaker 1>And this is exactly what I was but

00:29:02.375 --> 00:29:04.535
<v Speaker 1>I was just looking in completely the wrong

00:29:04.615 --> 00:29:05.015
<v Speaker 1>path.

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:07.510
<v Speaker 0>Was I I thought it was for hundreds

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:08.870
<v Speaker 0>of these customers, and I was looking at

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:10.470
<v Speaker 0>the wrong path, but don't worry about it.

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:15.430
<v Speaker 1>this service is disabled.

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:16.230
<v Speaker 1>And

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:18.230
<v Speaker 1>the way that I remember how to do

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:20.150
<v Speaker 1>this on a system the system involves

00:29:20.895 --> 00:29:24.735
<v Speaker 1>push putting units into disabled folders with puppet.

00:29:24.895 --> 00:29:27.375
<v Speaker 0>I know. You can do system control enable

00:29:27.375 --> 00:29:28.174
<v Speaker 0>Kubelet.

00:29:28.335 --> 00:29:30.495
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I just I just need to do

00:29:30.495 --> 00:29:31.375
<v Speaker 1>this. Okay.

00:29:33.775 --> 00:29:35.935
<v Speaker 1>And then we'll just check the status.

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:38.230
<v Speaker 1>And

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:41.110
<v Speaker 1>here we are. We have it enabled,

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.990
<v Speaker 1>and

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:43.350
<v Speaker 1>it's

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:45.110
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna have to do a restart on

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:47.110
<v Speaker 0>it, though, to just to kind of take

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.750
<v Speaker 0>it all.

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Some

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:50.710
<v Speaker 1>CTL

00:29:51.225 --> 00:29:52.424
<v Speaker 1>restart

00:29:52.665 --> 00:29:53.705
<v Speaker 1>Kubelet.

00:29:56.025 --> 00:29:58.825
<v Speaker 1>That was it gave me a successful error

00:29:58.905 --> 00:30:02.184
<v Speaker 1>code. And here we have and then the

00:30:02.184 --> 00:30:05.545
<v Speaker 1>Kubelet's entering the failed states, and it says

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:07.270
<v Speaker 1>that

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:11.190
<v Speaker 1>invalid max files one must be greater than

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.909
<v Speaker 1>one.

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:13.750
<v Speaker 1>So

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:16.789
<v Speaker 1>is this a sysctl?

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:19.110
<v Speaker 1>Is that what that's referencing?

00:30:19.534 --> 00:30:21.214
<v Speaker 1>Because this is like a go

00:30:21.455 --> 00:30:23.455
<v Speaker 1>variable of, like, a

00:30:24.174 --> 00:30:26.174
<v Speaker 1>max file sysctl.

00:30:27.215 --> 00:30:28.654
<v Speaker 1>I mean I had a feeling that I

00:30:28.654 --> 00:30:31.135
<v Speaker 1>should have exported all of the sysctls from

00:30:31.135 --> 00:30:33.054
<v Speaker 1>my notes when when they were good.

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:36.350
<v Speaker 0>Well, you're gonna run a system control cat

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:37.950
<v Speaker 0>kuplet, and it will show you all the

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:39.870
<v Speaker 0>places that the kuplet is configured.

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:41.870
<v Speaker 0>I would stop there.

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:45.470
<v Speaker 1>Some cuddle

00:30:46.805 --> 00:30:47.524
<v Speaker 1>cat.

00:30:47.925 --> 00:30:49.365
<v Speaker 0>Yep. Cat kubelet.

00:30:49.525 --> 00:30:51.284
<v Speaker 0>So you're gonna see there's

00:30:51.525 --> 00:30:53.525
<v Speaker 0>you can ignore the bootstrap one typically, but

00:30:53.525 --> 00:30:56.245
<v Speaker 0>FireLib kubelet config might be important. And then

00:30:56.245 --> 00:30:57.765
<v Speaker 0>there's the q b d m flags dot

00:30:57.765 --> 00:30:59.525
<v Speaker 0>e n v, which you probably wanna look

00:30:59.525 --> 00:31:02.165
<v Speaker 0>in. And then lastly, etcetera default kubelet.

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:05.659
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Okay.

00:31:07.179 --> 00:31:08.059
<v Speaker 1>We

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.259
<v Speaker 1>can start here.

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.580
<v Speaker 1>And what it's meant it's pointing to container

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:15.900
<v Speaker 1>d.

00:31:16.615 --> 00:31:19.575
<v Speaker 1>It has the a normal POS container image,

00:31:19.575 --> 00:31:21.414
<v Speaker 1>which is definitely a good thing.

00:31:21.975 --> 00:31:25.174
<v Speaker 1>And yeah. But this doesn't look like it's

00:31:25.174 --> 00:31:26.855
<v Speaker 1>missing anything in particular either.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:30.720
<v Speaker 1>K.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.320
<v Speaker 1>We have this.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.840
<v Speaker 1>This is gonna be the Kubelet component config,

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.320
<v Speaker 1>I think. Yeah. Much longer.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:44.865
<v Speaker 1>This is maintained by the, Kubelet team. It's

00:31:44.865 --> 00:31:46.705
<v Speaker 1>not a Kubernetes API that you can use

00:31:46.705 --> 00:31:47.825
<v Speaker 1>inside your cluster.

00:31:48.945 --> 00:31:49.664
<v Speaker 1>Right

00:31:52.705 --> 00:31:53.825
<v Speaker 0>at the bottom.

00:31:55.905 --> 00:31:56.625
<v Speaker 1>Max

00:31:56.865 --> 00:31:59.700
<v Speaker 1>files. Container log max files? Oh, okay. I

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:03.139
<v Speaker 1>never used this option ever. But Me neither.

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.260
<v Speaker 0>I'm also curious about the max pods at

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:06.979
<v Speaker 0>the bottom.

00:32:10.419 --> 00:32:12.500
<v Speaker 1>Max pods? Yeah. That doesn't look really good.

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:13.940
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we could drop that up to, like,

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:15.140
<v Speaker 1>50 or something.

00:32:16.075 --> 00:32:16.875
<v Speaker 1>And then

00:32:17.435 --> 00:32:19.035
<v Speaker 1>you can have 50 pods on a node.

00:32:19.035 --> 00:32:22.075
<v Speaker 1>Right? I think the default is a 10.

00:32:23.435 --> 00:32:24.075
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:32:24.395 --> 00:32:25.035
<v Speaker 1>That's

00:32:25.275 --> 00:32:26.715
<v Speaker 0>But you could also just remove it and

00:32:26.715 --> 00:32:28.795
<v Speaker 0>have the default. I I assume. I'm not

00:32:28.795 --> 00:32:31.100
<v Speaker 0>entirely sure, but I assume. No. You are

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:33.980
<v Speaker 1>right about that because the the structural

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.180
<v Speaker 1>deserialize.

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.660
<v Speaker 1>And then yeah. I mean, we don't even

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:40.380
<v Speaker 1>need this either.

00:32:42.935 --> 00:32:46.054
<v Speaker 1>Volume stats, add periods, sync frequency.

00:32:46.375 --> 00:32:48.135
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if zero seconds.

00:32:48.375 --> 00:32:51.175
<v Speaker 1>It seems like that's a, like, a default

00:32:51.175 --> 00:32:51.894
<v Speaker 1>value.

00:32:52.455 --> 00:32:54.455
<v Speaker 1>And then

00:32:56.509 --> 00:32:57.469
<v Speaker 1>local

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:02.269
<v Speaker 1>editor is not happy with this terminal size

00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:03.229
<v Speaker 1>discrepancy,

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:05.949
<v Speaker 1>but it we're making it work.

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:07.070
<v Speaker 1>K.

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:11.070
<v Speaker 1>We updated the config. Let's go ahead and

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:12.590
<v Speaker 1>just

00:33:14.154 --> 00:33:15.355
<v Speaker 1>restart

00:33:15.355 --> 00:33:16.634
<v Speaker 1>the Google app,

00:33:19.914 --> 00:33:21.914
<v Speaker 1>and then we will look at the Google

00:33:21.914 --> 00:33:22.955
<v Speaker 1>channel again.

00:33:23.355 --> 00:33:25.355
<v Speaker 1>And at least now, it looks like the

00:33:25.355 --> 00:33:27.030
<v Speaker 1>Google is trying to do things. It is.

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:28.470
<v Speaker 1>So that's better than, like, where we were

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:29.030
<v Speaker 1>before.

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:33.750
<v Speaker 1>And then error getting node, this is, like,

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:35.750
<v Speaker 1>not that surprising to me right now because

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:37.750
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes is not up and running yet.

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:40.470
<v Speaker 1>So, like, it's very natural for the Kubla

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:43.495
<v Speaker 1>control loops to be, like, just throwing up.

00:33:43.495 --> 00:33:44.935
<v Speaker 0>Typically, it means it can't speak to the

00:33:44.935 --> 00:33:46.215
<v Speaker 0>API server. Right?

00:33:46.615 --> 00:33:47.335
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:33:48.295 --> 00:33:51.015
<v Speaker 1>But we can, like, check and see. Okay.

00:33:51.015 --> 00:33:52.535
<v Speaker 1>We got our pods here, but do we

00:33:52.535 --> 00:33:53.655
<v Speaker 1>have our containers?

00:33:53.655 --> 00:33:54.055
<v Speaker 1>No.

00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:57.190
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:00.790
<v Speaker 0>I just saw a comment from Moz in

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:01.590
<v Speaker 0>the chat.

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Static pod path is wrong. Oh, yeah. Oh,

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:06.549
<v Speaker 1>I missed that. Totally.

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.

00:34:10.214 --> 00:34:10.855
<v Speaker 1>So

00:34:13.335 --> 00:34:15.815
<v Speaker 1>static pod path. Where where are you at?

00:34:15.815 --> 00:34:17.494
<v Speaker 1>Here. Yeah. That's not right.

00:34:17.655 --> 00:34:19.574
<v Speaker 0>Passes the eyeball test tool.

00:34:20.135 --> 00:34:20.934
<v Speaker 1>Manifests.

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:26.340
<v Speaker 1>Etsy Kubernetes manifest, plural. That's probably correct. That

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:27.060
<v Speaker 0>is correct.

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Resolveconf that we're gonna be piping into

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:31.699
<v Speaker 1>every single pod in the cluster looks okay

00:34:31.699 --> 00:34:32.260
<v Speaker 1>too.

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:34.900
<v Speaker 1>Cluster domain is normal.

00:34:36.405 --> 00:34:37.445
<v Speaker 1>CIDRs

00:34:37.445 --> 00:34:38.405
<v Speaker 1>are normal.

00:34:39.125 --> 00:34:41.845
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I I think that looks good now.

00:34:42.165 --> 00:34:43.605
<v Speaker 0>I think Cool. I think so.

00:34:46.165 --> 00:34:46.885
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:34:46.965 --> 00:34:47.445
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:50.850
<v Speaker 1>Now we have a new manifest path. Let's

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:53.489
<v Speaker 1>just go and reboot that Kubelet again.

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:56.530
<v Speaker 0>And then,

00:34:56.850 --> 00:34:57.570
<v Speaker 1>hopefully,

00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:59.810
<v Speaker 1>you know, like, say we give it a

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:02.290
<v Speaker 1>few seconds, and then we just are, like,

00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:02.930
<v Speaker 1>optimistic

00:35:03.255 --> 00:35:05.494
<v Speaker 1>that now we have some containers.

00:35:05.575 --> 00:35:06.454
<v Speaker 1>That's good.

00:35:06.934 --> 00:35:08.615
<v Speaker 1>This is this is a good thing now.

00:35:08.615 --> 00:35:09.255
<v Speaker 1>Hey.

00:35:09.734 --> 00:35:12.615
<v Speaker 1>We got STD coming up and stuff.

00:35:13.494 --> 00:35:15.494
<v Speaker 1>And then from, like that that's like a

00:35:15.494 --> 00:35:17.734
<v Speaker 1>container perspective. Now I do see that it

00:35:17.734 --> 00:35:19.815
<v Speaker 1>seems like there's, like, a lot of restarts

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:21.390
<v Speaker 1>there. So, like, are these pods, like,

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:22.670
<v Speaker 1>happy?

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And then

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:26.270
<v Speaker 1>all the base pods are fine, and then

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:28.270
<v Speaker 1>now we're getting some of the, rest of

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:28.750
<v Speaker 1>the

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:30.670
<v Speaker 1>more, like, run time

00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:33.384
<v Speaker 1>control plane coming up, like, and

00:35:33.384 --> 00:35:35.065
<v Speaker 1>all of these other things that are bootstrapped

00:35:35.065 --> 00:35:37.384
<v Speaker 1>into the early Kubernetes cluster. So it seems

00:35:37.384 --> 00:35:38.185
<v Speaker 1>like now,

00:35:38.505 --> 00:35:40.424
<v Speaker 1>it might be a reasonable expectation to be

00:35:40.424 --> 00:35:42.025
<v Speaker 1>able to, like, get some notes from the

00:35:42.025 --> 00:35:44.505
<v Speaker 1>cluster, and, that's good. What's also good here

00:35:44.505 --> 00:35:45.785
<v Speaker 1>is that our notes are ready.

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:50.550
<v Speaker 1>So that should mean that, like, from a

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:53.350
<v Speaker 1>networking standpoint, we at least have, like, something

00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:55.190
<v Speaker 1>that feels like Kubernetes.

00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:58.950
<v Speaker 1>And then since I'm thinking about networking and

00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:59.430
<v Speaker 1>we're,

00:36:00.195 --> 00:36:02.035
<v Speaker 1>like well, you know what? Let's just let's

00:36:02.035 --> 00:36:03.315
<v Speaker 1>just look at the deployment,

00:36:03.875 --> 00:36:05.635
<v Speaker 1>because, like, the whole point here

00:36:06.275 --> 00:36:07.075
<v Speaker 1>is that,

00:36:07.555 --> 00:36:08.915
<v Speaker 1>we wanted to

00:36:09.155 --> 00:36:11.555
<v Speaker 1>do a very simple thing with a single

00:36:11.555 --> 00:36:12.435
<v Speaker 1>application.

00:36:12.435 --> 00:36:13.235
<v Speaker 1>But instead,

00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:16.090
<v Speaker 1>it looks like we've deployed Argo CD,

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:18.810
<v Speaker 1>and there's also image registry.

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:22.010
<v Speaker 1>And there's a Go CD because we need

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:24.090
<v Speaker 1>a CICD pipeline as well.

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:26.650
<v Speaker 1>And then, why not also have a place

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:27.690
<v Speaker 1>to store artifacts?

00:36:28.015 --> 00:36:30.575
<v Speaker 1>You know, like, maybe who knows? Maybe now

00:36:30.575 --> 00:36:33.855
<v Speaker 1>we're building, like, a Google on Rails application

00:36:33.855 --> 00:36:36.815
<v Speaker 1>instead of, instead of the normal clustered Rust.

00:36:36.815 --> 00:36:38.335
<v Speaker 0>Well, you know what? It's nice to see

00:36:38.335 --> 00:36:40.390
<v Speaker 0>someone. You know, I saw all these cores

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:42.470
<v Speaker 0>and all this RAM at these clusters. Now

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:44.310
<v Speaker 0>it's finally getting tickled a little bit. So

00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:46.390
<v Speaker 0>that's good. Thank you, Marcus. Yeah.

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:48.630
<v Speaker 0>Good question from Russell. Have I gone down

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:50.869
<v Speaker 0>to one worker node? I have lowered this

00:36:50.869 --> 00:36:52.550
<v Speaker 0>back to one worker and one control plane

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:53.984
<v Speaker 0>just so that we don't have to keep

00:36:53.984 --> 00:36:56.705
<v Speaker 0>fixing things on two worker nodes every week.

00:36:57.825 --> 00:36:59.984
<v Speaker 0>I think it's simplified a wee bit. Let's

00:36:59.984 --> 00:37:02.065
<v Speaker 1>wrangle in the complexity for me a little

00:37:02.065 --> 00:37:04.065
<v Speaker 1>bit. Right? Yeah. So

00:37:04.305 --> 00:37:05.505
<v Speaker 1>my intuition here

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:07.020
<v Speaker 1>and

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:10.220
<v Speaker 1>this I I don't know. Maybe, like, should

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:11.980
<v Speaker 1>be good this sometime, but,

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:15.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean, we got some beefy nodes and

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.900
<v Speaker 1>nothing is passing the readiness check here.

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:21.705
<v Speaker 1>And why would that be? Oh, we have

00:37:21.705 --> 00:37:22.585
<v Speaker 1>Caverno.

00:37:24.665 --> 00:37:26.825
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting. Do you think his Argo is

00:37:26.825 --> 00:37:29.305
<v Speaker 0>to hide the Caverno deployment? You think it

00:37:29.305 --> 00:37:30.025
<v Speaker 0>was an illusion?

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:37.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean, well, there's there's, like, Caverno just

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:39.940
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of the screen. I'm I'm

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:41.540
<v Speaker 1>just assuming that that is

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:44.500
<v Speaker 1>a policy controller that's hooked in with an

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:45.620
<v Speaker 1>admission webhook

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:47.460
<v Speaker 1>to the API server, and that could be

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:48.500
<v Speaker 1>doing all sorts of stuff.

00:37:49.275 --> 00:37:50.474
<v Speaker 1>That's actually an area where I don't have

00:37:50.474 --> 00:37:51.755
<v Speaker 1>a lot of experience yet. So I'm about

00:37:51.755 --> 00:37:52.635
<v Speaker 1>to learn something.

00:37:54.395 --> 00:37:55.355
<v Speaker 0>Have ten minutes. Yeah.

00:37:57.675 --> 00:37:59.275
<v Speaker 1>Now what can we do in ten minutes

00:37:59.275 --> 00:38:00.714
<v Speaker 1>to make this

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:03.190
<v Speaker 1>interesting?

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:06.150
<v Speaker 1>How many hints are here in the, let's

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:07.510
<v Speaker 1>say if, like, I went over to the

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:09.910
<v Speaker 1>root directory? Alright. So we got five hints.

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:12.310
<v Speaker 1>We must have, like, already dealt with, like,

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:13.430
<v Speaker 1>one of these.

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:38:17.785 --> 00:38:19.705
<v Speaker 0>I mean, you could describe the cluster pods

00:38:19.705 --> 00:38:21.305
<v Speaker 0>and see why it's not ready.

00:38:22.745 --> 00:38:24.825
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Let's let's maybe

00:38:26.425 --> 00:38:27.305
<v Speaker 1>describe

00:38:27.945 --> 00:38:28.985
<v Speaker 1>the deploy

00:38:29.305 --> 00:38:30.105
<v Speaker 1>for

00:38:30.665 --> 00:38:31.145
<v Speaker 1>clustered.

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:34.330
<v Speaker 1>And here,

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:35.130
<v Speaker 1>we

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:38.570
<v Speaker 1>it says that it's scaled to zero.

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:41.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh, no. That's just the replica set, but

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:43.930
<v Speaker 1>it also is zero desired.

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:45.290
<v Speaker 1>And

00:38:47.305 --> 00:38:47.945
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:38:48.185 --> 00:38:50.345
<v Speaker 0>It's scaled. Yeah. And then, again, I'm not

00:38:50.345 --> 00:38:51.945
<v Speaker 1>in a pager, but it looks like you

00:38:51.945 --> 00:38:53.385
<v Speaker 1>guys can see most of what I'm seeing.

00:38:53.385 --> 00:38:55.385
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. We we can see all. It's definitely

00:38:55.385 --> 00:38:58.185
<v Speaker 0>set to zero point replicas. It's saying that

00:38:58.185 --> 00:39:01.465
<v Speaker 1>it's pointing to your image of v one.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.520
<v Speaker 1>So I imagine,

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:05.600
<v Speaker 1>if I just try

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.200
<v Speaker 1>and

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:10.079
<v Speaker 1>update this, that something is gonna fight me

00:39:10.079 --> 00:39:11.680
<v Speaker 1>with all of the stuff that's in this

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.280
<v Speaker 1>cluster, but there's no reason not to try.

00:39:16.295 --> 00:39:18.215
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know. I I don't Yeah.

00:39:18.215 --> 00:39:20.295
<v Speaker 0>Just add it to it. Take it easy,

00:39:20.295 --> 00:39:21.015
<v Speaker 0>though. Yeah.

00:39:22.535 --> 00:39:24.535
<v Speaker 1>Let's get edit deploy.

00:39:25.815 --> 00:39:27.575
<v Speaker 1>What do we got? It's a stem.

00:39:30.135 --> 00:39:31.335
<v Speaker 0>This is stem. Yeah.

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:34.910
<v Speaker 1>We do normally two replicas on this. Just

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:36.190
<v Speaker 0>one, but you can go for two. Why

00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:36.750
<v Speaker 0>not?

00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:38.510
<v Speaker 0>Look at the RAM.

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:42.190
<v Speaker 1>I am in some sort of, like, macro

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:43.710
<v Speaker 1>mode at the moment.

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:45.230
<v Speaker 1>I accidentally

00:39:45.425 --> 00:39:48.305
<v Speaker 1>used a different editor shortcuts, and now it's

00:39:48.305 --> 00:39:49.585
<v Speaker 1>not letting me hit escape.

00:39:49.905 --> 00:39:51.985
<v Speaker 0>Yep. Normal. Same.

00:39:54.385 --> 00:39:56.224
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm recording a macro right now

00:39:56.224 --> 00:39:56.945
<v Speaker 1>would be my guess.

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:01.640
<v Speaker 1>But

00:40:02.599 --> 00:40:04.840
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Someone Google how do we quit them.

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.280
<v Speaker 0>I'm trapped.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:09.400
<v Speaker 1>I

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Shall we open a new terminal?

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:13.240
<v Speaker 1>Sure.

00:40:14.095 --> 00:40:15.455
<v Speaker 1>Or actually, you know, I can just go

00:40:15.455 --> 00:40:17.455
<v Speaker 1>and kill the VIM process myself. Yeah. Go

00:40:17.455 --> 00:40:20.255
<v Speaker 0>for it. Why not? Yeah. Here. I I

00:40:20.255 --> 00:40:22.815
<v Speaker 1>I have the ability to control my own

00:40:22.815 --> 00:40:23.455
<v Speaker 1>destiny.

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:29.580
<v Speaker 1>I just need to TSH

00:40:29.819 --> 00:40:31.180
<v Speaker 1>into the

00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:34.460
<v Speaker 1>Marcus

00:40:34.859 --> 00:40:35.900
<v Speaker 1>control plane.

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:37.900
<v Speaker 0>Marcus control plane one. Yep.

00:40:41.555 --> 00:40:42.275
<v Speaker 1>Verb.

00:40:42.595 --> 00:40:44.515
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. There was a bug actually in a

00:40:44.515 --> 00:40:46.755
<v Speaker 0>recent point version of Teleport that broke control

00:40:46.755 --> 00:40:48.195
<v Speaker 0>c. So

00:40:48.674 --> 00:40:50.355
<v Speaker 0>but that has been affected, unfortunately.

00:40:51.795 --> 00:40:52.515
<v Speaker 0>But that was fun.

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:03.450
<v Speaker 1>It's a it's a VI process.

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:04.810
<v Speaker 1>Right? Mhmm.

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:08.730
<v Speaker 1>I just did a kill all, say kill

00:41:09.924 --> 00:41:12.325
<v Speaker 1>v I. Is is a kill not enough

00:41:12.325 --> 00:41:12.885
<v Speaker 1>to

00:41:13.765 --> 00:41:15.125
<v Speaker 1>winch editor

00:41:15.125 --> 00:41:16.244
<v Speaker 1>from the screen?

00:41:18.645 --> 00:41:19.444
<v Speaker 1>Oh. Alright.

00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:25.380
<v Speaker 1>I I see the process group here.

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:33.380
<v Speaker 1>I believe we're wasting time. It's gone. Let's

00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:35.220
<v Speaker 0>just let's just let's just just I've got

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:36.020
<v Speaker 0>a new session.

00:41:36.585 --> 00:41:39.305
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Cool. If you just join that. We'll

00:41:39.305 --> 00:41:40.505
<v Speaker 1>get the session. We'll add on a couple

00:41:40.505 --> 00:41:42.985
<v Speaker 0>of minutes just to get around that.

00:41:46.505 --> 00:41:47.545
<v Speaker 1>New session.

00:41:47.785 --> 00:41:49.705
<v Speaker 1>It's the one that's from thirty five seconds

00:41:49.705 --> 00:41:50.425
<v Speaker 1>ago.

00:41:50.744 --> 00:41:51.145
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:53.700
<v Speaker 0>Cool. Echo high into it.

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:57.700
<v Speaker 1>Fine.

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:00.820
<v Speaker 1>Coffee.

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:18.150
<v Speaker 1>What's it doing? I was

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:21.510
<v Speaker 0>So you can set editor to, yeah, micro.

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:23.030
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:24.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:26.390
<v Speaker 1>Edit

00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:28.230
<v Speaker 1>the

00:42:29.055 --> 00:42:31.135
<v Speaker 1>deploy for clustered,

00:42:32.415 --> 00:42:32.975
<v Speaker 1>and

00:42:35.375 --> 00:42:37.215
<v Speaker 1>I want to find the

00:42:37.454 --> 00:42:38.575
<v Speaker 1>replicas.

00:42:38.575 --> 00:42:40.734
<v Speaker 1>I should have just used the scale command.

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:44.270
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you were also going to update the

00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:45.310
<v Speaker 0>image, weren't you?

00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:50.670
<v Speaker 0>Oh, we can't your Salesforce Outlook. So there

00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:53.790
<v Speaker 1>is probably Caverno or oh, x five zero

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:55.630
<v Speaker 1>nine certificate is valid.

00:42:57.455 --> 00:42:58.095
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:43:00.495 --> 00:43:02.415
<v Speaker 1>So is the webhook

00:43:02.735 --> 00:43:04.335
<v Speaker 1>cert maybe not,

00:43:06.735 --> 00:43:07.775
<v Speaker 1>not good,

00:43:08.335 --> 00:43:08.495
<v Speaker 1>potentially?

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:17.270
<v Speaker 1>It's

00:43:18.069 --> 00:43:20.150
<v Speaker 1>one of the fast way to get that

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:21.110
<v Speaker 1>error again.

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:23.350
<v Speaker 0>To

00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:24.069
<v Speaker 0>deploy.

00:43:27.725 --> 00:43:28.925
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:43:29.485 --> 00:43:30.845
<v Speaker 1>It says that it's

00:43:31.565 --> 00:43:32.285
<v Speaker 1>scaled

00:43:33.645 --> 00:43:34.205
<v Speaker 1>this time.

00:43:40.619 --> 00:43:42.700
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's not right, though.

00:43:54.005 --> 00:43:56.565
<v Speaker 1>Okay. It it it has a desired I

00:43:56.565 --> 00:43:57.845
<v Speaker 1>was able to patch it.

00:43:58.885 --> 00:44:02.405
<v Speaker 1>So maybe whatever that webhook was is only

00:44:02.405 --> 00:44:04.725
<v Speaker 1>firing with kubectl apply or something.

00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:08.460
<v Speaker 1>But when you issue a raw patch for

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:09.100
<v Speaker 1>the

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:14.460
<v Speaker 1>mutating emission webhook that's configured in Caverno is

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:16.780
<v Speaker 1>not firing on patch or something.

00:44:19.865 --> 00:44:22.505
<v Speaker 1>Not not a lot of ideas there. So

00:44:22.505 --> 00:44:24.745
<v Speaker 1>I should probably learn a little bit about

00:44:24.745 --> 00:44:25.865
<v Speaker 1>the CRDs

00:44:26.025 --> 00:44:28.025
<v Speaker 1>that make Caverno work.

00:44:31.859 --> 00:44:34.180
<v Speaker 1>So that okay. So I can get the

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:35.300
<v Speaker 1>policies

00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:36.900
<v Speaker 1>inside

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:39.140
<v Speaker 1>the whole cluster, and I guess there's

00:44:39.299 --> 00:44:40.020
<v Speaker 1>none,

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:42.660
<v Speaker 1>but there might be some cluster policies.

00:44:45.555 --> 00:44:47.475
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a terrible time with the editor

00:44:47.475 --> 00:44:50.275
<v Speaker 1>size right here. Cluster policies.

00:44:50.435 --> 00:44:52.755
<v Speaker 1>There's no cluster policies either. So

00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:00.360
<v Speaker 0>why not check for admit mutate in admission

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:01.880
<v Speaker 0>controller at configurations?

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:03.720
<v Speaker 0>Mutate in webpack configurations?

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.440
<v Speaker 1>Mutating webpack.

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.785
<v Speaker 1>Let's look there. So there's this vault agent

00:45:11.785 --> 00:45:12.665
<v Speaker 1>injector.

00:45:14.825 --> 00:45:17.705
<v Speaker 1>We could just, like, delete that. Good call.

00:45:17.705 --> 00:45:19.705
<v Speaker 0>I think so. Because I mean, like, we

00:45:19.705 --> 00:45:22.265
<v Speaker 1>literally have no secrets in our application anyway.

00:45:22.265 --> 00:45:24.505
<v Speaker 1>Right? So I just don't trust mutating webhook

00:45:24.505 --> 00:45:27.500
<v Speaker 0>configurations. So No. Let's just delete all of

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:30.140
<v Speaker 1>those in all namespaces. Who cares? Yeah.

00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:33.820
<v Speaker 1>And then

00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:37.340
<v Speaker 1>let's go and describe that deploy again

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:39.500
<v Speaker 1>and see what else it's complaining about.

00:45:41.695 --> 00:45:43.295
<v Speaker 1>It says that

00:45:43.455 --> 00:45:45.135
<v Speaker 1>it has two desired.

00:45:45.535 --> 00:45:48.655
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at the replica sets.

00:45:51.615 --> 00:45:53.055
<v Speaker 1>And for clustered,

00:45:53.214 --> 00:45:56.095
<v Speaker 1>there's only one replica set, but we

00:45:56.690 --> 00:45:58.609
<v Speaker 1>oh, yeah. It should have scaled this replica

00:45:58.609 --> 00:46:01.250
<v Speaker 1>set up to two, but it doesn't look

00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:03.410
<v Speaker 1>like it did that because this replica set

00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:04.930
<v Speaker 1>still says zero.

00:46:07.009 --> 00:46:08.450
<v Speaker 0>So what's responsible for that?

00:46:10.875 --> 00:46:11.355
<v Speaker 1>And,

00:46:13.435 --> 00:46:15.435
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question, but I think I

00:46:15.435 --> 00:46:17.995
<v Speaker 1>might just go and try editing the deploy

00:46:17.995 --> 00:46:18.795
<v Speaker 1>again,

00:46:19.595 --> 00:46:22.075
<v Speaker 1>and setting the container image to v two

00:46:22.075 --> 00:46:22.795
<v Speaker 1>because

00:46:23.035 --> 00:46:23.995
<v Speaker 1>if

00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:26.940
<v Speaker 1>that's, like, the goal anyway.

00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Failed to call webhook,

00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:31.100
<v Speaker 1>validate.

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:34.060
<v Speaker 0>That port four four three is still there.

00:46:38.705 --> 00:46:39.985
<v Speaker 1>The Kubernetes

00:46:41.585 --> 00:46:44.065
<v Speaker 1>this is saying post to local host four

00:46:44.065 --> 00:46:45.345
<v Speaker 1>four three. Okay.

00:46:47.665 --> 00:46:50.145
<v Speaker 1>Where is this webhook configuration? It's not a

00:46:50.305 --> 00:46:51.345
<v Speaker 1>it's a validating

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:53.560
<v Speaker 1>webhook configuration,

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:56.440
<v Speaker 1>not a mutating one. Let's check them. So

00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:00.200
<v Speaker 1>let's go look at those.

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:02.200
<v Speaker 1>And

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:04.440
<v Speaker 1>that was only four eighty five hours ago,

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.560
<v Speaker 1>which is the same time that the API

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:08.005
<v Speaker 1>server was modified. I I also don't know

00:47:08.005 --> 00:47:10.005
<v Speaker 1>why the API server was modified.

00:47:10.885 --> 00:47:13.525
<v Speaker 1>We didn't find any differences in the API

00:47:13.525 --> 00:47:16.165
<v Speaker 1>server manifest that we wanted to change at

00:47:16.165 --> 00:47:17.685
<v Speaker 1>the time that we had looked at it.

00:47:18.005 --> 00:47:19.205
<v Speaker 1>But

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:22.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna come in here and

00:47:25.599 --> 00:47:26.880
<v Speaker 1>delete all of these

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:28.400
<v Speaker 1>as well,

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:31.200
<v Speaker 1>and then we'll try our edit one more

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.079
<v Speaker 1>time

00:47:32.925 --> 00:47:33.885
<v Speaker 1>and

00:47:34.205 --> 00:47:35.325
<v Speaker 1>come in here.

00:47:38.445 --> 00:47:39.085
<v Speaker 0>Hey.

00:47:39.245 --> 00:47:41.565
<v Speaker 1>So now we were able to actually edit

00:47:41.565 --> 00:47:42.445
<v Speaker 1>the deploy.

00:47:44.205 --> 00:47:45.005
<v Speaker 1>And

00:47:45.885 --> 00:47:48.045
<v Speaker 1>we have

00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:56.060
<v Speaker 1>two clustered replica sets. One of them,

00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:58.060
<v Speaker 1>has two desired

00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:00.140
<v Speaker 1>oh, no. Only one desired.

00:48:01.025 --> 00:48:03.745
<v Speaker 1>And then it's not so let's go and

00:48:03.745 --> 00:48:05.425
<v Speaker 1>describe that replica set

00:48:06.305 --> 00:48:08.145
<v Speaker 1>and see if there's, like, any events or

00:48:08.145 --> 00:48:11.665
<v Speaker 1>helpful information about why it's not progressing.

00:48:14.465 --> 00:48:14.865
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:18.970
<v Speaker 1>It says failed to

00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:19.850
<v Speaker 1>create.

00:48:20.250 --> 00:48:24.570
<v Speaker 1>Creating pods is forbidden for pod security policy.

00:48:25.450 --> 00:48:27.609
<v Speaker 1>Cool. Okay. So just like kinda lots of

00:48:27.609 --> 00:48:30.809
<v Speaker 1>policy stuff. Let's go. Let's look at the

00:48:32.095 --> 00:48:33.935
<v Speaker 1>look at the PSPs.

00:48:35.135 --> 00:48:37.055
<v Speaker 1>This says my scheduler,

00:48:37.695 --> 00:48:38.415
<v Speaker 1>and

00:48:40.575 --> 00:48:43.055
<v Speaker 1>I I honestly don't know if there's even

00:48:43.055 --> 00:48:45.569
<v Speaker 1>any consequence to deleting a pod security policy

00:48:45.569 --> 00:48:47.569
<v Speaker 1>because, I mean, we weren't using one in

00:48:47.569 --> 00:48:50.289
<v Speaker 1>the first place. Just delete it. Smash, smash.

00:48:50.289 --> 00:48:51.329
<v Speaker 1>Marcus

00:48:51.809 --> 00:48:54.130
<v Speaker 1>is sad. He says my lovingly classic webhook

00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:55.809
<v Speaker 1>was just carelessly deleted.

00:48:56.225 --> 00:48:58.545
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even call it by name. Yeah.

00:48:58.705 --> 00:48:59.105
<v Speaker 1>And

00:49:04.545 --> 00:49:05.185
<v Speaker 0>but

00:49:07.105 --> 00:49:09.025
<v Speaker 1>you'll have to send me the write up,

00:49:09.025 --> 00:49:09.425
<v Speaker 1>Marcus.

00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:14.180
<v Speaker 1>At this point, I'm racing through your your

00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:16.260
<v Speaker 1>intricately crafted

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:19.620
<v Speaker 1>monument of Yeah. Of policy. I feel like

00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:21.300
<v Speaker 0>we're close. So let's let's give it another

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:22.660
<v Speaker 0>a couple of minutes and see if we

00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:24.515
<v Speaker 0>can get this done. Okay. I mean, we're

00:49:24.515 --> 00:49:26.435
<v Speaker 1>still making progress. Like, we haven't gotten stuck.

00:49:26.435 --> 00:49:29.395
<v Speaker 1>Right? So it's just maybe I'm a little

00:49:29.395 --> 00:49:31.235
<v Speaker 1>bit verbose in my approach every now and

00:49:31.235 --> 00:49:33.715
<v Speaker 1>then. You wrote, yeah, class instead of grep

00:49:33.715 --> 00:49:34.275
<v Speaker 0>plus.

00:49:35.235 --> 00:49:35.555
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:39.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I I, started typing into some, like,

00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:42.530
<v Speaker 1>text that's not part of the terminal that

00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:44.210
<v Speaker 1>was just, like, in my p two y,

00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:45.570
<v Speaker 1>and, like, I couldn't see.

00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:49.970
<v Speaker 1>Hey. Get deploy

00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:51.250
<v Speaker 1>r s

00:49:51.734 --> 00:49:52.695
<v Speaker 1>pods,

00:49:53.015 --> 00:49:54.775
<v Speaker 1>prep for class.

00:49:55.734 --> 00:49:56.535
<v Speaker 1>So

00:49:56.694 --> 00:49:58.775
<v Speaker 1>we have these replica sets,

00:49:59.015 --> 00:50:02.454
<v Speaker 1>and is it, like, still complaining

00:50:03.335 --> 00:50:04.214
<v Speaker 1>about something?

00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:07.020
<v Speaker 1>If I

00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:09.980
<v Speaker 1>go back to what I was looking at

00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:13.340
<v Speaker 1>there, it says error creating pods.

00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:15.100
<v Speaker 1>And if I

00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:18.940
<v Speaker 1>there are no pods.

00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:20.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. But there's

00:50:21.025 --> 00:50:23.185
<v Speaker 0>So I actually caught this at the start.

00:50:23.185 --> 00:50:25.585
<v Speaker 0>In the API server manifest,

00:50:25.585 --> 00:50:27.025
<v Speaker 0>he enabled a

00:50:27.825 --> 00:50:29.985
<v Speaker 0>admission a static admission controller.

00:50:30.385 --> 00:50:32.145
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Cool. Let's go take a look at

00:50:32.145 --> 00:50:32.385
<v Speaker 1>the

00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:37.930
<v Speaker 1>and I don't wanna do this from this

00:50:37.930 --> 00:50:39.530
<v Speaker 1>bottom part of the terminal.

00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:41.369
<v Speaker 1>Let's

00:50:41.369 --> 00:50:45.450
<v Speaker 1>look open a pager at the Kubernetes manifests,

00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:48.730
<v Speaker 1>for the Kube API server.

00:50:49.825 --> 00:50:50.385
<v Speaker 1>And

00:50:50.945 --> 00:50:54.305
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned that there is an admission controller.

00:50:54.465 --> 00:50:57.185
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. The part security policy controller

00:50:57.265 --> 00:50:59.665
<v Speaker 0>was enabled on this API server.

00:51:00.465 --> 00:51:02.705
<v Speaker 1>Right. So that would be the change

00:51:02.705 --> 00:51:03.665
<v Speaker 1>that we know

00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:06.600
<v Speaker 1>happened,

00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:09.320
<v Speaker 1>and it's in this enable

00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:12.520
<v Speaker 1>admission controller plugins

00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:14.680
<v Speaker 1>flag. No restrictions should be the only thing

00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:15.960
<v Speaker 0>that's there. Okay.

00:51:18.575 --> 00:51:20.335
<v Speaker 0>If you resize your terminal, it should help

00:51:20.335 --> 00:51:22.494
<v Speaker 0>a little bit, I think. I'm not sure.

00:51:22.575 --> 00:51:23.535
<v Speaker 1>Resize.

00:51:23.535 --> 00:51:25.535
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Maybe I should make the terminal closer

00:51:25.535 --> 00:51:27.375
<v Speaker 1>to the size that it should be.

00:51:28.815 --> 00:51:30.575
<v Speaker 1>It's like, unfortunately, I don't know the exact

00:51:30.575 --> 00:51:32.579
<v Speaker 1>number columns, and it, like, doesn't tell me

00:51:32.579 --> 00:51:34.260
<v Speaker 1>when I'm resizing my terminal,

00:51:34.339 --> 00:51:36.180
<v Speaker 1>like, how many columns. But

00:51:41.059 --> 00:51:42.020
<v Speaker 1>and it's

00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:43.940
<v Speaker 1>manifests kube

00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:45.299
<v Speaker 1>API server,

00:51:46.484 --> 00:51:47.205
<v Speaker 1>And

00:51:48.484 --> 00:51:50.885
<v Speaker 1>looks like I'm kind of closer to where

00:51:50.885 --> 00:51:52.885
<v Speaker 1>it should one? So do we want this

00:51:52.885 --> 00:51:54.565
<v Speaker 1>node restriction one in in here as well?

00:51:54.565 --> 00:51:56.325
<v Speaker 0>We yeah. We do want node restriction.

00:51:56.644 --> 00:51:57.365
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:51:57.605 --> 00:51:58.404
<v Speaker 1>We'll keep that.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.920
<v Speaker 0>And if we do restart

00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:02.520
<v Speaker 0>Kubelet just to speed that up. It should

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:05.559
<v Speaker 0>restart our API server for us. Okay. Cool.

00:52:05.559 --> 00:52:06.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:08.360
<v Speaker 1>And

00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:11.800
<v Speaker 0>then maybe we should just take a quick

00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:14.105
<v Speaker 0>look at the hints and see what we've

00:52:14.105 --> 00:52:15.545
<v Speaker 0>solved so far.

00:52:16.105 --> 00:52:16.985
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:52:21.305 --> 00:52:23.465
<v Speaker 1>And one, it says

00:52:23.705 --> 00:52:25.145
<v Speaker 1>something

00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:26.940
<v Speaker 1>hook, probably web hook. Web hook. Yeah.

00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:28.220
<v Speaker 1>Web hook.

00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:31.820
<v Speaker 1>There's something between us. So that'll be the

00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:32.860
<v Speaker 0>NGINX. Right?

00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:35.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We did fix that.

00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:38.620
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember. My memory isn't what it

00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:40.745
<v Speaker 1>once was. Oh, I don't know if we

00:52:40.745 --> 00:52:42.745
<v Speaker 1>did that. Yeah. I'm not sure. No. We

00:52:42.745 --> 00:52:44.425
<v Speaker 0>haven't. Marcus says no. Okay.

00:52:46.905 --> 00:52:49.785
<v Speaker 1>This one is a very small emoji that

00:52:49.945 --> 00:52:51.465
<v Speaker 0>Pause. The pause emoji.

00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:53.540
<v Speaker 1>The pause emoji?

00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:54.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh.

00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:55.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh.

00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:56.980
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:52:58.020 --> 00:52:58.740
<v Speaker 1>And,

00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:01.940
<v Speaker 1>I hope you backed up those config files.

00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:09.205
<v Speaker 1>What config files, Marcus? Which which ones?

00:53:09.845 --> 00:53:11.045
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think is a good

00:53:11.045 --> 00:53:13.205
<v Speaker 1>approach since

00:53:13.205 --> 00:53:15.285
<v Speaker 1>we are we've we've kind of run into

00:53:15.285 --> 00:53:16.484
<v Speaker 1>the end of time. Do we wanna do

00:53:16.484 --> 00:53:18.805
<v Speaker 1>a a walk through the remaining problems?

00:53:19.605 --> 00:53:21.780
<v Speaker 1>You think, David? Or Yeah. Marcus, tell us

00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:23.780
<v Speaker 0>what what what if we're caught yet.

00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:27.220
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:28.020
<v Speaker 2>So

00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:31.220
<v Speaker 2>you skipped over a bunch of stuff that

00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:33.940
<v Speaker 2>was good because I did a load of

00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:35.380
<v Speaker 2>stuff in NGINX and all that kind of

00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:35.540
<v Speaker 2>thing,

00:53:36.455 --> 00:53:38.615
<v Speaker 2>but couldn't get the certificates to play nicely.

00:53:38.615 --> 00:53:40.135
<v Speaker 2>So I was just like, yeah, whatever. Just

00:53:40.135 --> 00:53:40.935
<v Speaker 2>have it failed.

00:53:41.335 --> 00:53:43.895
<v Speaker 2>Mhmm. So that's cool. You saw that I

00:53:43.895 --> 00:53:45.815
<v Speaker 2>just absolutely flooded it with

00:53:46.695 --> 00:53:49.575
<v Speaker 2>different apps. I basically just went through Artifact

00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:51.930
<v Speaker 2>Hub and installed all the top helm charts.

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:56.010
<v Speaker 2>None of those were actually doing anything. So

00:53:56.010 --> 00:53:58.330
<v Speaker 2>Caverno was just installed with nothing. There was

00:53:58.330 --> 00:54:00.490
<v Speaker 2>OPA on there as well. There was Chaos

00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:01.130
<v Speaker 2>Agent,

00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:02.425
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of stuff.

00:54:02.905 --> 00:54:05.865
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. One you haven't got

00:54:06.025 --> 00:54:07.385
<v Speaker 2>regarding memory.

00:54:07.785 --> 00:54:09.865
<v Speaker 2>So in the default and the kube system

00:54:09.865 --> 00:54:10.744
<v Speaker 2>namespace,

00:54:10.744 --> 00:54:13.865
<v Speaker 2>I created a new limit range that limited

00:54:13.865 --> 00:54:16.345
<v Speaker 2>the min and max memory to one kilobyte.

00:54:22.690 --> 00:54:25.490
<v Speaker 0>Everybody always forget about limit ranges per limit

00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:26.930
<v Speaker 0>ranges. Yeah.

00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:28.050
<v Speaker 1>So

00:54:28.530 --> 00:54:30.530
<v Speaker 1>does this actually affect things, though?

00:54:33.655 --> 00:54:34.855
<v Speaker 1>Or It'll

00:54:35.895 --> 00:54:37.734
<v Speaker 2>don't know. I I don't know. I just

00:54:37.734 --> 00:54:38.775
<v Speaker 2>threw it in there.

00:54:40.135 --> 00:54:42.855
<v Speaker 1>I wonder. Because It should affect Cilium. I

00:54:42.855 --> 00:54:44.810
<v Speaker 0>would be surprised if Cilium was working at

00:54:44.810 --> 00:54:46.410
<v Speaker 0>all, which is probably why none of our

00:54:46.410 --> 00:54:48.570
<v Speaker 0>pods are ready and stuck in that zero

00:54:48.890 --> 00:54:50.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. On the ready stage because there's no

00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:52.410
<v Speaker 0>Uh-huh. Working CNI on the worker nodes right

00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:53.930
<v Speaker 0>now. So, definitely,

00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:58.090
<v Speaker 1>we would just delete the limit ranges across

00:54:58.090 --> 00:54:58.970
<v Speaker 1>the entire

00:54:59.505 --> 00:55:00.305
<v Speaker 1>cluster.

00:55:00.305 --> 00:55:03.105
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. There were actually two of those. There

00:55:03.105 --> 00:55:05.105
<v Speaker 1>was another namespace where you had one.

00:55:06.545 --> 00:55:08.625
<v Speaker 1>Cool. Okay. That was So the

00:55:11.184 --> 00:55:11.744
<v Speaker 2>one,

00:55:12.384 --> 00:55:14.545
<v Speaker 2>James has caught it, is around the pause

00:55:14.545 --> 00:55:15.184
<v Speaker 2>container.

00:55:16.109 --> 00:55:18.430
<v Speaker 2>So when you actually went past it

00:55:19.069 --> 00:55:21.470
<v Speaker 2>Did I did I looking at the

00:55:22.029 --> 00:55:23.310
<v Speaker 2>at the Yeah.

00:55:24.910 --> 00:55:25.789
<v Speaker 1>It's the var

00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:29.470
<v Speaker 1>the the Varlib Kubelet Yeah. One, I think.

00:55:30.035 --> 00:55:31.475
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Or or something.

00:55:31.795 --> 00:55:34.115
<v Speaker 1>Let's it it was we got there from

00:55:34.115 --> 00:55:36.195
<v Speaker 1>system, cuddle, cat, Kubelet,

00:55:37.075 --> 00:55:38.355
<v Speaker 1>if I can fill it.

00:55:38.675 --> 00:55:39.475
<v Speaker 1>And then,

00:55:40.195 --> 00:55:43.795
<v Speaker 1>there is the Varlib Kubelet, Kubernetes, and flags

00:55:43.795 --> 00:55:44.835
<v Speaker 1>ENV

00:55:45.309 --> 00:55:46.910
<v Speaker 1>really gross Take a look at the last

00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:47.550
<v Speaker 2>line.

00:55:48.589 --> 00:55:51.549
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Oh, the pod and procuring right there.

00:55:51.549 --> 00:55:53.869
<v Speaker 1>Oh, you overrooted over there.

00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:56.029
<v Speaker 1>So that's is that, like, an old version

00:55:56.029 --> 00:55:57.309
<v Speaker 1>of that container or something,

00:55:58.164 --> 00:56:00.805
<v Speaker 1>Or or is that not a good tag?

00:56:02.805 --> 00:56:03.924
<v Speaker 2>No. If you actually keep

00:56:04.484 --> 00:56:06.565
<v Speaker 2>you scroll across, so you've got some more

00:56:06.565 --> 00:56:07.605
<v Speaker 2>width, I think.

00:56:09.285 --> 00:56:10.885
<v Speaker 0>If we just count that file, do mind

00:56:10.885 --> 00:56:11.685
<v Speaker 0>if I just

00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:15.380
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Where are we in?

00:56:16.339 --> 00:56:17.780
<v Speaker 0>This one? It

00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:19.619
<v Speaker 1>it looks like there's a

00:56:20.819 --> 00:56:22.099
<v Speaker 1>I was at the end of the file

00:56:22.099 --> 00:56:24.339
<v Speaker 1>there. You know? I was trying to Is

00:56:24.339 --> 00:56:25.460
<v Speaker 1>there is there more?

00:56:28.575 --> 00:56:30.735
<v Speaker 2>Okay. Maybe I just completely removed it. That

00:56:30.735 --> 00:56:32.975
<v Speaker 2>was weird. It was meant to be the

00:56:32.975 --> 00:56:33.615
<v Speaker 2>same

00:56:36.335 --> 00:56:37.135
<v Speaker 2>image,

00:56:37.135 --> 00:56:39.375
<v Speaker 2>but on the tag for the for the

00:56:39.375 --> 00:56:42.575
<v Speaker 2>the the version, I changed the the dots

00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:42.900
<v Speaker 2>to underscores.

00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:45.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh, just There we go. That you need

00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:47.460
<v Speaker 1>to Sorry. I I can see that. I

00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:48.660
<v Speaker 0>couldn't see that either.

00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:50.980
<v Speaker 0>I think that's the weird scroll bug.

00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I I I can see that. And

00:56:54.099 --> 00:56:55.935
<v Speaker 1>I was using a pager, but I I

00:56:55.935 --> 00:56:58.735
<v Speaker 1>guess it didn't show up. But, yeah. So

00:56:58.735 --> 00:56:59.455
<v Speaker 1>that tag,

00:56:59.695 --> 00:57:00.815
<v Speaker 1>is malformed,

00:57:00.895 --> 00:57:03.295
<v Speaker 1>which means that the pause container that was

00:57:03.295 --> 00:57:05.135
<v Speaker 1>being used by the Kubelet,

00:57:06.415 --> 00:57:07.375
<v Speaker 1>would not

00:57:07.935 --> 00:57:10.415
<v Speaker 1>get pulled. It wouldn't approve it. Yeah. Yeah.

00:57:11.250 --> 00:57:14.130
<v Speaker 1>And so then that prevents containers from starting,

00:57:15.010 --> 00:57:15.730
<v Speaker 1>which

00:57:16.450 --> 00:57:18.450
<v Speaker 1>would be even if you got the pod

00:57:18.450 --> 00:57:21.330
<v Speaker 1>security policy thing done, then you still prevent

00:57:21.650 --> 00:57:24.050
<v Speaker 1>containers from starting inside the cluster. So why

00:57:24.050 --> 00:57:25.170
<v Speaker 1>do the

00:57:25.635 --> 00:57:27.155
<v Speaker 1>why do the static pods work?

00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:39.860
<v Speaker 1>Because I, you know, I I would I

00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:41.380
<v Speaker 1>I kind of assumed, oh, okay. Well, my

00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:43.060
<v Speaker 1>pods are running, so my Kubla is probably

00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:45.700
<v Speaker 1>healthy, but, yeah, I guess not. Well,

00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:49.540
<v Speaker 2>do they just restart the containers that were

00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:50.500
<v Speaker 2>previously there?

00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:52.895
<v Speaker 0>Well, this obviously would work regardless of the

00:57:52.895 --> 00:57:54.255
<v Speaker 0>CNI because

00:57:54.415 --> 00:57:56.895
<v Speaker 0>the CNI is then started by the API

00:57:56.895 --> 00:57:59.295
<v Speaker 0>server and other things that keep the container.

00:57:59.295 --> 00:58:01.055
<v Speaker 0>So the static pods don't actually need

00:58:02.095 --> 00:58:03.455
<v Speaker 0>the pod sandbox

00:58:04.109 --> 00:58:06.029
<v Speaker 0>because they're actually matter of pods. So those

00:58:06.029 --> 00:58:07.869
<v Speaker 0>are not real pods. They're they're project matter

00:58:07.869 --> 00:58:09.790
<v Speaker 0>of projections on the API server.

00:58:10.509 --> 00:58:11.070
<v Speaker 0>So

00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:15.549
<v Speaker 1>but the pods the pods container is used

00:58:16.994 --> 00:58:18.835
<v Speaker 1>traditionally to create

00:58:19.154 --> 00:58:21.875
<v Speaker 1>namespaces that the Kubla can create further containers

00:58:21.875 --> 00:58:24.755
<v Speaker 1>underneath to support the multi container use case.

00:58:25.714 --> 00:58:27.634
<v Speaker 0>But the static pods, I don't think take

00:58:27.634 --> 00:58:29.315
<v Speaker 0>advantage of the pods container.

00:58:29.555 --> 00:58:31.474
<v Speaker 1>Can the static pods not use

00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:33.470
<v Speaker 1>multiple containers?

00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I don't know. I guess I don't

00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:36.190
<v Speaker 0>know.

00:58:37.550 --> 00:58:40.349
<v Speaker 1>You could just schedule them next to each

00:58:40.349 --> 00:58:42.750
<v Speaker 1>other in different sandboxes and not have, like,

00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:44.829
<v Speaker 1>IPC sharing and stuff. But that doesn't make

00:58:44.829 --> 00:58:46.030
<v Speaker 1>any sense because then how would you do

00:58:46.030 --> 00:58:48.105
<v Speaker 1>volume mounts between, like, in it containers and

00:58:48.105 --> 00:58:48.585
<v Speaker 1>things?

00:58:49.225 --> 00:58:51.305
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to look into static static static

00:58:51.305 --> 00:58:53.145
<v Speaker 0>manifest must have a whole bunch of restrictions

00:58:53.145 --> 00:58:55.225
<v Speaker 0>on them to avoid some of these weird

00:58:55.225 --> 00:58:58.265
<v Speaker 0>things. I'm not I there there are restrictions,

00:58:58.265 --> 00:58:59.465
<v Speaker 1>but, like, I

00:58:59.785 --> 00:59:02.105
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I was developing on Kubadm

00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:04.670
<v Speaker 1>that I was surprised at how much worked.

00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:07.230
<v Speaker 1>Right? Like, all of the volume mount stuff,

00:59:08.190 --> 00:59:10.910
<v Speaker 1>like, projecting things and changing like, that whole

00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:12.030
<v Speaker 1>API is

00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:13.550
<v Speaker 1>is load bearing,

00:59:13.790 --> 00:59:15.869
<v Speaker 1>for all of KubernetesM's configuration.

00:59:17.825 --> 00:59:18.545
<v Speaker 1>So

00:59:19.025 --> 00:59:21.345
<v Speaker 1>and it's a it's a normal pod spec,

00:59:21.345 --> 00:59:22.945
<v Speaker 1>so I would be very surprised,

00:59:23.265 --> 00:59:25.345
<v Speaker 1>to have, like, a different behavior,

00:59:26.384 --> 00:59:28.464
<v Speaker 1>between, like, multiple containers.

00:59:28.545 --> 00:59:28.945
<v Speaker 1>But,

00:59:30.065 --> 00:59:32.625
<v Speaker 1>no pod sandbox used for the

00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:35.400
<v Speaker 1>for the static pods, I guess.

00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:36.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,

00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:39.320
<v Speaker 1>I I guess, like, you could validate that

00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:40.920
<v Speaker 1>by looking

00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:42.200
<v Speaker 1>inside of

00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:43.800
<v Speaker 1>container d

00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:45.080
<v Speaker 1>directly,

00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:47.080
<v Speaker 1>and

00:59:47.765 --> 00:59:49.845
<v Speaker 1>grabbing for the API server,

00:59:50.565 --> 00:59:51.445
<v Speaker 1>for instance.

00:59:51.845 --> 00:59:53.765
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Are you still on the session? Because

00:59:53.765 --> 00:59:56.245
<v Speaker 0>I jumped off. Yeah. Dashing has to go

00:59:56.245 --> 00:59:56.885
<v Speaker 1>first,

00:59:58.405 --> 01:00:01.940
<v Speaker 1>and you would be correct about that. Yeah.

01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:02.980
<v Speaker 1>There's there's no,

01:00:04.019 --> 01:00:05.940
<v Speaker 1>there's no pause container

01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:07.380
<v Speaker 1>for that. I don't

01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:10.900
<v Speaker 1>oh, well, I I mean, it might not

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:13.700
<v Speaker 1>show up because if I look for pause

01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:14.420
<v Speaker 1>here,

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:15.220
<v Speaker 1>maybe

01:00:15.555 --> 01:00:17.635
<v Speaker 1>those pause containers are used for something else.

01:00:17.635 --> 01:00:19.795
<v Speaker 1>It's not the API server. It's my guess.

01:00:20.194 --> 01:00:20.835
<v Speaker 1>So

01:00:21.155 --> 01:00:21.795
<v Speaker 1>neat.

01:00:22.595 --> 01:00:24.915
<v Speaker 1>That's using a different pause container version.

01:00:25.395 --> 01:00:26.994
<v Speaker 1>That's not even the version that you linked.

01:00:26.994 --> 01:00:28.595
<v Speaker 1>You'd linked it to, like, three forty one

01:00:28.595 --> 01:00:30.190
<v Speaker 1>with, like, underscores and stuff. Right? So that

01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:32.750
<v Speaker 1>that's just, like, leftover from before, that the

01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:35.310
<v Speaker 1>perfect evidence of it not functioning, but the

01:00:35.310 --> 01:00:37.550
<v Speaker 1>static pods are still working. So

01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:40.510
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Is that is that all, Marcus?

01:00:42.865 --> 01:00:45.185
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. You caught the others when when you

01:00:45.505 --> 01:00:47.345
<v Speaker 2>well, when I did the typo.

01:00:47.745 --> 01:00:49.745
<v Speaker 2>So when you caught that that error with,

01:00:49.745 --> 01:00:50.465
<v Speaker 2>like, one

01:00:50.785 --> 01:00:53.185
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was, that was because that one

01:00:53.185 --> 01:00:54.865
<v Speaker 2>was meant to be one k I.

01:00:55.950 --> 01:00:58.030
<v Speaker 2>So it was meant to limit the log

01:00:58.030 --> 01:01:00.190
<v Speaker 2>files to, like, nothing

01:01:00.349 --> 01:01:02.510
<v Speaker 2>effectively. Yes. Uh-huh.

01:01:02.829 --> 01:01:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I got a little bit fortunate where

01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:06.589
<v Speaker 1>that showed up in the Kubelet log, I

01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:08.990
<v Speaker 1>think. That was a that was a nice

01:01:08.385 --> 01:01:11.105
<v Speaker 1>quick Kubelet exit as opposed to, like, a

01:01:11.345 --> 01:01:14.305
<v Speaker 1>a Kubelet error that's more devious because, like,

01:01:14.305 --> 01:01:15.265
<v Speaker 1>the flag

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:17.585
<v Speaker 1>is, like, not functioning,

01:01:17.585 --> 01:01:20.145
<v Speaker 1>and Kubelet is still running as a system.

01:01:20.145 --> 01:01:21.505
<v Speaker 1>We didn't understand any password.

01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Pretty. That was so fun. Thank you so

01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:28.660
<v Speaker 1>much for for putting that, that puzzle together,

01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:31.220
<v Speaker 1>for us to to discover through.

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:33.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to apologize.

01:01:36.035 --> 01:01:38.355
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Those were some cool breaks. Now is

01:01:38.515 --> 01:01:40.435
<v Speaker 0>now is let's let's at Looking forward to

01:01:40.435 --> 01:01:43.715
<v Speaker 2>this now. Yeah. Let's let's get started. So

01:01:44.755 --> 01:01:47.715
<v Speaker 0>let's see what Lee has prepared for Marcus.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.560
<v Speaker 0>So, Marcus, I have opened a session or

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:53.200
<v Speaker 0>I'm opening a session on Lee control plane

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.680
<v Speaker 0>one. Please just Okay.

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:57.120
<v Speaker 2>Yep.

<v Speaker 2>Join session.

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:00.960
<v Speaker 0>It looks like we have your dot files

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.240
<v Speaker 0>as well, Lee. So

01:02:05.275 --> 01:02:06.235
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Nice.

01:02:09.195 --> 01:02:09.995
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:02:09.995 --> 01:02:12.075
<v Speaker 0>So after a quick config, which may already

01:02:12.075 --> 01:02:13.195
<v Speaker 0>be set up in the dot fails. Who

01:02:13.195 --> 01:02:15.930
<v Speaker 0>knows? And Yeah. Could be. Oh, you've got

01:02:15.930 --> 01:02:19.050
<v Speaker 0>some tools coming. Key names, JQ, KibTTL,

01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:21.530
<v Speaker 0>SSD control. Hell. Alright. Alright.

01:02:22.330 --> 01:02:23.850
<v Speaker 0>Go have some fun, Marcus.

01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:26.090
<v Speaker 1>Automated the setup. Yeah.

01:02:26.650 --> 01:02:28.730
<v Speaker 1>The Helm one's actually useful. Cool.

01:02:30.695 --> 01:02:32.775
<v Speaker 2>So I think Helm's actually already installed, but

01:02:32.775 --> 01:02:33.655
<v Speaker 2>just in case.

01:02:36.055 --> 01:02:38.695
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. We do use Helm for the the

01:02:38.695 --> 01:02:39.415
<v Speaker 0>deployment.

01:02:39.575 --> 01:02:40.215
<v Speaker 0>So yeah.

01:02:50.050 --> 01:02:51.970
<v Speaker 0>I think you could have broken control plane,

01:02:51.970 --> 01:02:52.530
<v Speaker 0>Marcus.

01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:55.730

<v Speaker 2>Okay. So let's first have a look at

01:03:10.655 --> 01:03:11.935
<v Speaker 2>what we're dealing with.

01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:15.870
<v Speaker 2>So okay. So the name's been changed. Let's

01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:17.950
<v Speaker 2>let's change that back.

01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:27.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh,

<v Speaker 2>Cool.

01:03:33.695 --> 01:03:34.975
<v Speaker 2>Alright. Let's

01:03:35.215 --> 01:03:37.055
<v Speaker 2>get rid of that. What else we got?

01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:49.470
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

01:03:53.790 --> 01:03:54.670
<v Speaker 0>Is your best one?

01:03:57.265 --> 01:03:59.265
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.

01:04:04.465 --> 01:04:05.505
<v Speaker 2>No? No.

01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:18.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay. That's What are thinking so far about

01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:19.710
<v Speaker 1>this error message?

01:04:29.525 --> 01:04:30.405
<v Speaker 2>So

01:04:31.525 --> 01:04:32.245
<v Speaker 2>the

01:04:32.484 --> 01:04:33.285
<v Speaker 2>user

01:04:33.444 --> 01:04:35.125
<v Speaker 2>is not what I was expecting. I was

01:04:35.125 --> 01:04:37.204
<v Speaker 2>expecting that to be admin, especially as we

01:04:37.204 --> 01:04:37.765
<v Speaker 2>changed it.

01:04:41.330 --> 01:04:42.130
<v Speaker 2>What else

01:04:42.770 --> 01:04:43.810
<v Speaker 2>in here?

01:04:48.690 --> 01:04:51.330
<v Speaker 2>So let's see if there's been anything changed

01:04:51.330 --> 01:04:53.170
<v Speaker 2>with the Kubelet. No. That's alright.

01:04:58.975 --> 01:04:59.855
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So

01:05:00.495 --> 01:05:03.135
<v Speaker 0>Good comment there from Russell. Do a dash

01:05:03.135 --> 01:05:05.695
<v Speaker 0>v name and check the the debug logging

01:05:05.695 --> 01:05:07.935
<v Speaker 0>control if you want. Yeah. Good.

01:05:08.415 --> 01:05:09.375
<v Speaker 2>Good point.

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:16.119
<v Speaker 2>Oh, you now you can't see me scroll,

01:05:16.119 --> 01:05:18.760
<v Speaker 2>can you? Hold on. That's alright. I'm doing.

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh, you do? Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:23.800
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:25.319
<v Speaker 2>So

01:05:28.815 --> 01:05:29.695
<v Speaker 2>response.

01:05:32.175 --> 01:05:32.815
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

01:05:34.895 --> 01:05:36.495
<v Speaker 0>So I I kinda feel like this is

01:05:36.495 --> 01:05:38.575
<v Speaker 0>a real cube control and a real

01:05:39.110 --> 01:05:40.550
<v Speaker 0>API server.

01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:44.710
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It looks alright.

01:05:50.550 --> 01:05:53.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Okay. That's the one I pulled

01:05:53.830 --> 01:05:54.230
<v Speaker 2>out.

01:05:55.095 --> 01:05:57.415
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Try a cube control

01:05:57.415 --> 01:05:58.055
<v Speaker 0>version

01:05:58.215 --> 01:05:58.615
<v Speaker 0>curiosity.

01:06:00.055 --> 01:06:02.615
<v Speaker 1>If you want a cuter version of kubectl,

01:06:02.615 --> 01:06:04.295
<v Speaker 1>there's also kubectl.

01:06:08.775 --> 01:06:09.655
<v Speaker 0>What was that, Lee?

01:06:11.450 --> 01:06:14.809
<v Speaker 1>There's also cute cute CTL as well over

01:06:14.809 --> 01:06:16.970
<v Speaker 1>there. Unfortunately, you overwrote my

01:06:17.290 --> 01:06:19.369
<v Speaker 1>my shell script that was telling you to

01:06:19.369 --> 01:06:23.690
<v Speaker 1>just mute the. I've

01:06:23.690 --> 01:06:24.490
<v Speaker 1>already been forwarded.

01:06:28.845 --> 01:06:31.645
<v Speaker 0>Luckily, you're full than I thought you'd be.

01:06:31.645 --> 01:06:31.805
<v Speaker 1>So

01:06:36.125 --> 01:06:38.480
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we're able to connect to the

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:41.280
<v Speaker 2>server. We can see the the version's responding.

01:06:41.599 --> 01:06:42.080
<v Speaker 2>That

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:44.080
<v Speaker 2>looks correct. Okay.

01:06:47.359 --> 01:06:48.079
<v Speaker 2>Let's

01:06:48.319 --> 01:06:50.079
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I didn't have enough time to read

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:51.359
<v Speaker 1>help, and I used to add more.

01:06:54.905 --> 01:06:57.145
<v Speaker 2>I I nearly nearly did.

01:06:58.825 --> 01:06:59.545
<v Speaker 2>Oh, I can

01:07:01.065 --> 01:07:02.665
<v Speaker 0>no. There we go.

01:07:05.225 --> 01:07:05.625
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:07.560
<v Speaker 2>Where are you looking?

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:14.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:15.800
<v Speaker 2>No. You can't see what I can see.

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:16.600
<v Speaker 0>I can. Yes.

01:07:21.265 --> 01:07:22.065
<v Speaker 2>So

01:07:23.665 --> 01:07:25.025
<v Speaker 2>now preference to

01:07:25.585 --> 01:07:27.345
<v Speaker 2>authorization mode.

01:07:31.265 --> 01:07:33.025
<v Speaker 2>Is that authorization mode correct?

01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:35.620
<v Speaker 2>That's right. Yeah. I mean, when I first

01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:36.820
<v Speaker 0>seen that, I was like, oh, that's been

01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:38.580
<v Speaker 0>changed. But now I'm starting to second guess

01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:39.300
<v Speaker 0>myself.

01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:44.020
<v Speaker 1>I only changed one line in this file.

01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:44.580
<v Speaker 1>No.

01:07:48.665 --> 01:07:49.305
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

01:07:49.945 --> 01:07:51.145
<v Speaker 0>Hey. There you go.

01:07:52.105 --> 01:07:54.105
<v Speaker 0>Sorry?

01:07:56.505 --> 01:07:57.305
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:07:58.345 --> 01:07:59.945
<v Speaker 1>The the only change in this file is

01:07:59.945 --> 01:08:00.345
<v Speaker 1>the name.

01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:04.030
<v Speaker 0>Oh, here we go.

01:08:05.070 --> 01:08:07.230
<v Speaker 1>Well, you can totally just leave it like

01:08:07.230 --> 01:08:09.230
<v Speaker 1>that. It's it's completely gone.

01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:13.710
<v Speaker 2>What am looking at? Sorry. What's the top.

01:08:13.710 --> 01:08:16.510
<v Speaker 0>The metadata name has been changed, but that's

01:08:15.795 --> 01:08:16.594
<v Speaker 0>superficial.

01:08:16.755 --> 01:08:16.995
<v Speaker 0>So

01:08:18.835 --> 01:08:19.635
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

01:08:22.194 --> 01:08:23.314
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Okay.

01:08:27.074 --> 01:08:28.675
<v Speaker 2>Does that I don't think that makes a

01:08:28.675 --> 01:08:30.594
<v Speaker 2>difference, does it? No. Superficial.

01:08:32.130 --> 01:08:33.010
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

01:08:34.449 --> 01:08:35.170
<v Speaker 2>So

01:08:35.649 --> 01:08:37.010
<v Speaker 2>what else have we got then?

01:08:48.615 --> 01:08:50.935
<v Speaker 0>Surely nobody with mass spec kit that.

01:08:52.055 --> 01:08:53.175
<v Speaker 0>That would be weird.

01:08:54.135 --> 01:08:56.295
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I I know very little about it,

01:08:56.295 --> 01:08:56.774
<v Speaker 2>so

01:08:57.335 --> 01:08:57.975
<v Speaker 2>who knows?

01:08:59.170 --> 01:09:01.729
<v Speaker 1>Okay. I also I also from

01:09:01.729 --> 01:09:02.210
<v Speaker 1>that,

01:09:02.609 --> 01:09:04.369
<v Speaker 1>just because I didn't want them to do

01:09:04.369 --> 01:09:05.649
<v Speaker 1>the announcements.

01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:06.289
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

01:09:09.489 --> 01:09:11.569
<v Speaker 2>So we've got some containers.

01:09:11.569 --> 01:09:12.449
<v Speaker 2>That's that's good.

01:09:14.354 --> 01:09:16.755
<v Speaker 2>See if we've got any pods.

01:09:20.115 --> 01:09:21.554
<v Speaker 2>Okay. So we've got

01:09:22.915 --> 01:09:24.915
<v Speaker 2>kube calendar.

01:09:25.154 --> 01:09:25.795
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

01:09:26.675 --> 01:09:27.475
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Cool.

01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:31.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Google Calendar. Sure. And

01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:36.939
<v Speaker 0>the controller mule. Get it. The Oulu controller.

01:09:37.979 --> 01:09:39.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And

01:09:39.979 --> 01:09:41.899
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I I think I think you had

01:09:41.899 --> 01:09:42.699
<v Speaker 2>more fun with this.

01:09:46.865 --> 01:09:48.465
<v Speaker 2>Okay. So

01:09:55.745 --> 01:09:57.265
<v Speaker 2>let's see if we can do anything. So

01:09:57.265 --> 01:09:59.185
<v Speaker 2>we can't

01:10:01.190 --> 01:10:02.310
<v Speaker 1>can't without the

01:10:02.710 --> 01:10:05.110
<v Speaker 1>try without the, dash a flag there.

01:10:11.315 --> 01:10:12.275
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

01:10:12.675 --> 01:10:16.834
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That dash a flag, implicitly lists namespaces.

01:10:17.875 --> 01:10:20.034
<v Speaker 1>So this is, like, an important thing for,

01:10:20.034 --> 01:10:22.114
<v Speaker 1>like, any platform engineers. Like, if you're ever

01:10:22.114 --> 01:10:24.435
<v Speaker 1>trying to share a cluster with, like, lots

01:10:24.435 --> 01:10:26.660
<v Speaker 1>of tenants and, like, don't want them to

01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:28.580
<v Speaker 1>know the namespaces of each other, then it

01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:30.740
<v Speaker 1>creates, like, a huge usability issue in quick

01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:33.060
<v Speaker 1>control. Because you cannot use a resource name

01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:35.060
<v Speaker 1>with a list in Rawkode.

01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:36.500
<v Speaker 0>There you go.

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:38.580
<v Speaker 1>I I would have done it otherwise for

01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:40.985
<v Speaker 1>you so that, you know, you wouldn't run

01:10:40.985 --> 01:10:42.824
<v Speaker 1>into the problem as soon as you did.

01:10:47.304 --> 01:10:48.985
<v Speaker 2>Okay. I mean, you only have to modify

01:10:48.985 --> 01:10:50.585
<v Speaker 0>cluster, so maybe it's not the end of

01:10:50.585 --> 01:10:50.905
<v Speaker 0>the world.

01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:53.699
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.500
<v Speaker 2>Okay. Let's let's give that a go. Let's

01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:57.780
<v Speaker 2>let's see what we can do.

01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:05.620
<v Speaker 2>No.

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:27.400
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Let's not done anything.

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:30.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:11:37.595 --> 01:11:40.635
<v Speaker 2>Failed to create new replica set. Forbidden

01:11:40.635 --> 01:11:42.555
<v Speaker 2>exceed quota.

01:11:43.035 --> 01:11:44.715
<v Speaker 0>Oh, quota thing.

01:11:47.115 --> 01:11:48.555
<v Speaker 2>Oh, god. I don't know where quota is

01:11:48.555 --> 01:11:49.115
<v Speaker 2>a diff a

01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:54.200
<v Speaker 0>Well, I would take a look at API

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:55.000
<v Speaker 0>resources.

01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:56.360
<v Speaker 0>Would be a good place to start.

01:12:05.175 --> 01:12:06.614
<v Speaker 2>Okay. Resells.

01:12:13.255 --> 01:12:14.215
<v Speaker 0>Super.

01:12:14.455 --> 01:12:14.695
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:23.900
<v Speaker 0>Oh. Uh-oh.

01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:25.900
<v Speaker 0>And there's our backbite share.

01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:31.180
<v Speaker 1>And have security issues with the kinda own

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:31.660
<v Speaker 1>pods.

01:12:35.235 --> 01:12:37.075
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you think you can edit but not

01:12:37.075 --> 01:12:38.435
<v Speaker 0>delete? It's sneaky.

01:12:39.635 --> 01:12:40.355
<v Speaker 2>I see.

01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:50.540
<v Speaker 2>Let's just

01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:51.900
<v Speaker 2>yeah.

01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:55.260
<v Speaker 1>9,000.

01:12:58.300 --> 01:12:59.100
<v Speaker 0>Nice try.

01:13:04.325 --> 01:13:07.525
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Run cube control off, who am I?

01:13:07.525 --> 01:13:09.045
<v Speaker 0>Just out of curiosity.

01:13:14.805 --> 01:13:17.140
<v Speaker 2>Who what? Who am I? Maybe I oh,

01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:19.220
<v Speaker 0>yeah. What no no dashes. It's just like

01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:21.060
<v Speaker 0>that. Just who am I? Like, the limits

01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:21.860
<v Speaker 0>command.

01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:25.219
<v Speaker 0>Maybe that's the plug in.

01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:13:38.365 --> 01:13:40.765
<v Speaker 0>That Well, I think I'll see what The

01:13:40.765 --> 01:13:43.405
<v Speaker 2>scenario here is that the

01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:44.460
<v Speaker 1>the SRE team

01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:45.820
<v Speaker 1>had a meeting,

01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:46.780
<v Speaker 1>and

01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:49.260
<v Speaker 1>they read this article

01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:50.940
<v Speaker 1>from Rawkode Security

01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:53.980
<v Speaker 1>about how system masters is insecure.

01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:55.179
<v Speaker 1>Because

01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:57.340
<v Speaker 1>system masters,

01:13:57.855 --> 01:13:59.775
<v Speaker 1>it's the group that's used on the admin

01:13:59.775 --> 01:14:00.735
<v Speaker 1>coop config,

01:14:01.775 --> 01:14:04.095
<v Speaker 1>and it's it's the group that gets binded

01:14:04.095 --> 01:14:04.655
<v Speaker 1>to

01:14:05.135 --> 01:14:07.215
<v Speaker 1>by the default cluster role binding.

01:14:08.175 --> 01:14:10.735
<v Speaker 1>But if you delete every single RBAC object

01:14:10.735 --> 01:14:13.935
<v Speaker 1>inside the cluster, system masters has a by

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:16.159
<v Speaker 1>that's hard coded into the API server.

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:19.920
<v Speaker 1>And it still works. It still lets you

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:22.000
<v Speaker 1>access the cluster even if you've closed your

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:22.800
<v Speaker 1>RBAC.

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:27.234
<v Speaker 1>So I just I I decided,

01:14:27.235 --> 01:14:28.994
<v Speaker 1>you know, when I was talking with our

01:14:28.994 --> 01:14:30.195
<v Speaker 1>FRA team that,

01:14:31.954 --> 01:14:33.554
<v Speaker 1>maybe it would be better if we use

01:14:33.554 --> 01:14:35.715
<v Speaker 1>some least privilege roles, you know. Like, you

01:14:35.715 --> 01:14:38.034
<v Speaker 1>can get in there and and, like, delete

01:14:38.034 --> 01:14:40.114
<v Speaker 1>some sensible pods and stuff if, like, you

01:14:40.114 --> 01:14:41.074
<v Speaker 1>need to quickly

01:14:41.610 --> 01:14:45.289
<v Speaker 1>change production stuff. But all the policy and

01:14:46.090 --> 01:14:48.090
<v Speaker 1>the things that you don't normally wanna touch,

01:14:48.090 --> 01:14:49.850
<v Speaker 1>we'll keep that out of the normal RBAC

01:14:49.850 --> 01:14:50.489
<v Speaker 1>range.

01:14:50.730 --> 01:14:53.369
<v Speaker 1>But, of course, just like any Linux server

01:14:53.369 --> 01:14:55.130
<v Speaker 1>that you log into with your own user.

01:14:55.130 --> 01:14:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Right?

01:14:56.195 --> 01:14:57.875
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna wanna have, like, some sort of

01:14:57.875 --> 01:14:58.915
<v Speaker 1>pseudo privilege.

01:14:59.395 --> 01:15:00.114
<v Speaker 1>Right?

01:15:01.155 --> 01:15:01.875
<v Speaker 1>Well,

01:15:02.195 --> 01:15:03.715
<v Speaker 1>one of the hints in there

01:15:04.355 --> 01:15:07.235
<v Speaker 1>Oh, what Marcus tried there was switching to

01:15:07.235 --> 01:15:08.115
<v Speaker 0>the Kubectlone,

01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:10.190
<v Speaker 0>which was a nice try, but that that

01:15:10.190 --> 01:15:11.630
<v Speaker 0>would be able to allow you to modify

01:15:11.630 --> 01:15:12.510
<v Speaker 0>the r back.

01:15:13.070 --> 01:15:14.750
<v Speaker 0>But I would encourage you to run

01:15:15.150 --> 01:15:17.230
<v Speaker 0>can I list again and pay attention

01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:19.310
<v Speaker 0>to a couple of things in there? Yeah.

01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:21.070
<v Speaker 2>I I saw there's the impersonate.

01:15:21.465 --> 01:15:22.584
<v Speaker 0>Oh, even before

01:15:23.145 --> 01:15:26.105
<v Speaker 0>the impersonate, there's something worth checking out. Oh,

01:15:26.105 --> 01:15:27.064
<v Speaker 0>is there another?

01:15:28.105 --> 01:15:30.185
<v Speaker 1>I don't actually know if this shows up

01:15:30.185 --> 01:15:32.104
<v Speaker 1>inside of Canon or

01:15:32.585 --> 01:15:32.985
<v Speaker 1>not.

01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:36.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. The the thing that you need, it

01:15:36.150 --> 01:15:38.550
<v Speaker 1>may not show up there for a peculiar

01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:39.270
<v Speaker 1>reason,

01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:42.869
<v Speaker 1>but maybe it's there.

01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:47.670
<v Speaker 0>Elephant strike is interesting.

01:15:47.670 --> 01:15:48.070
<v Speaker 1>You know?

01:15:51.324 --> 01:15:53.245
<v Speaker 2>Sorry. Where do you look at? The very

01:15:54.125 --> 01:15:55.485
<v Speaker 0>I'm trying not to get too much away.

01:15:55.485 --> 01:15:56.844
<v Speaker 0>The first five, like Oh.

01:15:58.364 --> 01:16:00.685
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Sorry. Your scroll is different to my

01:16:00.685 --> 01:16:01.005
<v Speaker 2>scroll.

01:16:03.090 --> 01:16:05.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It may not show up for you.

01:16:05.490 --> 01:16:07.330
<v Speaker 1>Do if you type into the head No.

01:16:07.330 --> 01:16:08.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I've I've got it. I've got it.

01:16:08.690 --> 01:16:09.650
<v Speaker 2>I've got it. Yeah. Yeah.

01:16:10.530 --> 01:16:12.530
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So there's a there's a rather interesting

01:16:12.530 --> 01:16:13.890
<v Speaker 0>that you have complete

01:16:14.450 --> 01:16:17.170
<v Speaker 0>unfiltered access to something called break glass, which

01:16:17.170 --> 01:16:17.730
<v Speaker 0>is interesting.

01:16:18.385 --> 01:16:21.105
<v Speaker 0>But the impersonate is also very interesting. So

01:16:22.304 --> 01:16:23.025
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:16:24.304 --> 01:16:26.304
<v Speaker 0>But I'm curious about break glass. Let's take

01:16:26.304 --> 01:16:27.104
<v Speaker 0>a look at that.

01:16:29.105 --> 01:16:31.025
<v Speaker 2>So what was that? That was the Cluster

01:16:31.025 --> 01:16:33.505
<v Speaker 0>role binding. Cluster role behindings.

01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:37.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:45.880
<v Speaker 1>I love that everyone watching is getting a

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:48.625
<v Speaker 1>deep dive into every single RBAC object. It's

01:16:48.625 --> 01:16:51.745
<v Speaker 1>exactly what the United object community needs right

01:16:51.745 --> 01:16:52.225
<v Speaker 1>now.

01:16:52.785 --> 01:16:54.705
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I would have expected that to work

01:16:54.705 --> 01:16:57.185
<v Speaker 0>because you have unfiltered access.

01:16:57.505 --> 01:16:59.345
<v Speaker 0>So it must be the impersonation there.

01:17:01.369 --> 01:17:03.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I have no idea how to do

01:17:03.690 --> 01:17:04.889
<v Speaker 1>that. Yeah.

01:17:07.770 --> 01:17:10.969
<v Speaker 1>So you don't have gets on on cluster

01:17:10.969 --> 01:17:13.474
<v Speaker 1>role binding or list and that sort of

01:17:13.474 --> 01:17:15.554
<v Speaker 1>thing. But we thought you would do it

01:17:15.554 --> 01:17:17.235
<v Speaker 0>on the name, though. So you have to

01:17:17.235 --> 01:17:18.195
<v Speaker 0>add the name. So

01:17:18.915 --> 01:17:20.915
<v Speaker 1>that's that's that's good to know that resource

01:17:20.915 --> 01:17:22.195
<v Speaker 1>name shows up there.

01:17:23.554 --> 01:17:26.355
<v Speaker 0>Break dash glass. Break glass. Thank you.

01:17:29.949 --> 01:17:32.110
<v Speaker 2>Okay. So it's not inconsistent.

01:17:34.830 --> 01:17:36.670
<v Speaker 0>Well, it's not in the namespace because it's

01:17:36.670 --> 01:17:38.989
<v Speaker 0>a cluster rule binding. Oh, of course. Yes.

01:17:38.989 --> 01:17:39.310
<v Speaker 2>Of course.

01:17:41.515 --> 01:17:44.155
<v Speaker 2>But it's not found. Well, that should've worked.

01:17:44.955 --> 01:17:47.275
<v Speaker 0>I guess the list fails. Try edit.

01:17:51.595 --> 01:17:51.835
<v Speaker 1>You

01:17:52.555 --> 01:17:54.315
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. I just have to edit myself.

01:17:54.315 --> 01:17:57.120
<v Speaker 1>It's it's legitimately not there right now. Alright.

01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:57.920
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Alright.

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:04.160
<v Speaker 0>I'm I'm good home. Oh, okay. Okay.

01:18:10.875 --> 01:18:12.155
<v Speaker 2>Oh, hold on.

01:18:13.675 --> 01:18:15.755
<v Speaker 2>Right. Okay. Yeah. So

01:18:16.555 --> 01:18:17.435
<v Speaker 2>can

01:18:17.435 --> 01:18:18.635
<v Speaker 2>we create the break glass?

01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:22.739
<v Speaker 0>Nice nice idea.

01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:23.780
<v Speaker 0>So

01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:29.540
<v Speaker 2>hold on. No. That's

01:18:30.660 --> 01:18:31.860
<v Speaker 2>a custom role binding.

01:18:34.105 --> 01:18:34.905
<v Speaker 0>Right. K.

01:18:39.225 --> 01:18:41.625
<v Speaker 0>You gotta find yourself the system masters.

01:18:46.185 --> 01:18:46.585
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

01:18:53.929 --> 01:18:54.969
<v Speaker 2>Oh, crap. Yeah.

01:18:59.305 --> 01:19:00.745
<v Speaker 2>It has line

01:19:00.825 --> 01:19:02.985
<v Speaker 1>If you change using QCTL,

01:19:02.985 --> 01:19:03.945
<v Speaker 1>you will have a.

01:19:08.985 --> 01:19:10.105
<v Speaker 2>What? Sorry?

01:19:10.985 --> 01:19:13.465
<v Speaker 1>If you change your command to use QCTL

01:19:13.465 --> 01:19:14.425
<v Speaker 1>instead of QUKE,

01:19:15.219 --> 01:19:18.500
<v Speaker 1>like, cute, like, it's super cute, cute CTL,

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:19.860
<v Speaker 1>it will auto complete.

01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:21.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

01:19:25.699 --> 01:19:27.300
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. But you'd have to find some YAML

01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:29.460
<v Speaker 0>for across across the rule by then. Right?

01:19:29.945 --> 01:19:30.585
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:19:31.065 --> 01:19:34.025
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to. You can totally one

01:19:34.025 --> 01:19:35.145
<v Speaker 1>liner these things.

01:19:35.465 --> 01:19:37.545
<v Speaker 1>Just maybe look at the help.

01:19:38.105 --> 01:19:40.985
<v Speaker 1>It's they're really, really simple once you get

01:19:40.985 --> 01:19:41.704
<v Speaker 1>this one.

01:19:43.945 --> 01:19:44.825
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. Nice.

01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:46.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh, yeah. Nice.

01:19:48.179 --> 01:19:50.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I actually really like doing a dry

01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:51.780
<v Speaker 1>run client

01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:53.699
<v Speaker 1>and then outputting normal.

01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:56.659
<v Speaker 1>It's usually how I author my cluster role

01:19:56.659 --> 01:19:58.179
<v Speaker 1>bindings for my control repo.

01:19:59.245 --> 01:20:00.365
<v Speaker 0>Very cool. What

01:20:02.605 --> 01:20:04.845
<v Speaker 2>cluster role was it called?

01:20:05.245 --> 01:20:06.845
<v Speaker 2>Cluster admin. Yeah. Cluster admin.

01:20:12.450 --> 01:20:14.370
<v Speaker 0>You need to bind it to a user.

01:20:15.730 --> 01:20:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh.

01:20:25.490 --> 01:20:26.370
<v Speaker 2>But I'm

01:20:27.994 --> 01:20:29.834
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the permission to create.

01:20:31.195 --> 01:20:33.754
<v Speaker 1>Oh, that's that's

01:20:34.554 --> 01:20:35.434
<v Speaker 1>odd.

01:20:38.554 --> 01:20:41.354
<v Speaker 1>Did you tell break glass properly?

01:20:42.715 --> 01:20:43.034
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:20:45.159 --> 01:20:45.880
<v Speaker 1>Because

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:48.119
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure those it's three

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:50.840
<v Speaker 1>I I did this. I tested it.

01:20:51.239 --> 01:20:51.639
<v Speaker 1>And

01:20:53.159 --> 01:20:55.000
<v Speaker 0>Did you create a cluster role binding or

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.425
<v Speaker 0>a role binding? Let's see. Yeah. Cluster role

01:20:57.425 --> 01:20:59.905
<v Speaker 0>binding. It should be cluster role binding. Yeah.

01:21:00.784 --> 01:21:02.945
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Because it says right here, have

01:21:04.304 --> 01:21:06.864
<v Speaker 1>any verb on break glass, and then you

01:21:06.864 --> 01:21:08.704
<v Speaker 1>should be able to create it and bind

01:21:08.704 --> 01:21:09.584
<v Speaker 1>it to

01:21:10.224 --> 01:21:10.945
<v Speaker 1>cluster admin.

01:21:11.490 --> 01:21:14.530
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's great. A oh, the the

01:21:15.170 --> 01:21:16.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah. That's the role.

01:21:17.650 --> 01:21:19.970
<v Speaker 1>And then it should be your own Oh,

01:21:19.970 --> 01:21:23.090
<v Speaker 0>admin. Not yeah. Oh. Yeah. It should be

01:21:23.090 --> 01:21:25.010
<v Speaker 1>the Oulu Oulu admin.

01:21:26.074 --> 01:21:28.554
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I I tried to do that. Failed

01:21:28.554 --> 01:21:30.074
<v Speaker 2>to create. Okay.

01:21:36.074 --> 01:21:38.554
<v Speaker 1>So there's one other solution to this. I

01:21:38.554 --> 01:21:40.310
<v Speaker 1>don't know why this is not working

01:21:41.350 --> 01:21:43.910
<v Speaker 1>because I have to this make sure I

01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:46.150
<v Speaker 1>put basically the exact command

01:21:46.710 --> 01:21:47.670
<v Speaker 1>into

01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:49.110
<v Speaker 1>the hints file.

01:21:50.230 --> 01:21:52.230
<v Speaker 0>Let's let's check the hints. Let's have let's

01:21:52.230 --> 01:21:53.349
<v Speaker 2>have a look at them.

01:21:54.150 --> 01:21:54.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

01:21:58.865 --> 01:22:00.465
<v Speaker 2>Let's let's stop.

01:22:02.945 --> 01:22:03.665
<v Speaker 1>So

01:22:04.865 --> 01:22:06.625
<v Speaker 1>so there's another solution.

01:22:07.105 --> 01:22:09.025
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Here. Let's just use this other solution

01:22:09.025 --> 01:22:10.945
<v Speaker 1>here because

01:22:10.590 --> 01:22:12.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why your command is not

01:22:12.510 --> 01:22:13.869
<v Speaker 1>working, but it should work.

01:22:14.590 --> 01:22:16.510
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to look through the history file

01:22:16.510 --> 01:22:17.389
<v Speaker 1>that I saved.

01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:20.510
<v Speaker 1>Because I I tested it and it functions

01:22:20.510 --> 01:22:21.389
<v Speaker 1>properly.

01:22:22.590 --> 01:22:24.429
<v Speaker 1>This is a good way to, like, provide

01:22:24.429 --> 01:22:26.625
<v Speaker 1>a a way to break glass in a

01:22:26.625 --> 01:22:28.385
<v Speaker 1>cluster that you don't normally wanna paint.

01:22:28.705 --> 01:22:29.425
<v Speaker 1>So

01:22:30.305 --> 01:22:32.625
<v Speaker 1>you we can use KubernetesM and the existing

01:22:32.625 --> 01:22:35.265
<v Speaker 1>PKI that's inside of the Kubernetes manifest PKI

01:22:35.265 --> 01:22:35.985
<v Speaker 1>directory,

01:22:36.305 --> 01:22:37.744
<v Speaker 1>to fix this problem,

01:22:38.065 --> 01:22:39.985
<v Speaker 1>by running KubernetesM

01:22:40.225 --> 01:22:40.785
<v Speaker 1>certs,

01:22:42.510 --> 01:22:44.829
<v Speaker 1>and then there is a a sub command

01:22:44.829 --> 01:22:47.550
<v Speaker 1>to regenerate the admin conf. Yes.

01:22:49.869 --> 01:22:52.110
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes search renew, I believe.

01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:55.070
<v Speaker 1>No. Oh, yeah. Renew admin, maybe?

01:22:55.915 --> 01:22:57.675
<v Speaker 0>Renew all. You don't wanna renew all of

01:22:57.675 --> 01:23:00.235
<v Speaker 1>them. Oh, okay. Well, sure. Yeah. You can.

01:23:00.635 --> 01:23:02.155
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that would

01:23:03.515 --> 01:23:05.195
<v Speaker 1>spit out the admin prompt.

01:23:05.755 --> 01:23:07.595
<v Speaker 1>No. Because there's a special there's a special

01:23:07.595 --> 01:23:08.955
<v Speaker 1>sub command for the admin one.

01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:16.460
<v Speaker 1>Admin dot com. Yeah.

01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:19.019
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:21.739
<v Speaker 1>This is the second solution to the problem,

01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:24.699
<v Speaker 1>to brute force using the, cluster PKI.

01:23:25.445 --> 01:23:26.085
<v Speaker 1>Right.

01:23:29.205 --> 01:23:31.045
<v Speaker 1>Cool. So you should be able to,

01:23:31.605 --> 01:23:33.844
<v Speaker 1>be administrator now, I think.

01:23:35.525 --> 01:23:37.845
<v Speaker 2>Does that to out to the same place?

01:23:38.730 --> 01:23:40.170
<v Speaker 1>It's good to spit it out to the

01:23:40.170 --> 01:23:41.210
<v Speaker 1>proper directory.

01:23:42.570 --> 01:23:44.969
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Looks like it's been regen. Oh,

01:23:50.330 --> 01:23:50.810
<v Speaker 1>interesting.

01:23:51.425 --> 01:23:53.985
<v Speaker 0>You may have to restart the API server.

01:23:54.945 --> 01:23:55.905
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:23:56.625 --> 01:23:58.864
<v Speaker 1>It should just be I don't think that

01:23:58.864 --> 01:24:00.785
<v Speaker 1>file got overwritten. Maybe you have to move

01:24:00.945 --> 01:24:02.305
<v Speaker 1>like, make a backup or something.

01:24:10.210 --> 01:24:11.330
<v Speaker 2>Let's have a look.

01:24:13.810 --> 01:24:14.610
<v Speaker 2>Renew.

01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:16.370
<v Speaker 2>Additionally, regardless.

01:24:20.645 --> 01:24:22.885
<v Speaker 2>Oh, okay. Yeah. No. Okay. Yeah. So it's

01:24:22.885 --> 01:24:24.645
<v Speaker 2>there's defaulted.

01:24:26.725 --> 01:24:27.525
<v Speaker 2>Yep.

01:24:31.445 --> 01:24:34.485
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember that? Error reading configuration from

01:24:34.485 --> 01:24:36.990
<v Speaker 2>cluster falling back to the default configurations.

01:24:36.990 --> 01:24:39.230
<v Speaker 0>That's okay. We don't use skip proximity cluster.

01:24:39.230 --> 01:24:39.869
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Yeah.

01:24:45.310 --> 01:24:46.190
<v Speaker 1>I

01:24:47.470 --> 01:24:49.470
<v Speaker 1>I I think we might just need to

01:24:50.355 --> 01:24:52.435
<v Speaker 1>move the file to a different name,

01:24:52.915 --> 01:24:55.715
<v Speaker 1>just to verify that Deepgram is actually trying

01:24:55.715 --> 01:24:56.995
<v Speaker 1>to write it out.

01:24:58.835 --> 01:24:59.395
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:25:04.910 --> 01:25:06.349
<v Speaker 1>Oh, it says missing.

01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:10.909
<v Speaker 1>So there's another way to do

01:25:10.910 --> 01:25:11.310
<v Speaker 1>this.

01:25:21.835 --> 01:25:22.954
<v Speaker 2>Was it? Nope.

01:25:27.435 --> 01:25:27.995
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not.

01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:32.660
<v Speaker 0>No. Don't take it. All of the PPIs

01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:35.219
<v Speaker 1>are used to do this, and I and

01:25:35.219 --> 01:25:37.140
<v Speaker 1>I did generate this earlier as well.

01:25:45.804 --> 01:25:47.005
<v Speaker 1>That's so

01:25:47.645 --> 01:25:48.204
<v Speaker 1>I

01:25:48.765 --> 01:25:50.765
<v Speaker 1>might log in and and tinker with that

01:25:50.765 --> 01:25:52.765
<v Speaker 1>cluster role binding command really quick.

01:25:57.670 --> 01:25:58.630
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So that

01:26:03.510 --> 01:26:05.909
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. You shouldn't need to keep config params.

01:26:17.264 --> 01:26:19.425
<v Speaker 0>That looks like it working. Right?

01:26:20.304 --> 01:26:21.905
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:26:25.665 --> 01:26:26.784
<v Speaker 0>Try try to get pods.

01:26:35.090 --> 01:26:35.730
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

01:26:37.010 --> 01:26:38.930
<v Speaker 2>Oh, it's been really laggy for me. Are

01:26:38.930 --> 01:26:39.970
<v Speaker 2>you are you seeing that as well?

01:26:42.864 --> 01:26:44.224
<v Speaker 0>No. It's okay.

01:26:51.985 --> 01:26:53.344
<v Speaker 0>Well, that won't restart.

01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:56.120
<v Speaker 0>And if I'm just full,

01:26:57.640 --> 01:26:58.840
<v Speaker 0>you would have to do it.

01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:08.200
<v Speaker 0>Power back is always a pleasure.

01:27:09.664 --> 01:27:11.104
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

01:27:12.465 --> 01:27:14.625
<v Speaker 2>Oh, okay. I've got access to the cube

01:27:14.625 --> 01:27:15.344
<v Speaker 2>system.

01:27:18.224 --> 01:27:20.144
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So maybe you can grab a

01:27:20.784 --> 01:27:21.744
<v Speaker 1>token in there.

01:27:24.849 --> 01:27:26.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's a fair solution. You can grab

01:27:26.530 --> 01:27:27.730
<v Speaker 1>a token from one of the

01:27:29.329 --> 01:27:30.369
<v Speaker 1>from something.

01:27:32.050 --> 01:27:35.329
<v Speaker 1>I don't know necessarily what something might have

01:27:35.329 --> 01:27:37.250
<v Speaker 1>the ability to give you.

01:27:38.535 --> 01:27:39.255
<v Speaker 1>Oh,

01:27:40.614 --> 01:27:41.735
<v Speaker 1>okay. Yeah.

01:27:42.855 --> 01:27:45.415
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I mean, one upgrade would be just,

01:27:45.415 --> 01:27:47.094
<v Speaker 1>like, being able to see, like,

01:27:47.574 --> 01:27:49.574
<v Speaker 1>workloads in all namespaces,

01:27:49.574 --> 01:27:51.175
<v Speaker 1>which that would be, like,

01:27:52.090 --> 01:27:53.370
<v Speaker 1>a lot of pods.

01:27:53.930 --> 01:27:54.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:27:58.330 --> 01:27:59.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure which of these.

01:28:16.095 --> 01:28:17.935
<v Speaker 0>K. So why can you access Kube system

01:28:17.935 --> 01:28:18.815
<v Speaker 0>but not

01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:21.659
<v Speaker 0>default namespace?

01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:26.060
<v Speaker 2>No. I can't. I just can't access namespace

01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:27.179
<v Speaker 2>in general.

01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Mhmm.

01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:30.139
<v Speaker 1>So

01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:32.060
<v Speaker 2>I can do I can do it in

01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:34.014
<v Speaker 2>in the default, but I can't do

01:28:35.215 --> 01:28:38.014
<v Speaker 2>so I'm I'm blocked from actually getting namespaces.

01:28:41.934 --> 01:28:46.974
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Since you have access to

01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:45.789
<v Speaker 1>secrets

01:28:45.790 --> 01:28:48.909
<v Speaker 1>inside of the, cookie system name space,

01:28:49.390 --> 01:28:51.949
<v Speaker 1>another avenue for you to do a privilege

01:28:51.949 --> 01:28:54.269
<v Speaker 1>escalation in this situation is to

01:28:54.590 --> 01:28:58.190
<v Speaker 1>grab a legacy service account token from

01:28:58.385 --> 01:29:00.225
<v Speaker 1>one of the more privileged pods.

01:29:10.945 --> 01:29:11.905
<v Speaker 2>Okay. What we got?

01:29:20.190 --> 01:29:22.590
<v Speaker 2>What do we think? Node controller, maybe?

01:29:23.550 --> 01:29:25.390
<v Speaker 0>No. That won't have what you need.

01:29:28.905 --> 01:29:30.825
<v Speaker 0>We could just do an anti control delete

01:29:30.825 --> 01:29:32.505
<v Speaker 0>of the bad

01:29:32.665 --> 01:29:33.945
<v Speaker 0>rule binding. Right?

01:29:35.065 --> 01:29:37.145
<v Speaker 1>You could. You have to put through that.

01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:42.239
<v Speaker 1>But it's

01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:45.199
<v Speaker 1>that you would have less access than before.

01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:50.480
<v Speaker 0>Right. Maybe I I don't understand. Well, what

01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:52.000
<v Speaker 0>have you done to the Rawkode?

01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:53.920
<v Speaker 0>Because I'm I think I'm a bit at

01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:54.800
<v Speaker 0>a loss right now.

01:29:55.465 --> 01:29:56.985
<v Speaker 1>So I basically

01:29:57.145 --> 01:29:57.785
<v Speaker 1>have

01:29:58.025 --> 01:30:01.545
<v Speaker 1>issued a new certificate using the Kubernetes alpha,

01:30:03.065 --> 01:30:04.025
<v Speaker 1>or the Kubernetes

01:30:04.505 --> 01:30:05.145
<v Speaker 1>oh,

01:30:06.105 --> 01:30:07.465
<v Speaker 1>sorry. There's another

01:30:07.705 --> 01:30:08.185
<v Speaker 1>there's a

01:30:09.310 --> 01:30:12.030
<v Speaker 1>do this. Go to Kubernetes on group config.

01:30:14.590 --> 01:30:16.270
<v Speaker 1>There there's a whole new stuff to manage

01:30:16.270 --> 01:30:17.390
<v Speaker 1>that's GA now,

01:30:17.710 --> 01:30:18.590
<v Speaker 1>for this.

01:30:22.270 --> 01:30:23.070
<v Speaker 0>Oh. And

01:30:29.325 --> 01:30:31.085
<v Speaker 1>what user can we

01:30:31.405 --> 01:30:34.765
<v Speaker 1>mint for this? You could mint the user

01:30:34.765 --> 01:30:37.325
<v Speaker 1>of, like, a a privileged service account, and

01:30:37.325 --> 01:30:38.845
<v Speaker 1>then you have to format the service account

01:30:38.845 --> 01:30:39.325
<v Speaker 1>username.

01:30:40.930 --> 01:30:43.570
<v Speaker 1>So what I've done is I've minted a

01:30:43.570 --> 01:30:44.449
<v Speaker 1>certificate,

01:30:44.850 --> 01:30:48.130
<v Speaker 1>and using this and the Kubernetes config file,

01:30:48.610 --> 01:30:51.330
<v Speaker 1>you can ask Kubernetes to give you certificates

01:30:51.330 --> 01:30:53.010
<v Speaker 1>that are signed by the cluster CA.

01:30:53.645 --> 01:30:56.285
<v Speaker 1>And since Kubernetes clusters

01:30:56.285 --> 01:30:57.485
<v Speaker 1>will accept

01:30:57.805 --> 01:30:58.685
<v Speaker 1>mutual

01:30:58.685 --> 01:30:59.565
<v Speaker 1>TLS

01:30:59.645 --> 01:31:01.245
<v Speaker 1>client certificate off,

01:31:02.445 --> 01:31:04.925
<v Speaker 1>the cert the username that you're trying to

01:31:04.925 --> 01:31:07.570
<v Speaker 1>change before, it's actually baked into the x

01:31:07.570 --> 01:31:09.410
<v Speaker 1>five zero nine data, and it's it's pinned

01:31:09.410 --> 01:31:10.530
<v Speaker 1>like that based on

01:31:12.770 --> 01:31:15.330
<v Speaker 1>so that's how you have your identity, that

01:31:15.330 --> 01:31:16.690
<v Speaker 1>oOO admin.

01:31:17.250 --> 01:31:20.850
<v Speaker 1>And then I've gone in and added privileges

01:31:20.850 --> 01:31:22.690
<v Speaker 1>to to oOO admin

01:31:22.875 --> 01:31:25.755
<v Speaker 1>to be editor in every single namespace except

01:31:25.755 --> 01:31:27.034
<v Speaker 1>for two of them.

01:31:27.435 --> 01:31:28.875
<v Speaker 1>And then, also,

01:31:30.795 --> 01:31:34.155
<v Speaker 1>I've I added that break glass mechanism

01:31:34.235 --> 01:31:36.075
<v Speaker 1>that I I guess I didn't test well

01:31:36.075 --> 01:31:36.315
<v Speaker 1>enough.

01:31:37.130 --> 01:31:39.050
<v Speaker 1>I thought I used it properly,

01:31:39.210 --> 01:31:41.610
<v Speaker 1>and I was able to to use the

01:31:41.610 --> 01:31:44.489
<v Speaker 1>mechanism just fine. But I must have accidentally

01:31:44.489 --> 01:31:46.650
<v Speaker 1>created the cluster role binding using a higher

01:31:46.650 --> 01:31:47.689
<v Speaker 1>privileged account

01:31:48.090 --> 01:31:50.355
<v Speaker 1>while I was setting it up. And But

01:31:50.355 --> 01:31:52.514
<v Speaker 0>I don't understand why our koop adm search

01:31:52.514 --> 01:31:53.875
<v Speaker 0>renew admin.com

01:31:53.875 --> 01:31:56.114
<v Speaker 0>used your Mintage username

01:31:56.275 --> 01:31:58.034
<v Speaker 0>because it shouldn't. Right?

01:31:58.914 --> 01:31:59.474
<v Speaker 1>No.

01:31:59.795 --> 01:32:02.594
<v Speaker 1>I don't that's just not producing the admin

01:32:02.594 --> 01:32:03.795
<v Speaker 1>comp for some reason.

01:32:06.410 --> 01:32:08.489
<v Speaker 2>You didn't change any of these, did you?

01:32:10.810 --> 01:32:11.530
<v Speaker 1>No.

01:32:11.610 --> 01:32:14.090
<v Speaker 1>No. I the only thing I deleted was

01:32:14.090 --> 01:32:14.970
<v Speaker 1>the admin comp.

01:32:19.855 --> 01:32:21.534
<v Speaker 1>But, if you

01:32:22.335 --> 01:32:23.054
<v Speaker 1>use

01:32:23.455 --> 01:32:25.614
<v Speaker 1>anything that might have access to

01:32:27.215 --> 01:32:28.175
<v Speaker 1>secrets,

01:32:28.655 --> 01:32:30.415
<v Speaker 1>or to

01:32:31.710 --> 01:32:33.310
<v Speaker 1>exact in pods.

01:32:33.710 --> 01:32:36.110
<v Speaker 1>You could also get the you could also

01:32:36.110 --> 01:32:37.950
<v Speaker 1>exact into a pod

01:32:38.670 --> 01:32:41.150
<v Speaker 1>from the workload from the working org,

01:32:41.950 --> 01:32:43.390
<v Speaker 1>and you would be able to get,

01:32:45.745 --> 01:32:48.304
<v Speaker 1>like, tokens that would give you access.

01:32:48.785 --> 01:32:50.864
<v Speaker 1>None but I've I've really

01:32:51.665 --> 01:32:54.385
<v Speaker 1>not done you any favors, by messing up

01:32:54.385 --> 01:32:56.465
<v Speaker 1>that as you go

01:32:57.030 --> 01:33:00.550
<v Speaker 1>route there with the, cluster role binding create.

01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:10.390
<v Speaker 2>We do anything with the reset.

01:33:16.735 --> 01:33:17.295
<v Speaker 2>Screw it.

01:33:23.370 --> 01:33:25.530
<v Speaker 2>Okay. That doesn't look like it's gonna do

01:33:25.530 --> 01:33:26.170
<v Speaker 2>much.

01:33:36.330 --> 01:33:38.570
<v Speaker 1>Did I need to

01:33:38.195 --> 01:33:40.994
<v Speaker 1>Kubitiam config in the root home directory?

01:33:49.315 --> 01:33:51.155
<v Speaker 1>Yes. I did. Yeah. So

01:33:51.635 --> 01:33:53.715
<v Speaker 1>when you use your Kubitiam commands,

01:33:54.330 --> 01:33:56.490
<v Speaker 1>you can pass that. That's that's just a

01:33:56.490 --> 01:33:57.929
<v Speaker 1>config map from the,

01:33:58.330 --> 01:33:59.770
<v Speaker 1>Kube system namespace.

01:34:00.890 --> 01:34:02.890
<v Speaker 1>But it's I just wrote it out for

01:34:02.890 --> 01:34:03.610
<v Speaker 1>convenience,

01:34:04.250 --> 01:34:06.330
<v Speaker 1>so that you wouldn't have to go and

01:34:06.330 --> 01:34:06.730
<v Speaker 1>find it.

01:34:07.635 --> 01:34:09.954
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes stores it config in

01:34:10.355 --> 01:34:11.314
<v Speaker 1>Kube system.

01:34:12.755 --> 01:34:16.114
<v Speaker 1>And, so when you use Kubernetes commands like,

01:34:17.155 --> 01:34:19.234
<v Speaker 1>like, Kubernetes, it

01:34:19.795 --> 01:34:22.639
<v Speaker 1>acts for the Kubernetes config and as a

01:34:22.639 --> 01:34:24.480
<v Speaker 1>flag, and you can pass this. Same thing

01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:26.400
<v Speaker 1>for when you, like, renew certs and stuff,

01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:29.039
<v Speaker 1>and, this might alleviate

01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:31.280
<v Speaker 1>some of the issues that you're having with

01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:32.080
<v Speaker 1>regenerating

01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:34.000
<v Speaker 1>the admin conf. I think when I was

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.855
<v Speaker 1>doing it and testing that roughly, it worked.

01:34:37.015 --> 01:34:39.175
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure I've just deleted the cluster.

01:34:40.295 --> 01:34:41.815
<v Speaker 1>Oh, did you did you run a Kubernetes

01:34:41.815 --> 01:34:42.534
<v Speaker 1>and reset?

01:34:43.255 --> 01:34:44.135
<v Speaker 2>I did.

01:34:45.895 --> 01:34:46.535
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

01:34:47.015 --> 01:34:50.215
<v Speaker 1>Well, I suppose when you and you didn't

01:34:50.215 --> 01:34:51.175
<v Speaker 1>take a a TD snapshot.

01:34:52.830 --> 01:34:54.590
<v Speaker 2>Nah. That's not from scratch.

01:34:56.190 --> 01:34:58.190
<v Speaker 1>And then you'll need to deploy the

01:34:59.470 --> 01:35:00.830
<v Speaker 1>the workflow.

01:35:05.150 --> 01:35:06.670
<v Speaker 1>Would you like me to add the the

01:35:06.670 --> 01:35:07.630
<v Speaker 1>things back that can?

01:35:11.465 --> 01:35:13.785
<v Speaker 2>No. I'm just gonna deploy clustered and then

01:35:13.785 --> 01:35:14.745
<v Speaker 2>be done with it.

01:35:17.225 --> 01:35:18.745
<v Speaker 2>This is this is the bare metal version

01:35:18.745 --> 01:35:20.745
<v Speaker 2>of of just rolling the nodes. Right? Why

01:35:20.745 --> 01:35:23.225
<v Speaker 0>don't you apply everything back except the RBAC

01:35:23.130 --> 01:35:24.570
<v Speaker 0>change? Can you do that?

01:35:25.130 --> 01:35:27.209
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I can. Alright. Okay. Alright,

01:35:36.810 --> 01:35:40.889
<v Speaker 0>Marcus. We'll give Lee just a minute to

01:35:38.925 --> 01:35:41.965
<v Speaker 0>inject the other breaks minus the RBAC break

01:35:41.965 --> 01:35:42.604
<v Speaker 0>because

01:35:43.405 --> 01:35:44.684
<v Speaker 0>RBAC's too hard.

01:35:45.565 --> 01:35:47.565
<v Speaker 2>I've gotta get get the the node set

01:35:47.565 --> 01:35:49.164
<v Speaker 2>up again. Get the hard thing up. Yeah.

01:35:49.165 --> 01:35:49.645
<v Speaker 1>Mhmm.

01:35:53.219 --> 01:35:56.420
<v Speaker 0>I actually block access to the metadata API

01:35:56.420 --> 01:35:58.099
<v Speaker 0>as part of my setup. So you'll have

01:35:58.099 --> 01:36:00.420
<v Speaker 0>to do an IP tables dash f to

01:36:00.420 --> 01:36:01.539
<v Speaker 0>flush that block.

01:36:08.525 --> 01:36:09.804
<v Speaker 0>Capital f.

01:36:10.364 --> 01:36:11.725
<v Speaker 0>But you should be able to run the

01:36:11.725 --> 01:36:13.244
<v Speaker 0>public IP, etcetera.

01:36:16.844 --> 01:36:18.445
<v Speaker 2>Cool. Alright. Well, that's silly. I'm back.

01:36:23.550 --> 01:36:25.070
<v Speaker 0>So if you run a get pods dash

01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:26.990
<v Speaker 0>capital a as our cluster.

01:36:36.645 --> 01:36:37.445
<v Speaker 1>Cool.

01:36:40.085 --> 01:36:41.364
<v Speaker 0>Why don't I make this a bit easier

01:36:41.364 --> 01:36:42.485
<v Speaker 0>for you? Hold on.

01:36:44.965 --> 01:36:47.045
<v Speaker 0>All of the scripts that we use to

01:36:47.045 --> 01:36:49.125
<v Speaker 0>build this up is in here.

01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:53.470
<v Speaker 0>We can actually just cut the user data,

01:36:54.190 --> 01:36:55.630
<v Speaker 0>which will allow us to do some of

01:36:55.630 --> 01:36:57.630
<v Speaker 0>it. So let's take I need to maybe

01:36:57.630 --> 01:36:59.550
<v Speaker 0>jump. It should be alright.

01:36:59.870 --> 01:37:01.310
<v Speaker 0>We don't need this.

01:37:07.364 --> 01:37:09.605
<v Speaker 0>I don't need this. I mean, we probably

01:37:09.605 --> 01:37:11.605
<v Speaker 0>only need the workload at this point, but

01:37:11.605 --> 01:37:12.804
<v Speaker 0>let me just make sure.

01:37:13.685 --> 01:37:15.604
<v Speaker 0>There's our QEDM config.

01:37:16.485 --> 01:37:17.685
<v Speaker 0>Join config.

01:37:18.989 --> 01:37:21.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. We don't do any of that. So

01:37:21.230 --> 01:37:24.030
<v Speaker 0>all good. All gravy. Let's just skip. Keep

01:37:24.030 --> 01:37:25.869
<v Speaker 0>it. Yeah. We're probably gonna need that again

01:37:25.869 --> 01:37:27.949
<v Speaker 0>there. So let's start from

01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:30.989
<v Speaker 0>here.

01:37:33.745 --> 01:37:35.665
<v Speaker 0>I don't have to tell to run that

01:37:35.665 --> 01:37:37.265
<v Speaker 0>actually. Wait. I will need to do it

01:37:37.265 --> 01:37:38.145
<v Speaker 0>this slowly

01:37:38.385 --> 01:37:40.465
<v Speaker 0>where we run the script.

01:37:41.105 --> 01:37:43.185
<v Speaker 0>So which one is kubect?

01:37:45.070 --> 01:37:48.350
<v Speaker 0>Part 11. Okay. So bash part 11.

01:37:50.510 --> 01:37:51.230
<v Speaker 0>12.

01:37:53.630 --> 01:37:54.590
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:37:54.590 --> 01:37:54.990
<v Speaker 0>13.

01:37:56.905 --> 01:37:57.704
<v Speaker 0>14.

01:38:02.105 --> 01:38:03.385
<v Speaker 0>Fifth deploy.

01:38:03.945 --> 01:38:05.545
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I'm just gonna straight to 18 instead

01:38:05.545 --> 01:38:06.105
<v Speaker 0>of 17.

01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:09.800
<v Speaker 0>At this point, it should be alright, though.

01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:10.520
<v Speaker 0>It's just

01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:15.560
<v Speaker 0>so this stuff.

01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:19.960
<v Speaker 0>Nineteen.

01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:21.719
<v Speaker 0>There's our workload.

01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:24.175
<v Speaker 0>Come on. Where's our workload? Should we just

01:38:24.175 --> 01:38:24.815
<v Speaker 0>come in?

01:38:28.095 --> 01:38:30.335
<v Speaker 0>Oh, we don't need teleport. We've got teleport.

01:38:30.415 --> 01:38:31.935
<v Speaker 0>Grab workload.

01:38:34.415 --> 01:38:35.855
<v Speaker 1>Is Kubernetes now?

01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:37.199
<v Speaker 0>Sure.

01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:39.600
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We now have a

01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:48.160
<v Speaker 0>yeah. We have a working cluster. Oh, we've

01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:50.160
<v Speaker 0>now got v cluster in Tanzu being deployed.

01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:51.280
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming that's Julie.

01:38:52.265 --> 01:38:53.625
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. It's not gonna be

01:38:59.705 --> 01:39:02.585
<v Speaker 0>We will have to remove the tape from

01:39:02.585 --> 01:39:04.665
<v Speaker 0>the control plane node so that we don't

01:39:04.665 --> 01:39:06.265
<v Speaker 0>have to fix the worker. So if you

01:39:06.265 --> 01:39:07.225
<v Speaker 0>could do that, Marcus.

01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:09.429
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Yeah.

01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:16.949
<v Speaker 2>Which one's

01:39:19.270 --> 01:39:20.795
<v Speaker 0>let's great. Hold on.

01:39:21.195 --> 01:39:22.475
<v Speaker 0>Well, I mean, you can just remove the

01:39:22.475 --> 01:39:23.915
<v Speaker 0>tint from the node. Oh,

01:39:26.475 --> 01:39:28.715
<v Speaker 2>yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll just edit node.

01:39:28.715 --> 01:39:30.395
<v Speaker 0>Please control pin one.

01:39:30.795 --> 01:39:32.555
<v Speaker 0>Remove those tint lines. Yeah.

01:39:38.330 --> 01:39:40.490
<v Speaker 0>You need to remove 10. Oh,

01:39:40.650 --> 01:39:41.690
<v Speaker 0>did that work?

01:39:42.010 --> 01:39:43.130
<v Speaker 0>There we go. It

01:39:43.690 --> 01:39:44.490
<v Speaker 2>should do.

01:39:44.810 --> 01:39:45.450
<v Speaker 2>Right?

01:39:46.410 --> 01:39:49.515
<v Speaker 0>Run get pods, and let's see. Alright. Cool.

01:39:49.675 --> 01:39:51.755
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Lee, has your break back in place,

01:39:51.755 --> 01:39:52.795
<v Speaker 0>or do need a minute?

01:39:53.595 --> 01:39:54.555
<v Speaker 1>It

01:39:54.555 --> 01:39:55.195
<v Speaker 1>is

01:39:55.435 --> 01:39:57.835
<v Speaker 1>I'm waiting it's a it's a competition now.

01:39:58.155 --> 01:39:59.675
<v Speaker 1>It's waiting for things.

01:40:00.635 --> 01:40:03.355
<v Speaker 1>So just give it a quick moment here.

01:40:16.335 --> 01:40:18.975
<v Speaker 1>It might take, like, an actual minute because

01:40:18.975 --> 01:40:21.054
<v Speaker 1>I am also installing Kubernetes.

01:40:21.055 --> 01:40:21.375
<v Speaker 1>But

01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:41.419
<v Speaker 1>because we're there,

01:40:41.579 --> 01:40:42.379
<v Speaker 1>and then

01:40:43.340 --> 01:40:45.340
<v Speaker 1>it needs to

01:40:45.795 --> 01:40:46.914
<v Speaker 1>do this.

01:40:47.074 --> 01:40:47.875
<v Speaker 1>And then

01:40:54.995 --> 01:40:56.835
<v Speaker 0>Marcus was trying to feed your friend.

01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:03.039
<v Speaker 0>Nice try, Marcus.

01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:06.000
<v Speaker 2>It's worth a try.

01:41:19.345 --> 01:41:20.145
<v Speaker 1>Oh,

01:41:20.305 --> 01:41:22.785
<v Speaker 1>I forgot to do a thing. That's the

01:41:22.785 --> 01:41:24.545
<v Speaker 1>one I can do. Sorry.

01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:28.080
<v Speaker 1>I we're, like, waiting on something that's not

01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:30.400
<v Speaker 1>gonna finish until I run this one command.

01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:35.599
<v Speaker 1>Now

01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:38.160
<v Speaker 1>now we should be on the path.

01:41:39.115 --> 01:41:40.795
<v Speaker 1>I I needed to add

01:41:41.835 --> 01:41:43.755
<v Speaker 1>a a p d c provider

01:41:43.835 --> 01:41:45.195
<v Speaker 1>and set it to default.

01:41:45.675 --> 01:41:47.195
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. We

01:41:47.195 --> 01:41:48.795
<v Speaker 0>have to reassign it.

01:41:49.835 --> 01:41:51.995
<v Speaker 1>It's it's there now. And

01:41:52.155 --> 01:41:53.275
<v Speaker 1>and now

01:41:54.630 --> 01:41:57.430
<v Speaker 1>the the other pieces will fall into place,

01:41:57.430 --> 01:41:59.190
<v Speaker 1>and then we will get to learn a

01:41:59.190 --> 01:42:00.790
<v Speaker 1>a cool thing.

01:42:01.670 --> 01:42:02.390
<v Speaker 1>So

01:42:04.470 --> 01:42:05.910
<v Speaker 2>so where's Postgres gone?

01:42:07.455 --> 01:42:08.574
<v Speaker 1>I

01:42:09.614 --> 01:42:10.574
<v Speaker 1>just

01:42:10.975 --> 01:42:13.135
<v Speaker 1>deleted that in anticipation

01:42:13.135 --> 01:42:14.735
<v Speaker 1>of it coming back.

01:42:16.815 --> 01:42:17.454
<v Speaker 1>But

01:42:17.855 --> 01:42:19.295
<v Speaker 1>You deleted the deployment.

01:42:20.574 --> 01:42:20.895
<v Speaker 1>Sorry?

01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:23.020
<v Speaker 1>I

01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:28.300
<v Speaker 1>You know, they Like, the the the deployment

01:42:28.300 --> 01:42:31.020
<v Speaker 2>for it's gone or the stateful set. Sorry.

01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:33.100
<v Speaker 1>It's we're just waiting for a crash loop

01:42:33.100 --> 01:42:35.260
<v Speaker 1>back off. Yeah. It's the the stateful set.

01:42:37.114 --> 01:42:39.195
<v Speaker 1>We're just waiting for crash loop back off

01:42:39.195 --> 01:42:42.475
<v Speaker 1>right now, and I suppose I could delete

01:42:42.475 --> 01:42:43.514
<v Speaker 1>this pod and

01:42:44.235 --> 01:42:45.675
<v Speaker 1>expedite this process.

01:42:48.955 --> 01:42:51.195
<v Speaker 0>So as the cluster currently broken, Lee?

01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:54.920
<v Speaker 1>Is it broken? I mean, no. Can can

01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:56.600
<v Speaker 0>Marcus start to debug? I mean, yeah, it

01:42:56.600 --> 01:42:56.760
<v Speaker 2>is.

01:43:06.875 --> 01:43:07.755
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.

01:43:07.755 --> 01:43:09.995
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Crash the back off. There we go.

01:43:16.155 --> 01:43:16.795
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:43:17.115 --> 01:43:17.355
<v Speaker 1>I

01:43:18.475 --> 01:43:19.355
<v Speaker 1>five seconds.

01:43:21.590 --> 01:43:22.949
<v Speaker 1>That CD is

01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:24.469
<v Speaker 1>I

01:43:24.949 --> 01:43:27.909
<v Speaker 1>don't know why that, PVC is not

01:43:30.230 --> 01:43:32.389
<v Speaker 1>because the the the NCD is not running.

01:43:34.230 --> 01:43:35.189
<v Speaker 1>I could

01:43:36.195 --> 01:43:37.475
<v Speaker 1>yeah. I mean,

01:43:38.035 --> 01:43:38.595
<v Speaker 1>there's not

01:43:40.995 --> 01:43:42.755
<v Speaker 1>unless I take a different approach to get

01:43:42.755 --> 01:43:44.594
<v Speaker 1>the configs onto the cluster

01:43:44.835 --> 01:43:45.395
<v Speaker 1>and,

01:43:46.275 --> 01:43:46.995
<v Speaker 1>you know,

01:43:47.635 --> 01:43:49.155
<v Speaker 1>like, just reprovisioning

01:43:49.155 --> 01:43:50.195
<v Speaker 1>the the cluster,

01:43:51.170 --> 01:43:51.890
<v Speaker 1>basically,

01:43:52.450 --> 01:43:55.330
<v Speaker 1>uninstalled all of this and save.

01:43:56.290 --> 01:43:57.890
<v Speaker 0>I mean, can be the m preset as

01:43:57.890 --> 01:43:59.970
<v Speaker 0>one way to when clustered. That's for sure.

01:44:00.130 --> 01:44:00.770
<v Speaker 1>Save.

01:44:01.970 --> 01:44:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:44:02.930 --> 01:44:05.490
<v Speaker 1>But it's sorry. I just, like,

01:44:06.545 --> 01:44:08.784
<v Speaker 0>I just wanna I just fast enough.

01:44:10.385 --> 01:44:11.905
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's call it.

01:44:12.784 --> 01:44:15.665
<v Speaker 0>QbDM reset was all was always going to

01:44:15.665 --> 01:44:17.665
<v Speaker 0>cause a bit of chaos in the mix

01:44:17.665 --> 01:44:20.000
<v Speaker 0>there. But why don't Lee tell us what

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:21.840
<v Speaker 0>what was your your break that you put

01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:22.800
<v Speaker 0>together for us?

01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:24.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:25.040
<v Speaker 1>Well, inside

01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:27.600
<v Speaker 1>of a Tanzu Community Edition cluster, we have

01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:30.080
<v Speaker 1>an operator called CapController.

01:44:30.905 --> 01:44:31.865
<v Speaker 1>And

01:44:31.945 --> 01:44:32.985
<v Speaker 1>if you go,

01:44:33.625 --> 01:44:36.745
<v Speaker 1>share screen and just go to StealthyBox slash

01:44:36.745 --> 01:44:37.625
<v Speaker 1>clustered,

01:44:38.025 --> 01:44:38.745
<v Speaker 1>on GitHub.

01:44:52.010 --> 01:44:52.890
<v Speaker 0>Alright. And,

01:44:53.530 --> 01:44:54.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah.

01:44:54.650 --> 01:44:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Here, I just had the the static pods.

01:44:57.210 --> 01:44:58.650
<v Speaker 1>It was just the renamed names.

01:44:59.105 --> 01:45:02.305
<v Speaker 1>The notes was how I got to the

01:45:02.305 --> 01:45:03.345
<v Speaker 1>the cluster,

01:45:03.985 --> 01:45:05.185
<v Speaker 1>which includes

01:45:05.345 --> 01:45:07.825
<v Speaker 1>setting up the, koop configs,

01:45:08.465 --> 01:45:10.305
<v Speaker 1>and applying the RBAC and,

01:45:12.110 --> 01:45:12.670
<v Speaker 1>like,

01:45:14.190 --> 01:45:16.110
<v Speaker 1>downloading some tools like vCluster,

01:45:17.150 --> 01:45:18.989
<v Speaker 1>setting up the vCluster,

01:45:19.630 --> 01:45:21.469
<v Speaker 1>installing cap controller,

01:45:21.550 --> 01:45:24.829
<v Speaker 1>and then, bootstrapping cap controller with the, vCluster

01:45:24.829 --> 01:45:26.685
<v Speaker 1>app. Mhmm. So if you go to the

01:45:26.685 --> 01:45:28.045
<v Speaker 1>vCluster app,

01:45:28.525 --> 01:45:29.324
<v Speaker 1>YAML,

01:45:29.885 --> 01:45:32.925
<v Speaker 1>then, this points to this Git repository,

01:45:33.245 --> 01:45:35.165
<v Speaker 1>to the subpack config,

01:45:36.045 --> 01:45:38.205
<v Speaker 1>and it applies configuration

01:45:38.205 --> 01:45:39.325
<v Speaker 1>relentlessly

01:45:39.970 --> 01:45:41.890
<v Speaker 1>just like our friend, Rick Astley.

01:45:42.370 --> 01:45:43.970
<v Speaker 1>And, then if you go to the config

01:45:43.970 --> 01:45:44.770
<v Speaker 1>directory,

01:45:46.690 --> 01:45:49.010
<v Speaker 1>then this is where our GitOps control repo

01:45:49.010 --> 01:45:49.650
<v Speaker 1>starts.

01:45:50.130 --> 01:45:52.050
<v Speaker 1>So we have that stateful set. We've got

01:45:52.050 --> 01:45:52.690
<v Speaker 1>the deployment,

01:45:53.995 --> 01:45:56.315
<v Speaker 1>and these are pinned at the version one.

01:45:56.955 --> 01:45:57.515
<v Speaker 1>And

01:45:58.955 --> 01:46:01.355
<v Speaker 1>then we've got the Cilium network policy,

01:46:01.835 --> 01:46:03.755
<v Speaker 1>which was bugged and failed in a way

01:46:03.755 --> 01:46:05.115
<v Speaker 1>that was actually worse than what I was

01:46:05.115 --> 01:46:05.915
<v Speaker 1>trying to do.

01:46:06.235 --> 01:46:07.035
<v Speaker 1>And

01:46:07.755 --> 01:46:08.315
<v Speaker 1>then

01:46:09.570 --> 01:46:11.010
<v Speaker 1>yeah, and then there was,

01:46:11.810 --> 01:46:14.210
<v Speaker 1>the the RBAC here as well is is,

01:46:15.090 --> 01:46:16.530
<v Speaker 1>this is where that's managed.

01:46:17.330 --> 01:46:17.889
<v Speaker 1>So

01:46:19.010 --> 01:46:19.650
<v Speaker 1>yep.

01:46:20.770 --> 01:46:21.250
<v Speaker 1>But,

01:46:22.130 --> 01:46:23.395
<v Speaker 1>yeah. So just, you know, a little bit

01:46:23.395 --> 01:46:25.554
<v Speaker 1>of GitOps, little declarative config. It's like, you're

01:46:25.554 --> 01:46:27.554
<v Speaker 1>gonna break something, break it well. Right? So

01:46:28.515 --> 01:46:30.995
<v Speaker 2>Oh, hold on. So in that break glass,

01:46:30.995 --> 01:46:33.715
<v Speaker 2>you're binding it to the user uwu admin?

01:46:34.195 --> 01:46:36.719
<v Speaker 2>Yes. What if me if what if changing

01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:40.240
<v Speaker 2>the values in the admin dot conf have

01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:41.920
<v Speaker 2>prevented that from them working?

01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Those values are purely cosmetic for your own

01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:45.760
<v Speaker 1>use. Yeah.

01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:49.200
<v Speaker 1>They're they're config database values that are unrelated

01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:50.080
<v Speaker 1>to the

01:46:50.695 --> 01:46:53.575
<v Speaker 1>administrator name that actually gets baked into the

01:46:53.735 --> 01:46:54.935
<v Speaker 1>certificate's,

01:46:55.415 --> 01:46:56.295
<v Speaker 1>common name.

01:46:56.855 --> 01:46:59.815
<v Speaker 1>Oh, it just yeah. Yeah. So it's it's

01:46:59.815 --> 01:47:01.735
<v Speaker 1>baked into the x five zero nine, data.

01:47:04.070 --> 01:47:05.750
<v Speaker 1>But you when you were doing your cluster

01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:07.109
<v Speaker 1>role binding creates,

01:47:07.829 --> 01:47:09.429
<v Speaker 1>there were times where you were trying to

01:47:09.429 --> 01:47:11.590
<v Speaker 1>bind it to admin instead, just, I think,

01:47:12.389 --> 01:47:14.630
<v Speaker 1>out of, like, fresh Yeah. I tried I

01:47:14.630 --> 01:47:15.510
<v Speaker 2>tried both.

01:47:16.230 --> 01:47:16.789
<v Speaker 1>Which,

01:47:17.885 --> 01:47:20.445
<v Speaker 1>that's just my bad. I I I missed

01:47:20.445 --> 01:47:22.045
<v Speaker 1>some verbs or something here.

01:47:22.845 --> 01:47:23.805
<v Speaker 1>Might need, like, a

01:47:24.685 --> 01:47:27.325
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, those were both

01:47:28.445 --> 01:47:31.450
<v Speaker 0>very boring clusters, but I learned an absolute

01:47:31.450 --> 01:47:33.450
<v Speaker 0>lot today from both of you. So thank
