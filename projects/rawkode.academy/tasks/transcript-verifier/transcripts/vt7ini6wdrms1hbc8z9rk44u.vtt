00:01:44.545 --> 00:01:47.825
<v Speaker 0>Hello, and welcome back to the Rawkode Academy.

00:01:47.825 --> 00:01:49.024
<v Speaker 0>This is Custard.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.050
<v Speaker 0>Today, we have two amazing teams

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.290
<v Speaker 0>who have very kindly or badly broken some

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.930
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes clusters for the other team to fix.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.890
<v Speaker 0>Before we introduce our first team, we are

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.450
<v Speaker 0>going to say hello and thank you to

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.844
<v Speaker 0>our sponsors.

00:02:06.484 --> 00:02:09.604
<v Speaker 0>So Teleport have been sponsoring Clustered since almost

00:02:09.604 --> 00:02:11.925
<v Speaker 0>the very beginning, and we've been using Teleport

00:02:11.925 --> 00:02:13.685
<v Speaker 0>since the very first episode.

00:02:13.765 --> 00:02:16.084
<v Speaker 0>Teleport is an amazing tool, allows us to

00:02:16.084 --> 00:02:17.525
<v Speaker 0>commoditize access

00:02:17.605 --> 00:02:19.205
<v Speaker 0>to each of these bare metal clusters.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.030
<v Speaker 0>The fan grained RBAC controls and a pairing

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.030
<v Speaker 0>ability, which you will see us using on

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.590
<v Speaker 0>every single episode of Clustered. So thank you

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.550
<v Speaker 0>Teleport.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.430
<v Speaker 0>Also, thank you to Equinix Metal. They've been

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.670
<v Speaker 0>providing the hardware again, since the very first

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.365
<v Speaker 0>episode. These bare metal machines are awesome. They

00:02:36.365 --> 00:02:38.285
<v Speaker 0>have tons of cores, tons of memory,

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:40.205
<v Speaker 0>tons of fun to be had for people

00:02:40.205 --> 00:02:43.165
<v Speaker 0>that wish to break and fix clusters.

00:02:43.485 --> 00:02:45.485
<v Speaker 0>So thank you, Equinix. It's always a pleasure.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.630
<v Speaker 0>All right. Let's introduce our first team. I'm

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.950
<v Speaker 0>gonna pop over to here and we're gonna

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.830
<v Speaker 0>say hello to team ambassador labs.

<v Speaker 1>Right?

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:50.579
<v Speaker 3>It will.

00:03:53.535 --> 00:03:56.974
<v Speaker 0>It's alright. I'm sure nobody ever attacks the

00:03:56.974 --> 00:03:58.334
<v Speaker 0>Linux machine. Right? They just do a nice

00:03:58.334 --> 00:04:00.335
<v Speaker 0>easy breaks on the Kubernetes cluster.

00:04:00.495 --> 00:04:01.935
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying. Alright.

00:04:04.095 --> 00:04:06.255
<v Speaker 0>Well, you are up against a returning team,

00:04:06.255 --> 00:04:08.015
<v Speaker 0>team fair winds. We will see them in

<v Speaker 0>around forty five minutes time.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.600
<v Speaker 0>But let's get started with our cluster for

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.480
<v Speaker 0>today. So we are gonna pop open my

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.520
<v Speaker 0>screen share.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.079
<v Speaker 0>I've already connected to the control plane node.

00:04:21.425 --> 00:04:23.345
<v Speaker 0>So if you could each please join the

00:04:23.345 --> 00:04:25.825
<v Speaker 0>session and just type echo hello or anything

00:04:25.825 --> 00:04:27.585
<v Speaker 0>to let me know that you are there.

00:04:28.065 --> 00:04:29.905

<v Speaker 0>I'll let you just take it from here.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.210
<v Speaker 0>Set up your cube config, check for a

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.490
<v Speaker 0>control plane and best of luck.

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:55.414
<v Speaker 1>Awesome stuff. Shall I drive folks, first off?

00:04:55.414 --> 00:04:57.255

<v Speaker 1>Oh.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh, we have start. For a control plane.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Well, supposedly. I know they've done some tricks

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.130
<v Speaker 1>in the past. I do get notes. I

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.930
<v Speaker 1>guess I get pods.

00:05:21.455 --> 00:05:23.455
<v Speaker 1>It's looking pretty good. Right?

00:05:24.415 --> 00:05:26.175
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. It looks like everything is running as

00:05:26.175 --> 00:05:29.615
<v Speaker 3>well. Yeah. Restart on the controller manager.

00:05:29.695 --> 00:05:32.495
<v Speaker 1>Interesting. Yeah. Conveniently, like, an an a day

00:05:32.495 --> 00:05:34.255
<v Speaker 1>ago, right, when you would have been playing

00:05:34.255 --> 00:05:34.895
<v Speaker 1>around with stuff?

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.500
<v Speaker 3>Let's Okay.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.340
<v Speaker 1>David, can we see if v one is

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.900
<v Speaker 1>running,

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.700
<v Speaker 1>please?

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.900
<v Speaker 0>It's then crash look back off. So if

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.580
<v Speaker 0>you take that for less, I've I've screwed

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.660
<v Speaker 0>up as well for the audience, but the

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.345
<v Speaker 0>cluster pod is is a broken pod. Ah,

00:05:51.345 --> 00:05:53.425
<v Speaker 1>thanks. That was great. Wishful thinking, You know?

00:05:53.425 --> 00:05:56.145
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yes. Worth a try. Right? Shall we

00:05:56.545 --> 00:05:57.025
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:05:57.425 --> 00:05:59.025
<v Speaker 1>Describe on that one?

00:05:59.505 --> 00:06:02.225
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. So that's where the problem is. Sure.

00:06:02.225 --> 00:06:03.265
<v Speaker 2>Get the events.

00:06:03.665 --> 00:06:05.265
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. It seems every other one is running

00:06:05.265 --> 00:06:06.065
<v Speaker 3>aside from that.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.340
<v Speaker 1>So we got waiting, crash loop, back off,

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.060
<v Speaker 1>terminated,

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.260
<v Speaker 1>oom killed.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.380
<v Speaker 2>Java developer. I know that all too well.

00:06:20.395 --> 00:06:22.315
<v Speaker 1>Spinning up Spring. I love Spring, of course,

00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:24.235
<v Speaker 1>but often gets him killed. Look

00:06:25.195 --> 00:06:27.675
<v Speaker 2>at the limits on this pod. He has

00:06:27.675 --> 00:06:28.875
<v Speaker 2>10 megabytes.

00:06:30.074 --> 00:06:31.835
<v Speaker 1>Well spotted, Alex. Well spotted.

00:06:32.074 --> 00:06:32.555
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Back off, reset. Liveness probe failed health

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.480
<v Speaker 1>as well.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.640
<v Speaker 1>What's the recommendation, everyone? What do you think?

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.440
<v Speaker 2>Let's try and bump up the memory limit.

00:06:49.275 --> 00:06:51.355
<v Speaker 1>Yep. What's the command on that one? That's

00:06:51.835 --> 00:06:53.035
<v Speaker 1>feel free to type if want it as

00:06:53.035 --> 00:06:53.515
<v Speaker 1>well.

00:06:54.235 --> 00:06:54.875
<v Speaker 2>I

00:06:55.275 --> 00:06:57.515
<v Speaker 2>don't recall by hand. I'd probably do a

00:06:57.515 --> 00:06:58.955
<v Speaker 2>kubectl edit. Yeah.

00:06:59.355 --> 00:07:01.195
<v Speaker 1>Sounds good. Right? Should do that.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.840
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Edit deployment. I think that's your best

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.560
<v Speaker 0>bet here.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.480
<v Speaker 1>So what you're in prod. Right?

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.720
<v Speaker 1>The deployment then.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.800
<v Speaker 1>What's it called? Cluster. Right? It's just called

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.320
<v Speaker 0>cluster dash. Right? Yeah.

00:07:17.055 --> 00:07:18.975
<v Speaker 0>And I will show this through here.

00:07:19.615 --> 00:07:21.935
<v Speaker 0>It's a weird bug. There we go.

00:07:22.895 --> 00:07:25.455
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yes. Can you demonstrate to my screen?

00:07:25.455 --> 00:07:26.255
<v Speaker 1>Oh, gotcha.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.300
<v Speaker 1>Got the

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.860
<v Speaker 1>checks there. There's the limits. Right? So I

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:39.580
<v Speaker 1>added them?

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. What what are we going for, do

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:42.060
<v Speaker 1>you reckon?

00:07:44.014 --> 00:07:46.254
<v Speaker 2>I think we should remove

00:07:46.254 --> 00:07:47.055
<v Speaker 2>everything.

00:07:47.134 --> 00:07:49.055
<v Speaker 0>Exactly. Sledgehammer approach.

00:07:50.735 --> 00:07:51.294
<v Speaker 0>We

00:07:52.895 --> 00:07:54.495
<v Speaker 0>don't need limits. Come on.

00:07:54.895 --> 00:07:55.215
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.510
<v Speaker 2>And yeah. Happy with that?

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:00.510
<v Speaker 3>Yep.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:01.710
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:03.230
<v Speaker 1>There you go.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:04.510
<v Speaker 2>Resources

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:05.550
<v Speaker 2>column.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Supposedly running there. Right?

00:08:11.505 --> 00:08:13.585
<v Speaker 3>It is. It does appear

00:08:14.065 --> 00:08:15.105
<v Speaker 0>to be running.

00:08:16.065 --> 00:08:18.785
<v Speaker 1>Do I love that Rust application instantly fast

00:08:18.785 --> 00:08:20.625
<v Speaker 1>fire instantly fires out. Right?

00:08:21.665 --> 00:08:23.850
<v Speaker 0>Would you like me to test it? Yes,

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:26.090
<v Speaker 1>please. There it is, please. Alright. That would

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.250
<v Speaker 1>be we're we're clearly expecting it tonight. It's

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:30.410
<v Speaker 1>gonna go in flames. Right? The Fairwinds people

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:31.850
<v Speaker 1>are far too devious.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:34.409
<v Speaker 0>So

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:36.490
<v Speaker 0>normally

00:08:36.865 --> 00:08:39.345
<v Speaker 0>oh, there's my LinkedIn. Normally,

00:08:42.225 --> 00:08:44.865
<v Speaker 0>there is a node port service in 30,000.

00:08:44.865 --> 00:08:46.545
<v Speaker 0>But can you just double check that for

00:08:46.545 --> 00:08:48.225
<v Speaker 0>me and run out a get service?

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Run out what side, dude?

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.840
<v Speaker 0>I'm sorry. Get services. I just wanted to

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.960
<v Speaker 0>make sure that Yeah.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.600
<v Speaker 0>So I would have expected that to work.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.760
<v Speaker 0>I will check one more thing just in

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.440
<v Speaker 0>case it's my setup

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.840
<v Speaker 0>because I am also prone to a lot

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.240
<v Speaker 0>of errors.

00:09:07.095 --> 00:09:09.095
<v Speaker 0>I'll get the public IP address. Oh, it's

00:09:09.095 --> 00:09:09.735
<v Speaker 0>not there.

00:09:14.055 --> 00:09:14.615
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.920
<v Speaker 0>Too many clusters.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.240
<v Speaker 0>So just in case.

00:09:30.575 --> 00:09:32.815
<v Speaker 0>They left you a message. Gotcha. It says

00:09:32.815 --> 00:09:34.335
<v Speaker 0>gotcha. I

00:09:34.975 --> 00:09:36.495
<v Speaker 1>was just gonna do a carol, right, on

00:09:36.495 --> 00:09:36.975
<v Speaker 1>the

00:09:37.375 --> 00:09:38.895
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. We could've just done a carol

00:09:38.895 --> 00:09:40.655
<v Speaker 0>look was, but I'm jumping around looking at

00:09:40.655 --> 00:09:42.735
<v Speaker 0>it here. So No worries. And that's why

00:09:42.735 --> 00:09:44.575
<v Speaker 1>I was just like, just talking. I lost

00:09:44.575 --> 00:09:44.975
<v Speaker 1>connection.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.959
<v Speaker 1>No. It's back. Here we go. Yep.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:09:49.639 --> 00:09:51.640
<v Speaker 1>I was gonna do a call local host.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:53.959
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.880
<v Speaker 3>Freaking Fairwinds

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.079
<v Speaker 1>Insight can help you with your

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.154
<v Speaker 1>done team. Bet you save your resources. Actually,

00:10:01.154 --> 00:10:02.755
<v Speaker 1>on that note, have we got we have

00:10:02.755 --> 00:10:03.795
<v Speaker 1>got some hints if we need them. Right?

00:10:03.795 --> 00:10:05.235
<v Speaker 1>Thank you, Fairwinds folks. I believe it's hints

00:10:05.235 --> 00:10:06.435
<v Speaker 1>there if we we need them.

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:10.035
<v Speaker 1>Cool. Well, what are you thinking now?

00:10:11.555 --> 00:10:13.394
<v Speaker 1>Should we check for network policies? Anything like

00:10:13.394 --> 00:10:13.555
<v Speaker 1>that?

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:18.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Because, obviously, something is

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:20.610
<v Speaker 2>answering our request,

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.970
<v Speaker 2>but not the application that we're expecting. So

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.450
<v Speaker 2>maybe you look at the the ingress configuration

00:10:29.175 --> 00:10:31.175
<v Speaker 4>or the So we couldn't find node port,

00:10:31.175 --> 00:10:33.175
<v Speaker 1>Alex, aren't we? So no ingress.

00:10:34.535 --> 00:10:36.215
<v Speaker 0>Although there is m s s s ingress

00:10:36.215 --> 00:10:38.455
<v Speaker 0>deployed to the cluster. Just throwing that out

00:10:38.455 --> 00:10:39.015
<v Speaker 0>there.

00:10:40.535 --> 00:10:42.855
<v Speaker 0>Emissary ingress is a nice ingress. Who works

00:10:42.855 --> 00:10:43.175
<v Speaker 0>on that?

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:45.850
<v Speaker 1>We love emissary ingress. Right?

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And I I one of the first

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:49.210
<v Speaker 1>things I did when I saw emissary ingress

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:50.410
<v Speaker 1>there is I was like, what what listeners

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:51.450
<v Speaker 1>are set up? What mapping is set up

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:52.730
<v Speaker 1>in my cluster and of course didn't find

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:54.170
<v Speaker 1>any. And then I figured out you're using

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.455
<v Speaker 1>no port to expose these things. Yeah. I've

00:10:56.455 --> 00:10:59.335
<v Speaker 0>been improving the setup over the last month,

00:10:59.335 --> 00:11:01.255
<v Speaker 0>and I just brought in ingress. So, yeah,

00:11:01.255 --> 00:11:03.095
<v Speaker 0>I will be exposing over

00:11:03.095 --> 00:11:05.415
<v Speaker 0>some shiny domain Know where we are, David.

00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:06.775
<v Speaker 1>I can help with those listeners host some

00:11:06.775 --> 00:11:08.855
<v Speaker 1>mappings. Emitter ingress is one of the if

00:11:08.855 --> 00:11:10.375
<v Speaker 1>not the best ingress out there. Right?

00:11:12.629 --> 00:11:14.629
<v Speaker 1>Cool. So we've got yeah. So it doesn't

00:11:14.629 --> 00:11:16.069
<v Speaker 1>look like emissary is being used in terms

00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:17.269
<v Speaker 1>of mappings

00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:19.509
<v Speaker 1>or even probably it's worth just checking listeners

00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:21.430
<v Speaker 1>because that would be very cruel to leave

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:23.509
<v Speaker 1>it. Yeah. Nothing I suppose I should do.

00:11:25.065 --> 00:11:26.825
<v Speaker 1>So looks like it's not a

00:11:27.705 --> 00:11:29.385
<v Speaker 1>panemissary ingress thing.

00:11:31.065 --> 00:11:31.705
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:11:31.865 --> 00:11:33.945
<v Speaker 0>But, I mean, you're having an application that

00:11:33.945 --> 00:11:35.465
<v Speaker 0>looks like my application.

00:11:35.625 --> 00:11:38.105
<v Speaker 0>I mean, what should we be checking next?

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:40.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. The image, I think, is a good

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:44.250
<v Speaker 1>good idea. Right? Yeah. Definitely. Checking the image.

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:45.450
<v Speaker 1>So

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:49.770
<v Speaker 1>if we just do we've already done the

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:50.970
<v Speaker 1>describe, actually, on the

00:11:53.525 --> 00:11:54.965
<v Speaker 1>on the deploy. Right?

00:11:56.485 --> 00:11:58.405
<v Speaker 1>What's the line? On the pod, not on

00:11:58.405 --> 00:11:59.285
<v Speaker 2>the deployment.

00:12:00.165 --> 00:12:01.125
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. If I just keep

00:12:02.325 --> 00:12:03.685
<v Speaker 1>what do think I should do on the

00:12:03.685 --> 00:12:04.805
<v Speaker 1>pod

00:12:04.805 --> 00:12:05.525
<v Speaker 1>or

00:12:06.085 --> 00:12:06.805
<v Speaker 1>on the deployment?

00:12:08.639 --> 00:12:11.120
<v Speaker 2>Well, we did it on the pod initially.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.680
<v Speaker 1>We can take a look at the deployment

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.320
<v Speaker 1>as well.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Because it says, right, image g hcr.i

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.800
<v Speaker 1>o Rawkode clustered v one.

00:12:22.735 --> 00:12:24.895
<v Speaker 1>So the image looks legit. Right? That's what

00:12:24.895 --> 00:12:26.415
<v Speaker 1>we expected when we were messing up with

00:12:26.415 --> 00:12:27.855
<v Speaker 1>our cluster. Mhmm.

00:12:28.335 --> 00:12:29.055
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

00:12:30.095 --> 00:12:32.415
<v Speaker 3>Screw to it. I like it when things

00:12:32.415 --> 00:12:33.135
<v Speaker 0>look legit.

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:36.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You know there's something we could try

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:37.870
<v Speaker 1>bumping it to v two. Right? Because that

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:39.070
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate goal here is to try and

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:40.030
<v Speaker 1>get to v two. If you see what

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.390
<v Speaker 1>happens there, I reckon the Fairwinds team might

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:43.230
<v Speaker 1>have left us a nice little surprise there

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.990
<v Speaker 1>as well. Well, that is the that is

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:47.310
<v Speaker 0>the voice of a experienced cluster or as

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.685
<v Speaker 0>well, and you've not been on before. Yeah.

00:12:49.685 --> 00:12:52.085
<v Speaker 1>Let's give it a try. Right? Yeah. That's

00:12:52.085 --> 00:12:52.885
<v Speaker 0>a good idea.

00:12:53.285 --> 00:12:54.725
<v Speaker 1>Edit. Deploy.

00:12:55.045 --> 00:12:55.605
<v Speaker 1>Plastic.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:09.620
<v Speaker 0>Well,

00:13:16.154 --> 00:13:18.235
<v Speaker 1>It is running. It's restarted. If I just

00:13:18.235 --> 00:13:18.875
<v Speaker 1>do

00:13:20.395 --> 00:13:22.955
<v Speaker 1>a local host again, see what we've got

00:13:22.955 --> 00:13:23.595
<v Speaker 1>there.

00:13:24.395 --> 00:13:26.235
<v Speaker 1>Uh-huh. It's gonna be alright. Boiled. Yeah.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:29.690
<v Speaker 1>So do we

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:31.770
<v Speaker 1>do we think potentially

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:35.130
<v Speaker 1>someone's

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:36.649
<v Speaker 1>messed around with the registries?

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:39.290
<v Speaker 1>Actually pulling them like a Are you can

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:42.250
<v Speaker 2>you describe the I would doubt it. Walking

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:44.010
<v Speaker 2>into I heard it's

00:13:44.295 --> 00:13:45.895
<v Speaker 2>always full policy

00:13:45.895 --> 00:13:47.895
<v Speaker 2>on the deployment. So

00:13:48.375 --> 00:13:50.935
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that we are getting the

00:13:50.935 --> 00:13:53.415
<v Speaker 2>image from the registry, and it's not preloaded

00:13:53.415 --> 00:13:54.535
<v Speaker 2>on the machine.

00:13:55.815 --> 00:13:57.495
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. Image full policy always. Yeah. I'm

00:13:57.495 --> 00:13:58.055
<v Speaker 1>with you, Alex.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.830
<v Speaker 0>If you describe the part as the image

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:02.630
<v Speaker 0>the same?

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:04.150
<v Speaker 1>You

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:08.950
<v Speaker 1>get.

00:14:14.524 --> 00:14:15.964
<v Speaker 1>Kubectl.

00:14:18.365 --> 00:14:19.084
<v Speaker 3>My pod.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Pulling image?

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.120
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. But it it does appear to be

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.480
<v Speaker 0>pushed down correctly.

00:14:31.959 --> 00:14:33.800
<v Speaker 3>So Yeah. It looks like it's bit That's

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.279
<v Speaker 0>fun.

00:14:36.839 --> 00:14:38.360
<v Speaker 1>What if we do

00:14:39.319 --> 00:14:40.885
<v Speaker 1>big on g

00:14:41.285 --> 00:14:42.885
<v Speaker 1>h c r?

00:14:43.045 --> 00:14:44.485
<v Speaker 1>See if that's

00:14:45.205 --> 00:14:46.725
<v Speaker 0>Do you know the IP address of that

00:14:46.725 --> 00:14:47.845
<v Speaker 0>off the top of your head?

00:14:48.245 --> 00:14:49.445
<v Speaker 1>I do not, but I was thinking if

00:14:49.445 --> 00:14:50.725
<v Speaker 1>it was, like, loop back or something, it'd

00:14:50.725 --> 00:14:51.925
<v Speaker 1>be crazy, like

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.690
<v Speaker 1>That looks pretty legit, actually. But I'm just

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:56.370
<v Speaker 1>thinking, where's that going to?

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:03.570
<v Speaker 1>Because that that would be the

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:07.235
<v Speaker 1>just thinking, like, to your point logically here,

00:15:07.235 --> 00:15:10.035
<v Speaker 1>Alex, like, is something intercepting

00:15:10.275 --> 00:15:11.635
<v Speaker 1>that port

00:15:12.515 --> 00:15:13.955
<v Speaker 1>before it's even getting here? Or

00:15:15.875 --> 00:15:16.755
<v Speaker 1>is it the image? What do you think

00:15:16.755 --> 00:15:17.715
<v Speaker 1>of the junk? Like, I wonder if I'm

00:15:17.715 --> 00:15:18.995
<v Speaker 1>we might be getting led astray. Right?

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean, I I know we're actually talking

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.200
<v Speaker 3>about, like, network policy. Right? And then you

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.520
<v Speaker 3>mentioned there was an existing note, so there's

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.440
<v Speaker 3>no way to track that. Because ideally,

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.000
<v Speaker 3>that could be the problem. Maybe they set

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:31.560
<v Speaker 3>some

00:15:34.715 --> 00:15:37.835
<v Speaker 3>commands that prevents us from accessing it directly.

00:15:39.035 --> 00:15:39.995
<v Speaker 0>So Like,

00:15:40.555 --> 00:15:42.315
<v Speaker 0>for the people watching then, right,

00:15:42.955 --> 00:15:44.955
<v Speaker 0>if you had a NodePort service,

00:15:45.459 --> 00:15:47.700
<v Speaker 0>can you follow that thread? Like,

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:50.740
<v Speaker 0>what endpoints does it have? Does the pod

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.060
<v Speaker 0>IPs match up? Like, you you could kind

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.500
<v Speaker 0>of work that out. Right?

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:56.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Interesting.

00:15:59.045 --> 00:16:01.605
<v Speaker 1>What's the perk folks' thoughts on that? So

00:16:04.165 --> 00:16:06.885
<v Speaker 2>the Let's look at the the

00:16:07.764 --> 00:16:10.005
<v Speaker 2>service node port

00:16:10.005 --> 00:16:12.565
<v Speaker 2>and probably the endpoints

00:16:12.644 --> 00:16:16.190
<v Speaker 2>being served by this for this service.

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:18.750
<v Speaker 1>Do you wanna drive, Alex? My

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:22.110
<v Speaker 2>Internet is a bit flaky, so I think

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:24.029
<v Speaker 2>I'll I'll

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:25.709
<v Speaker 2>You're shout shout what to type in that

00:16:25.709 --> 00:16:26.110
<v Speaker 1>case then.

00:16:27.145 --> 00:16:28.185
<v Speaker 2>Let's

00:16:28.185 --> 00:16:30.345
<v Speaker 2>start by listing all services.

00:16:31.385 --> 00:16:32.665
<v Speaker 3>Yep. I

00:16:33.225 --> 00:16:33.865
<v Speaker 1>like your thinking.

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:41.650
<v Speaker 2>So we have

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:47.010
<v Speaker 2>a note for on the clustered service.

00:16:47.089 --> 00:16:47.730
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:51.010
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm. Let's look at the kubectl

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.210
<v Speaker 2>get endpoints

00:16:52.529 --> 00:16:53.890
<v Speaker 2>for this clustered service.

00:16:56.385 --> 00:16:57.585
<v Speaker 1>You've got a cuddle

00:16:57.985 --> 00:16:59.185
<v Speaker 1>get endpoints?

00:16:59.265 --> 00:17:00.465
<v Speaker 0>Yep. K.

00:17:02.865 --> 00:17:04.305
<v Speaker 0>We can just run that as is if

00:17:04.305 --> 00:17:04.705
<v Speaker 0>you wish.

00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:10.410
<v Speaker 0>And now you've got 8080? Yeah. Well, you've

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:12.170
<v Speaker 0>got a port you've got an IP address.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:15.610
<v Speaker 0>You may wanna Then we can, yeah, get

00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:16.490
<v Speaker 2>pods

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:17.450
<v Speaker 2>dash

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:19.770
<v Speaker 2>o wide to get the

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:20.970
<v Speaker 2>pod IPs.

00:17:27.155 --> 00:17:27.714
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:17:31.795 --> 00:17:34.275
<v Speaker 1>You have a match. It does match. So

00:17:34.275 --> 00:17:35.875
<v Speaker 0>that rules out the hypothesis.

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:39.590
<v Speaker 1>Nice thought, did it. Nice thought.

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:44.549
<v Speaker 0>It's a cool effect, this.

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:46.870
<v Speaker 0>Image compose it always.

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:49.430
<v Speaker 0>Image name appears to be correct down the

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:50.149
<v Speaker 0>stack,

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.575
<v Speaker 0>but the image Is it car port? It's

00:17:52.575 --> 00:17:54.575
<v Speaker 1>all that, I wonder. Sidecar container, sorry.

00:17:56.255 --> 00:17:58.414
<v Speaker 1>Didn't see anything, did we? No. It it

00:18:00.654 --> 00:18:02.414
<v Speaker 0>I I don't believe so.

00:18:03.375 --> 00:18:04.975
<v Speaker 0>It says one of one ready, so one

00:18:04.975 --> 00:18:05.375
<v Speaker 0>container.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:09.470
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't I couldn't do anything clever with the

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:11.549
<v Speaker 1>in it containers or I know the Fairwinds

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:14.350
<v Speaker 1>folks have used all the Kubernetes real estate

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:15.149
<v Speaker 1>in the past.

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:17.230
<v Speaker 0>So let's assume

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:19.309
<v Speaker 0>that the request is set in the correct

00:18:19.309 --> 00:18:22.385
<v Speaker 0>pod, but somehow the Fairwinds team have put

00:18:22.385 --> 00:18:25.265
<v Speaker 0>something in place that well, Kubernetes believes this

00:18:25.265 --> 00:18:27.985
<v Speaker 0>is the correct image, that they're actually doing

00:18:27.985 --> 00:18:29.424
<v Speaker 0>sneaky sneaky stuff.

00:18:29.665 --> 00:18:31.825
<v Speaker 0>So what's responsible

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.090
<v Speaker 0>for pulling the image to the machine?

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.010
<v Speaker 2>The Docker daemon

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:40.970
<v Speaker 2>or

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:44.010
<v Speaker 0>Yep. Docker container d c r I and

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.970
<v Speaker 0>the kubelet has some involvement. So maybe start

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:49.044
<v Speaker 0>I may have to start poking at those,

00:18:49.044 --> 00:18:49.764
<v Speaker 0>I think.

00:18:51.445 --> 00:18:53.445
<v Speaker 1>How was your Didi Dong, Alex, what's your

00:18:53.445 --> 00:18:54.724
<v Speaker 1>experience like with the

00:18:55.284 --> 00:18:56.804
<v Speaker 1>with the cryo stuff?

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:05.049
<v Speaker 0>The the Fairbench team are also reminding us

00:19:05.049 --> 00:19:06.889
<v Speaker 0>we have hints. It's alright to use the

00:19:06.889 --> 00:19:09.370
<v Speaker 0>hints. Thank Kevin's team. Appreciate it. Sweet sweet

00:19:09.529 --> 00:19:11.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Cat them with that. Good idea. So

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:14.330
<v Speaker 0>we got some chat from the comments

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:15.769
<v Speaker 0>saying mutating webhook.

00:19:16.315 --> 00:19:19.434
<v Speaker 0>Now, it doesn't feel like mutating webhooks because

00:19:20.155 --> 00:19:22.235
<v Speaker 0>what we're seeing in the state

00:19:22.315 --> 00:19:24.075
<v Speaker 0>and the edit pod

00:19:24.875 --> 00:19:27.035
<v Speaker 0>would be different. Right? If they had mutated

00:19:27.035 --> 00:19:27.674
<v Speaker 0>the

00:19:28.315 --> 00:19:31.995
<v Speaker 0>the payload. Yeah. Yeah. So it's a good

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.480
<v Speaker 1>you know, they're they're sort of Oh, people

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.799
<v Speaker 0>do love mutating webhooks on clusters. I do

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:35.519
<v Speaker 0>gotta say.

00:19:36.159 --> 00:19:37.359
<v Speaker 1>And

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.840
<v Speaker 1>I got one, I think.

00:19:41.919 --> 00:19:43.120
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't have to take a look at

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.880
<v Speaker 0>Xeno, but I think you probably fixed the

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:45.360
<v Speaker 0>error rate.

00:19:46.885 --> 00:19:48.164
<v Speaker 0>Oh, look at that.

00:19:48.485 --> 00:19:50.725
<v Speaker 0>Some ASCII art. What's

00:19:50.725 --> 00:19:52.965
<v Speaker 1>that say? Fairwinds versus

00:19:54.245 --> 00:19:55.365
<v Speaker 1>ambassador's ass.

00:19:55.684 --> 00:19:56.804
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you get my Yeah.

00:19:56.804 --> 00:19:57.284
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately.

00:19:58.325 --> 00:20:01.285
<v Speaker 3>Okay. Quite mean. Ambassador, I think. Right? I'm

00:20:01.285 --> 00:20:01.605
<v Speaker 0>gonna

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:04.910
<v Speaker 0>Let's out. There we go. Oh, nice. Nice.

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:05.470
<v Speaker 1>That

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:08.590
<v Speaker 1>is nice. That is nice. I like that.

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:09.710
<v Speaker 3>Very cool, actually.

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:12.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Kudos for that one. I mean, not

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:14.270
<v Speaker 0>a hint. Just I mean, if we're sticking

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:15.870
<v Speaker 0>to the rules, I'm just saying.

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:18.375
<v Speaker 1>To be fair, think your rules do say

00:20:18.375 --> 00:20:20.135
<v Speaker 1>zero one is the first hint, David. Little

00:20:20.135 --> 00:20:22.055
<v Speaker 1>bit like Built

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:24.695
<v Speaker 1>in system namespaces can hide all sorts of

00:20:24.695 --> 00:20:25.335
<v Speaker 1>junk.

00:20:27.255 --> 00:20:29.735
<v Speaker 1>Built in. So, like, static static pods.

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:33.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. Like, those namespaces that come directly with

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:34.470
<v Speaker 3>Kubernetes.

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:37.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I wonder if we do l s

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:39.750
<v Speaker 1>e t c Kubernetes

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:41.510
<v Speaker 1>manifests.

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:43.510
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna see

00:20:44.225 --> 00:20:46.705
<v Speaker 1>who we expect. Right? API server controller, keep

00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:47.985
<v Speaker 1>the case of that VIP. But I wonder

00:20:47.985 --> 00:20:49.265
<v Speaker 1>if each of them have got

00:20:49.585 --> 00:20:51.025
<v Speaker 1>do you think I'm gonna rabbit hole here?

00:20:51.025 --> 00:20:52.065
<v Speaker 1>I'm wondering if each of them have got

00:20:52.065 --> 00:20:54.305
<v Speaker 1>what we expect. We could cap them. I'm

00:20:54.305 --> 00:20:56.304
<v Speaker 1>also could dim them and have a look.

00:20:57.025 --> 00:20:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Or is there an easier way to go

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.560
<v Speaker 1>in system namespace? It's gonna have all sorts

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.640
<v Speaker 0>of I mean, you could trust the timestamp.

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.400
<v Speaker 5>Running in the cube system names.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.440
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.120
<v Speaker 1>Sorry. Sorry. Folks, what was that? Yep.

00:21:11.125 --> 00:21:13.284
<v Speaker 3>I think you mentioned something around system.

00:21:13.765 --> 00:21:14.325
<v Speaker 3>Right?

00:21:14.645 --> 00:21:17.284
<v Speaker 3>So, like, you still get namespaces and then

00:21:17.525 --> 00:21:19.605
<v Speaker 3>find try to, like, get things in that

00:21:19.605 --> 00:21:21.845
<v Speaker 3>namespaces, see what exists inside of it. Because

00:21:21.845 --> 00:21:23.924
<v Speaker 3>it it seems like they hit something inside

00:21:23.924 --> 00:21:26.005
<v Speaker 3>the that particular namespace, if I'm not mistaken.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.680
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right, Eddie. Yeah. Just look

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.480
<v Speaker 1>to David's point. That's a suspicious March 2,

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah, yesterday on coop controller manager. Right?

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:38.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Exactly. That's a good hint, I think,

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:38.520
<v Speaker 1>there.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.120
<v Speaker 1>We just go with him. Right?

00:21:42.825 --> 00:21:44.505
<v Speaker 0>Interesting.

00:21:51.225 --> 00:21:51.785
<v Speaker 1>So

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.679
<v Speaker 1>that one's definitely for folks watching, should contain

00:21:54.679 --> 00:21:55.639
<v Speaker 1>some YAML.

00:21:56.519 --> 00:21:58.519
<v Speaker 0>That says did you put the path in

00:21:58.519 --> 00:22:00.840
<v Speaker 0>or just the fail in him? Oh, that's

00:22:00.919 --> 00:22:02.359
<v Speaker 1>cheers, dude. Yeah. I've

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.559
<v Speaker 1>you're right. I just my my badge will

00:22:05.559 --> 00:22:07.960
<v Speaker 1>be oh, yeah. Just do

00:22:08.255 --> 00:22:09.695
<v Speaker 1>ahead of myself. Right?

00:22:13.535 --> 00:22:15.135
<v Speaker 1>Fox boys. Great work.

00:22:16.255 --> 00:22:17.615
<v Speaker 1>That's more like it. Right?

00:22:18.095 --> 00:22:19.695
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That that's what you expect.

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Shall we actually, I'm trying think what's the

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:28.020
<v Speaker 1>what's best to do here? It go go

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.020
<v Speaker 1>to the top? I mean, when I open

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.540
<v Speaker 0>a fail and my customer doesn't start in

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:32.980
<v Speaker 0>lane one, I would maybe look at what

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:33.620
<v Speaker 0>it was around.

00:22:35.535 --> 00:22:37.615
<v Speaker 1>You what? So David? When I opened a

00:22:37.615 --> 00:22:39.535
<v Speaker 0>file of them and my cursor is 200

00:22:39.535 --> 00:22:41.855
<v Speaker 0>lines down, I would probably check there first

00:22:41.855 --> 00:22:43.055
<v Speaker 0>rather than go to the top of the

00:22:43.055 --> 00:22:43.855
<v Speaker 0>file. Hundred?

00:22:44.255 --> 00:22:44.895
<v Speaker 1>That's

00:22:45.535 --> 00:22:46.815
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question. You're right at the

00:22:46.815 --> 00:22:48.495
<v Speaker 1>end of the I was it's the driving

00:22:48.495 --> 00:22:50.815
<v Speaker 1>mentality. I'm so in in the terminal.

00:22:52.409 --> 00:22:53.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Was it right at the end? That

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:56.650
<v Speaker 1>is Oh, it was. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I

00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:58.169
<v Speaker 1>think they might have thought that.

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:00.970
<v Speaker 4>Can

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:03.289
<v Speaker 1>I use control f and b on this

00:23:03.289 --> 00:23:03.450
<v Speaker 1>one?

00:23:07.565 --> 00:23:08.764
<v Speaker 1>B. There we go.

00:23:13.405 --> 00:23:14.845
<v Speaker 1>Chat if anything looks

00:23:15.245 --> 00:23:16.445
<v Speaker 1>suspicious, folks.

00:23:17.405 --> 00:23:17.885
<v Speaker 6>Yep.

00:23:37.155 --> 00:23:38.274
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

00:23:39.875 --> 00:23:41.555
<v Speaker 3>That part, is that is that supposed to

00:23:41.555 --> 00:23:42.835
<v Speaker 3>be healthy?

00:23:42.915 --> 00:23:43.395
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. A lot of them are healthy. There's

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:47.600
<v Speaker 1>a good point, though. Some of them are

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.040
<v Speaker 1>health some of them are healthy. Right? So,

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.880
<v Speaker 1>yeah, you you're right. Oh, okay. There's little

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.000
<v Speaker 1>bit of suspicion, but I think I know

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.760
<v Speaker 1>the XCD ones are health, for example, versus

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.600
<v Speaker 1>healthy. Yeah. If you I think you'll find

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.680
<v Speaker 0>if it comes from a Google developer, they've

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.600
<v Speaker 0>got a concept of z pages, then you'll

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.424
<v Speaker 0>see health z. Oh, okay. Okay. Actually, David,

00:24:02.424 --> 00:24:03.945
<v Speaker 1>I wondered where that rule came from. Yeah.

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.900
<v Speaker 0>It looks alright. Yeah? It does. It does.

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:24.100
<v Speaker 0>Any

00:24:25.059 --> 00:24:26.740
<v Speaker 1>thoughts, team? Any thoughts? Because it does it

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:27.620
<v Speaker 1>looks pretty legit. Right?

00:24:29.645 --> 00:24:31.325
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. It's good.

00:24:31.485 --> 00:24:33.245
<v Speaker 1>Is it It does look good, Harry.

00:24:34.045 --> 00:24:35.245
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Sorry, Alex.

00:24:37.245 --> 00:24:39.885
<v Speaker 1>Well, suppose it is. It's probably an ad,

00:24:39.885 --> 00:24:41.565
<v Speaker 1>man. Now it does look good to me.

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:42.870
<v Speaker 4>There

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:44.630
<v Speaker 0>there was one thing that covers you, but

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:46.310
<v Speaker 0>I I don't wanna send you down any

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:47.590
<v Speaker 0>rabbit holes. So

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh.

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:52.150
<v Speaker 1>But time to speak like, something Didion mentioned,

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:54.230
<v Speaker 1>you're about looking at namespaces, Didion. Right? We

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:56.310
<v Speaker 1>try that. Yeah. Let's run the system.

00:24:56.914 --> 00:24:57.715
<v Speaker 1>Namespaces.

00:24:57.715 --> 00:24:59.634
<v Speaker 1>So, like, what we're thinking? Kube CTL?

00:25:00.355 --> 00:25:01.794
<v Speaker 3>Gets namespaces.

00:25:03.635 --> 00:25:05.315
<v Speaker 3>So just yeah. So

00:25:05.875 --> 00:25:07.635
<v Speaker 3>maybe, like, Kube CTL gets all and then

00:25:07.635 --> 00:25:09.635
<v Speaker 3>specify the Kube system namespace

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:10.780
<v Speaker 3>to see

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.700
<v Speaker 3>what's inside of it.

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:14.460
<v Speaker 1>How do you do that again, do you

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.540
<v Speaker 1>know? Keep you still get all dash n

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:20.220
<v Speaker 3>for that? Yeah. Yes. Yes. And then keep

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:20.940
<v Speaker 3>system.

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.540
<v Speaker 3>Think. Oh, not that much.

00:25:26.295 --> 00:25:28.615
<v Speaker 1>We got a bunch of Cilium, CoreDNS.

00:25:30.295 --> 00:25:31.254
<v Speaker 2>There

00:25:32.135 --> 00:25:33.735
<v Speaker 2>is something wrong with

00:25:34.054 --> 00:25:35.174
<v Speaker 2>KubeDNS.

00:25:35.815 --> 00:25:39.174
<v Speaker 2>Seems like there's been multiple replica set of

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:40.700
<v Speaker 2>could they have been trying

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:43.420
<v Speaker 2>to deploy a new version with a new

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:45.660
<v Speaker 2>configuration of core DNS that would have forced

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:47.020
<v Speaker 2>Rawkode replicas?

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:49.660
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That would concern me too, definitely.

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.380
<v Speaker 1>Interesting, Alex. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah.

00:25:55.155 --> 00:25:57.315
<v Speaker 1>DNS, right, could be pointing

00:25:58.915 --> 00:26:00.275
<v Speaker 1>in the wrong direction.

00:26:00.995 --> 00:26:03.155
<v Speaker 1>How best to it's funny how we're trying

00:26:03.155 --> 00:26:04.275
<v Speaker 1>it off camera. Was like, one thing I

00:26:04.275 --> 00:26:05.795
<v Speaker 1>don't wanna do is call DNS. I'm really

00:26:05.795 --> 00:26:07.795
<v Speaker 1>not very good at call DNS. Right? I

00:26:07.795 --> 00:26:09.635
<v Speaker 1>thought the cluster the Fairwinds team must have

00:26:09.635 --> 00:26:11.740
<v Speaker 1>been like, yep. We're just loving that.

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:14.700
<v Speaker 0>So there's a few different train of thoughts

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.780
<v Speaker 0>right now. Okay? You got the DNS, you

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.380
<v Speaker 0>got the hint which alluded to stuff in

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.220
<v Speaker 0>hiding inside of a cube system or system

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:21.580
<v Speaker 0>based namespace.

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.820
<v Speaker 0>But the effect that you're currently dealing with

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:25.965
<v Speaker 0>is the fact that the image isn't the

00:26:25.965 --> 00:26:28.045
<v Speaker 0>image that we want it to be. Yeah.

00:26:28.045 --> 00:26:29.245
<v Speaker 0>So I think you need to just pick

00:26:29.245 --> 00:26:31.085
<v Speaker 0>one of those and let's

00:26:31.485 --> 00:26:33.885
<v Speaker 0>let's focus on it. Hnt o one

00:26:34.445 --> 00:26:36.285
<v Speaker 0>probably should be the thing we focus on.

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:39.450
<v Speaker 0>Ever fixing things in order. However, you could

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:40.809
<v Speaker 0>just go straight for the image.

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:41.849
<v Speaker 1>So

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:44.809
<v Speaker 1>So you're thinking the namespace stuff, David? I

00:26:44.809 --> 00:26:47.210
<v Speaker 0>mean, that would be the journey that Fairwinds

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:48.730
<v Speaker 0>want you to go down just based on

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:49.769
<v Speaker 0>the order of the hints.

00:26:50.284 --> 00:26:52.044
<v Speaker 0>But, you know Yeah. The mission is just

00:26:52.044 --> 00:26:53.965
<v Speaker 0>to get v two running. So it's entirely

00:26:53.965 --> 00:26:54.764
<v Speaker 0>up to you.

00:26:56.445 --> 00:26:57.724
<v Speaker 1>What are thinking, team?

00:27:00.205 --> 00:27:02.124
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. I think we'll go ahead to

00:27:02.929 --> 00:27:04.850
<v Speaker 3>let's just start somewhere because we don't know

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:06.450
<v Speaker 3>for sure where the error is.

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:08.850
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Let's look at that head again. Yeah.

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:10.850
<v Speaker 0>Let's let's remind ourselves with that headset.

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:16.850
<v Speaker 1>It was

00:27:18.575 --> 00:27:20.254
<v Speaker 3>one. It was one. Yeah.

00:27:20.735 --> 00:27:22.014
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Sorry.

00:27:22.654 --> 00:27:25.294
<v Speaker 1>Built in system namespaces can hide all sorts

00:27:25.294 --> 00:27:26.254
<v Speaker 1>of junk.

00:27:27.615 --> 00:27:30.570
<v Speaker 1>Built in system namespaces can hide all sorts

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:32.809
<v Speaker 1>of junk. Yeah. So, I mean, it's possible

00:27:32.809 --> 00:27:35.050
<v Speaker 3>that it's not exactly the cube system. I

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:36.649
<v Speaker 3>think when I saw system,

00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:38.570
<v Speaker 3>I assumed it was cube system. So it

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:41.690
<v Speaker 3>could be any other v built in namespaces.

00:27:41.975 --> 00:27:43.495
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I think you're right. I would I

00:27:43.495 --> 00:27:44.935
<v Speaker 0>would take a look at those namespaces that

00:27:44.935 --> 00:27:46.135
<v Speaker 0>we always ignore

00:27:46.135 --> 00:27:47.495
<v Speaker 0>and see what's running.

00:27:47.975 --> 00:27:49.255
<v Speaker 0>I think that's a good idea.

00:27:50.215 --> 00:27:51.654
<v Speaker 1>So what are we thinking, Max?

00:27:53.815 --> 00:27:55.575
<v Speaker 1>We look at what gives CDL get an

00:27:55.575 --> 00:27:55.735
<v Speaker 1>s?

00:27:56.899 --> 00:28:00.339
<v Speaker 3>Yes. Let's check each other one of them.

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:04.739
<v Speaker 3>I think we we could try public.

00:28:06.899 --> 00:28:08.740
<v Speaker 1>I just want to kubectl

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:11.379
<v Speaker 1>get all thinking? Get all. Yes. And then

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:12.580
<v Speaker 3>dash namespace.

00:28:13.015 --> 00:28:15.174
<v Speaker 3>Dash n, then new namespace.

00:28:16.855 --> 00:28:17.495
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.

00:28:19.095 --> 00:28:21.975
<v Speaker 1>Postgres there? Kube public.

00:28:22.215 --> 00:28:23.735
<v Speaker 1>Because you said the Postgres be running in

00:28:23.735 --> 00:28:26.790
<v Speaker 1>default. Right? That is well, yeah, that's what

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:27.590
<v Speaker 0>I wanted.

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Should we continue down this should we

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:32.389
<v Speaker 1>have a quick look at node lease?

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:36.390
<v Speaker 1>Just see what's Yeah.

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:37.830
<v Speaker 3>I think we should just check that out.

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:39.955
<v Speaker 3>Even though node leases usually used to keep

00:28:39.955 --> 00:28:41.955
<v Speaker 3>the notes. No resources.

00:28:41.955 --> 00:28:42.994
<v Speaker 1>Right there.

00:28:43.475 --> 00:28:44.994
<v Speaker 1>We've already done system. Right?

00:28:45.875 --> 00:28:46.514
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:28:46.754 --> 00:28:48.274
<v Speaker 1>Is it worth just checking?

00:28:48.754 --> 00:28:50.835
<v Speaker 1>I mean, it'd evil. We mean even to,

00:28:50.835 --> 00:28:52.274
<v Speaker 1>like, put something in emissary. Right?

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:58.970
<v Speaker 1>I think that looks pretty legit. Right? That's

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:00.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. This looks legit.

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:04.410
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what the image in that Postgres

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:05.690
<v Speaker 2>pod might be.

00:29:07.115 --> 00:29:08.794
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's a good good thing you're nice.

00:29:08.794 --> 00:29:09.195
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Let me just

00:29:10.075 --> 00:29:14.315
<v Speaker 2>matches what we would expect to find. Superhackerimage.one.

00:29:14.635 --> 00:29:16.235
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I like that. I you're I like

00:29:16.395 --> 00:29:18.475
<v Speaker 1>yeah. So and this is yeah. Right? Low

00:29:18.475 --> 00:29:19.115
<v Speaker 1>balancer. Yeah.

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:20.610
<v Speaker 1>So

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:23.570
<v Speaker 1>kubectl.

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:26.289
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. All

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:28.610
<v Speaker 1>was it it was

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:30.850
<v Speaker 1>what's the name of the

00:29:33.215 --> 00:29:35.215
<v Speaker 0>The cube dash public was the one that

00:29:35.215 --> 00:29:37.775
<v Speaker 0>was suspicious. Yeah. There was cube dash public.

00:29:37.775 --> 00:29:38.815
<v Speaker 3>Yes. Yeah.

00:29:39.695 --> 00:29:42.895
<v Speaker 1>Cube public. So can you describe on the

00:29:44.895 --> 00:29:46.015
<v Speaker 1>deployment, do you think?

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:49.950
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't look like a deployment.

00:29:50.429 --> 00:29:51.629
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I think it's deployed.

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:53.710
<v Speaker 0>Default set. Okay. So that's all set. Oh,

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:56.270
<v Speaker 1>yeah. Oh, yeah. Cool. So Yeah. Yep. Keep

00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:57.150
<v Speaker 1>CTL.

00:29:57.150 --> 00:29:59.150
<v Speaker 0>And it's only twenty five hours old. That's

00:29:59.150 --> 00:29:59.950
<v Speaker 0>suspicious timing.

00:30:01.015 --> 00:30:02.455
<v Speaker 1>Indeed. Should

00:30:04.375 --> 00:30:05.895
<v Speaker 1>we just what's the idea? Describe on the

00:30:05.895 --> 00:30:06.534
<v Speaker 1>portal?

00:30:09.575 --> 00:30:11.735
<v Speaker 3>I think describe should give us more context.

00:30:12.375 --> 00:30:12.775
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:16.509
<v Speaker 4>Oops.

00:30:16.669 --> 00:30:18.030
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We're halfway through.

00:30:29.455 --> 00:30:31.854
<v Speaker 1>Image Postgres 13 Alpine.

00:30:33.695 --> 00:30:34.654
<v Speaker 1>Docker.

00:30:34.654 --> 00:30:36.815
<v Speaker 1>Liveness.

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:39.289
<v Speaker 1>Exact p g ready.

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:43.850
<v Speaker 0>So I'll give you some information about how

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:46.730
<v Speaker 0>my setup works because I think it's pertinent

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:49.690
<v Speaker 0>right now. So the postgres at the default

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:52.195
<v Speaker 0>namespace is not a stateful set. At least

00:30:52.195 --> 00:30:53.554
<v Speaker 0>I I don't think it is.

00:30:54.115 --> 00:30:56.035
<v Speaker 0>Or it may be, but it doesn't use

00:30:56.035 --> 00:30:58.115
<v Speaker 0>any persistent volumes and the data is all

00:30:57.955 --> 00:31:00.035
<v Speaker 0>Oh, okay. Is all loaded through in in

00:31:00.035 --> 00:31:00.995
<v Speaker 0>a container.

00:31:02.115 --> 00:31:02.675
<v Speaker 0>So

00:31:03.155 --> 00:31:05.075
<v Speaker 0>it could be that they have provided their

00:31:05.075 --> 00:31:08.230
<v Speaker 0>own postgres with different data to inject onto

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:09.110
<v Speaker 0>the page.

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:16.870
<v Speaker 1>Interesting. Let's In which case, we should be

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:19.590
<v Speaker 2>able to configure which Postgres is being used

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:20.390
<v Speaker 2>by the application.

00:31:21.445 --> 00:31:23.605
<v Speaker 2>I'm assuming there's a configuration

00:31:24.325 --> 00:31:25.685
<v Speaker 2>environment variable

00:31:26.245 --> 00:31:26.965
<v Speaker 2>or something.

00:31:27.765 --> 00:31:29.445
<v Speaker 1>There is a Postgres running in the default

00:31:29.445 --> 00:31:30.485
<v Speaker 1>namespace. Right?

00:31:31.845 --> 00:31:34.005
<v Speaker 3>Yep. I think that's the one, if I'm

00:31:34.005 --> 00:31:34.245
<v Speaker 1>mistaken.

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:37.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's also 25 years old.

00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:39.330
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:39.970
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Interesting. So

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:45.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm wondering,

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:47.810
<v Speaker 1>you in your

00:31:49.845 --> 00:31:51.684
<v Speaker 1>config there, Dave, for that

00:31:52.805 --> 00:31:55.125
<v Speaker 1>for that deploy I think you use deployment

00:31:55.125 --> 00:31:55.765
<v Speaker 1>to

00:31:56.325 --> 00:31:58.085
<v Speaker 1>inject some config for the Postgres?

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:04.380
<v Speaker 0>It may very well be entirely hard coded

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:05.259
<v Speaker 0>to just

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:06.460
<v Speaker 0>Postgres.

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:11.980
<v Speaker 0>So if you run get services, I'd be

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:13.260
<v Speaker 0>curious to see what we see there.

00:32:22.645 --> 00:32:24.325
<v Speaker 0>Standard cluster IP.

00:32:24.885 --> 00:32:27.605
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. And it's two days old, whereas the

00:32:27.605 --> 00:32:29.125
<v Speaker 3>other one was twenty something hours.

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:31.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:37.860
<v Speaker 1>We just do

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:41.860
<v Speaker 1>we we don't describe that one. I mean,

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:43.220
<v Speaker 1>if we do describe on

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:45.700
<v Speaker 1>right. Just keep

00:32:46.635 --> 00:32:47.515
<v Speaker 1>detail.

00:32:47.675 --> 00:32:49.755
<v Speaker 1>Describe on the service.

00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.870
<v Speaker 1>Think

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:03.429
<v Speaker 1>scrolling up through. Hopefully, folks can see this.

00:33:03.429 --> 00:33:03.909
<v Speaker 1>Oops.

00:33:04.309 --> 00:33:07.429
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So my application is hard coded to

00:33:07.429 --> 00:33:09.990
<v Speaker 0>speak to a service called Postgres

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:11.910
<v Speaker 0>and the same namespace.

00:33:14.934 --> 00:33:15.575
<v Speaker 2>So

00:33:16.135 --> 00:33:18.534
<v Speaker 2>if we cannot change the endpoint

00:33:19.414 --> 00:33:21.735
<v Speaker 2>for that thing That's if it's my application

00:33:21.735 --> 00:33:22.614
<v Speaker 0>running.

00:33:23.895 --> 00:33:24.455
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:33:24.934 --> 00:33:26.375
<v Speaker 0>Which I I'm not convinced of.

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:32.110
<v Speaker 2>But maybe there's something to do with core

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:32.830
<v Speaker 2>DNS?

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:35.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. We've seen those replica sets. Alex, you

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:37.470
<v Speaker 1>were suspicious about them. Right? Yeah.

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:39.870
<v Speaker 0>They could be forwarded onto something else. Good

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:41.390
<v Speaker 0>catch. Onto another namespace. Right?

00:33:42.075 --> 00:33:43.674
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That that makes a lot of sense.

00:33:43.674 --> 00:33:45.595
<v Speaker 1>How would we go back yeah. My core

00:33:45.595 --> 00:33:47.114
<v Speaker 1>DNS knowledge is somewhat limited.

00:33:47.355 --> 00:33:48.955
<v Speaker 1>How do we go back Yeah. Finding that

00:33:48.955 --> 00:33:51.034
<v Speaker 1>one out? Everybody says because why would you

00:33:51.034 --> 00:33:52.875
<v Speaker 0>why would you need to configure core DNS?

00:33:52.875 --> 00:33:55.195
<v Speaker 0>It just works. Right? Yeah. Exactly. Like, I

00:33:55.195 --> 00:33:56.554
<v Speaker 1>mean, it's always DNS, right, as the as

00:33:56.554 --> 00:33:58.049
<v Speaker 1>the joke goes, but why do we need

00:33:58.049 --> 00:33:58.849
<v Speaker 1>to configure it?

00:33:59.409 --> 00:34:02.690
<v Speaker 2>Let's maybe describe the core DNS pods and

00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:05.809
<v Speaker 2>figure out if there's a config map or

00:34:05.809 --> 00:34:07.889
<v Speaker 2>kind of configuration that's There is. There's a

00:34:07.889 --> 00:34:10.449
<v Speaker 0>config map in KubeSystem called core DNS.

00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:13.415
<v Speaker 0>Or, yeah. Maybe cube DNS. I can't remember.

00:34:13.415 --> 00:34:15.015
<v Speaker 0>But if you've listed config maps in cube

00:34:15.015 --> 00:34:17.015
<v Speaker 0>system, you will see what you're looking for.

00:34:22.855 --> 00:34:23.575
<v Speaker 1>In

00:34:24.054 --> 00:34:24.855
<v Speaker 1>cube system.

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:32.040
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. CoreDNS is one.

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.000
<v Speaker 1>Does it just get config map

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.360
<v Speaker 1>or describe what is it? It was it

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:42.505
<v Speaker 3>KubeS? I thought it was cubes public. Was

00:34:42.505 --> 00:34:43.545
<v Speaker 3>it cubesystem?

00:34:43.864 --> 00:34:46.025
<v Speaker 3>Was it not cubes public? We

00:34:46.185 --> 00:34:47.945
<v Speaker 3>so Okay. Well, cubes public is where the

00:34:47.945 --> 00:34:50.985
<v Speaker 0>rogue postgres is, but the core DNS configures

00:34:50.985 --> 00:34:53.385
<v Speaker 0>in cubesystem. And you can just system. Alright.

00:34:53.385 --> 00:34:55.065
<v Speaker 0>Add dash o yaml to that if you

00:34:55.065 --> 00:34:57.600
<v Speaker 0>wanna look at it. Yes, Oh, sure.

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:05.360
<v Speaker 1>I'll check lame duck five seconds. That's interesting.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:06.960
<v Speaker 2>It's a rewrite.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:07.680
<v Speaker 5>It's tough.

00:35:11.685 --> 00:35:12.725
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.

00:35:12.805 --> 00:35:14.565
<v Speaker 1>So what do we think it

00:35:15.845 --> 00:35:17.605
<v Speaker 2>I think we should Should be like not

00:35:17.605 --> 00:35:18.645
<v Speaker 1>rewrite this. This

00:35:20.645 --> 00:35:22.245
<v Speaker 3>should public.

00:35:23.205 --> 00:35:24.005
<v Speaker 3>Oops. Just

00:35:24.805 --> 00:35:26.480
<v Speaker 1>to edit. Edit.

00:35:27.359 --> 00:35:29.440
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Go straight to edit. Go for it.

00:35:29.599 --> 00:35:31.440
<v Speaker 3>Yep. Yeah. It's just in, like, start getting

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.880
<v Speaker 3>the one and keep public.

00:35:33.359 --> 00:35:34.720
<v Speaker 1>And then what we thinking? The

00:35:38.335 --> 00:35:41.535
<v Speaker 2>Let's comment comment out this rewrite block so

00:35:41.535 --> 00:35:42.335
<v Speaker 2>that the

00:35:43.455 --> 00:35:45.375
<v Speaker 0>Comment it out? That's a bit cautious.

00:35:46.415 --> 00:35:49.215
<v Speaker 1>Alex. That that's Alex all over. That's why

00:35:49.215 --> 00:35:51.135
<v Speaker 1>he's awesome on the team. He's super cautious

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:53.170
<v Speaker 1>because, yeah, I was thinking, like, d d.

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:54.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna press up d.

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:55.490
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.

00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:57.810
<v Speaker 1>That's what d d and I do in

00:35:57.810 --> 00:35:58.850
<v Speaker 1>DevRel. Right? Yeah.

00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:00.930
<v Speaker 0>Brilliant.

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Cool. You over that?

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:03.090
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:36:08.224 --> 00:36:08.865
<v Speaker 1>And

00:36:11.585 --> 00:36:12.385
<v Speaker 1>now

00:36:13.664 --> 00:36:16.785
<v Speaker 2>Let's maybe restart the core DNS server. I

00:36:16.785 --> 00:36:19.105
<v Speaker 1>don't know if the configuration map will automatically

00:36:19.105 --> 00:36:22.040
<v Speaker 2>reload or if we should force a restart.

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. What's the what's the best command for

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:26.280
<v Speaker 1>that one? So if I do

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:28.440
<v Speaker 1>TTL get

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:30.840
<v Speaker 1>is it, like, in the name of this

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:31.960
<v Speaker 1>cube system?

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.080
<v Speaker 1>Just we just restart?

00:36:35.825 --> 00:36:38.545
<v Speaker 2>The pod probably. Can see I'll get pod.

00:36:38.704 --> 00:36:39.585
<v Speaker 2>Yep.

00:36:43.105 --> 00:36:44.625
<v Speaker 0>Alright. You just have ten minutes.

00:36:45.345 --> 00:36:47.425
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So we've two pods there?

00:36:47.905 --> 00:36:48.305
<v Speaker 2>Yep.

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:51.550
<v Speaker 1>Just delete?

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:53.150
<v Speaker 1>Or Delete. Delete.

00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:55.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Can yep.

00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:59.070
<v Speaker 1>CTL.

00:36:59.070 --> 00:36:59.390
<v Speaker 1>Delete.

00:37:13.575 --> 00:37:15.895
<v Speaker 3>What's usually take a while to okay. That

00:37:15.895 --> 00:37:16.855
<v Speaker 3>that was fast. Yeah.

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.440
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty good. Did you want yeah. If

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:21.920
<v Speaker 1>I change the final one there

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:28.320
<v Speaker 1>to TBH4S4S.

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:28.720
<v Speaker 3>Yep.

00:37:34.835 --> 00:37:36.675
<v Speaker 2>And then we probably wanna do the same

00:37:36.675 --> 00:37:37.955
<v Speaker 2>thing with our application.

00:37:38.035 --> 00:37:40.835
<v Speaker 2>If there are connections established already to the

00:37:41.155 --> 00:37:42.675
<v Speaker 2>wrong Postgres

00:37:42.995 --> 00:37:43.555
<v Speaker 2>instance.

00:37:45.599 --> 00:37:48.480
<v Speaker 1>Like it. Forced to reconnections. Good point.

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:49.119
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:38:04.485 --> 00:38:06.085
<v Speaker 1>And see if could restart with that Rust

00:38:06.085 --> 00:38:07.285
<v Speaker 1>app. Right? So

00:38:07.445 --> 00:38:08.565
<v Speaker 1>should we try

00:38:08.725 --> 00:38:10.085
<v Speaker 1>calling local host?

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Different error. Failed to connect to database. It's

00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:19.210
<v Speaker 3>a different

00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:21.930
<v Speaker 1>So one down.

00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:24.570
<v Speaker 1>What's the next one?

00:38:29.855 --> 00:38:33.375
<v Speaker 1>So it's a hard coded value in the

00:38:33.375 --> 00:38:35.535
<v Speaker 1>app reaching out to that. There was a

00:38:35.535 --> 00:38:37.295
<v Speaker 0>very pertinent comment

00:38:37.535 --> 00:38:38.494
<v Speaker 0>from the

00:38:39.214 --> 00:38:40.175
<v Speaker 0>chat.

00:38:42.174 --> 00:38:44.494
<v Speaker 2>It was the endpoints, I believe, for this.

00:38:44.815 --> 00:38:45.055
<v Speaker 0>That's right.

00:38:46.299 --> 00:38:47.900
<v Speaker 0>There we go. It was the

00:38:48.299 --> 00:38:49.740
<v Speaker 0>Narla Patel there.

00:38:50.059 --> 00:38:52.220
<v Speaker 0>The Postgres service has no endpoints on the

00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:54.540
<v Speaker 0>default namespace. Oh, interesting.

00:38:55.819 --> 00:38:58.700
<v Speaker 2>Well, thank you So probably label selectors or

00:38:58.780 --> 00:38:59.660
<v Speaker 2>something of the sort.

00:39:01.355 --> 00:39:03.194
<v Speaker 1>Yes. That's the best way to figure that

00:39:03.194 --> 00:39:03.995
<v Speaker 1>one out.

00:39:07.035 --> 00:39:08.155
<v Speaker 1>Get endpoint

00:39:08.875 --> 00:39:09.755
<v Speaker 1>but no.

00:39:10.795 --> 00:39:13.435
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. We can do some analysis or look

00:39:13.435 --> 00:39:15.994
<v Speaker 2>directly at the the labels that are applied

00:39:15.994 --> 00:39:18.770
<v Speaker 2>to the Postgres deployment and compare the label

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:21.570
<v Speaker 2>selectors in the Postgres service.

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Or should we describe

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:27.490
<v Speaker 1>the service

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:29.410
<v Speaker 1>for Postgres?

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:30.530
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm.

00:39:33.835 --> 00:39:35.755
<v Speaker 1>Q o. It's

00:39:35.755 --> 00:39:36.555
<v Speaker 0>just Postgres.

00:39:37.194 --> 00:39:37.595
<v Speaker 1>Oh,

00:39:40.154 --> 00:39:41.435
<v Speaker 0>No endpoints.

00:39:42.394 --> 00:39:43.355
<v Speaker 0>Good catch, Narla.

00:39:44.555 --> 00:39:46.234
<v Speaker 1>Nothing. None none. Right? On the labels on

00:39:46.234 --> 00:39:46.555
<v Speaker 1>the endpoints.

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh, I'm sorry. There is actually on the

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.320
<v Speaker 2>label selectors,

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.160
<v Speaker 2>app equal Postgres.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:54.960
<v Speaker 1>Sorry. Yeah.

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Alex, what was that?

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:59.200
<v Speaker 2>There yeah. I was just pointing to the

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.240
<v Speaker 2>app equals

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.160
<v Speaker 2>pro equals Postgres.

00:40:02.385 --> 00:40:04.305
<v Speaker 1>So Oh, I gotcha. On the selector. Sorry.

00:40:04.305 --> 00:40:05.025
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yep.

00:40:07.345 --> 00:40:09.025
<v Speaker 0>So you're gonna wanna check that pod and

00:40:09.025 --> 00:40:11.105
<v Speaker 0>see if the labels match up.

00:40:11.585 --> 00:40:12.305
<v Speaker 1>Mhmm.

00:40:13.025 --> 00:40:14.945
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. On the Postgres pod.

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:29.400
<v Speaker 1>Label's none.

00:40:31.335 --> 00:40:32.055
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:40:32.535 --> 00:40:34.135
<v Speaker 1>You wanna see that one at the top?

00:40:35.895 --> 00:40:37.415
<v Speaker 1>So do have Kubel edit?

00:40:39.495 --> 00:40:41.655
<v Speaker 0>The old favorite. Go for more time.

00:40:42.295 --> 00:40:43.495
<v Speaker 1>Exactly. One more time.

00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:51.660
<v Speaker 1>There is I can just find it. How

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:53.900
<v Speaker 0>much of the pod spec is immutable, though?

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:56.300
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:58.780
<v Speaker 0>I don't remember if labels are or not.

00:40:59.915 --> 00:41:03.915
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. So we probably should modify the statefuls,

00:41:03.915 --> 00:41:04.475
<v Speaker 2>sir?

00:41:04.795 --> 00:41:07.675
<v Speaker 0>Deployment for the cluster one. Yeah. The deployment.

00:41:07.994 --> 00:41:09.915
<v Speaker 2>K. Keep CTL,

00:41:10.635 --> 00:41:11.035
<v Speaker 1>edit

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:15.550
<v Speaker 1>the cluster service, did you say? Deployment.

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:16.910
<v Speaker 2>The deployment.

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:27.470
<v Speaker 1>The final label. Clustered one, but the Postgres

00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:27.870
<v Speaker 2>one.

00:41:28.965 --> 00:41:30.245
<v Speaker 1>Yes. Sorry.

00:41:38.165 --> 00:41:40.005
<v Speaker 0>It's a stable set for STS.

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:42.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:49.590
<v Speaker 2>Oops. Press q l.

00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:53.910
<v Speaker 0>There we go. We'll get it.

00:41:55.775 --> 00:41:57.215
<v Speaker 3>Awesome. We're in.

00:41:57.535 --> 00:41:59.375
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I wrote these manifests. I don't even

00:41:59.375 --> 00:42:00.015
<v Speaker 0>remember.

00:42:01.375 --> 00:42:03.695
<v Speaker 1>It's fine. There we go. At postgres.

00:42:04.015 --> 00:42:05.695
<v Speaker 1>Oh, is there a mutating

00:42:05.935 --> 00:42:07.135
<v Speaker 1>webhook or something?

00:42:07.775 --> 00:42:08.415
<v Speaker 1>That's

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:10.530
<v Speaker 1>changing that.

00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:13.410
<v Speaker 2>Could be. Yep. More for Luke.

00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:14.690
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:17.730
<v Speaker 0>Got five minutes or just under five minutes.

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:18.530
<v Speaker 1>I

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:20.930
<v Speaker 1>think the Fairwinds team might have a specific

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:23.065
<v Speaker 1>on this one. What is it? Get mutating

00:42:23.065 --> 00:42:26.025
<v Speaker 1>webhooks? I can never really Mutating webhook configuration.

00:42:32.025 --> 00:42:34.185
<v Speaker 0>Nice long one there for you. That's a

00:42:34.185 --> 00:42:34.745
<v Speaker 3>long one.

00:42:36.119 --> 00:42:37.560
<v Speaker 3>No recesses found.

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:42.359
<v Speaker 1>Any

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:47.320
<v Speaker 1>thoughts?

00:42:47.799 --> 00:42:49.559
<v Speaker 0>I would encourage you to use the hints

00:42:49.559 --> 00:42:52.115
<v Speaker 0>given how little Yeah. Time there is. It

00:42:52.115 --> 00:42:53.635
<v Speaker 0>doesn't hurt to use the hints and and

00:42:53.635 --> 00:42:54.195
<v Speaker 0>get

00:42:54.515 --> 00:42:56.115
<v Speaker 0>maybe catch one more time.

00:42:58.275 --> 00:43:00.435
<v Speaker 1>Ejecting HTML is so easy when you control

00:43:00.435 --> 00:43:02.355
<v Speaker 1>the database. That was your suspicion, David. Right?

00:43:02.915 --> 00:43:05.555
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'm gonna have to sanitize my inputs.

00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Lesson learned.

00:43:08.849 --> 00:43:10.450
<v Speaker 1>We do it like another

00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:12.130
<v Speaker 1>we sort of need that. I've never seen

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:14.930
<v Speaker 0>that SQL injection go the other way. On

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:16.450
<v Speaker 1>the database side. Yeah.

00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:18.530
<v Speaker 1>Nice. Should we do the other?

00:43:21.684 --> 00:43:22.805
<v Speaker 1>Three.

00:43:23.924 --> 00:43:25.204
<v Speaker 1>DNS.

00:43:25.204 --> 00:43:27.204
<v Speaker 1>That's it. Right? DNS. There's

00:43:27.204 --> 00:43:28.725
<v Speaker 1>no way to that. Right? DNS.

00:43:30.484 --> 00:43:31.204
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. We're good for

00:43:33.204 --> 00:43:34.880
<v Speaker 1>you know, you can just name a naked

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:37.120
<v Speaker 1>pod the same as what a control expects?

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:37.920
<v Speaker 1>I did not.

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:39.280
<v Speaker 1>Right. Did you

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.200
<v Speaker 0>Ah, okay.

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:43.920
<v Speaker 2>So

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.720
<v Speaker 2>let's just delete this pod.

00:43:47.165 --> 00:43:49.165
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. And let the country actually

00:43:50.925 --> 00:43:52.765
<v Speaker 2>It's the Postgres pod. Postgres

00:43:52.925 --> 00:43:55.085
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Quick. Nick it with fire. You've got

00:43:55.085 --> 00:43:57.005
<v Speaker 1>you've got it's three minutes.

00:43:57.565 --> 00:43:58.765
<v Speaker 1>New CTL.

00:43:58.765 --> 00:43:59.085
<v Speaker 1>Delete

00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:01.570
<v Speaker 1>pod. What was the

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:03.570
<v Speaker 0>Postgres,

00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:04.530
<v Speaker 0>yeah,

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:06.850
<v Speaker 0>cool URL dash o one.

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:08.930
<v Speaker 1>PostgresQL,

00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:09.650
<v Speaker 1>o one?

00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:13.890
<v Speaker 0>I should And maybe Postgres. I don't know.

00:44:14.724 --> 00:44:16.724
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. Let's just if you get supports. Yeah.

00:44:16.724 --> 00:44:18.885
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Oh, just deal. O.

00:44:19.204 --> 00:44:20.085
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

<v Speaker 1>Yep. Lost my turn up. I don't know.

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:29.080
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:30.520
<v Speaker 1>Should we just do a

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:32.120
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Yeah. Go for it.

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:39.400
<v Speaker 1>It failed. Well, it may not be running

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:40.440
<v Speaker 0>yet, to be fair.

00:44:41.115 --> 00:44:42.955
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. So this is Oh, it's gone.

00:44:44.075 --> 00:44:51.835
<v Speaker 1>That's

00:44:51.835 --> 00:44:54.715
<v Speaker 1>intriguing. Right? It's just default set replicas

00:44:54.715 --> 00:44:55.435
<v Speaker 0>set to zero?

00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:00.349
<v Speaker 1>Is the deployment

00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:00.910
<v Speaker 1>set?

00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:03.950
<v Speaker 0>The stateful set. The stateful set.

00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:05.790
<v Speaker 1>In

00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:08.510
<v Speaker 1>in the other namespace or No. In this

00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:09.070
<v Speaker 0>one.

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:12.145
<v Speaker 1>So what's the what's the command to run?

00:45:12.145 --> 00:45:14.305
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I would just edit the stateful

00:45:14.305 --> 00:45:16.465
<v Speaker 0>set and then search for replicas and see.

00:45:17.665 --> 00:45:19.265
<v Speaker 1>So kubectl

00:45:19.425 --> 00:45:20.225
<v Speaker 1>edit.

00:45:20.545 --> 00:45:22.145
<v Speaker 0>S t s. Yeah.

00:45:24.145 --> 00:45:24.945
<v Speaker 0>Post SQL.

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:34.520
<v Speaker 0>There we go. Touch four. Zero replicas.

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:36.360
<v Speaker 1>Ah, yes. I see it.

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:39.320

<v Speaker 1>Oh, Pairwinds insights can help you with resource

00:46:17.055 --> 00:46:17.935

<v Speaker 6>And really excited to be back and and

00:48:56.215 --> 00:48:57.655

<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Thank you.

00:49:26.575 --> 00:49:27.375
<v Speaker 0>Robert?

00:49:27.615 --> 00:49:30.255
<v Speaker 4>I'm, Robert Brennan. I'm a

00:49:31.215 --> 00:49:32.895
<v Speaker 4>I, I'm a software developer.

00:49:33.055 --> 00:49:35.215
<v Speaker 4>I lead the team building Fairwinds Insights, which

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:38.440
<v Speaker 4>are our commercial platform for doing, Kubernetes governance.

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:41.880
<v Speaker 0>And, Andy, there you go.

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:45.480
<v Speaker 5>Hey, y'all. I'm Andy, director of r and

00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:46.920
<v Speaker 5>d and technology here.

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:49.319
<v Speaker 5>I've, been doing Kubernetes for

00:49:50.255 --> 00:49:52.415
<v Speaker 5>so many years now, and it's just super

00:49:52.415 --> 00:49:53.775
<v Speaker 5>fun to be back here. This is a

00:49:53.775 --> 00:49:55.455
<v Speaker 5>total blast. So thanks for having us.

00:49:55.935 --> 00:49:57.535
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Welcome back.

00:49:59.055 --> 00:50:02.415
<v Speaker 0>Doing a reverse SQL injection into my application

00:50:02.415 --> 00:50:05.590
<v Speaker 0>was particularly sticky because in my head, I

00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:07.270
<v Speaker 0>was trying to fix the wrong thing, I

00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:08.870
<v Speaker 0>think for a while in there,

00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:11.030
<v Speaker 0>trying to work out how you potentially replace

00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.830
<v Speaker 0>the image.

00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:14.150
<v Speaker 0>I like that. That was very

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:15.190
<v Speaker 0>sneaky.

00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:18.630
<v Speaker 0>All right. I think it's only fair now

00:50:18.735 --> 00:50:21.455
<v Speaker 0>to hand a cluster over to you. So,

00:50:21.455 --> 00:50:24.015
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna pop my screen share back up

00:50:24.975 --> 00:50:27.215
<v Speaker 0>and I will open a connection

00:50:28.735 --> 00:50:32.730
<v Speaker 0>on Farewell. Oh, no, not Farewells. Ambassador

00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:34.650
<v Speaker 0>Labs control plane

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:37.770
<v Speaker 0>one. Please remember to use activity, active sessions

00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:40.330
<v Speaker 0>and join rather than creating your own session,

00:50:40.330 --> 00:50:41.690
<v Speaker 0>just so that we're all typing into the

00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:43.450
<v Speaker 0>same window. And if you could all give

00:50:43.450 --> 00:50:45.895
<v Speaker 0>me a echo hello, that would be awesome.

00:50:45.895 --> 00:50:48.135
<v Speaker 0>And I will get one more extra picture

00:50:48.694 --> 00:50:50.775
<v Speaker 0>of on the screen because we're missing one.

00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:01.330
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Just do this all ad hoc. I

00:51:01.330 --> 00:51:02.610
<v Speaker 0>don't need me. I'm good.

00:51:10.875 --> 00:51:12.555
<v Speaker 0>All right. We've got a few hellos there.

00:51:12.555 --> 00:51:13.035
<v Speaker 0>So

00:51:13.435 --> 00:51:15.435
<v Speaker 0>feel free to set up your KubeConfig and

00:51:15.435 --> 00:51:16.235
<v Speaker 0>aliases,

00:51:16.235 --> 00:51:18.315
<v Speaker 0>check for a control plane and best of

00:51:18.315 --> 00:51:19.115
<v Speaker 0>luck team.

00:51:30.619 --> 00:51:32.700
<v Speaker 0>But who have we got driving today?

00:51:33.339 --> 00:51:35.420
<v Speaker 6>Oh, yeah. That would be me.

00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:37.900
<v Speaker 6>So

00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:40.645
<v Speaker 6>yeah. Feel the curse everyone feels when you

00:51:40.645 --> 00:51:42.085
<v Speaker 6>screen share screen.

00:51:42.645 --> 00:51:45.925
<v Speaker 6>Everything suddenly goes to nowhere. So where is

00:51:45.925 --> 00:51:48.005
<v Speaker 6>this one, Andy? It was in Etsy.

00:51:48.005 --> 00:51:49.845
<v Speaker 5>Etsy Kubernetes

00:51:49.925 --> 00:51:50.805
<v Speaker 5>admin dot com.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:52.960
<v Speaker 4>There we go.

00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:56.560
<v Speaker 5>And, Brian, I understand. I drove last time,

00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:58.640
<v Speaker 5>and I still don't remember all the details

00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:01.120
<v Speaker 5>of what happened because it was just, like,

00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:02.720
<v Speaker 5>total blur.

00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:03.920
<v Speaker 0>Uh-oh.

00:52:05.835 --> 00:52:10.155
<v Speaker 0>You have no control play. Let's

00:52:10.155 --> 00:52:11.835
<v Speaker 5>take a look at what's in that cube

00:52:11.835 --> 00:52:14.955
<v Speaker 5>config. It looks like Yeah. It's missing some

00:52:14.955 --> 00:52:15.435
<v Speaker 5>information.

00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:22.620
<v Speaker 5>Client keys data.

00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:25.900
<v Speaker 5>Is that the right key? Is it supposed

00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:27.500
<v Speaker 5>to be client key data?

00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:33.020
<v Speaker 6>Client key must be specified.

00:52:36.575 --> 00:52:38.015
<v Speaker 4>Client key data.

00:52:39.535 --> 00:52:41.455
<v Speaker 6>Yeah. There's client key data.

00:52:41.855 --> 00:52:43.935
<v Speaker 5>And it says client keys data. Is that

00:52:43.935 --> 00:52:45.055
<v Speaker 5>supposed to be plural?

00:52:45.775 --> 00:52:47.295
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so. I think Not

00:52:47.615 --> 00:52:48.655
<v Speaker 6>based on this error.

00:52:49.590 --> 00:52:51.590
<v Speaker 6>Errors of the very wary, I think.

00:52:52.070 --> 00:52:54.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah. I'm very wary of typos after last

00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:56.470
<v Speaker 5>time because we spent, what,

00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:59.270
<v Speaker 5>fifteen minutes staring at that YAML trying to

00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:00.790
<v Speaker 5>find a typo last time.

00:53:01.350 --> 00:53:03.750
<v Speaker 6>Alright. So I'm just gonna ditch that guy

00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:04.550
<v Speaker 6>that one there.

00:53:09.095 --> 00:53:10.455
<v Speaker 1>Oops.

00:53:14.135 --> 00:53:15.015
<v Speaker 5>You

00:53:16.295 --> 00:53:17.815
<v Speaker 5>can specify aliases.

00:53:19.050 --> 00:53:21.930
<v Speaker 6>That's right. Ex what is that? Export. I'll

00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:22.970
<v Speaker 6>do that later.

00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:26.090
<v Speaker 6>Looks like we're still not getting it.

00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:30.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. It's asking for client key data still.

00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:32.730
<v Speaker 6>Yeah. Thought we

00:53:33.395 --> 00:53:35.715
<v Speaker 6>are we in the right config?

00:53:36.835 --> 00:53:38.035
<v Speaker 6>Let me get out of there.

00:53:39.474 --> 00:53:40.355
<v Speaker 4>It's there.

00:53:42.115 --> 00:53:43.795
<v Speaker 4>Where is client key data?

00:53:44.915 --> 00:53:46.195
<v Speaker 5>It's in the right place?

00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:48.820
<v Speaker 4>Is it, yeah, is it indented properly?

00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:52.100
<v Speaker 5>So can't we just use

00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:54.420
<v Speaker 5>QADM to give us a new config

00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:57.140
<v Speaker 1>so we don't have to try and figure

00:53:57.140 --> 00:53:58.580
<v Speaker 5>out all the things that might be wrong?

00:54:00.285 --> 00:54:01.165
<v Speaker 6>Sure.

00:54:02.445 --> 00:54:03.965
<v Speaker 6>Remember the command for that?

00:54:05.085 --> 00:54:05.645
<v Speaker 5>Oh, no.

00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:18.620
<v Speaker 6>I think it's let's see.

00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:23.020
<v Speaker 6>I think it's just kubeadm kubeadm config.

00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:24.380
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:27.099
<v Speaker 5>Kubeadm

00:54:27.099 --> 00:54:27.980
<v Speaker 5>kubeadm

00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:28.460
<v Speaker 5>config.

00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:47.660
<v Speaker 6>Let's see. Would it be user?

00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:51.100
<v Speaker 4>Have you used the Internet as a generator

00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:51.500
<v Speaker 4>config?

00:54:57.275 --> 00:54:59.195
<v Speaker 4>Or is the user command necessary?

00:55:02.395 --> 00:55:04.155
<v Speaker 6>No. I gotta have something there.

00:55:07.194 --> 00:55:09.035
<v Speaker 0>You can try Kubernetes dash admin.

00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:15.140
<v Speaker 4>But I think without the user.

00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:18.100
<v Speaker 6>Oh, without user. No. No. Wipe user. I

00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:19.780
<v Speaker 5>think that is the user. Yeah.

00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:20.580
<v Speaker 5>Gotcha.

00:55:22.915 --> 00:55:25.234
<v Speaker 0>It might want a flag. Oh, I got

00:55:25.234 --> 00:55:28.275
<v Speaker 6>the flag. The flag. Again, screen sharing. Apologies.

00:55:28.915 --> 00:55:30.434
<v Speaker 0>I know. It's user and then dash dash

00:55:30.434 --> 00:55:32.675
<v Speaker 0>help. It must want maybe dash dot. I

00:55:32.675 --> 00:55:34.115
<v Speaker 0>don't know if it wants a flag for

00:55:34.115 --> 00:55:36.434
<v Speaker 0>the Kubernetes admin or not. Oh, right. Right.

00:55:36.434 --> 00:55:36.994
<v Speaker 6>Right. Right. Right.

00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:39.420
<v Speaker 0>I

00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:42.220
<v Speaker 0>don't know. I've never used this this command

00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:42.940
<v Speaker 0>before.

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:45.420
<v Speaker 6>Oh, what I'm let's see. I'm looking at

00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:45.980
<v Speaker 6>this.

00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:49.260
<v Speaker 5>No. I see.

00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:53.865
<v Speaker 5>Q config user dash dash client dash name

00:55:54.665 --> 00:55:56.025
<v Speaker 6>That's it. Equals

00:55:56.905 --> 00:55:58.185
<v Speaker 5>dash admin.

00:55:59.945 --> 00:56:02.185
<v Speaker 5>That's But we need the q a d

00:56:02.185 --> 00:56:02.825
<v Speaker 5>m

00:56:03.145 --> 00:56:05.065
<v Speaker 5>config file for this cluster. So we need

00:56:05.065 --> 00:56:06.345
<v Speaker 5>dash dash config,

00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:11.050
<v Speaker 5>and I don't know where that is.

00:56:12.090 --> 00:56:12.810
<v Speaker 6>K.

00:56:13.450 --> 00:56:15.370
<v Speaker 5>But you can try it without the last

00:56:15.370 --> 00:56:16.890
<v Speaker 5>flag and see what it does.

00:56:17.690 --> 00:56:18.090
<v Speaker 6>K.

00:56:23.835 --> 00:56:25.435
<v Speaker 6>Config not set. Alright.

00:56:26.875 --> 00:56:27.995
<v Speaker 6>Alright. Let's see.

00:56:29.515 --> 00:56:32.155
<v Speaker 0>There is no Kubernetes and config left on

00:56:32.155 --> 00:56:34.395
<v Speaker 0>the machines after the provisioning step, I'm afraid.

00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:36.940
<v Speaker 6>Okay. Alright.

00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:42.300
<v Speaker 5>Then let's let's

00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:43.100
<v Speaker 5>look at

00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:44.060
<v Speaker 5>because

00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:46.780
<v Speaker 4>Why yeah. Why is it still complaining about

00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:47.900
<v Speaker 4>the the key

00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:49.260
<v Speaker 4>key not being there?

00:56:50.555 --> 00:56:51.515
<v Speaker 5>Good question.

00:56:52.635 --> 00:56:54.075
<v Speaker 5>Let's take a look at that thing again,

00:56:54.075 --> 00:56:54.715
<v Speaker 5>shall we?

00:56:55.035 --> 00:56:56.075
<v Speaker 5>Yeah. Yeah.

00:56:59.115 --> 00:57:00.235
<v Speaker 6>The admin.com

00:57:00.235 --> 00:57:00.955
<v Speaker 6>file?

00:57:02.155 --> 00:57:02.555
<v Speaker 5>Two.

00:57:04.359 --> 00:57:06.600
<v Speaker 5>With which kubectl.

00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:08.520
<v Speaker 5>Okay.

00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:10.280
<v Speaker 5>And

00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:12.600
<v Speaker 5>let's check for aliases too.

00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:14.200
<v Speaker 6>Okay.

00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:16.359
<v Speaker 5>That's sneaky. Because, like

00:57:17.175 --> 00:57:19.095
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That would be sneaky. You could just

00:57:19.095 --> 00:57:20.535
<v Speaker 0>type alias. Yeah. That will list them all.

00:57:20.535 --> 00:57:22.055
<v Speaker 5>Just type alias. Yeah.

00:57:24.695 --> 00:57:26.695
<v Speaker 0>Up to date. I don't see anything there.

00:57:27.255 --> 00:57:30.055
<v Speaker 6>Someone suggested looking for a backup of something.

00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:34.940
<v Speaker 6>Wonder if it's hidden somewhere.

00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:38.140
<v Speaker 5>I don't know. Let's go back to what

00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:40.380
<v Speaker 5>what we were looking at the queue. The

00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:43.020
<v Speaker 5>admin conference. Right? It's not

00:57:45.025 --> 00:57:46.865
<v Speaker 5>red hair and YouTube part of it.

00:57:51.585 --> 00:57:54.065
<v Speaker 6>So you have client key data, client certificate

00:57:54.065 --> 00:57:54.865
<v Speaker 6>data.

00:57:55.665 --> 00:57:58.225
<v Speaker 5>Oh, wait. No. That's

00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:04.930
<v Speaker 5>cluster. Contacts.

00:58:05.410 --> 00:58:08.290
<v Speaker 5>User your Kubernetes admin. That matches the name.

00:58:11.490 --> 00:58:13.330
<v Speaker 5>That oh, check your contacts.

00:58:14.525 --> 00:58:17.165
<v Speaker 6>That's right. Yeah. Kubectl yeah. The name of

00:58:17.165 --> 00:58:18.285
<v Speaker 5>the context.

00:58:18.925 --> 00:58:21.645
<v Speaker 5>Is that correct? Do a kubectl config get

00:58:21.645 --> 00:58:22.205
<v Speaker 5>context.

00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:29.960
<v Speaker 0>Oops.

00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:33.320
<v Speaker 0>It does look okay in the file.

00:58:36.839 --> 00:58:39.079
<v Speaker 4>So we specify for Kubernetes admin.

00:58:40.704 --> 00:58:42.305
<v Speaker 5>To use the client. Why

00:58:43.425 --> 00:58:45.265
<v Speaker 5>is it doing that when you say kubectl

00:58:45.265 --> 00:58:46.065
<v Speaker 5>config,

00:58:46.065 --> 00:58:48.785
<v Speaker 5>though? That says to me that something's been,

00:58:48.944 --> 00:58:49.505
<v Speaker 5>yeah,

00:58:50.224 --> 00:58:51.425
<v Speaker 5>messed with here

00:58:51.825 --> 00:58:53.825
<v Speaker 5>with the kubectl

00:58:53.825 --> 00:58:54.865
<v Speaker 5>binary itself.

00:58:56.170 --> 00:58:56.970
<v Speaker 5>Wow.

00:58:57.530 --> 00:58:58.410
<v Speaker 5>Cat

00:58:58.490 --> 00:59:01.050
<v Speaker 5>user bin kubectl.

00:59:01.130 --> 00:59:02.010
<v Speaker 0>Uh-oh.

00:59:03.690 --> 00:59:04.650
<v Speaker 0>Oh, alright.

00:59:04.970 --> 00:59:06.970
<v Speaker 5>I mean, I if I was gonna be

00:59:06.970 --> 00:59:08.890
<v Speaker 5>really mean, I would replace it with a

00:59:08.890 --> 00:59:10.890
<v Speaker 5>bad script. Can you type reset to clean

00:59:10.890 --> 00:59:11.210
<v Speaker 5>that up?

00:59:12.305 --> 00:59:13.744
<v Speaker 5>I I did the same thing, and it

00:59:13.744 --> 00:59:14.625
<v Speaker 5>worked okay.

00:59:16.865 --> 00:59:18.705
<v Speaker 5>My my apologies.

00:59:22.464 --> 00:59:23.905
<v Speaker 1>How do we get out of this one?

00:59:24.224 --> 00:59:26.180
<v Speaker 5>Guess I could've used file instead. That would've

00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:27.140
<v Speaker 5>been Yeah.

00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:28.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.

00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:32.580
<v Speaker 0>I think I'll just close this terminal.

00:59:40.015 --> 00:59:41.455
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So I

00:59:42.975 --> 00:59:45.295
<v Speaker 0>let's close this. The session will disappear.

00:59:53.289 --> 00:59:54.650
<v Speaker 0>Okay. We have a

00:59:58.009 --> 00:59:59.290
<v Speaker 0>I missed it.

01:00:00.809 --> 01:00:01.289
<v Speaker 1>There you go.

01:00:07.075 --> 01:00:08.195
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Connect.

01:00:12.995 --> 01:00:14.995
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I can't spell control plan. Apologies.

01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:24.260
<v Speaker 0>Okay. We have a new session. Please join

01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:24.980
<v Speaker 0>that.

01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:27.780
<v Speaker 0>The one that says

01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:29.860
<v Speaker 0>could just close the one you're in just

01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:31.140
<v Speaker 0>now. Just jump into the one that's been

01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:33.620
<v Speaker 0>open for a few seconds and reconfigure

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:35.540
<v Speaker 0>your config and hope for the best.

01:00:36.695 --> 01:00:37.495
<v Speaker 5>And

01:00:39.655 --> 01:00:41.255
<v Speaker 0>for the record, that is two people that

01:00:41.255 --> 01:00:42.935
<v Speaker 0>have captured a binary file in the last

01:00:42.935 --> 01:00:44.455
<v Speaker 0>two episodes. So

01:00:46.935 --> 01:00:48.135
<v Speaker 6>Do you want me to use file on

01:00:48.135 --> 01:00:48.775
<v Speaker 6>that, Andy?

01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:52.460
<v Speaker 5>No. I mean, we know it's a binary

01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:53.100
<v Speaker 5>now.

01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:54.619
<v Speaker 6>Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I guess it could

01:00:54.619 --> 01:00:56.460
<v Speaker 5>be the wrong binary, but we would I

01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:57.660
<v Speaker 2>was gonna say maybe. Download

01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:00.859
<v Speaker 4>a new maybe?

01:01:03.234 --> 01:01:05.315
<v Speaker 5>Yeah. We could get a new just grab

01:01:05.315 --> 01:01:06.755
<v Speaker 5>a new one just in case.

01:01:11.795 --> 01:01:12.835
<v Speaker 6>Let's see.

01:01:14.515 --> 01:01:16.115
<v Speaker 0>It helps if you use grab. Me in

01:01:16.115 --> 01:01:17.795
<v Speaker 5>the other room. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:21.090
<v Speaker 6>Grab.

01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:27.730
<v Speaker 6>It's been there for a while.

01:01:29.090 --> 01:01:30.930
<v Speaker 6>Okay. Yeah.

01:01:32.130 --> 01:01:32.690
<v Speaker 5>Hello.

01:01:35.075 --> 01:01:35.795
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:01:36.994 --> 01:01:39.315
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. There must be hints. Yeah.

01:01:39.714 --> 01:01:41.395
<v Speaker 5>Was gonna say, are there other hints?

01:01:45.474 --> 01:01:47.395
<v Speaker 6>It's functionally similar to Carta.

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:51.380
<v Speaker 5>So a typo? Don't count don't count them

01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:51.940
<v Speaker 5>all. There's

01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:54.420
<v Speaker 5>That's what Carta did.

01:01:56.339 --> 01:01:58.420
<v Speaker 6>There's an element of the eighties soft sell

01:01:58.420 --> 01:01:59.060
<v Speaker 6>song here.

01:02:00.805 --> 01:02:02.565
<v Speaker 5>Brian, you're our music expert.

01:02:03.685 --> 01:02:04.725
<v Speaker 6>Tainted Love.

01:02:05.365 --> 01:02:06.645
<v Speaker 6>So there's tape somewhere. But

01:02:08.885 --> 01:02:11.525
<v Speaker 5>That sounds like that sounds like a typo

01:02:11.525 --> 01:02:14.005
<v Speaker 5>that we're missing maybe. So let's maybe take

01:02:14.005 --> 01:02:15.445
<v Speaker 5>a look at that admin conf again.

01:02:16.410 --> 01:02:17.130
<v Speaker 6>Okay.

01:02:26.089 --> 01:02:26.490
<v Speaker 5>I got

01:02:27.930 --> 01:02:30.170
<v Speaker 4>Cluster, I mean, right, is there

01:02:31.625 --> 01:02:33.785
<v Speaker 4>is there more going on, like, above here

01:02:33.785 --> 01:02:35.704
<v Speaker 4>that I can't see? Here we go.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.920
<v Speaker 5>Clusters

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:47.960
<v Speaker 5>cluster

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:49.000
<v Speaker 5>name, Kubernetes,

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:53.160
<v Speaker 5>context cluster user, Kubernetes admin.

01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:58.040
<v Speaker 5>Contact's name is Kubernetes admin at Kubernetes.

01:02:58.665 --> 01:03:01.065
<v Speaker 5>Current context matches that.

01:03:02.905 --> 01:03:09.305
<v Speaker 1>Client's

01:03:09.385 --> 01:03:11.305
<v Speaker 1>I wish you all the spaces and tabs.

01:03:11.305 --> 01:03:12.025
<v Speaker 0>I have curiosity.

01:03:16.339 --> 01:03:17.380
<v Speaker 5>Say that again?

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:20.579
<v Speaker 0>Is YAML fine with spaces and tabs? I'm

01:03:20.579 --> 01:03:21.220
<v Speaker 0>guessing.

01:03:21.539 --> 01:03:24.339
<v Speaker 0>You know, like Oh. Like What what have

01:03:24.339 --> 01:03:26.339
<v Speaker 0>we got before the client key data about,

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:27.780
<v Speaker 0>could it could it be a tab character

01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:28.180
<v Speaker 0>or something?

01:03:30.155 --> 01:03:31.835
<v Speaker 1>Could be, but I don't think the actual

01:03:31.835 --> 01:03:33.195
<v Speaker 5>cares. Does it?

01:03:35.675 --> 01:03:37.275
<v Speaker 4>It could if it's

01:03:37.435 --> 01:03:39.595
<v Speaker 4>oh, no. Yeah. I think you'd get a

01:03:39.595 --> 01:03:40.875
<v Speaker 4>different error message.

01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:43.820
<v Speaker 4>But it's weird that it's saying there's no

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:45.020
<v Speaker 4>client key data.

01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:49.340
<v Speaker 6>That is weird. Like,

01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:53.820
<v Speaker 4>if if can you if can you edit

01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:55.660
<v Speaker 4>the file with with them just to, like,

01:03:55.660 --> 01:03:58.315
<v Speaker 1>see if they're letting any hints?

01:04:05.275 --> 01:04:07.435
<v Speaker 4>It's that little add add add at the

01:04:07.435 --> 01:04:08.075
<v Speaker 4>bottom.

01:04:08.875 --> 01:04:10.235
<v Speaker 4>That's just them.

01:04:14.210 --> 01:04:15.090
<v Speaker 6>Oops.

01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:15.890
<v Speaker 6>Is

01:04:17.569 --> 01:04:19.570
<v Speaker 5>that the right number of spaces

01:04:19.970 --> 01:04:22.049
<v Speaker 5>in front of client key data? I can't

01:04:22.049 --> 01:04:23.890
<v Speaker 5>actually tell from here.

01:04:26.770 --> 01:04:28.775
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. It looks like it. Looks like four

01:04:28.775 --> 01:04:29.575
<v Speaker 4>spaces. Can

01:04:30.295 --> 01:04:30.455
<v Speaker 4>you

01:04:31.415 --> 01:04:33.895
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Go down there. Let's see. One, two,

01:04:33.895 --> 01:04:34.775
<v Speaker 1>three, four.

01:04:36.535 --> 01:04:37.255
<v Speaker 6>Yep.

01:04:37.655 --> 01:04:38.455
<v Speaker 6>That's four.

01:04:49.310 --> 01:04:50.190
<v Speaker 5>I'm looking

01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:53.470
<v Speaker 5>at a cube config for a kind cluster

01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:54.430
<v Speaker 5>locally.

01:04:54.910 --> 01:04:55.630
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.

01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:58.109
<v Speaker 6>So

01:04:57.684 --> 01:05:00.484
<v Speaker 6>suggested our client certificate data and client key

01:05:00.484 --> 01:05:01.685
<v Speaker 6>data swapped.

01:05:04.244 --> 01:05:04.965
<v Speaker 5>They

01:05:05.125 --> 01:05:05.765
<v Speaker 5>could

01:05:06.405 --> 01:05:09.204
<v Speaker 5>be I'm not sure how we would let's

01:05:09.204 --> 01:05:11.700
<v Speaker 5>see. Just, like, chain change the keys

01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:14.020
<v Speaker 4>back and forth? Like, change the lines to

01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:15.460
<v Speaker 0>try it. Data.

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:16.580
<v Speaker 6>Okay. Do wanna

01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:19.540
<v Speaker 6>oops.

01:05:28.375 --> 01:05:29.255
<v Speaker 6>Like that?

01:05:30.375 --> 01:05:31.015
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:05:36.535 --> 01:05:37.975
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you ever

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:42.200
<v Speaker 6>I saved that. Did you export the

01:05:42.599 --> 01:05:44.440
<v Speaker 5>you export the Kube config again?

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:46.280
<v Speaker 5>Probably

01:05:46.599 --> 01:05:48.120
<v Speaker 5>No. Copy of this file.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.839
<v Speaker 5>Then why is it still doing this thing?

01:05:53.714 --> 01:05:55.075
<v Speaker 6>Oh, you're right.

01:05:56.755 --> 01:05:58.434
<v Speaker 6>Export econfig

01:05:58.434 --> 01:05:59.474
<v Speaker 6>equals

01:05:59.474 --> 01:06:00.515
<v Speaker 6>Etsy.

01:06:03.155 --> 01:06:03.555
<v Speaker 5>How

01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:06.750
<v Speaker 5>is it still giving us the same error

01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:09.390
<v Speaker 5>no matter what we do? I think This

01:06:09.390 --> 01:06:10.670
<v Speaker 5>is not right. I

01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:13.710
<v Speaker 5>think need a new There's alternative ways to

01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:15.630
<v Speaker 0>set the cube config. What about the flag

01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:16.430
<v Speaker 0>on the cube control?

01:06:17.375 --> 01:06:18.015
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.

01:06:20.255 --> 01:06:22.095
<v Speaker 0>I I would try that. We checked.

01:06:22.335 --> 01:06:22.975
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:06:24.175 --> 01:06:26.175
<v Speaker 0>The dash dash cube config equals

01:06:26.895 --> 01:06:27.775
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:06:28.655 --> 01:06:30.974
<v Speaker 0>And let's just rule out some environment

01:06:30.974 --> 01:06:31.535
<v Speaker 0>trickery.

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:41.560
<v Speaker 0>And then the last thing I'll suggest is

01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:44.280
<v Speaker 0>there are other cube configs in that directory

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:47.240
<v Speaker 0>for the other controller managers, etcetera, that may

01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:48.974
<v Speaker 0>be able Yeah.

01:06:56.974 --> 01:06:58.095
<v Speaker 5>That would be

01:06:58.654 --> 01:06:59.295
<v Speaker 5>yeah.

01:06:59.535 --> 01:07:00.974
<v Speaker 5>It's true. We could try any one of

01:07:00.974 --> 01:07:01.214
<v Speaker 5>those.

01:07:05.570 --> 01:07:06.850
<v Speaker 5>I mean, if we wanna grab a new

01:07:06.850 --> 01:07:09.890
<v Speaker 5>kubectl binary, I have the command here. You

01:07:09.890 --> 01:07:12.130
<v Speaker 0>could also do apt get install dash dash

01:07:12.130 --> 01:07:13.010
<v Speaker 0>reinstall

01:07:13.170 --> 01:07:14.610
<v Speaker 0>kubectl if

01:07:14.610 --> 01:07:15.570
<v Speaker 0>you wanna refresh it.

01:07:21.525 --> 01:07:22.805
<v Speaker 6>It's like that one?

01:07:23.685 --> 01:07:25.205
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I don't know if it'll more of

01:07:25.205 --> 01:07:27.525
<v Speaker 0>it reinstalled flag beam before install, but give

01:07:27.525 --> 01:07:28.325
<v Speaker 0>it a shot.

01:07:29.365 --> 01:07:31.285
<v Speaker 6>K. I'll put that at the end.

01:07:33.730 --> 01:07:34.290
<v Speaker 6>Or

01:07:34.530 --> 01:07:36.050
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Take it there.

01:07:42.690 --> 01:07:43.330
<v Speaker 1>K.

01:07:46.370 --> 01:07:47.170
<v Speaker 6>Same error.

01:07:48.785 --> 01:07:50.385
<v Speaker 6>Alright. So it doesn't Should we try one

01:07:50.385 --> 01:07:51.745
<v Speaker 6>of those other KubeConfigs?

01:07:51.745 --> 01:07:52.225
<v Speaker 6>Or

01:07:52.545 --> 01:07:54.305
<v Speaker 4>What does k version show just to make

01:07:54.305 --> 01:07:56.705
<v Speaker 4>sure we're using one dot 23 dot four?

01:07:56.705 --> 01:07:58.305
<v Speaker 0>It's 23 dot three.

01:07:58.545 --> 01:07:59.985
<v Speaker 4>But something's a weird, but it should be

01:08:00.065 --> 01:08:03.505
<v Speaker 5>Oh, k k version dash dash

01:08:03.309 --> 01:08:05.069
<v Speaker 5>Is it that's just client only or that's

01:08:05.069 --> 01:08:06.350
<v Speaker 5>just client? Client

01:08:06.829 --> 01:08:07.150
<v Speaker 1>on

01:08:12.190 --> 01:08:14.109
<v Speaker 6>wow. It's not liking any of that.

01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:17.069
<v Speaker 5>It's not the real c t l binary.

01:08:18.435 --> 01:08:19.554
<v Speaker 5>There's no way.

01:08:20.194 --> 01:08:21.874
<v Speaker 6>Yeah. Something's weird here.

01:08:22.354 --> 01:08:24.194
<v Speaker 5>Beautiful. Just here.

01:08:24.994 --> 01:08:27.394
<v Speaker 6>Can I download that binary to Loco?

01:08:28.034 --> 01:08:30.755
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you could always just instead of using

01:08:30.755 --> 01:08:32.514
<v Speaker 0>alias and keep control, like, fully,

01:08:33.409 --> 01:08:36.290
<v Speaker 0>like, do slash then keep control and then

01:08:36.290 --> 01:08:37.249
<v Speaker 0>you're guaranteed.

01:08:38.529 --> 01:08:39.969
<v Speaker 0>Or you could do that. Try the one.

01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:41.249
<v Speaker 5>Try try

01:08:41.810 --> 01:08:43.330
<v Speaker 5>the one in that slash. Although that has

01:08:43.330 --> 01:08:44.369
<v Speaker 5>been really fast.

01:08:44.849 --> 01:08:46.929
<v Speaker 5>Try that slash q back tool. You need

01:08:46.929 --> 01:08:47.729
<v Speaker 0>to plus exit.

01:08:48.564 --> 01:08:49.444
<v Speaker 5>Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:03.840
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Different. We

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:07.120
<v Speaker 5>swapped the Yes. We we did that. Right?

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:08.719
<v Speaker 5>The key the key and the certificate. Yeah.

01:09:08.719 --> 01:09:10.239
<v Speaker 5>We need go swap those back or use

01:09:10.239 --> 01:09:12.800
<v Speaker 5>a different KubeCon thing. Alright. Should I move

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:14.880
<v Speaker 6>this file over to user

01:09:16.385 --> 01:09:18.305
<v Speaker 6>Yeah. Join? I don't think it's gonna make

01:09:18.305 --> 01:09:20.305
<v Speaker 0>a difference. I think what's in user Ben

01:09:20.305 --> 01:09:22.385
<v Speaker 0>is correct. I think you'll find there's something

01:09:22.385 --> 01:09:25.265
<v Speaker 0>in the bash profile possibly that is being

01:09:25.265 --> 01:09:28.145
<v Speaker 0>very sneaky here. But if you fully qualify,

01:09:28.065 --> 01:09:30.330
<v Speaker 0>could control all the time as slash user

01:09:30.330 --> 01:09:32.489
<v Speaker 0>slash bed slash control, you should be okay.

01:09:33.689 --> 01:09:36.170
<v Speaker 0>You can you can tell us to this

01:09:36.409 --> 01:09:38.409
<v Speaker 1>current one. Yeah. Maybe something in bash or

01:09:38.409 --> 01:09:40.250
<v Speaker 0>c or dot profile. It could be anywhere,

01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:40.889
<v Speaker 0>to be honest. Oh.

01:09:43.795 --> 01:09:45.554
<v Speaker 5>Mean, we've we've gotten around it. We don't

01:09:45.554 --> 01:09:47.394
<v Speaker 5>have to know what it is. Yeah. Exactly.

01:09:47.954 --> 01:09:49.874
<v Speaker 5>Gone out of this cluster and move on.

01:09:50.034 --> 01:09:50.914
<v Speaker 0>There you go.

01:09:51.715 --> 01:09:54.434
<v Speaker 0>It's the function. There it is. Yeah. Okay.

01:09:55.235 --> 01:09:56.755
<v Speaker 5>Oh. Oh, man.

01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:58.920
<v Speaker 1>That's

01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:01.080
<v Speaker 1>oh, man. That's so good. That is exactly

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:03.400
<v Speaker 5>what we did to Carta, isn't it? With

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:04.920
<v Speaker 5>a function instead of an alias so that

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:06.920
<v Speaker 5>they wouldn't be able to find it. That's

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:07.720
<v Speaker 1>so good.

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.880
<v Speaker 0>You need to do that. Sorry. Yeah. You're

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:12.200
<v Speaker 0>on it.

01:10:13.775 --> 01:10:14.574
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

01:10:16.735 --> 01:10:18.414
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't am I on it?

01:10:19.455 --> 01:10:21.375
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. The source I thought would have like,

01:10:21.375 --> 01:10:23.215
<v Speaker 0>you could do unset cube control.

01:10:23.695 --> 01:10:25.135
<v Speaker 5>Yeah. That would be good.

01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:30.340
<v Speaker 0>Okay. There we go. There we go. Okay.

01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:30.900
<v Speaker 6>Back to

01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:33.540
<v Speaker 6>wow. Man.

01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:35.380
<v Speaker 1>We're

01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:37.860
<v Speaker 1>We're out. Alright. So just swap these over.

01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:39.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:10:44.245 --> 01:10:46.405
<v Speaker 5>Think y'all counted on our memories being better

01:10:46.405 --> 01:10:47.284
<v Speaker 5>than they are.

01:10:48.005 --> 01:10:50.885
<v Speaker 6>Alright. Back to our regularly scheduled program.

01:10:51.525 --> 01:10:53.765
<v Speaker 5>Alright. Let's see what we got for pods

01:10:53.765 --> 01:10:56.409
<v Speaker 5>and deployments and such in this name space.

01:10:56.650 --> 01:10:58.490
<v Speaker 0>I love that they watched that episode. They

01:10:58.490 --> 01:11:00.170
<v Speaker 0>used that trick against you.

01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:01.849
<v Speaker 2>Oh, so good.

01:11:02.330 --> 01:11:04.010
<v Speaker 5>Apparently, I should've done the same.

01:11:04.730 --> 01:11:06.250
<v Speaker 6>Got one that's pending.

01:11:06.810 --> 01:11:07.290
<v Speaker 5>Alright.

01:11:08.425 --> 01:11:11.385
<v Speaker 6>Alright. Well, based on hint number two Oh,

01:11:13.545 --> 01:11:15.785
<v Speaker 1>yeah. You no taints. Right?

01:11:16.265 --> 01:11:17.625
<v Speaker 6>Tainted love.

01:11:18.825 --> 01:11:22.185
<v Speaker 6>I bet we're gonna see something around tolerations

01:11:22.530 --> 01:11:23.649
<v Speaker 6>or taints.

01:11:24.210 --> 01:11:25.729
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So

01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:28.690
<v Speaker 0>There's nothing embarrassing about knowing that soft sales

01:11:28.690 --> 01:11:30.210
<v Speaker 0>can take a good lump. I'm not I'm

01:11:30.210 --> 01:11:31.489
<v Speaker 0>just gonna throw that out. No. It's a

01:11:31.489 --> 01:11:32.130
<v Speaker 6>wonderful thing.

01:11:39.385 --> 01:11:40.505
<v Speaker 6>Let's see.

01:11:42.985 --> 01:11:44.105
<v Speaker 6>There we go.

01:11:46.585 --> 01:11:47.385
<v Speaker 0>What do you see?

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:50.280
<v Speaker 6>I see a taint here. Right? If you

01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:51.800
<v Speaker 0>can use the last pager, it just means

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:53.960
<v Speaker 0>the audience can follow along as well. Oh,

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:54.760
<v Speaker 6>sorry. Okay.

01:12:02.434 --> 01:12:03.954
<v Speaker 6>Are you all bits are you all able

01:12:03.954 --> 01:12:06.114
<v Speaker 6>to see that taint? Yep. Yeah. It's there's

01:12:06.114 --> 01:12:07.715
<v Speaker 4>a no no schedule taint.

01:12:07.795 --> 01:12:09.074
<v Speaker 5>Oh, alright. Yep.

01:12:10.675 --> 01:12:13.234
<v Speaker 6>Should I just delete that off those nodes?

01:12:13.795 --> 01:12:14.514
<v Speaker 5>Mhmm.

01:12:15.795 --> 01:12:16.275
<v Speaker 5>Yes.

01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:19.400
<v Speaker 6>K. Is that through edit, or is there

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:21.320
<v Speaker 6>another way to do that? There is a

01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:23.000
<v Speaker 0>nice sweep, but nobody remembers it. I would

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:23.559
<v Speaker 0>edit.

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:25.640
<v Speaker 0>I'm just speaking for a second. I'm just

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:27.560
<v Speaker 1>saying that. It's like, I I I know

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:29.000
<v Speaker 5>how to create one, but I don't remember

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.195
<v Speaker 5>how to remove one intentionally. It's it's the

01:12:31.195 --> 01:12:33.195
<v Speaker 0>same, but you put a dash on the

01:12:33.195 --> 01:12:34.715
<v Speaker 0>end of the tenth.

01:12:35.035 --> 01:12:38.155
<v Speaker 6>That's it. That's it. Definitely not gonna remember

01:12:38.155 --> 01:12:38.635
<v Speaker 5>that.

01:12:41.035 --> 01:12:41.675
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:12:42.315 --> 01:12:44.715
<v Speaker 0>I'm still relying on keep control edit these

01:12:44.715 --> 01:12:45.515
<v Speaker 0>days. It's unbelievable.

01:12:51.010 --> 01:12:53.409
<v Speaker 6>Okay. And then worker two.

01:13:00.975 --> 01:13:02.735
<v Speaker 5>Alright. That's good news. Running.

01:13:04.495 --> 01:13:07.535
<v Speaker 5>Let's edit the deployment to v two and

01:13:07.695 --> 01:13:09.775
<v Speaker 5>see what happens. I suppose we should look

01:13:09.775 --> 01:13:11.135
<v Speaker 5>and see if the app's even running on

01:13:11.135 --> 01:13:12.175
<v Speaker 5>v one. But

01:13:13.295 --> 01:13:14.495
<v Speaker 6>Yeah. Let's do that first.

01:13:15.829 --> 01:13:18.389
<v Speaker 6>Was that a curl command? Or Local host

01:13:18.389 --> 01:13:19.270
<v Speaker 5>30,000.

01:13:27.205 --> 01:13:29.445
<v Speaker 6>That's not fun. Yeah. That's not working.

01:13:35.045 --> 01:13:36.725
<v Speaker 5>Import 30,000.

01:13:36.725 --> 01:13:37.685
<v Speaker 5>Check the endpoints.

01:13:42.530 --> 01:13:43.810
<v Speaker 0>How much is that right?

01:13:44.210 --> 01:13:44.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.

01:13:56.455 --> 01:13:58.215
<v Speaker 1>Yep. That's the right pod

01:13:58.295 --> 01:13:59.574
<v Speaker 1>or that's the right

01:14:00.135 --> 01:14:02.855
<v Speaker 4>Is it the right port?

01:14:06.135 --> 01:14:07.655
<v Speaker 0>The port is correct. Yes.

01:14:08.055 --> 01:14:09.255
<v Speaker 1>Okay. K.

01:14:09.495 --> 01:14:10.855
<v Speaker 0>Cluster runs on eighty eighty.

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:12.440
<v Speaker 5>Okay.

01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:14.840
<v Speaker 5>Alright.

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:25.159
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna assume Daniel with his love for

01:14:25.159 --> 01:14:26.925
<v Speaker 0>the JVM has stuck it on a machine,

01:14:26.925 --> 01:14:28.525
<v Speaker 0>and now all networking is broke because the

01:14:28.525 --> 01:14:29.724
<v Speaker 0>JVM is stuck in all the

01:14:33.405 --> 01:14:35.084
<v Speaker 6>Should we look at hint three?

01:14:36.125 --> 01:14:38.124
<v Speaker 4>What did what did the curl sound there?

01:14:38.364 --> 01:14:39.804
<v Speaker 0>I don't think you need hint three.

01:14:40.639 --> 01:14:42.400
<v Speaker 0>In the return. Alright. But what's the symptom

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:44.079
<v Speaker 0>here? Right? You're you're trying to curl a

01:14:44.079 --> 01:14:45.440
<v Speaker 0>service. It doesn't work. So

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.039
<v Speaker 5>Right.

01:14:47.599 --> 01:14:49.599
<v Speaker 5>Let's check for network policies.

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:50.880
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Good shit.

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.000
<v Speaker 4>Do a

01:14:55.055 --> 01:14:56.175
<v Speaker 4>default log.

01:14:59.215 --> 01:15:01.535
<v Speaker 5>What can we do that as as the

01:15:01.535 --> 01:15:03.855
<v Speaker 5>animal? Twenty three hours old. I don't think

01:15:03.855 --> 01:15:05.055
<v Speaker 5>that exists normally.

01:15:05.295 --> 01:15:07.215
<v Speaker 0>I mean, the name would it looks legit.

01:15:07.215 --> 01:15:07.455
<v Speaker 0>Right?

01:15:08.110 --> 01:15:10.670
<v Speaker 5>The name looks legit, but I I don't

01:15:10.670 --> 01:15:12.190
<v Speaker 5>don't think you need that.

01:15:13.950 --> 01:15:14.910
<v Speaker 6>Let's see.

01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:18.030
<v Speaker 5>Policy rights egress.

01:15:18.030 --> 01:15:21.070
<v Speaker 5>No rule. Pod selector is nothing, though. But

01:15:21.070 --> 01:15:22.190
<v Speaker 6>that

01:15:22.215 --> 01:15:24.215
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't that select all pods, though, on a

01:15:24.215 --> 01:15:25.175
<v Speaker 5>network policy?

01:15:25.335 --> 01:15:27.575
<v Speaker 6>Yeah. It seems like that. I'll just delete

01:15:27.575 --> 01:15:28.135
<v Speaker 4>it.

01:15:28.775 --> 01:15:31.095
<v Speaker 4>Yep. The network policy. Yeah. Nothing good ever

01:15:31.095 --> 01:15:33.175
<v Speaker 0>came from leaving something lighter. I'd like that.

01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:41.820
<v Speaker 5>K. Let's try our curl again.

01:15:44.139 --> 01:15:44.699
<v Speaker 5>Hey.

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:49.739
<v Speaker 5>Yep. That's v one. Did we edit the

01:15:49.739 --> 01:15:51.099
<v Speaker 5>deployment already? I can't remember.

01:15:51.739 --> 01:15:52.380
<v Speaker 1>Not yet.

01:16:10.290 --> 01:16:11.490
<v Speaker 6>Like that one?

01:16:11.730 --> 01:16:12.210
<v Speaker 4>Yep.

01:16:18.585 --> 01:16:19.625
<v Speaker 4>Check curl.

01:16:23.625 --> 01:16:25.545
<v Speaker 5>The new one wasn't ready yet. I'm not

01:16:25.545 --> 01:16:25.705
<v Speaker 5>sure.

01:16:32.250 --> 01:16:34.570
<v Speaker 5>Do we do we get get network policies

01:16:34.570 --> 01:16:35.289
<v Speaker 5>again?

01:16:37.690 --> 01:16:38.969
<v Speaker 6>Wow. Came back.

01:16:40.090 --> 01:16:40.889
<v Speaker 6>Oh.

01:16:42.809 --> 01:16:44.730
<v Speaker 4>Okay. That's what

01:16:48.284 --> 01:16:48.685
<v Speaker 1>Is it

01:16:49.485 --> 01:16:51.405
<v Speaker 5>It would it would have a control plane

01:16:51.405 --> 01:16:53.005
<v Speaker 5>name if it was a static manifest. We

01:16:53.005 --> 01:16:54.445
<v Speaker 5>learned that while trying to break the other

01:16:54.445 --> 01:16:55.084
<v Speaker 5>cluster.

01:16:55.885 --> 01:16:58.685
<v Speaker 5>Let's do a get pos dash capital a

01:16:58.685 --> 01:17:01.059
<v Speaker 5>and see what else is running. It's probably

01:17:02.420 --> 01:17:04.180
<v Speaker 5>something recreating

01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:05.139
<v Speaker 5>it maybe.

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.900
<v Speaker 6>You're right. Unless it is a a static

01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:14.715
<v Speaker 6>pod or well, no. Let's Kube VIP. I

01:17:14.715 --> 01:17:16.875
<v Speaker 4>don't that doesn't look familiar. That's a bare

01:17:16.875 --> 01:17:19.435
<v Speaker 0>metal BGP broadcaster and load sponsor. You don't

01:17:19.435 --> 01:17:21.515
<v Speaker 0>need to worry about that. That's supposed to

01:17:21.515 --> 01:17:22.715
<v Speaker 0>be there. I mean, as to it as

01:17:22.715 --> 01:17:24.315
<v Speaker 0>a KubeFit. I don't I I right now,

01:17:24.315 --> 01:17:26.155
<v Speaker 0>I don't know. But Yeah. Yeah.

01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:32.460
<v Speaker 5>I can't remember if there was a Cilium

01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:33.340
<v Speaker 5>operator

01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:34.220
<v Speaker 5>or not.

01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:37.980
<v Speaker 0>There is that look I mean, besides the

01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:40.060
<v Speaker 0>twenty four hours ago restart on it, it

01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:42.675
<v Speaker 0>looks okay. It passes the eyeball test.

01:17:45.235 --> 01:17:46.594
<v Speaker 5>Controller managers.

01:17:48.035 --> 01:17:51.075
<v Speaker 5>Cube scheduler ambassador labs control Plane 1. That's

01:17:51.075 --> 01:17:53.235
<v Speaker 5>correct. I just remembered that the cluster is

01:17:53.235 --> 01:17:57.155
<v Speaker 5>called ambassador labs, not heroins because I was

01:17:58.370 --> 01:18:00.530
<v Speaker 5>Two core DNS pods,

01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:02.450
<v Speaker 5>cluster pod.

01:18:03.010 --> 01:18:04.850
<v Speaker 0>I mean, does the sneaky thing have to

01:18:04.850 --> 01:18:06.370
<v Speaker 0>be a container?

01:18:07.650 --> 01:18:09.970
<v Speaker 5>No. It could be a process system as

01:18:09.970 --> 01:18:11.784
<v Speaker 5>well. Yeah. Yeah.

01:18:13.224 --> 01:18:14.504
<v Speaker 4>Maybe edit

01:18:15.065 --> 01:18:16.425
<v Speaker 4>the cron job file?

01:18:16.744 --> 01:18:18.344
<v Speaker 5>It could be a cron job.

01:18:19.945 --> 01:18:21.945
<v Speaker 5>Yeah. Do it. Can repeat it again? Cron

01:18:21.945 --> 01:18:22.665
<v Speaker 5>jobs. Oh.

01:18:23.450 --> 01:18:24.330
<v Speaker 4>I mean,

01:18:25.050 --> 01:18:26.650
<v Speaker 0>like a Oh, on the system. On the

01:18:26.650 --> 01:18:28.250
<v Speaker 5>system. The system crontab. It could be a

01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:30.810
<v Speaker 5>system crontab. Yeah. Yeah. We spent so much

01:18:30.810 --> 01:18:33.050
<v Speaker 5>time in Kubernetes. We forgot how Linux works.

01:18:33.450 --> 01:18:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Crontab dash e, you think?

01:18:37.450 --> 01:18:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:18:40.815 --> 01:18:43.295
<v Speaker 6>Oh, there it is. Nice.

01:18:44.895 --> 01:18:45.855
<v Speaker 6>Nice.

01:18:46.095 --> 01:18:48.415
<v Speaker 6>Oh, and it's gonna automatically set that too.

01:18:48.415 --> 01:18:48.975
<v Speaker 6>Right?

01:18:49.775 --> 01:18:52.335
<v Speaker 5>Yeah. Both of those. Yeah. Yeah.

01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:55.780
<v Speaker 6>So just delete those? Yeah. Make those go

01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:56.420
<v Speaker 5>away.

01:18:56.660 --> 01:18:59.540
<v Speaker 5>And then Okay. Have to reload that. Right?

01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:03.060
<v Speaker 6>Edit the deployment. Right? Yeah.

01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:05.220
<v Speaker 5>Use just the cron tab anymore.

01:19:14.715 --> 01:19:16.155
<v Speaker 5>Okay. We don't have to be

01:19:23.210 --> 01:19:25.290
<v Speaker 6>My screen is not letting me see everything

01:19:25.290 --> 01:19:27.449
<v Speaker 6>very nicely. Okay. There we go.

01:19:28.570 --> 01:19:29.530
<v Speaker 6>And then

01:19:36.875 --> 01:19:37.835
<v Speaker 6>Okay.

01:19:40.395 --> 01:19:41.355
<v Speaker 6>And then

01:19:41.915 --> 01:19:42.795
<v Speaker 6>curl.

01:19:45.435 --> 01:19:47.034
<v Speaker 5>Still says we want

01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:55.750
<v Speaker 5>Oh, he's dancing now. That may be my

01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:57.910
<v Speaker 0>browser cache, which is always really bad for

01:19:57.910 --> 01:19:58.710
<v Speaker 0>this. So

01:19:59.190 --> 01:20:00.710
<v Speaker 0>is it v one or v

01:20:01.165 --> 01:20:03.084
<v Speaker 0>two, is it? One in the title.

01:20:05.085 --> 01:20:06.364
<v Speaker 0>Oh, that could be a bug too, to

01:20:06.364 --> 01:20:07.005
<v Speaker 0>be honest.

01:20:07.725 --> 01:20:09.645
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. Should we start loading it up in

01:20:09.645 --> 01:20:10.204
<v Speaker 0>the background?

01:20:10.925 --> 01:20:11.965
<v Speaker 5>How do we know?

01:20:12.685 --> 01:20:14.650
<v Speaker 0>I I I think it fixed it. I

01:20:14.650 --> 01:20:16.730
<v Speaker 0>mean, if you describe the pod and it

01:20:16.730 --> 01:20:18.410
<v Speaker 0>says v two and my browser says v

01:20:18.410 --> 01:20:20.090
<v Speaker 0>two, I'm happy that it's v two.

01:20:20.890 --> 01:20:23.210
<v Speaker 5>Dude, dude, just grab it, Will you? Please.

01:20:24.330 --> 01:20:25.050
<v Speaker 0>Maybe

01:20:25.210 --> 01:20:27.050
<v Speaker 0>I'll update the title for the next episode.

01:20:29.425 --> 01:20:31.105
<v Speaker 5>I kept wondering about that when I was

01:20:31.105 --> 01:20:32.625
<v Speaker 5>testing it. I was like, it still says

01:20:32.625 --> 01:20:33.905
<v Speaker 5>v two in the title. I just assumed

01:20:33.905 --> 01:20:35.265
<v Speaker 5>it was browser cache. Alright.

01:20:35.665 --> 01:20:38.065
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That says v two. Successfully build. I

01:20:38.065 --> 01:20:40.065
<v Speaker 0>think you have fixed that cluster, and you

01:20:40.065 --> 01:20:42.065
<v Speaker 0>had a whole nine minutes left to spare.

01:20:42.145 --> 01:20:42.705
<v Speaker 0>There you go.

01:20:44.239 --> 01:20:45.920
<v Speaker 5>That was fun. Awesome.

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:47.360
<v Speaker 5>That was very

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.880
<v Speaker 5>nice work. Ambassador folks. That was cool. That

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:52.800
<v Speaker 1>was great. Yeah. Some dark arts we don't

01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:55.280
<v Speaker 6>usually deal with. I mean, dropping down to

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:57.600
<v Speaker 0>content on the Linux host was pretty amusing.

01:20:59.345 --> 01:21:00.305
<v Speaker 5>Okay.

01:21:00.305 --> 01:21:00.705
<v Speaker 5>Alright.

01:21:01.825 --> 01:21:04.065
<v Speaker 0>Well well done. You smashed that. Like I

01:21:04.065 --> 01:21:06.065
<v Speaker 0>said, nine minutes left. That's that's rare on

01:21:06.065 --> 01:21:07.344
<v Speaker 0>custard. So well done.

01:21:07.825 --> 01:21:09.265
<v Speaker 0>Good team effort there.

01:21:09.745 --> 01:21:12.465
<v Speaker 0>So thank you for for joining me. And

01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:14.119
<v Speaker 0>I'm sure we'll have you back for a

01:21:14.119 --> 01:21:15.559
<v Speaker 0>third time in the future.

01:21:16.119 --> 01:21:17.800
<v Speaker 5>Awesome. Thanks for having us. Alright.

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:19.320
<v Speaker 0>Thank you all.

01:21:20.119 --> 01:21:23.159
<v Speaker 0>Alright. That was two great clusters, two great

01:21:23.159 --> 01:21:25.960
<v Speaker 0>teams, everything fixed. I mean, that's a pretty

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:27.400
<v Speaker 0>good episode of

01:21:27.875 --> 01:21:29.475
<v Speaker 0>Clustered. I'm really happy with that. And it

01:21:29.475 --> 01:21:31.235
<v Speaker 0>was fun. I was laughing all the way

01:21:31.235 --> 01:21:33.635
<v Speaker 0>through that. So thank you for joining us

01:21:33.635 --> 01:21:36.115
<v Speaker 0>and watching all your comments and the chat.

01:21:36.355 --> 01:21:37.875
<v Speaker 0>I just want to say thank you again

01:21:37.875 --> 01:21:40.115
<v Speaker 0>to Teleport. You've seen us use this tool

01:21:40.115 --> 01:21:42.195
<v Speaker 0>on this episode and every other episode. It's

01:21:42.195 --> 01:21:44.730
<v Speaker 0>just an amazing tool that I really genuinely

01:21:44.730 --> 01:21:47.210
<v Speaker 0>believe everybody should have installed on all of

01:21:47.210 --> 01:21:48.169
<v Speaker 0>their environments.

01:21:48.329 --> 01:21:50.090
<v Speaker 0>So you can support the show by checking

01:21:50.090 --> 01:21:53.050
<v Speaker 0>out rockode.liveteleport.

01:21:53.050 --> 01:21:54.809
<v Speaker 0>And also thank you to Equinix Metal for

01:21:54.809 --> 01:21:56.809
<v Speaker 0>providing all the bare metal machines that we

01:21:56.809 --> 01:21:59.184
<v Speaker 0>use for this. We will be back

01:21:59.745 --> 01:22:00.465
<v Speaker 0>tomorrow.

01:22:00.945 --> 01:22:03.505
<v Speaker 0>We had to reschedule last week's episode because

01:22:03.505 --> 01:22:05.425
<v Speaker 0>everyone had more important things to be doing,

01:22:05.425 --> 01:22:07.425
<v Speaker 0>but we will have another episode tomorrow

01:22:07.825 --> 01:22:10.545
<v Speaker 0>where we will be joined by Adrien and

01:22:10.545 --> 01:22:13.220
<v Speaker 0>William from the Discord community. So we will

01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:15.140
<v Speaker 0>see you all then. Have a wonderful day

01:22:15.140 --> 01:22:17.860
<v Speaker 0>everyone, and I will see you all soon.

01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:18.660
<v Speaker 0>Thank you very much.
