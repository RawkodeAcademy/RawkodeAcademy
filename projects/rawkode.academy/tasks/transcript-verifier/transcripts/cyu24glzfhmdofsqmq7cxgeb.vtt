<v Speaker 3>Cool.

00:00:55.164 --> 00:00:58.524

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.460
<v Speaker 0>Oh, great.

<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.340
<v Speaker 0>Let me take a look at that. I

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.860
<v Speaker 0>thought that, Paul, your video is off. I

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.460
<v Speaker 0>don't know if that's intentional or not.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.500
<v Speaker 3>He's taken off the pizza.

00:01:15.015 --> 00:01:16.135
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well,

00:01:16.455 --> 00:01:18.375
<v Speaker 0>so this is supposed to be our

00:01:18.935 --> 00:01:21.175
<v Speaker 0>pop those podcast segment. You've already told us

00:01:21.175 --> 00:01:23.095
<v Speaker 0>how you got into tech. So I'm gonna

00:01:23.095 --> 00:01:24.855
<v Speaker 0>throw a few more questions at you. We'll

00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:26.215
<v Speaker 0>keep this late and have a bit of

00:01:26.215 --> 00:01:27.655
<v Speaker 0>fun and then we'll all

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.070
<v Speaker 0>oh, yeah. We've gotta substitute

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.950
<v Speaker 0>Paul.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.390
<v Speaker 0>So if

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 0>you could pick anyone, living or dead, to

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.270
<v Speaker 0>join on the podcast, who would that be?

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.590
<v Speaker 3>That's an awesome question.

00:01:40.165 --> 00:01:40.965
<v Speaker 3>Wow.

00:01:42.565 --> 00:01:45.445
<v Speaker 3>Tesla, probably. Like, Nikolai Tesla, you know, and

00:01:45.445 --> 00:01:46.405
<v Speaker 3>just because

00:01:46.645 --> 00:01:48.725
<v Speaker 3>I think you know, I watched a documentary

00:01:48.725 --> 00:01:50.565
<v Speaker 3>recently with him at the Ethan Hawke, I

00:01:50.565 --> 00:01:51.685
<v Speaker 3>think. And and

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.060
<v Speaker 3>I just think

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.100
<v Speaker 3>he had an alternate way of, you know,

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.820
<v Speaker 3>obviously,

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.140
<v Speaker 3>you know, of thinking.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.659
<v Speaker 3>And I just I I I'm all about

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.020
<v Speaker 3>that. And I think there was a there's

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.780
<v Speaker 3>that movie I think was, like, Prestige or

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.485
<v Speaker 3>something. And I I was like, it's just

00:02:07.645 --> 00:02:09.485
<v Speaker 3>they made they made this, like, myth myth

00:02:09.485 --> 00:02:11.725
<v Speaker 3>about him well, but that would be one

00:02:11.725 --> 00:02:14.925
<v Speaker 3>of them. Benjamin Franklin, another one.

00:02:16.045 --> 00:02:18.605
<v Speaker 3>Long Shanks from from Braveheart.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.540
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem with Scotland. It's full of

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.260
<v Speaker 3>Scots.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.060
<v Speaker 1>There you go.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.300
<v Speaker 3>Said keep it light, brother.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm I'm I'm actually gonna ask you a

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:33.620
<v Speaker 1>serious question,

00:02:34.155 --> 00:02:35.835
<v Speaker 1>kinda go through something. So,

00:02:36.075 --> 00:02:37.515
<v Speaker 1>you you know, and I kinda prepped you

00:02:37.515 --> 00:02:39.594
<v Speaker 1>for this the other day. You know, as

00:02:39.594 --> 00:02:40.474
<v Speaker 1>as

00:02:40.474 --> 00:02:42.314
<v Speaker 1>long as I've known you, you've always had

00:02:42.314 --> 00:02:43.195
<v Speaker 1>this sort of,

00:02:43.594 --> 00:02:45.594
<v Speaker 1>like, this mentor mentality.

00:02:45.594 --> 00:02:46.954
<v Speaker 1>You know, you've always

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.970
<v Speaker 1>offered help and things like that. But in

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.010
<v Speaker 1>02/2019,

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.850
<v Speaker 1>you know, something happened to you, and you

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.730
<v Speaker 1>made this very these very positive changes in

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:56.530
<v Speaker 1>your life.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.850
<v Speaker 1>You know? Can you just talk about that

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:59.650
<v Speaker 1>for a minute?

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:01.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

00:03:02.605 --> 00:03:04.765
<v Speaker 3>I've struggled. I just like we all struggle,

00:03:04.765 --> 00:03:06.445
<v Speaker 3>you know, struggle with your weight, you struggle

00:03:06.445 --> 00:03:07.325
<v Speaker 3>with health.

00:03:07.885 --> 00:03:08.445
<v Speaker 3>And,

00:03:09.485 --> 00:03:10.685
<v Speaker 3>obviously, by the fact that I ate a

00:03:10.685 --> 00:03:13.085
<v Speaker 3>whole fucking medium pizza, I really probably shouldn't

00:03:13.085 --> 00:03:13.645
<v Speaker 3>have

00:03:13.965 --> 00:03:15.565
<v Speaker 3>I really give a shit about my health.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.210
<v Speaker 3>All this aside, normally, you know, I'm very,

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.650
<v Speaker 3>very clean. But, like, I went to my

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.450
<v Speaker 3>doctor, and the doctor's like, you probably will

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.370
<v Speaker 3>die. Your blood pressure right now is a

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 3>75

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.210
<v Speaker 3>or, like, one thirty

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:29.650
<v Speaker 3>or so. It was one twenty. It was

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.370
<v Speaker 3>pretty, like, high.

00:03:31.325 --> 00:03:33.725
<v Speaker 3>And he was like, you needed to you

00:03:33.725 --> 00:03:35.485
<v Speaker 3>need to do some lifestyle changes. And so

00:03:35.485 --> 00:03:37.485
<v Speaker 3>that point, I was, you know, probably almost

00:03:37.485 --> 00:03:38.845
<v Speaker 3>a hundred pounds overweight.

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:39.805
<v Speaker 3>And,

00:03:40.285 --> 00:03:42.285
<v Speaker 3>it's a struggle every day, you know, all

00:03:42.285 --> 00:03:43.885
<v Speaker 3>of us. Right? It's like, especially, you know,

00:03:43.885 --> 00:03:46.070
<v Speaker 3>this this pant panty we're we're in right

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.750
<v Speaker 3>now, it's hard to do that. But I've

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.510
<v Speaker 3>just focused, and I think all aspects of

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.830
<v Speaker 3>my life has gotten better by having this

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.710
<v Speaker 3>repetition by you know, regardless of eating this

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.390
<v Speaker 3>whole pizza, I'm going to the gym tonight.

00:03:56.625 --> 00:03:58.625
<v Speaker 3>I'm religious about that. I go twice a

00:03:58.625 --> 00:04:01.265
<v Speaker 3>day sometimes, like this, you know, whatever, but

00:04:01.265 --> 00:04:03.665
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy it. But it's also helped my

00:04:04.865 --> 00:04:06.545
<v Speaker 3>the way that I approach my show. I

00:04:06.545 --> 00:04:07.985
<v Speaker 3>almost see it as, like, reps. You know

00:04:07.985 --> 00:04:09.105
<v Speaker 3>what I mean? Like, if I do this

00:04:09.105 --> 00:04:10.145
<v Speaker 3>and then, you know, it's like I have

00:04:10.145 --> 00:04:12.145
<v Speaker 3>this methodical way. Like, every single

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.160
<v Speaker 3>Friday, I'll do my primary cut of of

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.720
<v Speaker 3>the show. And then Saturday, I'll do, like,

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.000
<v Speaker 3>the, you know, the more of the stuff

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.920
<v Speaker 3>and and and all of that. So it's

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.360
<v Speaker 3>helped me in all aspects of my life.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.600
<v Speaker 3>But, I mean, pretty much, I had an

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.440
<v Speaker 3>awful year, just an awful year,

00:04:27.514 --> 00:04:29.115
<v Speaker 3>You know? And then I decided to make

00:04:29.115 --> 00:04:30.315
<v Speaker 3>those lifestyle changes.

00:04:30.635 --> 00:04:31.995
<v Speaker 1>Dude, because I'm gonna be honest with you.

00:04:31.995 --> 00:04:33.835
<v Speaker 1>You know? It's black and white. Right? Like,

00:04:33.915 --> 00:04:35.995
<v Speaker 1>you you know? I mean and and and

00:04:35.995 --> 00:04:37.755
<v Speaker 1>all of it's been for the better. Right?

00:04:37.755 --> 00:04:40.395
<v Speaker 1>Like, in, you know, I I I I

00:04:40.555 --> 00:04:43.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah. I mean, don't wanna sound macabre or

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.890
<v Speaker 1>anything like that, but, you know,

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.890
<v Speaker 1>I can't see

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.010
<v Speaker 1>you you like, I can't imagine you being

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.010
<v Speaker 1>where you are today without having made those

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.490
<v Speaker 1>changes because, I mean, it's really been just

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.050
<v Speaker 1>like

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.265
<v Speaker 1>like this spurt of growth just as you

00:04:58.265 --> 00:05:00.265
<v Speaker 1>know, personally and professionally,

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:02.745
<v Speaker 1>like, it's it's been amazing. So kudos to

00:05:02.745 --> 00:05:05.625
<v Speaker 1>you. I think you get back the confidence.

00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:06.745
<v Speaker 3>Right? And so

00:05:07.145 --> 00:05:08.265
<v Speaker 3>see you later, Marky.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.080
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the other thing is I

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.840
<v Speaker 3>just you know, I feel that if I

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.680
<v Speaker 3>put my mind to it, I can accomplish

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.080
<v Speaker 3>anything. And it's not me being, like, conceded

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.000
<v Speaker 3>or anything like that. It's just, you know,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.120
<v Speaker 3>you have to have that mindset. And I'm

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.280
<v Speaker 3>hoping I wanna inspire other people. I wanna

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.415
<v Speaker 3>help help everybody. You think I don't? I

00:05:24.415 --> 00:05:26.655
<v Speaker 3>spend my my off hours, you know, doing

00:05:26.655 --> 00:05:28.415
<v Speaker 3>stuff for the community, and it's not like

00:05:28.415 --> 00:05:29.935
<v Speaker 3>I wanna hand out or anything. I just

00:05:29.935 --> 00:05:31.855
<v Speaker 3>wanna help people. That's I have no pardon

00:05:31.855 --> 00:05:34.095
<v Speaker 3>me. I don't have an ulterior motive at

00:05:34.095 --> 00:05:36.735
<v Speaker 3>all. Yeah. So Yeah. No. That's good. And

00:05:36.735 --> 00:05:38.240
<v Speaker 1>that that kinda leads us to this next

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.680
<v Speaker 1>question. So you do all these things for

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.400
<v Speaker 1>the community.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.640
<v Speaker 1>You know, you you do all these things

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.720
<v Speaker 1>for community. I don't do enough. Oh, man.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.000
<v Speaker 1>And I'm telling no. I'm dead serious. I

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.520
<v Speaker 3>wanna do more. Like, this is the year

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna double down. So Well well, I

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.960
<v Speaker 1>mean, I

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.680
<v Speaker 1>I

00:05:52.345 --> 00:05:54.425
<v Speaker 1>we we can't wait to see it. Right?

00:05:54.425 --> 00:05:55.065
<v Speaker 1>Like

<v Speaker 1>but what do you do to what do

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:58.105
<v Speaker 1>you do in your downtime? What do do

00:05:58.105 --> 00:05:59.465
<v Speaker 1>to unwind? And I'm not I'm not talking

00:05:59.465 --> 00:06:01.305
<v Speaker 1>about the gym, like, because, you know, even

00:06:01.305 --> 00:06:02.345
<v Speaker 1>I look at that as, like, a big

00:06:02.345 --> 00:06:03.785
<v Speaker 1>stress reliever, but, you know,

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.210
<v Speaker 1>what do you do to relax?

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.450

<v Speaker 3>I I have two kids. I have a

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:12.770
<v Speaker 3>son, and I have a daughter and a

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.530
<v Speaker 3>son, and and they take a lot of

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.690
<v Speaker 3>my time. And it's, you know, it's fun

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.324
<v Speaker 3>just, you know, obviously,

00:06:18.405 --> 00:06:21.365
<v Speaker 3>helping them grow and helping them kinda see

00:06:21.365 --> 00:06:22.005
<v Speaker 3>the world.

00:06:24.004 --> 00:06:26.085
<v Speaker 3>I love music. Right? So, like, you know,

00:06:26.085 --> 00:06:28.164
<v Speaker 3>obviously, by the guitars and stuff like that,

00:06:28.164 --> 00:06:28.724
<v Speaker 3>I like to play.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.900
<v Speaker 3>But, like, I also enjoy like, I miss

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.380
<v Speaker 3>and this is something, like, you know, recently,

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.540
<v Speaker 3>like, Brandon and Augustus came to

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.380
<v Speaker 3>to the Long Island, and we had dinner

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.700
<v Speaker 3>together. I love having meals with people and

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.420
<v Speaker 3>just enjoying, like, just having conversations. I'm hoping

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.134
<v Speaker 3>that I get to visit all of you

00:06:46.134 --> 00:06:48.215
<v Speaker 3>and and do that at some point. That

00:06:48.215 --> 00:06:49.415
<v Speaker 3>was my plan for

00:06:49.655 --> 00:06:51.255
<v Speaker 3>I had this idea for the for a

00:06:51.255 --> 00:06:53.495
<v Speaker 3>podcast. It was originally gonna be the dinner

00:06:53.495 --> 00:06:54.455
<v Speaker 3>with DevOps.

00:06:54.535 --> 00:06:56.134
<v Speaker 3>So remember that show that was like and

00:06:56.134 --> 00:06:58.100
<v Speaker 3>I wanna do that for the season. It

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.780
<v Speaker 3>was that show, like, dinner for five, and

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.700
<v Speaker 3>they had, like, people around the table, and

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.100
<v Speaker 3>they would talk about movies and and and

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.700
<v Speaker 3>and talk about the movies they were in.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.139
<v Speaker 3>There were actors and stuff. I wanna do

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:09.860
<v Speaker 3>that same thing. A round table, different people,

00:07:10.525 --> 00:07:12.205
<v Speaker 3>just like you would at any conference. You

00:07:12.205 --> 00:07:13.645
<v Speaker 3>sit there and you start talking to each

00:07:13.645 --> 00:07:15.565
<v Speaker 3>other about just the cool concepts that you

00:07:15.565 --> 00:07:17.724
<v Speaker 3>worked on. Oh, and then and then meet

00:07:17.724 --> 00:07:19.724
<v Speaker 3>people and stuff like that. Like, when we

00:07:19.724 --> 00:07:20.285
<v Speaker 3>had

00:07:20.525 --> 00:07:21.885
<v Speaker 3>the Kubernetes

00:07:22.205 --> 00:07:23.884
<v Speaker 3>New York meetup, shout out to you, Ariel

00:07:23.884 --> 00:07:24.365
<v Speaker 3>and Paul,

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.250
<v Speaker 3>We used to go to dinner after the

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:27.970
<v Speaker 3>meetups

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.690
<v Speaker 3>and, you know, grab some, you know, some

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.890
<v Speaker 3>appetizers and BS. And you'd have, like, Paul

<v Speaker 3>you know, people coming in from town, like

00:07:36.705 --> 00:07:38.705
<v Speaker 3>Joe Duffy from Pulumi would come and we,

00:07:38.705 --> 00:07:40.064
<v Speaker 3>you know, we'd I I get to meet

00:07:40.064 --> 00:07:42.705
<v Speaker 3>him or, you know, folks from, like, you

00:07:42.705 --> 00:07:44.865
<v Speaker 3>know, the the end user community. It's the

00:07:44.865 --> 00:07:46.465
<v Speaker 3>greatest thing in the world. I just that's

00:07:46.465 --> 00:07:48.305
<v Speaker 3>the sole again, to answer your question, like,

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.120
<v Speaker 3>I love having meals with people, having great

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.360
<v Speaker 3>wine, having a great, you know, cocktail, and

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.600
<v Speaker 3>just BS ing. That's like I love that.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.320
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:07:59.840
<v Speaker 0>So we said

00:08:00.825 --> 00:08:02.185
<v Speaker 0>sorry. You go, Paul.

00:08:02.585 --> 00:08:03.385
<v Speaker 2>Alright.

00:08:03.625 --> 00:08:06.105
<v Speaker 2>So we have spoken a lot about pineapple

00:08:06.105 --> 00:08:07.145
<v Speaker 2>pizza.

00:08:08.185 --> 00:08:11.145
<v Speaker 2>I never got out of you, Pop.

00:08:11.945 --> 00:08:13.465
<v Speaker 2>What do you like on your pizza?

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.640
<v Speaker 3>Okay. So

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.520
<v Speaker 3>my so I don't know. This is something

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we no people know. Maybe

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.560
<v Speaker 3>I said this before. My father used to

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.440
<v Speaker 3>own about 20 like, 15 pizzerias in Upstate

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.625
<v Speaker 3>New York. So, like, I grew up in

00:08:27.625 --> 00:08:28.345
<v Speaker 3>this business.

00:08:28.985 --> 00:08:29.385
<v Speaker 3>And,

00:08:30.265 --> 00:08:31.785
<v Speaker 3>and, you know, no offense to anybody owned

00:08:31.785 --> 00:08:33.625
<v Speaker 3>restaurants. It's the hardest business in the world,

00:08:33.625 --> 00:08:35.545
<v Speaker 3>without a doubt. It's super, super hard. I

00:08:35.545 --> 00:08:37.545
<v Speaker 3>mean, you know, Cody's brother owns a bar

00:08:37.625 --> 00:08:40.345
<v Speaker 3>amazing barbecue restaurant. Go check them out. And,

00:08:41.065 --> 00:08:42.659
<v Speaker 3>and so, you know,

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.540
<v Speaker 3>on terms of on my pizza,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.420
<v Speaker 3>I like just a plain pizza. And if

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm, you know, going crazy, I'll do, like,

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.180
<v Speaker 3>a, like, a buffalo chicken slice or something,

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.420
<v Speaker 3>but it's typically just a plain slice. You

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.180
<v Speaker 3>can judge a pizza by its slice, I

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.435
<v Speaker 3>think. Like, you know, my favorite in in

00:08:58.435 --> 00:09:00.755
<v Speaker 3>the city, for instance, is Joe's. Joe's,

00:09:00.995 --> 00:09:02.355
<v Speaker 3>you know, Joe's is a great place and

00:09:02.355 --> 00:09:04.035
<v Speaker 3>then John's on Bleecker for a full full

00:09:04.035 --> 00:09:04.835
<v Speaker 3>pie.

00:09:06.435 --> 00:09:09.075
<v Speaker 2>So you like a good Kevin McAllister slice,

00:09:09.075 --> 00:09:10.035
<v Speaker 2>plain cheese?

00:09:10.515 --> 00:09:11.475
<v Speaker 3>Plain exactly.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:12.960
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.800
<v Speaker 2>Nice. A purest.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.960
<v Speaker 2>A pizza purest named Pop.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.120
<v Speaker 3>Well, there's a there's a

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.000
<v Speaker 3>there's that marriage

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.320
<v Speaker 3>of sauce to cheese ratio with a good

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.595
<v Speaker 3>crust. Right? That to me is is like

00:09:26.595 --> 00:09:28.835
<v Speaker 3>you you can't f that up. You know,

00:09:28.835 --> 00:09:30.595
<v Speaker 3>you can't you can't put hag haggis on

00:09:30.595 --> 00:09:32.355
<v Speaker 3>that shit and expect it to be good.

00:09:32.755 --> 00:09:36.115
<v Speaker 3>What's

00:09:36.115 --> 00:09:36.835
<v Speaker 3>that, boss?

00:09:37.315 --> 00:09:39.395
<v Speaker 2>You're the Pythagoras of pizza.

00:09:39.955 --> 00:09:40.515
<v Speaker 3>Pretty much.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:44.770
<v Speaker 3>A squared, b squared, c squared. No? What?

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.690
<v Speaker 3>No? Did I get wrong? My dad, but

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:47.650
<v Speaker 2>with pizza.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:51.810
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So we we said earlier we had

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.170
<v Speaker 0>a few videos for you, and I managed

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:54.450
<v Speaker 0>to get a few of them onto this

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:56.335
<v Speaker 0>platform that we're using now. So I'm gonna

00:09:56.335 --> 00:09:57.775
<v Speaker 0>take a quick break and play one of

00:09:57.775 --> 00:09:59.295
<v Speaker 0>these videos, and then we're gonna come back

00:09:59.295 --> 00:10:01.535
<v Speaker 0>with a few more questions. So strap yourself

00:10:01.535 --> 00:10:02.255
<v Speaker 0>in me.

00:10:02.895 --> 00:10:05.375
<v Speaker 0>And because Marky said goodbye in the chat

00:10:05.375 --> 00:10:06.895
<v Speaker 0>there, I'm gonna start off with his video.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.020
<v Speaker 4>I've been friends with Pop for quite a

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.820
<v Speaker 4>long time, and his friendship

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.300
<v Speaker 4>has meant the world to me.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.620
<v Speaker 4>Being on his show was kind of a

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.020
<v Speaker 4>long time in the making. We planned that

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.180
<v Speaker 4>out for a very, very long time.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.315
<v Speaker 4>And the things that he's done for the

00:10:26.315 --> 00:10:27.195
<v Speaker 4>community

00:10:27.755 --> 00:10:28.395
<v Speaker 4>and

00:10:28.715 --> 00:10:32.075
<v Speaker 4>the the just his selflessness to bring everybody

00:10:32.075 --> 00:10:33.915
<v Speaker 4>together to uplift

00:10:34.075 --> 00:10:37.439
<v Speaker 4>people and give them them hope. I'm just

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm so proud of I'm so proud of

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.480
<v Speaker 4>the POPCAST.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm so proud of POP. I really, really

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.040
<v Speaker 4>wish you didn't have to eat pineapple on

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.040
<v Speaker 4>pizza because it's a sin.

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:49.279
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna go ahead and forgive you,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.615

<v Speaker 4>and for all of those people that wanted

00:11:01.334 --> 00:11:03.654
<v Speaker 4>to see you eat this pineapple

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.880

<v Speaker 4>I I don't know what's wrong with you

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:09.440
<v Speaker 4>people.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.440

<v Speaker 3>him to death.

00:11:19.295 --> 00:11:20.335
<v Speaker 2>What a guy. Alright.

00:11:22.895 --> 00:11:24.655
<v Speaker 0>Let's get another question and then we'll pop

00:11:24.655 --> 00:11:26.815
<v Speaker 0>over in one of these other videos. So

00:11:26.815 --> 00:11:29.215
<v Speaker 0>another question on for a regular question I

00:11:29.215 --> 00:11:31.295
<v Speaker 0>feel from the podcast is the crystal ball.

00:11:32.175 --> 00:11:33.695
<v Speaker 0>We're we're gonna give you

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:35.950
<v Speaker 0>you don't know your own

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:38.590
<v Speaker 3>No. No. I I I couldn't understand you're

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:39.950
<v Speaker 3>speaking speaking Scottish.

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:44.910
<v Speaker 0>Crystal ball? Let me get my good English

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:47.230
<v Speaker 0>voice. The crystal ball question.

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:47.950
<v Speaker 0>So

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.055
<v Speaker 0>tell us what's gonna happen in the future.

00:11:51.055 --> 00:11:53.135
<v Speaker 0>We're gonna start off with CICD.

00:11:53.615 --> 00:11:54.655
<v Speaker 0>What comes next?

00:11:55.375 --> 00:11:57.695
<v Speaker 3>Oh, technology wise? Yeah.

00:11:58.655 --> 00:11:59.375
<v Speaker 3>Oh.

00:12:00.815 --> 00:12:00.975
<v Speaker 3>Or

00:12:02.015 --> 00:12:03.340
<v Speaker 0>I No. Go for it. I mean, technology

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.580
<v Speaker 0>wise, it could just be discipline wise. It

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.820
<v Speaker 0>could be whatever. Like, when I say CICD,

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:09.100
<v Speaker 0>what do think is coming next?

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.980
<v Speaker 3>I think, obviously, I I because, you know,

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.315
<v Speaker 3>my my forte is security. Right? So it's

00:12:16.315 --> 00:12:18.394
<v Speaker 3>like, I think pipeline security, you know, is

00:12:18.394 --> 00:12:20.555
<v Speaker 3>is is key. I think,

00:12:22.235 --> 00:12:25.595
<v Speaker 3>also integrating, like, security in pipelines, I think,

00:12:25.595 --> 00:12:28.714
<v Speaker 3>is is huge. I think also just abstracting

00:12:28.714 --> 00:12:29.115
<v Speaker 3>away,

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.990
<v Speaker 3>making Kubernetes less operational, more app application, I

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:37.070
<v Speaker 3>think, is is what I'd like to see

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:37.710
<v Speaker 3>as well.

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.510
<v Speaker 3>Obviously, I have to, with Paul here, talk

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.589
<v Speaker 3>more about, like, serverless stuff, and I'd like

00:12:42.589 --> 00:12:44.110
<v Speaker 3>to see more of that fun happening.

00:12:45.605 --> 00:12:46.965
<v Speaker 3>And, you know, and I think, you know,

00:12:46.965 --> 00:12:48.405
<v Speaker 3>I've tracked in that way. But I and

00:12:48.405 --> 00:12:50.245
<v Speaker 3>I see a future again where

00:12:50.725 --> 00:12:53.125
<v Speaker 3>people aren't just limited to vulnerability scanning for

00:12:53.125 --> 00:12:55.285
<v Speaker 3>pipelines. They're looking at it runtime, and I'm

00:12:55.365 --> 00:12:57.365
<v Speaker 3>you know, I'll I'll tout Falco because I

00:12:57.365 --> 00:12:59.380
<v Speaker 3>love Falco. That's why I'm I'm I'm over

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.220
<v Speaker 3>there because I think Falco's a fantastic thing.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.740
<v Speaker 3>So in my crystal ball, I would say

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.980
<v Speaker 3>that I like to see more collaboration. I

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.380
<v Speaker 3>like to see more, like, open source do

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.260
<v Speaker 3>I think more people more enterprises should adopt

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.740
<v Speaker 3>open source because they're stupid if they don't

00:13:12.995 --> 00:13:15.795
<v Speaker 3>because it's it's a great way to, you

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:17.714
<v Speaker 3>know, adopt amazing technologies.

00:13:17.875 --> 00:13:20.514
<v Speaker 3>And lastly, I'll say, you know, again, throw

00:13:20.514 --> 00:13:22.915
<v Speaker 3>some, some love to you all. Like, you

00:13:22.915 --> 00:13:24.834
<v Speaker 3>know, in terms of, you know, bare metal

00:13:24.834 --> 00:13:27.149
<v Speaker 3>deployments, without a doubt, it's awesome to see

00:13:27.149 --> 00:13:28.589
<v Speaker 3>see some of that stuff and as well

00:13:28.589 --> 00:13:31.069
<v Speaker 3>as, like, you know, tuning for configuration

00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:32.269
<v Speaker 3>through machine learning.

00:13:32.589 --> 00:13:34.110
<v Speaker 3>Like, to me, that when I saw I

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:35.870
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't bullshitting when I had, you know,

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:38.350
<v Speaker 3>Ofer on the podcast talking about that that

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:42.005
<v Speaker 3>from what StormForge is doing. It's phenomenal. Like,

00:13:42.005 --> 00:13:44.005
<v Speaker 3>you can use this, like, every single day.

00:13:44.005 --> 00:13:45.525
<v Speaker 3>It's like, oh, I have you know, I

00:13:45.525 --> 00:13:46.885
<v Speaker 3>wanna be able to, like, tweak this. If

00:13:46.885 --> 00:13:48.165
<v Speaker 3>you can do do tweak this from a

00:13:48.165 --> 00:13:51.685
<v Speaker 3>machine learning perspective, your configurations from Kubernetes perspective,

00:13:51.845 --> 00:13:54.085
<v Speaker 3>that's the magic. Like, everybody always wants to

00:13:54.085 --> 00:13:55.045
<v Speaker 3>do that. What are you gonna do with

00:13:55.045 --> 00:13:56.949
<v Speaker 3>metrics? You use metrics to be able to

00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:57.589
<v Speaker 3>drive,

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:59.750
<v Speaker 3>you know, configuration changes and all this stuff.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.190
<v Speaker 3>If you can do that in real time,

00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:03.589
<v Speaker 3>like, Cody, man, that's that's that's a great

00:14:03.589 --> 00:14:04.870
<v Speaker 3>place to be. So

00:14:07.695 --> 00:14:09.695
<v Speaker 0>Nice. So we got two more crystal ball

00:14:09.695 --> 00:14:11.695
<v Speaker 0>terms for you. Open source.

00:14:12.575 --> 00:14:14.655
<v Speaker 3>I think I answered the open source question.

00:14:14.655 --> 00:14:17.135
<v Speaker 0>We kinda laid onto open source after CICD,

00:14:17.135 --> 00:14:19.055
<v Speaker 0>but Yeah. Alright. Last one, podcast.

<v Speaker 3>I got the guy from that created Plex.

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:16.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you all use Plex.

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:18.290
<v Speaker 3>It was a dream of mine. Like, all

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:20.769
<v Speaker 3>of this stuff is all running Plex, and

00:15:20.769 --> 00:15:22.690
<v Speaker 3>that's how I learned microservices.

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:25.570
<v Speaker 3>And so I was literally, like, gobsmacked talking

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:27.345
<v Speaker 3>to this guy the whole time. So that

00:15:27.345 --> 00:15:30.145
<v Speaker 3>was phenomenal. I had, Phil Estes is on

00:15:30.145 --> 00:15:31.985

<v Speaker 3>the whole thing is not just bigger and

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.120
<v Speaker 3>better in the fact that, like,

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.565
<v Speaker 3>you know, I want to do more for

00:15:56.565 --> 00:15:58.725
<v Speaker 3>the community. We're gonna donate more money. We're

00:15:58.725 --> 00:16:00.165
<v Speaker 3>gonna do that. I mean, again, last year,

00:16:00.165 --> 00:16:01.845
<v Speaker 3>we donated $5,000

00:16:01.845 --> 00:16:04.885
<v Speaker 3>to Code twenty forty, American Cancer Society,

00:16:05.365 --> 00:16:07.204
<v Speaker 3>you know, also to the Dan Cohen Tribute

00:16:07.204 --> 00:16:08.805
<v Speaker 3>Fund. We've done, you know, we've done that,

00:16:08.805 --> 00:16:11.080
<v Speaker 3>and it's all based on the community enjoying

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.560
<v Speaker 3>the show. I I fucking love that.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:16.920
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.680
<v Speaker 2>Do you see a

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.680
<v Speaker 2>pizza related sponsor?

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.120
<v Speaker 3>No.

00:16:24.135 --> 00:16:26.695
<v Speaker 3>I don't. Well, Papa John's is definitely out

00:16:26.695 --> 00:16:28.455
<v Speaker 3>after that experience.

00:16:30.535 --> 00:16:32.775
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's throw in another video, and then

00:16:32.775 --> 00:16:34.375
<v Speaker 0>we'll get you another question.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:38.570
<v Speaker 5>Hello. I'm Paul from Popcast

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:40.250
<v Speaker 5>episode 39,

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:40.890
<v Speaker 5>and

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:43.850
<v Speaker 5>I love what Pop's doing with the Popcast.

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:45.770
<v Speaker 5>I think he's doing two important things for

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:47.290
<v Speaker 5>the Kubernetes community.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:48.090
<v Speaker 5>Number one,

00:16:48.695 --> 00:16:52.055
<v Speaker 5>he is creating some history. So he's, you

00:16:52.055 --> 00:16:54.775
<v Speaker 5>know, answering questions about what kind of thoughts

00:16:54.775 --> 00:16:57.175
<v Speaker 5>went into why we do things the way

00:16:57.175 --> 00:16:59.095
<v Speaker 5>we do by interviewing the people that are

00:16:59.095 --> 00:17:00.695
<v Speaker 5>really building the software.

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:04.710
<v Speaker 5>And two, he's humanizing. He's he's bringing a

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:06.309
<v Speaker 5>human element to

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:09.349
<v Speaker 5>these people whose names we see plastered all

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:11.509
<v Speaker 5>over the thing that we work on.

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:15.044
<v Speaker 5>Can seem larger than life. And in a

00:17:15.044 --> 00:17:17.924
<v Speaker 5>way, he's he's making them into friends and

00:17:17.924 --> 00:17:19.364
<v Speaker 5>acquaintances and

00:17:20.004 --> 00:17:22.004
<v Speaker 5>people we can actually engage with and ask

00:17:22.004 --> 00:17:24.244
<v Speaker 5>questions of, which I think is very important

00:17:24.244 --> 00:17:26.964
<v Speaker 5>in the space that we're in because community

00:17:26.964 --> 00:17:28.244
<v Speaker 5>is all about collaboration.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.559
<v Speaker 5>So being able to have the confidence to

00:17:31.559 --> 00:17:33.399
<v Speaker 5>reach out to others like that is big.

00:17:33.399 --> 00:17:33.959
<v Speaker 5>So

00:17:34.519 --> 00:17:36.840
<v Speaker 5>in celebration of Pop, I'm I'm happy he's

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.240
<v Speaker 5>joining us on the the salty plus sweet

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.515
<v Speaker 5>bandwagon with Pineapple today, And look forward to

00:17:42.515 --> 00:17:44.755
<v Speaker 5>seeing the episode of him down in the

00:17:44.755 --> 00:17:45.634
<v Speaker 5>whole pizza.

00:17:48.595 --> 00:17:50.995
<v Speaker 3>Can I tell you something? Like, Paul is

00:17:51.395 --> 00:17:54.195
<v Speaker 3>like, such an amazing resource in open source.

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:55.729
<v Speaker 3>Like, that guy

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:58.370
<v Speaker 3>and not just, you know, because he's my

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:01.090
<v Speaker 3>friend and and and all, but, like, he

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:02.850
<v Speaker 3>is so brilliant. I mean, he was in

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:04.850
<v Speaker 3>the CoreOS in the CoreOS days, you know,

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:07.090
<v Speaker 3>doing marketing for Chorus. You're marketing something

00:18:07.705 --> 00:18:09.545
<v Speaker 3>that at the time, nobody knew what the

00:18:09.545 --> 00:18:10.905
<v Speaker 3>hell Kubernetes was.

00:18:11.065 --> 00:18:12.665
<v Speaker 3>Right? And and and and

00:18:12.825 --> 00:18:15.145
<v Speaker 3>the amazing that, like, Brandon and Paul V

00:18:15.145 --> 00:18:16.985
<v Speaker 3>and Red Beard and all those people did.

00:18:16.985 --> 00:18:18.105
<v Speaker 3>I mean, it's just

00:18:18.425 --> 00:18:20.665
<v Speaker 3>that guy is and if you've ever and

00:18:20.665 --> 00:18:23.180
<v Speaker 3>and I I I don't know. Paul, have

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.860
<v Speaker 3>you ever met the other Paul?

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:26.860
<v Speaker 2>No.

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:27.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.460
<v Speaker 3>So I think you dig dig him. Like,

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.820
<v Speaker 3>the dude is just like I said, he

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.620
<v Speaker 3>he he has he's so learned. He he

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.735
<v Speaker 3>can, like, speak about different topics, but at

00:18:36.735 --> 00:18:38.895
<v Speaker 3>at LinkedIn in a very, like, great way.

00:18:38.895 --> 00:18:40.175
<v Speaker 3>And so the the clip that I did

00:18:40.175 --> 00:18:42.015
<v Speaker 3>in the podcast with him in the year

00:18:42.015 --> 00:18:44.575
<v Speaker 3>end was him talking about the the the

00:18:44.575 --> 00:18:46.575
<v Speaker 3>beginning of calculus. But he did it in

00:18:46.575 --> 00:18:47.855
<v Speaker 3>such a way that, like, you're you were

00:18:47.855 --> 00:18:49.420
<v Speaker 3>hooked on what the what how did they,

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:50.940
<v Speaker 3>you know, figure out how to use yeah.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.780
<v Speaker 3>Figure out calculus. I was like,

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.940
<v Speaker 3>phenomenal. So I I think you all would

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:56.780
<v Speaker 3>dig him. Yeah. He wasn't even supposed to

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:58.300
<v Speaker 1>be a math major either. Right? It was

00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:59.980
<v Speaker 1>just kinda thrown on him. So shout out

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:00.780
<v Speaker 1>to Paul.

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:02.780
<v Speaker 1>That guy's fantastic.

00:19:03.825 --> 00:19:05.104
<v Speaker 1>So
