00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:48.670
<v Speaker 0>Hello,

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.750
<v Speaker 0>and welcome to the newly branded Rawkode Academy.

00:01:53.055 --> 00:01:54.655
<v Speaker 0>This is my first

00:01:54.895 --> 00:01:55.935
<v Speaker 0>ever video

00:01:56.095 --> 00:01:58.015
<v Speaker 0>under this new name, and I I hope

00:01:58.015 --> 00:02:00.495
<v Speaker 0>you're excited to join me on this journey.

00:02:01.375 --> 00:02:03.535
<v Speaker 0>Remember, if you're not subscribed

00:02:03.535 --> 00:02:04.335
<v Speaker 0>already,

00:02:04.735 --> 00:02:05.695
<v Speaker 0>go ahead and do that now.

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.250
<v Speaker 0>You can click thumbs up on the video,

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.330

<v Speaker 0>a monthly membership and get access to private

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.090
<v Speaker 0>livestreams,

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.050
<v Speaker 0>emojis,

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.370
<v Speaker 0>although

00:02:19.035 --> 00:02:21.035
<v Speaker 0>they don't work that great on my software,

00:02:21.035 --> 00:02:22.155
<v Speaker 0>but we'll fix that.

00:02:23.115 --> 00:02:25.355
<v Speaker 0>And there'll be courses launching in July.

00:02:25.835 --> 00:02:28.395
<v Speaker 0>Also, we have a Discord server available at

00:02:28.395 --> 00:02:29.675
<v Speaker 0>Rawkode.chat.

00:02:29.675 --> 00:02:31.595
<v Speaker 0>If you're watching this live and wanna chat

00:02:31.595 --> 00:02:33.420
<v Speaker 0>afterwards or you have more questions, that is

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.340
<v Speaker 0>the best place to do it. If you're

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.340
<v Speaker 0>not watching live and you still have questions,

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.700
<v Speaker 0>that is also the best place to do

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.700
<v Speaker 0>it. Hopefully, we will see you in there

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.340
<v Speaker 0>soon.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.260
<v Speaker 0>Now, today's episode is a little bit different

00:02:45.935 --> 00:02:48.255
<v Speaker 0>and that, well, it is just me.

00:02:48.895 --> 00:02:52.255
<v Speaker 0>And we're gonna do some CKA

00:02:52.335 --> 00:02:53.615
<v Speaker 0>exam preparation.

00:02:54.655 --> 00:02:56.255
<v Speaker 0>And I was really looking forward to this

00:02:56.255 --> 00:02:59.295
<v Speaker 0>until I read that it's apparently harder

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.190
<v Speaker 0>than passing the CK.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.070
<v Speaker 0>You see here difficulty.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.430
<v Speaker 0>This simulator is more difficult than the real

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.390
<v Speaker 0>certification.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.750
<v Speaker 0>So what is this simulator? This is Keller.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:12.310
<v Speaker 0>Sh.

00:03:12.915 --> 00:03:15.474
<v Speaker 0>This is now something that anyone who purchases

00:03:15.474 --> 00:03:17.635
<v Speaker 0>an exam from the CNCF

00:03:17.635 --> 00:03:19.635
<v Speaker 0>will have access to this simulator.

00:03:19.954 --> 00:03:22.114
<v Speaker 0>I believe they get two runs through the

00:03:22.114 --> 00:03:24.355
<v Speaker 0>scenarios in order to prepare for setting the

00:03:24.355 --> 00:03:25.075
<v Speaker 0>actual CTA.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.170
<v Speaker 0>So, of course, it makes sense that this

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.010
<v Speaker 0>would be a little bit more difficult just

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.690
<v Speaker 0>to give you that extra bit of confidence

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.370
<v Speaker 0>when you go in for your exam.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 0>So that's today's plan.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.610
<v Speaker 0>I have already started a a session.

00:03:40.205 --> 00:03:41.885
<v Speaker 0>In order to do so, if you wanna,

00:03:41.885 --> 00:03:43.565
<v Speaker 0>you know, do this in your own time,

00:03:43.965 --> 00:03:47.405
<v Speaker 0>you log in. I authenticated with my Linux

00:03:47.405 --> 00:03:48.845
<v Speaker 0>foundation account.

00:03:49.325 --> 00:03:50.845
<v Speaker 0>And then from the dashboard,

00:03:50.924 --> 00:03:52.525
<v Speaker 0>you can see I've got my active session

00:03:52.525 --> 00:03:54.045
<v Speaker 0>here and I have another one here.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.870
<v Speaker 0>It took around three minutes for the environment

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:58.910
<v Speaker 0>to spin up.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.830
<v Speaker 0>I haven't looked at anything. I've not even

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:01.790
<v Speaker 0>clicked star.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.710
<v Speaker 0>I believe I've got thirty six hours from

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.470
<v Speaker 0>the moment I started the environment to complete

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:06.110
<v Speaker 0>it.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.750
<v Speaker 0>So we're pretty much just gonna

00:04:09.145 --> 00:04:11.145
<v Speaker 0>dive straight in and and see how prepared

00:04:11.145 --> 00:04:11.865
<v Speaker 0>I am.

00:04:12.345 --> 00:04:13.145
<v Speaker 0>My

00:04:13.145 --> 00:04:16.265
<v Speaker 0>CKA and my CKAD both expire in a

00:04:16.265 --> 00:04:18.024
<v Speaker 0>couple of months, so this will be really

00:04:18.024 --> 00:04:19.785
<v Speaker 0>good preparation

00:04:19.865 --> 00:04:21.225
<v Speaker 0>for resetting those exams.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.840
<v Speaker 0>So if you're watching, say hello in the

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.280
<v Speaker 0>comments. It's always good to get a little

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.760
<v Speaker 0>bit of feedback, especially when I'm sitting here

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.880
<v Speaker 0>all on my own.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.280
<v Speaker 0>And let's get started.

00:04:35.384 --> 00:04:36.264
<v Speaker 0>Actually, nervous.

00:04:37.065 --> 00:04:38.264
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's see.

00:04:39.305 --> 00:04:42.425
<v Speaker 0>Zoom. Zoom. Zoom. Zoom. Let's make this really

00:04:42.425 --> 00:04:44.185
<v Speaker 0>big. Hopefully, that's oh.

00:04:44.824 --> 00:04:46.824
<v Speaker 0>It's difficult for me to read, but

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:49.760
<v Speaker 0>let's see how we get on.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.280
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Instructions. You should avoid using

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.440
<v Speaker 0>the deprecated kubectl commands as these might not

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.560
<v Speaker 0>work in exam.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.360
<v Speaker 0>There are three Kubernetes clusters and eight nodes

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.495
<v Speaker 0>in total. Cluster one, cluster two, cluster three.

00:05:04.495 --> 00:05:05.375
<v Speaker 0>Got it.

00:05:06.175 --> 00:05:08.495
<v Speaker 0>I'm only allowed to have one other browser

00:05:08.495 --> 00:05:10.895
<v Speaker 0>tab open with the Kubernetes documentation.

00:05:11.215 --> 00:05:13.135
<v Speaker 0>I'm not gonna read the docs.

00:05:14.095 --> 00:05:15.055
<v Speaker 0>Notes.

00:05:15.295 --> 00:05:17.135
<v Speaker 0>You have a notepad tool,

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.160
<v Speaker 0>Just like the exam.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.000
<v Speaker 0>And there's a difficulty thing. Alright.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.720
<v Speaker 0>Using kubectl from the terminal, you can reach

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.560
<v Speaker 0>the API servers of all of them. I

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.640
<v Speaker 0>just need to switch context. Alright. Good.

00:05:35.944 --> 00:05:36.985
<v Speaker 0>What did I do?

00:05:38.264 --> 00:05:39.865
<v Speaker 0>Oh, next question.

00:05:40.824 --> 00:05:41.705
<v Speaker 0>First

00:05:41.705 --> 00:05:42.664
<v Speaker 0>challenge done.

00:05:43.625 --> 00:05:44.425
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:05:44.664 --> 00:05:46.745
<v Speaker 0>I have access to multiple clusters from my

00:05:46.745 --> 00:05:47.544
<v Speaker 0>main terminal.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.690
<v Speaker 0>Sure.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.330
<v Speaker 0>Kubectl context, right, all of these context names

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:56.930
<v Speaker 0>enter this fail.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.665
<v Speaker 0>You have access to multiple clusters for your

00:06:01.665 --> 00:06:04.145
<v Speaker 0>main terminal for the kubectl. Alright. Kubectl.

00:06:04.385 --> 00:06:05.185
<v Speaker 0>Got it.

00:06:07.105 --> 00:06:07.985
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

00:06:08.465 --> 00:06:09.905
<v Speaker 0>Config get

00:06:10.705 --> 00:06:11.585
<v Speaker 0>contacts.

00:06:12.625 --> 00:06:13.105
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.480
<v Speaker 0>Write all those context names and to a

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.600
<v Speaker 0>fail. Alright.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.600
<v Speaker 0>One in each lane, comma separated.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.480
<v Speaker 0>Do you care?

00:06:26.285 --> 00:06:27.325
<v Speaker 0>Not sure.

00:06:28.365 --> 00:06:30.765
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's do a head

00:06:31.325 --> 00:06:33.005
<v Speaker 0>dash m one. It should get rid of

00:06:33.005 --> 00:06:35.005
<v Speaker 0>the header. No. That's only gonna give me

00:06:35.005 --> 00:06:35.805
<v Speaker 0>the header.

00:06:37.645 --> 00:06:38.685
<v Speaker 0>Did I skip a lane?

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:42.850
<v Speaker 0>Told tell me I can't remember how to

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:43.650
<v Speaker 0>skip a lane.

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.050
<v Speaker 0>Manhead.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.650
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Print the first number of lanes. No.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.170
<v Speaker 0>I wanna skip a lane. Skip a lane.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:53.650
<v Speaker 0>Skip a lane.

00:06:55.625 --> 00:06:56.825
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:59.465
<v Speaker 0>Who just thought that would get me first?

00:06:59.545 --> 00:07:00.345
<v Speaker 0>Get

00:07:01.225 --> 00:07:03.145
<v Speaker 0>context. I'm just going to

00:07:03.305 --> 00:07:04.105
<v Speaker 0>arc

00:07:05.225 --> 00:07:07.145
<v Speaker 0>open open

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:08.880
<v Speaker 0>Print.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.000
<v Speaker 0>One.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.960
<v Speaker 0>Why have I got a thingy here?

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.800
<v Speaker 0>Now zero would be the whole lane. One

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.479
<v Speaker 0>should be the star. Two should be the

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:18.880
<v Speaker 0>name.

00:07:20.514 --> 00:07:21.315
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:07:23.235 --> 00:07:24.595
<v Speaker 0>Write this to

00:07:24.915 --> 00:07:25.475
<v Speaker 0>op

00:07:26.995 --> 00:07:27.875
<v Speaker 0>course

00:07:27.875 --> 00:07:28.515
<v Speaker 0>one

00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:29.795
<v Speaker 0>context,

00:07:30.435 --> 00:07:32.880
<v Speaker 0>and I'm gonna cheat because I can't remember

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.960
<v Speaker 0>how to skip a line on my output.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.400
<v Speaker 0>Maybe I could do with less.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.240
<v Speaker 0>Of course, one

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.520
<v Speaker 0>tail. Thanks, Alex.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.160
<v Speaker 0>That's always a weird thing. Alright. I think

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.520
<v Speaker 0>that's good enough.

00:07:47.205 --> 00:07:48.965
<v Speaker 0>So Alice Bauer says, yeah, should have used

00:07:48.965 --> 00:07:51.125
<v Speaker 0>tail. Yeah, I can. I could have used

00:07:51.125 --> 00:07:53.044
<v Speaker 0>tail. It seems obvious now that you've stated

00:07:53.044 --> 00:07:53.605
<v Speaker 0>it.

00:07:54.405 --> 00:07:57.205
<v Speaker 0>Matt Hawk, I'm a huge Hawk fan. I

00:07:57.205 --> 00:07:59.445
<v Speaker 0>love using Hawk for pretty much anything on

00:07:59.445 --> 00:08:00.085
<v Speaker 0>my terminal.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.400
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so now we want to write a

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.240
<v Speaker 0>command to display

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.960
<v Speaker 0>the current context

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.080
<v Speaker 0>and here,

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.080
<v Speaker 0>I would just hit that.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.000
<v Speaker 0>Alright, so

00:08:14.695 --> 00:08:15.975
<v Speaker 0>get context.

00:08:16.375 --> 00:08:17.015
<v Speaker 0>Correct.

00:08:17.735 --> 00:08:18.455
<v Speaker 0>Star.

00:08:19.335 --> 00:08:20.215
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:08:23.255 --> 00:08:25.255
<v Speaker 0>Put it into this other file.

00:08:25.415 --> 00:08:27.575
<v Speaker 0>Sure thing. I just want a name.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:31.050
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:35.370
<v Speaker 0>Print

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:37.770
<v Speaker 0>to

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:39.130
<v Speaker 0>opt

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:40.730
<v Speaker 0>course one.

00:08:43.505 --> 00:08:45.584
<v Speaker 0>Bring up my CLI a bit. No problem,

00:08:45.584 --> 00:08:46.785
<v Speaker 0>Navin. Thank you.

00:08:48.785 --> 00:08:50.464
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Context

00:08:50.704 --> 00:08:51.665
<v Speaker 0>default

00:08:51.825 --> 00:08:52.704
<v Speaker 0>kubectl

00:08:52.704 --> 00:08:53.584
<v Speaker 0>dot sh.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.420
<v Speaker 0>Oh, wait. It says write a command

00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:59.660
<v Speaker 0>to display the current context.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.020
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So I don't sort of command in

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.940
<v Speaker 0>the file, even though it's dot sh file.

00:09:10.475 --> 00:09:12.154
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, I want that SH trail to be

00:09:12.154 --> 00:09:13.834
<v Speaker 0>a command that I could run right.

00:09:20.555 --> 00:09:22.394
<v Speaker 0>Without the use of kubectl.

00:09:23.579 --> 00:09:24.300
<v Speaker 0>Really?

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:26.620
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:09:31.339 --> 00:09:32.300
<v Speaker 0>Echo

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:33.579
<v Speaker 0>all of this.

00:09:36.425 --> 00:09:37.945
<v Speaker 0>I think that's what it wants.

00:09:39.225 --> 00:09:41.385
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming the idea being I could run

00:09:41.385 --> 00:09:42.265
<v Speaker 0>course

00:09:42.265 --> 00:09:43.865
<v Speaker 0>one context

00:09:43.865 --> 00:09:44.905
<v Speaker 0>default.

00:09:46.505 --> 00:09:47.625
<v Speaker 0>I got the rate.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.560
<v Speaker 0>Why did my

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.080
<v Speaker 0>walk not kick in?

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.880
<v Speaker 0>Because it was interpolated.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:02.920
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:04.920
<v Speaker 0>That was funny.

00:10:06.725 --> 00:10:08.725
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Now I need to do the same,

00:10:08.725 --> 00:10:09.845
<v Speaker 0>but without

00:10:14.005 --> 00:10:16.965
<v Speaker 0>using cube control. So I expect what this

00:10:16.965 --> 00:10:18.485
<v Speaker 0>is trying to confirm is that I know

00:10:18.485 --> 00:10:21.180
<v Speaker 0>that the config is here.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:30.780
<v Speaker 0>That is Yamal.

00:10:36.665 --> 00:10:39.145
<v Speaker 0>Always grip fail. It has a default context

00:10:39.145 --> 00:10:41.145
<v Speaker 0>lane if I remember or a current context

00:10:41.145 --> 00:10:41.865
<v Speaker 0>lane.

00:10:42.904 --> 00:10:43.465
<v Speaker 0>Correct.

00:10:44.024 --> 00:10:44.665
<v Speaker 0>Current.

00:10:45.065 --> 00:10:45.945
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. There we go.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.290
<v Speaker 0>So we actually wanna echo this to fail,

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:51.650
<v Speaker 0>and I know someone's gonna tell me, you

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:53.650
<v Speaker 0>don't need to use cat. Yeah.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:56.690
<v Speaker 0>That's that's gonna bug me, isn't it? So

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.410
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we're gonna grab for current here.

00:11:04.535 --> 00:11:05.735
<v Speaker 0>Okay,

00:11:05.735 --> 00:11:07.735
<v Speaker 0>so now our arc has to get fancy.

00:11:10.375 --> 00:11:13.815
<v Speaker 0>And because we do want to print

00:11:15.149 --> 00:11:17.790
<v Speaker 0>zero all one left hand side, two right

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:21.149
<v Speaker 0>hand side, only this time we're gonna need

00:11:21.149 --> 00:11:21.870
<v Speaker 0>an

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:24.350
<v Speaker 0>a field separator.

00:11:27.705 --> 00:11:30.105
<v Speaker 0>I'm getting nested quotes here now. I wonder

00:11:30.105 --> 00:11:31.705
<v Speaker 0>if I can do it with the, let's

00:11:32.185 --> 00:11:32.825
<v Speaker 0>try.

00:11:33.945 --> 00:11:35.305
<v Speaker 0>And I'm gonna have to run this to

00:11:35.305 --> 00:11:37.385
<v Speaker 0>test before I start echoing it.

00:11:39.865 --> 00:11:40.905
<v Speaker 0>No. Alright. Okay.

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:43.930
<v Speaker 0>Now if this is field separator, go in.

00:11:46.329 --> 00:11:47.210
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

00:11:48.089 --> 00:11:50.410
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So now I wanna echo this

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:52.170
<v Speaker 0>to that location,

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:53.529
<v Speaker 0>escaping these.

00:11:55.495 --> 00:11:57.975
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if I completely misunderstood

00:12:00.055 --> 00:12:03.335
<v Speaker 0>this first task. It seems a little weird,

00:12:05.095 --> 00:12:06.455
<v Speaker 0>but I should

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.360
<v Speaker 0>be able to run

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.400
<v Speaker 0>context

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.440
<v Speaker 0>default

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.240
<v Speaker 0>null.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.560
<v Speaker 0>My awk again.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.960
<v Speaker 0>It's a good thing I'm checking my work.

00:12:23.014 --> 00:12:23.815
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:12:23.894 --> 00:12:25.735
<v Speaker 0>We've got a cube control one, make sure

00:12:25.735 --> 00:12:28.535
<v Speaker 0>that works. It does. And we wrote our

00:12:28.535 --> 00:12:29.014
<v Speaker 0>context.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.060
<v Speaker 0>Not what I was expecting for a first

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:39.700
<v Speaker 0>question.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.579
<v Speaker 0>I guess it's just trying to clarify, you

00:12:42.579 --> 00:12:44.180
<v Speaker 0>know, where the cube things is, you know,

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.019
<v Speaker 0>roughly the format of what,

00:12:46.259 --> 00:12:48.500
<v Speaker 0>how the context works and how it stores

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.625
<v Speaker 0>the default. And then I guess there's a

00:12:50.625 --> 00:12:51.904
<v Speaker 0>little bit of knowledge there to test your

00:12:51.904 --> 00:12:52.865
<v Speaker 0>cube control.

00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:55.345
<v Speaker 0>Alex with another great comment in the chat.

00:12:56.545 --> 00:12:58.865
<v Speaker 0>Cube control get context. No headers.

00:12:59.745 --> 00:13:00.385
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:13:01.185 --> 00:13:02.065
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

00:13:02.464 --> 00:13:03.825
<v Speaker 0>I always forget that's an option.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.040
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.320
<v Speaker 0>I agree, Matt. I'm not entirely sure that

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.520
<v Speaker 0>it's a great first question,

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.080
<v Speaker 0>but

00:13:21.704 --> 00:13:23.464
<v Speaker 0>Alex, what you're saying to me. Alex is

00:13:23.464 --> 00:13:25.065
<v Speaker 0>saying, I don't think you did the context

00:13:25.065 --> 00:13:26.105
<v Speaker 0>one correctly.

00:13:30.024 --> 00:13:31.464
<v Speaker 0>Since it wants you to know what the

00:13:31.464 --> 00:13:32.264
<v Speaker 0>options are.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.430
<v Speaker 0>No. I think that would be a shitty.

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:38.190
<v Speaker 0>I don't think it's anything to do with

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:40.350
<v Speaker 0>the options. I I think it's just familiarity

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.830
<v Speaker 0>with the KubeConfig and enough Linux knowledge to

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:44.510
<v Speaker 0>juggle it around. I don't really think it

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:45.950
<v Speaker 0>matters how they get to it. Like,

00:13:46.655 --> 00:13:49.375
<v Speaker 0>knowing that you can do formatting of kubectl,

00:13:50.255 --> 00:13:53.135
<v Speaker 0>nobody remembers those parameters ever. Everyone's always gonna

00:13:53.135 --> 00:13:54.895
<v Speaker 0>default. I will speak for myself, not for

00:13:54.895 --> 00:13:56.655
<v Speaker 0>everyone. I'm always gonna default to my Linux

00:13:56.655 --> 00:14:00.015
<v Speaker 0>tools rather than esoteric flags on kubectl.

00:14:00.095 --> 00:14:02.630
<v Speaker 0>So I disagree. The outcome is what matters.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:06.390
<v Speaker 0>Okay. I switched context. I create a single

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:09.350
<v Speaker 0>pod running this image and the namespace default.

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:11.590
<v Speaker 0>The pod should be in pod one, and

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:13.590
<v Speaker 0>the container should be named pod one container.

00:14:14.295 --> 00:14:17.095
<v Speaker 0>This pod should only be scheduled on a

00:14:17.735 --> 00:14:20.695
<v Speaker 0>control plane node. Do not add any labels.

00:14:21.575 --> 00:14:23.815
<v Speaker 0>Shortly, write the reason on why the pods

00:14:23.815 --> 00:14:25.735
<v Speaker 0>are by default not scheduled.

00:14:27.014 --> 00:14:27.495
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:33.880
<v Speaker 0>Now,

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.680
<v Speaker 0>do we have anything well, I'm gonna set

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:37.640
<v Speaker 0>my alias.

00:14:39.399 --> 00:14:41.640
<v Speaker 0>Have anything running to copy.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.605
<v Speaker 0>I always found that it's the best way

00:14:44.605 --> 00:14:46.125
<v Speaker 0>to get started when I did my CK

00:14:46.125 --> 00:14:48.125
<v Speaker 0>the first time. Like, nobody expects you to

00:14:48.125 --> 00:14:49.485
<v Speaker 0>remember a pod spec off the top of

00:14:49.485 --> 00:14:50.925
<v Speaker 0>your head. I thought the pod's

00:14:51.404 --> 00:14:53.644
<v Speaker 0>easy enough. We probably could we probably could

00:14:53.644 --> 00:14:54.524
<v Speaker 0>take that up.

00:14:55.324 --> 00:14:57.084
<v Speaker 0>But there's already specs here and this is

00:14:57.084 --> 00:14:58.285
<v Speaker 0>a one to one cluster.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:14:59.920
<v Speaker 0>Was it?

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.399
<v Speaker 0>Let's find out.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.920
<v Speaker 0>Which means if I do a get pod

00:15:07.519 --> 00:15:08.720
<v Speaker 0>dash o

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.000
<v Speaker 0>yaml,

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.560
<v Speaker 0>there must be a one.

00:15:15.335 --> 00:15:16.055
<v Speaker 0>No, no,

00:15:16.535 --> 00:15:17.415
<v Speaker 0>no. There we go.

00:15:18.215 --> 00:15:21.095
<v Speaker 0>No. Yeah. It's not got all of the

00:15:21.095 --> 00:15:24.135
<v Speaker 0>verbosity that I just bet. So, okay, cool.

00:15:24.135 --> 00:15:26.615
<v Speaker 0>I didn't see managed fields, which is good.

00:15:26.615 --> 00:15:28.510
<v Speaker 0>This maybe has a one twenty one cluster.

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:30.190
<v Speaker 0>There

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:32.190
<v Speaker 0>used to be an export flag, don't think

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.110
<v Speaker 0>that works anymore. Yeah. That was deprecated, but

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:35.310
<v Speaker 0>it would try to remove all of that

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:35.950
<v Speaker 0>crap.

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:38.110
<v Speaker 0>But you can just say pod dot yaml

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:38.830
<v Speaker 0>and

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:40.990
<v Speaker 0>then tweak.

00:15:41.925 --> 00:15:44.485
<v Speaker 0>So you gotta remember to remove metadata that

00:15:44.485 --> 00:15:46.005
<v Speaker 0>is not particularly important.

00:15:47.125 --> 00:15:48.885
<v Speaker 0>And I also told us that there should

00:15:48.885 --> 00:15:50.965
<v Speaker 0>be no labels.

00:15:51.125 --> 00:15:52.965
<v Speaker 0>Do not add any new labels to the

00:15:52.965 --> 00:15:53.605
<v Speaker 0>node.

00:15:54.565 --> 00:15:56.005
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Means I don't need any.

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.680
<v Speaker 0>The name is supposed to be

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.400
<v Speaker 0>pod one and the default namespace.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:04.600
<v Speaker 0>We

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.360
<v Speaker 0>don't need that.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.960
<v Speaker 0>Containers. Unfortunately, think that's actually the same one,

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.960
<v Speaker 0>isn't it? Yep. 2, no, almost.

00:16:12.735 --> 00:16:17.215
<v Speaker 0>2.40.41DashAlpine.

00:16:18.735 --> 00:16:20.655
<v Speaker 0>The policy is not important. The pod name

00:16:20.655 --> 00:16:22.255
<v Speaker 0>was, I want it to be called Pod

00:16:22.255 --> 00:16:23.295
<v Speaker 0>1 container.

00:16:24.655 --> 00:16:27.130
<v Speaker 0>We don't need any mounts if I delete

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:28.490
<v Speaker 0>too much. Nope.

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:31.130
<v Speaker 0>Where's my relative line numbers?

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:33.290
<v Speaker 0>What else do we need?

00:16:34.649 --> 00:16:35.450
<v Speaker 0>Nothing

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:37.210
<v Speaker 0>yet.

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.649
<v Speaker 0>We will need the toleration, I'm gonna leave

00:16:40.649 --> 00:16:41.130
<v Speaker 0>them in.

00:16:42.214 --> 00:16:43.975
<v Speaker 0>And I can't comment about Oh, yeah, can't

00:16:44.055 --> 00:16:45.415
<v Speaker 0>This is an actual local fail. This is

00:16:45.415 --> 00:16:46.774
<v Speaker 0>not a cube control edit.

00:16:47.975 --> 00:16:50.454
<v Speaker 0>I'll never remember the toleration syntax.

00:16:51.894 --> 00:16:53.815
<v Speaker 0>And we'll delete all of that. Okay.

00:16:55.959 --> 00:16:58.440
<v Speaker 0>This is our polyaml spec.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.160
<v Speaker 0>Right now I think it does everything that

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.360
<v Speaker 0>it has to do here.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.679
<v Speaker 0>It wants us

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.040
<v Speaker 0>to ensure that is only scheduled on a

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.079
<v Speaker 0>control plane node,

00:17:11.825 --> 00:17:12.944
<v Speaker 0>which means

00:17:13.265 --> 00:17:15.025
<v Speaker 0>I need to remember how all of this

00:17:15.025 --> 00:17:15.664
<v Speaker 0>works,

00:17:16.065 --> 00:17:18.145
<v Speaker 0>but we can run KGET nodes.

00:17:19.744 --> 00:17:21.424
<v Speaker 0>Let me shut my phone up.

00:17:23.185 --> 00:17:23.905
<v Speaker 0>Describe

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.950
<v Speaker 0>cluster

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:26.470
<v Speaker 0>one, master

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:27.109
<v Speaker 0>one.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:30.549
<v Speaker 0>And

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:32.630
<v Speaker 0>there is label on this, which will say

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:34.710
<v Speaker 0>that it is a control plane node, although

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:36.870
<v Speaker 0>we could just use a node selector.

00:17:39.255 --> 00:17:40.695
<v Speaker 0>Maybe that's just easier.

00:17:42.215 --> 00:17:44.375
<v Speaker 0>We've tried to tolerate

00:17:44.375 --> 00:17:45.494
<v Speaker 0>the labels,

00:17:45.894 --> 00:17:47.654
<v Speaker 0>but yeah, we got this here. So we

00:17:47.654 --> 00:17:49.174
<v Speaker 0>can either add a toleration

00:17:49.174 --> 00:17:50.294
<v Speaker 0>or this load,

00:17:50.695 --> 00:17:51.975
<v Speaker 0>affinity for this label,

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.820
<v Speaker 0>but I'm just gonna use the node selector

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:56.779
<v Speaker 0>actually.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.780
<v Speaker 0>Where was that? What was it? Okay. Cluster

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:01.419
<v Speaker 0>one,

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:03.580
<v Speaker 0>master one. Okay.

00:18:11.775 --> 00:18:13.695
<v Speaker 0>In a while. Let's see.

00:18:17.855 --> 00:18:18.495
<v Speaker 0>Bye.

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:23.590
<v Speaker 0>What

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:25.670
<v Speaker 0>did I get wrong?

00:18:36.175 --> 00:18:38.174
<v Speaker 0>Oh, my node selector is wrong.

00:18:39.135 --> 00:18:42.495
<v Speaker 0>Alright, we are gonna use Kubernetes docs. Node

00:18:42.495 --> 00:18:43.534
<v Speaker 0>selector.

00:18:48.255 --> 00:18:49.775
<v Speaker 0>That's what I used.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.760
<v Speaker 0>I put it in the wrong place.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.040
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Okay. So yeah, it's the node selector

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.120
<v Speaker 0>and then how to select it.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.240
<v Speaker 0>I don't think we need to use affinity

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.160
<v Speaker 0>here. I'm going to just avoid it.

00:19:08.764 --> 00:19:09.964
<v Speaker 0>And just need name.

00:19:16.845 --> 00:19:17.644
<v Speaker 0>Let's try.

00:19:18.764 --> 00:19:20.044
<v Speaker 0>So worst that can happen.

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.259
<v Speaker 0>Only people are watching me.

00:19:23.539 --> 00:19:25.140
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Node selector.

00:19:38.755 --> 00:19:40.754
<v Speaker 0>Well, that pending tells me

00:19:42.035 --> 00:19:43.154
<v Speaker 0>hasn't worked.

00:19:43.395 --> 00:19:45.395
<v Speaker 0>Zero free notes are available to pod and

00:19:45.395 --> 00:19:46.115
<v Speaker 0>tolerate.

00:19:46.595 --> 00:19:47.235
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:19:47.475 --> 00:19:48.835
<v Speaker 0>It didn't match that. So

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.719
<v Speaker 0>my selector is wrong. Let's describe

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.479
<v Speaker 0>this again.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.159
<v Speaker 0>That are the key, get nodes, show labels.

00:20:03.784 --> 00:20:04.664
<v Speaker 0>Okay. What we got?

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.100
<v Speaker 0>How does this work again?

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.340
<v Speaker 0>Oh yeah, good show.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.580
<v Speaker 0>Rory is saying I can just use node

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:24.299
<v Speaker 0>name.

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.340
<v Speaker 0>Now I'm kinda,

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:29.980
<v Speaker 0>I do kinda wanna get it working.

00:20:31.894 --> 00:20:34.215
<v Speaker 0>So the node selector, and then there's this,

00:20:34.215 --> 00:20:36.294
<v Speaker 0>is this, this is the key value pair,

00:20:36.294 --> 00:20:38.934
<v Speaker 0>right? Of the labels that were attached because

00:20:39.174 --> 00:20:40.054
<v Speaker 0>this is

00:20:40.375 --> 00:20:43.014
<v Speaker 0>adding a label here where this type equals.

00:20:43.735 --> 00:20:44.615
<v Speaker 0>So I'm assuming,

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:46.769
<v Speaker 0>we'll try one more thing and I'll use

00:20:46.769 --> 00:20:48.929
<v Speaker 0>node name and one US actually set the

00:20:48.929 --> 00:20:50.529
<v Speaker 0>node name on the pod. I believe the

00:20:50.529 --> 00:20:52.370
<v Speaker 0>scheduler just ignores it and then the kubelet

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:54.529
<v Speaker 0>takes over. So you don't it doesn't get

00:20:54.529 --> 00:20:55.729
<v Speaker 0>scheduled per se.

00:20:56.769 --> 00:20:57.890
<v Speaker 0>But that's a good show actually.

00:20:59.505 --> 00:21:02.385
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we did have control plane,

00:21:02.465 --> 00:21:04.705
<v Speaker 0>but it was set to kind of zero.

00:21:06.385 --> 00:21:07.745
<v Speaker 0>So I'm assuming

00:21:11.265 --> 00:21:13.825
<v Speaker 0>control dash plane here with an empty file

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:17.299
<v Speaker 0>and I can't update pods. Those are immutable.

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:22.179
<v Speaker 0>See, I've made this take a lot longer

00:21:22.179 --> 00:21:23.619
<v Speaker 0>now by just avoiding

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:25.940
<v Speaker 0>the affinity. I think the affinity would have

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:26.980
<v Speaker 0>been a lot quicker,

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:29.059
<v Speaker 0>but

00:21:34.394 --> 00:21:36.154
<v Speaker 0>yeah, okay, that's not working.

00:21:36.794 --> 00:21:39.034
<v Speaker 0>Delete pod, pod one.

00:21:39.434 --> 00:21:41.514
<v Speaker 0>Let's modify this one more time.

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:49.049
<v Speaker 0>Cluster one.

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:57.610
<v Speaker 0>Here we go. So

00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:59.530
<v Speaker 0>what's the chat saying to me? It was

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:00.410
<v Speaker 0>kinda going

00:22:00.655 --> 00:22:02.735
<v Speaker 0>kinda Alastair saying, hey.

00:22:04.335 --> 00:22:06.415
<v Speaker 0>If you're telling me to use tents, yeah.

00:22:06.415 --> 00:22:07.935
<v Speaker 0>I was avoiding that just because I felt

00:22:07.935 --> 00:22:09.375
<v Speaker 0>like it was too much typing and then

00:22:09.375 --> 00:22:10.895
<v Speaker 0>it ended up taking myself around on a

00:22:10.895 --> 00:22:11.615
<v Speaker 0>couple of circles.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
<v Speaker 0>So suggestion, well, you need a toleration for

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.080
<v Speaker 0>the no schedule. Not if I skipped the

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.840
<v Speaker 0>scheduler and use node name.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.080
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. Actually, I bet my selector was

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.520
<v Speaker 0>working and I just didn't tell it to

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.640
<v Speaker 0>tolerate the no schedule.

00:22:27.875 --> 00:22:28.914
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

00:22:29.715 --> 00:22:31.475
<v Speaker 0>In fact, there we go. If got comments

00:22:31.475 --> 00:22:33.315
<v Speaker 0>in the chat. You forgot to add the

00:22:33.315 --> 00:22:34.114
<v Speaker 0>toleration.

00:22:35.155 --> 00:22:36.915
<v Speaker 0>Message is quite difficult to read. Let's pop

00:22:36.915 --> 00:22:37.395
<v Speaker 0>that over there.

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:40.129
<v Speaker 0>Let's just remove that.

00:22:43.809 --> 00:22:46.129
<v Speaker 0>The opacity or transparency.

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:49.009
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's see.

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:52.930
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Yep. The chat corrects me. Yes. You're

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:53.570
<v Speaker 0>all correct.

00:22:54.095 --> 00:22:54.975
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:22:57.375 --> 00:22:58.174
<v Speaker 0>However,

00:22:59.375 --> 00:23:02.015
<v Speaker 0>we cheated. Well, it's not cheating. We got

00:23:02.015 --> 00:23:03.855
<v Speaker 0>the end result. Maybe it's just not the

00:23:03.855 --> 00:23:05.375
<v Speaker 0>way that we're telling us to. And the

00:23:05.375 --> 00:23:07.690
<v Speaker 0>CK is not, I don't think they check

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:09.289
<v Speaker 0>to see how you implemented that. They really

00:23:09.289 --> 00:23:10.489
<v Speaker 0>just check the results.

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:13.129
<v Speaker 0>You use whatever you can.

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:15.849
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:16.409
<v Speaker 0>So

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:19.529
<v Speaker 0>switch con it's the same context, but let's

00:23:20.205 --> 00:23:22.525
<v Speaker 0>type it anyway or copy and paste it

00:23:22.525 --> 00:23:23.164
<v Speaker 0>anyway.

00:23:26.605 --> 00:23:28.445
<v Speaker 0>Okay. There are two pods

00:23:28.525 --> 00:23:30.284
<v Speaker 0>and a namespace

00:23:31.325 --> 00:23:33.085
<v Speaker 0>project c 13

00:23:33.885 --> 00:23:35.005
<v Speaker 0>or o three DB.

00:23:36.019 --> 00:23:37.379
<v Speaker 0>There are indeed.

00:23:38.419 --> 00:23:40.580
<v Speaker 0>C 13 management asked,

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.539
<v Speaker 0>just asked us to scale them down so

00:23:43.539 --> 00:23:46.099
<v Speaker 0>that we only have one replica.

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:48.580
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So the first thing we notice here

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:50.260
<v Speaker 0>is the naming convention of the pod.

00:23:50.775 --> 00:23:52.775
<v Speaker 0>It is not a triple with a replica

00:23:52.775 --> 00:23:54.935
<v Speaker 0>set in the middle like we see here.

00:23:54.935 --> 00:23:56.934
<v Speaker 0>So this this is the three part triple.

00:23:58.055 --> 00:24:00.375
<v Speaker 0>Pods are generally like this. This would be

00:24:00.375 --> 00:24:03.175
<v Speaker 0>the higher level name, probably the deployment.

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:06.350
<v Speaker 0>The middle bit is the replica set ID

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:08.269
<v Speaker 0>and then this is the pod ID.

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:10.669
<v Speaker 0>What we see here is that

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:13.790
<v Speaker 0>these are stateful sets because we have numbered

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:15.070
<v Speaker 0>ordered pods.

00:24:17.355 --> 00:24:19.434
<v Speaker 0>Oh, did I miss an action on question

00:24:19.434 --> 00:24:20.315
<v Speaker 0>two?

00:24:26.875 --> 00:24:27.674
<v Speaker 0>Did I?

00:24:28.794 --> 00:24:31.195
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. Sure. Thanks. Good catch.

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:38.499
<v Speaker 0>So I'm gonna lie here.

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:43.779
<v Speaker 0>The pods weren't scheduled

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.099
<v Speaker 0>with the affinity

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.299
<v Speaker 0>or

00:24:48.455 --> 00:24:49.415
<v Speaker 0>selector

00:24:49.735 --> 00:24:52.934
<v Speaker 0>because the pod wasn't configured

00:24:52.935 --> 00:24:54.055
<v Speaker 0>to tolerate

00:24:54.055 --> 00:24:55.175
<v Speaker 0>the taint

00:24:55.255 --> 00:24:57.495
<v Speaker 0>that control plane nodes

00:24:57.495 --> 00:24:58.295
<v Speaker 0>have.

00:25:00.135 --> 00:25:01.975
<v Speaker 0>Not sure how they check that if a

00:25:01.975 --> 00:25:03.890
<v Speaker 0>human is involved or they just look for

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:06.529
<v Speaker 0>the keyword, which is tolerate, but there we

00:25:06.529 --> 00:25:08.610
<v Speaker 0>go. Okay, so we wanna scale down the

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:11.809
<v Speaker 0>stateful set. So if we enter namespace,

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:15.489
<v Speaker 0>get

00:25:16.049 --> 00:25:16.610
<v Speaker 0>STS,

00:25:17.545 --> 00:25:18.985
<v Speaker 0>You can see it here.

00:25:19.625 --> 00:25:21.304
<v Speaker 0>Edit o three DB

00:25:21.865 --> 00:25:22.904
<v Speaker 0>replicas

00:25:24.425 --> 00:25:25.065
<v Speaker 0>one

00:25:29.065 --> 00:25:30.184
<v Speaker 0>get pod

00:25:30.265 --> 00:25:31.144
<v Speaker 0>watch.

00:25:31.625 --> 00:25:33.590
<v Speaker 0>And we'll wait for that to terminate and

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:34.630
<v Speaker 0>we'll move on.

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:39.830
<v Speaker 0>I think we're good.

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:44.230
<v Speaker 0>More questions like that, please.

00:25:45.285 --> 00:25:47.285
<v Speaker 0>Okay, same context. I'm not going to copy

00:25:47.285 --> 00:25:49.525
<v Speaker 0>and paste it again. Do the following,

00:25:49.685 --> 00:25:52.165
<v Speaker 0>do the following and namespace default, create a

00:25:52.165 --> 00:25:54.645
<v Speaker 0>single pod named ready of service ready with

00:25:54.645 --> 00:25:57.845
<v Speaker 0>an NGINX image, configure aliveness probe,

00:25:57.925 --> 00:25:59.445
<v Speaker 0>which simply runs true,

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:02.539
<v Speaker 0>configure a readiness probe, which does an HTTP

00:26:02.539 --> 00:26:03.419
<v Speaker 0>check.

00:26:04.539 --> 00:26:06.220
<v Speaker 0>Start this pod and confirm it isn't ready

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:07.979
<v Speaker 0>because of the readiness probe.

00:26:08.779 --> 00:26:11.179
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, we already got a pod Yamo.

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.259
<v Speaker 0>What question is this?

00:26:13.995 --> 00:26:15.595
<v Speaker 0>Let's call it q four.

00:26:18.955 --> 00:26:20.475
<v Speaker 0>It was naive of me to call it

00:26:20.475 --> 00:26:21.434
<v Speaker 0>pod.yaml

00:26:21.434 --> 00:26:22.475
<v Speaker 0>in the first place.

00:26:23.115 --> 00:26:24.235
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So

00:26:25.675 --> 00:26:26.955
<v Speaker 0>pod name

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:28.470
<v Speaker 0>ready.

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:30.070
<v Speaker 0>If service,

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:31.029
<v Speaker 0>ready.

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:33.190
<v Speaker 0>Default namespace.

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:35.350
<v Speaker 0>Doesn't need scheduled.

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:41.110
<v Speaker 0>Image nginx one sixteen one dash

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.990
<v Speaker 0>Alpine.

00:26:43.424 --> 00:26:44.704
<v Speaker 0>Oh, come on then.

00:26:46.945 --> 00:26:48.384
<v Speaker 0>Let's just call this

00:26:49.505 --> 00:26:50.384
<v Speaker 0>NGINX.

00:26:52.865 --> 00:26:53.984
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So

00:26:54.465 --> 00:26:56.144
<v Speaker 0>we need to add

00:26:58.620 --> 00:26:59.500
<v Speaker 0>liveness

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:00.539
<v Speaker 0>probe

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:03.820
<v Speaker 0>command.

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:08.220
<v Speaker 0>See if I can remember how to do

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:09.740
<v Speaker 0>this. I'm gonna use the docs.

00:27:12.995 --> 00:27:15.155
<v Speaker 0>So there's two ones that can go here,

00:27:15.155 --> 00:27:16.915
<v Speaker 0>right? There's http get

00:27:18.275 --> 00:27:19.475
<v Speaker 0>blah blah blah.

00:27:19.955 --> 00:27:20.595
<v Speaker 0>And

00:27:20.995 --> 00:27:22.434
<v Speaker 0>I think it's

00:27:23.875 --> 00:27:25.155
<v Speaker 0>just exec

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:27.090
<v Speaker 0>and then

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:30.130
<v Speaker 0>true.

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:34.770
<v Speaker 0>We'll make it up there. Okay.

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:36.210
<v Speaker 0>Oops.

00:27:38.535 --> 00:27:39.975
<v Speaker 0>Remember when I said I wasn't gonna use

00:27:39.975 --> 00:27:42.934
<v Speaker 0>a docs? Well, that was naive to exec

00:27:45.175 --> 00:27:46.215
<v Speaker 0>command.

00:27:46.295 --> 00:27:47.575
<v Speaker 0>So close.

00:27:49.415 --> 00:27:50.135
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:27:51.495 --> 00:27:53.015
<v Speaker 0>And this is just returning true.

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.790
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:58.830
<v Speaker 0>And it wanted a

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:00.429
<v Speaker 0>readiness probe

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:04.030
<v Speaker 0>get

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:06.750
<v Speaker 0>URL

00:28:09.865 --> 00:28:11.065
<v Speaker 0>Copy paste.

00:28:15.304 --> 00:28:17.304
<v Speaker 0>It's actually telling me to

00:28:17.625 --> 00:28:19.065
<v Speaker 0>use w get.

00:28:20.024 --> 00:28:20.424
<v Speaker 0>Why?

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.800
<v Speaker 0>We get Oh, because that's only gonna Of

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.360
<v Speaker 0>course.

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:32.040
<v Speaker 0>Because you can't provide an absolute URL here.

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.120
<v Speaker 0>It only hits your actual pod.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.240
<v Speaker 0>Of course it is.

00:28:39.355 --> 00:28:40.475
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So

00:28:41.195 --> 00:28:43.515
<v Speaker 0>I'm feeling to be able to do. Let's

00:28:43.515 --> 00:28:44.634
<v Speaker 0>do the exact

00:28:45.595 --> 00:28:46.394
<v Speaker 0>command.

00:28:46.955 --> 00:28:48.394
<v Speaker 0>This is actually a

00:28:48.635 --> 00:28:49.115
<v Speaker 0>list.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.299
<v Speaker 0>As is this, I'm gonna change syntax just

00:28:54.299 --> 00:28:56.379
<v Speaker 0>to make it confusing for everyone.

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:57.899
<v Speaker 0>W get

00:28:58.379 --> 00:28:59.099
<v Speaker 0>this.

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:02.620
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So start the pod, confirm that it

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:05.419
<v Speaker 0>never gets ready because of this command here.

00:29:07.585 --> 00:29:08.705
<v Speaker 0>Q four.

00:29:15.105 --> 00:29:16.864
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So that is running,

00:29:17.265 --> 00:29:20.065
<v Speaker 0>and we should not really see any updates

00:29:20.065 --> 00:29:21.024
<v Speaker 0>for that to change.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.120
<v Speaker 0>May have been smart for me to set

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.559
<v Speaker 0>it then really quickly so we can get

00:29:24.559 --> 00:29:26.799
<v Speaker 0>through the three adaptations, but I'm pretty confident

00:29:26.799 --> 00:29:28.799
<v Speaker 0>that is not gonna update because I trust

00:29:28.799 --> 00:29:30.080
<v Speaker 0>the exam question.

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.360
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So now we wanna create a second

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.440
<v Speaker 0>pod called I am ready. Looks like the

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.575
<v Speaker 0>image is potentially the same. We want to

00:29:37.575 --> 00:29:38.534
<v Speaker 0>add a label.

00:29:41.495 --> 00:29:43.415
<v Speaker 0>They already exist in service service. I'm not

00:29:43.415 --> 00:29:45.495
<v Speaker 0>ready. It should now have that second. Okay.

00:29:45.495 --> 00:29:46.935
<v Speaker 0>So now we're just checking that we can

00:29:46.935 --> 00:29:48.695
<v Speaker 0>add a new pod with the right label,

00:29:48.695 --> 00:29:49.815
<v Speaker 0>which is going to be in the selector

00:29:49.815 --> 00:29:50.455
<v Speaker 0>in our service.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.919
<v Speaker 0>We'll call this Q4,

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.760
<v Speaker 0>Q 4 2.

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.400
<v Speaker 0>So what was different here? Am I ready?

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:04.440
<v Speaker 0>Yes. Am I ready?

00:30:05.995 --> 00:30:08.234
<v Speaker 0>Some of the default namespace is correct.

00:30:08.715 --> 00:30:10.075
<v Speaker 0>Image is the same.

00:30:11.755 --> 00:30:12.794
<v Speaker 0>Labels.

00:30:15.115 --> 00:30:16.554
<v Speaker 0>That's the labels on that.

00:30:20.899 --> 00:30:23.059
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, it's just apologies about deployment.

00:30:25.379 --> 00:30:26.259
<v Speaker 0>Labels

00:30:28.179 --> 00:30:29.059
<v Speaker 0>ID

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:30.179
<v Speaker 0>cross

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:31.779
<v Speaker 0>server ready.

00:30:34.755 --> 00:30:36.434
<v Speaker 0>Doesn't ask for any probes.

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.340
<v Speaker 0>Running, ready,

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:50.380
<v Speaker 0>describe.

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.540
<v Speaker 0>Let's get the services first.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.020
<v Speaker 0>Describe service.

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.179
<v Speaker 0>I have a quick No.

00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:59.500
<v Speaker 0>Let's get that enabled next.

00:31:02.034 --> 00:31:02.754
<v Speaker 0>And

00:31:02.835 --> 00:31:04.274
<v Speaker 0>we have our endpoint.

00:31:04.355 --> 00:31:05.315
<v Speaker 0>Looking good.

00:31:06.034 --> 00:31:06.835
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:31:06.835 --> 00:31:07.794
<v Speaker 0>Source.

00:31:08.595 --> 00:31:09.394
<v Speaker 0>Control

00:31:09.794 --> 00:31:10.835
<v Speaker 0>completion

00:31:10.914 --> 00:31:11.635
<v Speaker 0>bash.

00:31:20.809 --> 00:31:21.450
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:31:21.929 --> 00:31:22.729
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:31:23.769 --> 00:31:24.809
<v Speaker 0>Like that one.

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:27.130
<v Speaker 0>Question five.

00:31:28.645 --> 00:31:30.245
<v Speaker 0>It says I've got ninety three minutes left.

00:31:30.245 --> 00:31:31.925
<v Speaker 0>I'm only gonna be streaming for another thirty.

00:31:31.925 --> 00:31:33.125
<v Speaker 0>So we'll see how far we get through

00:31:33.125 --> 00:31:34.565
<v Speaker 0>and then I'll try and pick it up

00:31:34.565 --> 00:31:35.205
<v Speaker 0>again

00:31:35.685 --> 00:31:38.485
<v Speaker 0>after I've had lunch with my daughter.

00:31:39.285 --> 00:31:40.645
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Same context.

00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:45.269
<v Speaker 0>There are various pods in all namespaces. No

00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:48.549
<v Speaker 0>shit. Write a command into fame pods, which

00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:50.789
<v Speaker 0>was all the pods sorted by their age.

00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:51.589
<v Speaker 0>Who

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.870
<v Speaker 0>remembers

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:53.589
<v Speaker 0>this?

00:31:54.549 --> 00:31:56.070
<v Speaker 0>Alex is gonna give me any trouble if

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:57.429
<v Speaker 0>I don't use

00:31:57.184 --> 00:31:58.304
<v Speaker 0>commands, but

00:31:58.865 --> 00:32:02.065
<v Speaker 0>more like this through bash and sort and

00:32:02.065 --> 00:32:02.624
<v Speaker 0>stuff.

00:32:03.585 --> 00:32:05.025
<v Speaker 0>So first thing we want to do is

00:32:05.025 --> 00:32:06.225
<v Speaker 0>get all pods

00:32:09.425 --> 00:32:10.144
<v Speaker 0>wide.

00:32:10.545 --> 00:32:11.985
<v Speaker 0>Do we even need,

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.480
<v Speaker 0>we get the time already, don't we? Yeah.

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:17.039
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:32:19.679 --> 00:32:22.480
<v Speaker 0>Get pods help. Let's do this nice way.

00:32:25.085 --> 00:32:25.804
<v Speaker 0>So

00:32:25.885 --> 00:32:26.765
<v Speaker 0>start by

00:32:31.965 --> 00:32:33.565
<v Speaker 0>I don't think these flags are good for

00:32:33.565 --> 00:32:34.524
<v Speaker 0>certification.

00:32:37.565 --> 00:32:38.605
<v Speaker 0>Not that important.

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:42.640
<v Speaker 0>Network?

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.680
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. They're not enough of that coder anymore.

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.560
<v Speaker 0>Alright. And write the command into a file.

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.080
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.200
<v Speaker 0>Alt

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.400
<v Speaker 0>course five.

00:32:58.375 --> 00:33:00.375
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:33:05.015 --> 00:33:06.455
<v Speaker 0>Right. Second command,

00:33:06.855 --> 00:33:09.415
<v Speaker 0>which lists all the pods sorted by

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:16.470
<v Speaker 0>metadata UID using kubectl sorting for both commands.

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:19.270
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So I was actually making sure I

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:20.149
<v Speaker 0>used that.

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:22.470
<v Speaker 0>So this is

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:24.710
<v Speaker 0>find pods

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:25.830
<v Speaker 0>UID

00:33:27.965 --> 00:33:29.004
<v Speaker 0>UID.

00:33:33.404 --> 00:33:34.445
<v Speaker 0>Thank you.

00:33:39.565 --> 00:33:40.684
<v Speaker 0>That's my other one.

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:47.100
<v Speaker 0>Thomas laugh, nice catch. I forgot the all

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:47.820
<v Speaker 0>pods

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:49.340
<v Speaker 0>in my commands.

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:53.340
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's run off course five fame pods

00:33:55.405 --> 00:33:57.245
<v Speaker 0>and find pods,

00:33:57.805 --> 00:33:58.605
<v Speaker 0>UID.

00:34:02.045 --> 00:34:02.765
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:34:03.005 --> 00:34:05.645
<v Speaker 0>Maybe I messed something up there. Seems okay.

00:34:05.885 --> 00:34:07.405
<v Speaker 0>Oh, 8%.

00:34:07.645 --> 00:34:07.965
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:11.690
<v Speaker 0>Create a new persistent volume

00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:14.489
<v Speaker 0>named Safari PV. I should have a capacity

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:17.210
<v Speaker 0>of two gigabit access

00:34:17.609 --> 00:34:20.570
<v Speaker 0>mode to readwrite once host path. Hey.

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:23.130
<v Speaker 0>And no storage class name defined.

00:34:23.675 --> 00:34:26.155
<v Speaker 0>Create a new persistent volume claim

00:34:27.435 --> 00:34:29.835
<v Speaker 0>to claim the persistent volume.

00:34:33.114 --> 00:34:33.835
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:34:35.195 --> 00:34:37.355
<v Speaker 0>Let's see if we have any PVs, PVCs.

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.280
<v Speaker 0>Definitely

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.880
<v Speaker 0>copy and paste in this at the docs

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:41.520
<v Speaker 0>then.

00:34:42.559 --> 00:34:43.119
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.560
<v Speaker 0>Well, this is question

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:49.679
<v Speaker 0>six

00:34:49.839 --> 00:34:50.719
<v Speaker 0>then

00:34:52.674 --> 00:34:54.755
<v Speaker 0>q six. I just need to create them.

00:34:54.755 --> 00:34:56.355
<v Speaker 0>I don't need to store the YAML anywhere.

00:34:56.355 --> 00:34:57.395
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Nice.

00:34:57.795 --> 00:34:59.154
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we'll just do this all in

00:34:59.154 --> 00:35:01.635
<v Speaker 0>a one hour. Q six dot YAML.

00:35:03.154 --> 00:35:04.595
<v Speaker 0>Copy some YAML.

00:35:04.595 --> 00:35:05.555
<v Speaker 0>Assistant

00:35:06.515 --> 00:35:06.835
<v Speaker 0>volume.

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:13.050
<v Speaker 0>Show me the ammo.

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:21.210
<v Speaker 0>Got one with everything?

00:35:22.315 --> 00:35:22.955
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:35:27.275 --> 00:35:28.635
<v Speaker 0>K. One at a time.

00:35:31.515 --> 00:35:33.915
<v Speaker 0>Messed my Versus Code Editor, which has OO

00:35:33.915 --> 00:35:36.315
<v Speaker 0>Complete and generation for all of this.

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:42.040
<v Speaker 0>Okay. What are we calling this?

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:43.000
<v Speaker 0>Safari

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:44.760
<v Speaker 0>PV

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:48.840
<v Speaker 0>two, read write once.

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.400
<v Speaker 0>Don't need anything else.

00:35:52.505 --> 00:35:54.665
<v Speaker 0>Yama multi lane and that we need to

00:35:54.665 --> 00:35:55.385
<v Speaker 0>claim

00:35:59.065 --> 00:35:59.705
<v Speaker 0>as such.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.040
<v Speaker 0>And

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.480
<v Speaker 0>we're calling this,

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.720
<v Speaker 0>oh wait, host path here. I'll fix that

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:10.520
<v Speaker 0>in a second.

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:13.559
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:36:13.559 --> 00:36:13.960
<v Speaker 0>So,

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.040
<v Speaker 0>oh no, we're in a namespace.

00:36:20.095 --> 00:36:21.215
<v Speaker 0>Safari

00:36:21.375 --> 00:36:22.175
<v Speaker 0>PVC

00:36:22.654 --> 00:36:23.775
<v Speaker 0>namespace.

00:36:25.454 --> 00:36:27.214
<v Speaker 0>Project Tiger, nice name.

00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:37.530
<v Speaker 0>Don't define the storage class name.

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:41.610
<v Speaker 0>I don't want, don't need volume mode either.

00:36:44.065 --> 00:36:46.625
<v Speaker 0>And

00:36:46.785 --> 00:36:48.865
<v Speaker 0>how do we define host path?

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:06.310
<v Speaker 0>Just a little path. Okay.

00:37:09.605 --> 00:37:11.285
<v Speaker 0>PostPath.

00:37:12.484 --> 00:37:13.125
<v Speaker 0>Volumes.

00:37:14.565 --> 00:37:15.684
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if that's supposed to be

00:37:15.684 --> 00:37:18.244
<v Speaker 0>a joke with it slash volumes capital V.

00:37:18.244 --> 00:37:19.765
<v Speaker 0>Maybe it's like trying to pretend it's a

00:37:19.765 --> 00:37:20.325
<v Speaker 0>Mac.

00:37:20.565 --> 00:37:22.484
<v Speaker 0>Never seen that on a Linux system before.

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:25.660
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's make sure I've not messed this

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:28.060
<v Speaker 0>up. So we created a persistent volume called

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:29.260
<v Speaker 0>Safari PV.

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:31.820
<v Speaker 0>It's got two Gebi bits.

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:33.100
<v Speaker 0>Gebi bits.

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.540
<v Speaker 0>We've got a host path of volumes data

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:38.325
<v Speaker 0>with an access mode to read write once.

00:37:38.325 --> 00:37:40.405
<v Speaker 0>We then want a PVC within a namespace,

00:37:40.405 --> 00:37:43.205
<v Speaker 0>which we've got the same size, same mode,

00:37:43.205 --> 00:37:44.565
<v Speaker 0>no storage class.

00:37:45.765 --> 00:37:47.365
<v Speaker 0>Oh, and you want a deployment.

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.339
<v Speaker 0>Am I gonna type a deployment?

00:37:57.859 --> 00:37:58.099
<v Speaker 0>Well,

00:38:03.995 --> 00:38:06.475
<v Speaker 0>guess we're converting a pod to deployment. Okay.

00:38:11.195 --> 00:38:12.315
<v Speaker 0>Deploy.

00:38:14.475 --> 00:38:17.835
<v Speaker 0>And we wanna call this

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:17.480
<v Speaker 0>Safari

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.560
<v Speaker 0>and same namespace.

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.480
<v Speaker 0>Really I should have created some of these

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.280
<v Speaker 0>first.

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:24.200
<v Speaker 0>Yeah,

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:26.200
<v Speaker 0>I should be using kubectl explain.

00:38:31.975 --> 00:38:32.695
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:38:32.855 --> 00:38:34.295
<v Speaker 0>Now we need to convert this pod to

00:38:34.295 --> 00:38:37.255
<v Speaker 0>deployment. So that goes away. We've got spec

00:38:37.655 --> 00:38:38.775
<v Speaker 0>template

00:38:40.295 --> 00:38:41.495
<v Speaker 0>spec

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:44.840
<v Speaker 0>selector

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.680
<v Speaker 0>and oh too much.

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.280
<v Speaker 0>Oh, it's set.

00:38:59.325 --> 00:39:01.725
<v Speaker 0>TS, let's say you set a tab size.

00:39:07.805 --> 00:39:10.045
<v Speaker 0>Let me just do this the slow manual

00:39:10.045 --> 00:39:10.525
<v Speaker 0>way.

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:15.250
<v Speaker 0>Why is that x four? X three?

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:19.410
<v Speaker 0>So, yeah.

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:20.450
<v Speaker 0>It's a small x.

00:39:23.895 --> 00:39:24.615
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:39:26.535 --> 00:39:27.255
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:39:30.135 --> 00:39:30.855
<v Speaker 0>Image.

00:39:30.935 --> 00:39:33.255
<v Speaker 0>I don't think care about the names.

00:39:33.495 --> 00:39:35.655
<v Speaker 0>So let's call this HTTP because it's the

00:39:35.655 --> 00:39:38.215
<v Speaker 0>image at least at once. That one's HTTP

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:40.870
<v Speaker 0>two four four one

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:41.830
<v Speaker 0>Alpine.

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:43.830
<v Speaker 0>No command.

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:46.950
<v Speaker 0>It wants to mount our PV, which would

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:48.070
<v Speaker 0>leave a code.

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:50.150
<v Speaker 0>This is a host path

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:51.510
<v Speaker 0>and

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:52.870
<v Speaker 0>it's going to fix that.

00:39:54.525 --> 00:39:56.205
<v Speaker 0>And we're mounting to

00:39:58.684 --> 00:39:59.645
<v Speaker 0>temp

00:39:59.964 --> 00:40:01.405
<v Speaker 0>Safari data.

00:40:03.325 --> 00:40:05.405
<v Speaker 0>Maybe it's a Mac joke. It's called Safari.

00:40:06.285 --> 00:40:08.045
<v Speaker 0>Alright. This volume

00:40:08.365 --> 00:40:09.565
<v Speaker 0>is

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.990
<v Speaker 0>who knows?

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:17.430
<v Speaker 0>The fatty

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.910
<v Speaker 0>PVC.

00:40:23.265 --> 00:40:24.865
<v Speaker 0>Can't remember if it has claim name or

00:40:24.865 --> 00:40:26.145
<v Speaker 0>if it's something else.

00:40:27.665 --> 00:40:29.825
<v Speaker 0>Course, persistent volume claim and then the claim

00:40:29.825 --> 00:40:30.465
<v Speaker 0>name.

00:40:31.744 --> 00:40:33.185
<v Speaker 0>Persistent

00:40:33.425 --> 00:40:34.225
<v Speaker 0>volume

00:40:34.464 --> 00:40:34.785
<v Speaker 0>claim.

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:47.240
<v Speaker 0>This could blow up.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:48.760
<v Speaker 0>I have no idea.

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:51.000
<v Speaker 0>Draps.

00:40:52.935 --> 00:40:54.775
<v Speaker 0>It did blow up. Okay. Converting the channel

00:40:54.775 --> 00:40:56.455
<v Speaker 0>to JSON line 12.

00:40:59.975 --> 00:41:02.295
<v Speaker 0>I've got any more than that. I cannot

00:41:02.295 --> 00:41:04.055
<v Speaker 0>find expected colon.

00:41:05.815 --> 00:41:06.855
<v Speaker 0>Anchor saying

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:09.350
<v Speaker 0>feels good to watch someone else think.

00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:12.470
<v Speaker 0>Thanks. I'm doing my best.

00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:16.150
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:18.390
<v Speaker 0>Debugging at all is not something I want

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.870
<v Speaker 0>to be doing.

00:41:22.365 --> 00:41:23.885
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So this, these

00:41:25.725 --> 00:41:27.965
<v Speaker 0>board dashes. I'm on chat. Should be all

00:41:27.965 --> 00:41:28.685
<v Speaker 0>over that.

00:41:29.565 --> 00:41:32.365
<v Speaker 0>At least now it's something else, but okay.

00:41:32.365 --> 00:41:35.405
<v Speaker 0>So it's telling me that my persistent volume

00:41:35.405 --> 00:41:38.180
<v Speaker 0>and valid type host path volume source got

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:40.020
<v Speaker 0>a string expected to map.

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:42.900
<v Speaker 0>Okay, what did I get wrong with the

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:43.780
<v Speaker 0>host path?

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:47.940
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, let's use the explain.

00:41:50.085 --> 00:41:52.805
<v Speaker 0>So this is our persistent volume spec host

00:41:52.805 --> 00:41:55.925
<v Speaker 0>path. So we can do k explain

00:41:56.565 --> 00:41:58.165
<v Speaker 0>PV spec

00:41:59.925 --> 00:42:01.205
<v Speaker 0>host path and

00:42:02.244 --> 00:42:04.964
<v Speaker 0>it just expects there to be a path.

00:42:08.099 --> 00:42:10.340
<v Speaker 0>Easy when you know how.

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:15.220
<v Speaker 0>And let's try.

00:42:18.345 --> 00:42:23.145
<v Speaker 0>Silly

00:42:23.705 --> 00:42:25.545
<v Speaker 0>apps v one.

00:42:28.905 --> 00:42:29.945
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I

00:42:30.505 --> 00:42:31.785
<v Speaker 0>was gonna say better. I mean, that is

00:42:31.785 --> 00:42:32.105
<v Speaker 0>better.

00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:34.589
<v Speaker 0>I didn't add a selector.

00:42:34.589 --> 00:42:35.150
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:38.830
<v Speaker 0>Labels,

00:42:40.109 --> 00:42:40.670
<v Speaker 0>name

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:42.030
<v Speaker 0>Safari,

00:42:42.109 --> 00:42:43.069
<v Speaker 0>templates back.

00:42:47.385 --> 00:42:48.585
<v Speaker 0>Selector

00:42:50.745 --> 00:42:52.025
<v Speaker 0>match labels

00:42:54.105 --> 00:42:55.065
<v Speaker 0>name,

00:42:55.625 --> 00:42:56.105
<v Speaker 0>and

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:06.119
<v Speaker 0>gonna get something wrong.

00:43:06.839 --> 00:43:07.560
<v Speaker 0>Name

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:08.839
<v Speaker 0>Safari.

00:43:13.255 --> 00:43:15.495
<v Speaker 0>Quickly. Why is that? Don't have much time.

00:43:16.855 --> 00:43:18.615
<v Speaker 0>But it's not labels on the top level.

00:43:18.615 --> 00:43:20.935
<v Speaker 0>Right? Is it? Matadea labels.

00:43:21.015 --> 00:43:21.415
<v Speaker 0>Select

00:43:23.335 --> 00:43:24.295
<v Speaker 0>or match labels.

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:27.060
<v Speaker 0>Method, oh, got it the wrong way,

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:28.020
<v Speaker 0>Kinda.

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:29.859
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:43:31.059 --> 00:43:33.140
<v Speaker 0>So this is the selector

00:43:35.299 --> 00:43:36.660
<v Speaker 0>match labels,

00:43:39.755 --> 00:43:41.115
<v Speaker 0>templates back,

00:43:41.194 --> 00:43:42.075
<v Speaker 0>metadata

00:43:42.075 --> 00:43:44.155
<v Speaker 0>label. Yeah, of course it is.

00:43:45.115 --> 00:43:47.435
<v Speaker 0>This is the, we applied to pods.

00:43:49.755 --> 00:43:51.115
<v Speaker 0>Spacing looks wrong.

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:01.660
<v Speaker 0>Unknown field metadata.

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:02.780
<v Speaker 0>I just looked you up.

00:44:03.655 --> 00:44:04.855
<v Speaker 0>Template spec.

00:44:05.495 --> 00:44:07.015
<v Speaker 0>Template spec metadata.

00:44:07.975 --> 00:44:09.015
<v Speaker 0>Template meta.

00:44:10.375 --> 00:44:12.135
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. This because

00:44:12.215 --> 00:44:13.495
<v Speaker 0>it's above that.

00:44:13.895 --> 00:44:15.575
<v Speaker 0>Like, I was actually typing a real pod.

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:17.250
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:23.250
<v Speaker 0>Let's

00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:24.130
<v Speaker 0>check.

00:44:24.690 --> 00:44:27.010
<v Speaker 0>This was a namespace, wasn't it? Projects

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:28.690
<v Speaker 0>Tiger project.

00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:30.130
<v Speaker 0>Pvb.

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:30.290
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:44:31.755 --> 00:44:32.555
<v Speaker 0>That is

00:44:33.355 --> 00:44:34.155
<v Speaker 0>perfect.

00:44:34.714 --> 00:44:36.635
<v Speaker 0>What I'm looking for here

00:44:37.035 --> 00:44:38.714
<v Speaker 0>is just these status

00:44:38.954 --> 00:44:41.515
<v Speaker 0>bound. That means they're connected, they're working.

00:44:42.315 --> 00:44:44.075
<v Speaker 0>What I don't wanna see is I get

00:44:44.075 --> 00:44:47.035
<v Speaker 0>pods and something set in impending because it

00:44:47.035 --> 00:44:48.710
<v Speaker 0>can't do anything.

00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:50.950
<v Speaker 0>All is good running.

00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:54.390
<v Speaker 0>We can always describe it if we were

00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:55.350
<v Speaker 0>cautious.

00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:57.910
<v Speaker 0>Tiger

00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:01.030
<v Speaker 0>describe pod. We should have auto complete.

00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:02.390
<v Speaker 0>Nope.

00:45:06.125 --> 00:45:06.925
<v Speaker 0>And

00:45:07.805 --> 00:45:09.085
<v Speaker 0>we got our volume.

00:45:09.165 --> 00:45:10.125
<v Speaker 0>Looks good.

00:45:10.445 --> 00:45:11.165
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:45:13.805 --> 00:45:14.765
<v Speaker 0>I think that's alright.

00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:19.230
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So I wonder how many questions there

00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:21.150
<v Speaker 0>are. I really should look that up because

00:45:21.310 --> 00:45:22.990
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure what I'll get through. Maybe

00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:24.430
<v Speaker 0>maybe one or two more.

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:26.910
<v Speaker 0>K. This is a one percenter, so the

00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:28.510
<v Speaker 0>matrix server hasn't been installed yet in the

00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:30.030
<v Speaker 0>cluster, but it's something that should be done

00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:33.485
<v Speaker 0>soon. Your college would already like to know

00:45:33.485 --> 00:45:36.525
<v Speaker 0>the kubectl commands too. Show

00:45:36.525 --> 00:45:37.405
<v Speaker 0>node

00:45:37.725 --> 00:45:38.525
<v Speaker 0>resource

00:45:38.525 --> 00:45:39.485
<v Speaker 0>usage.

00:45:43.405 --> 00:45:45.830
<v Speaker 0>Show pod under container. I mean, that's not

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:47.590
<v Speaker 0>gonna work with the metric server.

00:45:51.590 --> 00:45:52.950
<v Speaker 0>Just want the command.

00:45:57.655 --> 00:45:58.935
<v Speaker 0>Sure. Why not?

00:45:59.975 --> 00:46:00.775
<v Speaker 0>Course

00:46:00.775 --> 00:46:01.495
<v Speaker 0>seven.

00:46:01.575 --> 00:46:02.935
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if it wants me

00:46:03.895 --> 00:46:05.975
<v Speaker 0>to install metric server.

00:46:09.415 --> 00:46:11.015
<v Speaker 0>It just wants the commands. Okay.

00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:15.570
<v Speaker 0>So this will be kubectl top node

00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:18.050
<v Speaker 0>pod.

00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:22.130
<v Speaker 0>Don't know if I'm oversimplifying

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:23.010
<v Speaker 0>this one.

00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:24.530
<v Speaker 0>Well,

00:46:25.275 --> 00:46:26.555
<v Speaker 0>we'll just keep moving.

00:46:27.115 --> 00:46:28.714
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. But before I get to the end,

00:46:28.714 --> 00:46:30.075
<v Speaker 0>well, I think I can actually go in

00:46:30.075 --> 00:46:31.595
<v Speaker 0>the actions here and just say like, you

00:46:31.595 --> 00:46:33.435
<v Speaker 0>know, get my get my score.

00:46:35.275 --> 00:46:35.994
<v Speaker 0>So if we don't

00:46:36.555 --> 00:46:38.075
<v Speaker 0>Woah,

00:46:38.075 --> 00:46:39.674
<v Speaker 0>there's 25 questions

00:46:41.369 --> 00:46:43.369
<v Speaker 0>And I've got plenty of time but not

00:46:43.369 --> 00:46:45.049
<v Speaker 0>actually got plenty of time. So maybe

00:46:46.009 --> 00:46:48.010
<v Speaker 0>I think if I click show answers

00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:49.450
<v Speaker 0>and score,

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:54.650
<v Speaker 0>I don't think I can come back and

00:46:53.655 --> 00:46:55.335
<v Speaker 0>do it again, but I do have thirty

00:46:55.335 --> 00:46:57.255
<v Speaker 0>six hours. So I'm tempted to just, you

00:46:57.255 --> 00:46:58.855
<v Speaker 0>know, do the next question and then maybe

00:46:58.855 --> 00:47:00.935
<v Speaker 0>just, like, drop out and then do a

00:47:00.935 --> 00:47:01.735
<v Speaker 0>part two.

00:47:03.415 --> 00:47:05.255
<v Speaker 0>But I also kinda wanna know if I'm

00:47:05.255 --> 00:47:06.055
<v Speaker 0>getting shit right.

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:08.440
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:10.120
<v Speaker 0>Let's see. Let's see where we are in

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:13.160
<v Speaker 0>five minutes. Okay. So we wanna SSH in

00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:14.760
<v Speaker 0>to the master

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:16.600
<v Speaker 0>why does it keep calling it master control

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:17.400
<v Speaker 0>plane node?

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:20.615
<v Speaker 0>SSH onto a control plane node with this.

00:47:20.615 --> 00:47:22.694
<v Speaker 0>Let me send a feedback to update that.

00:47:22.694 --> 00:47:24.455
<v Speaker 0>Come on. We're past this now.

00:47:27.095 --> 00:47:29.974
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Check how the control plane components keep

00:47:30.135 --> 00:47:31.255
<v Speaker 0>ah, see, I love it when I get

00:47:31.255 --> 00:47:32.615
<v Speaker 0>to deal with the control plane components.

00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:34.890
<v Speaker 0>I think it'd be, that's a clustered episode

00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:35.610
<v Speaker 0>right there.

00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:38.650
<v Speaker 0>Check how the mass control plane components, the

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:40.330
<v Speaker 0>kubelet, the API server, the schedule and the

00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:42.170
<v Speaker 0>cube controller manager and SSE are starting and

00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:44.250
<v Speaker 0>installed on the control plane node. Also find

00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:46.970
<v Speaker 0>that name of the DNS application and how

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:48.365
<v Speaker 0>it started Awesome.

00:47:48.365 --> 00:47:49.645
<v Speaker 0>This is just a

00:47:50.204 --> 00:47:51.565
<v Speaker 0>health check of the components.

00:47:51.724 --> 00:47:52.205
<v Speaker 0>So

00:47:53.085 --> 00:47:54.925
<v Speaker 0>what I would expect, in fact, we can

00:47:54.925 --> 00:47:56.845
<v Speaker 0>check if this is a QVDM cluster,

00:47:57.565 --> 00:47:59.805
<v Speaker 0>but just really take a look here. And

00:47:59.805 --> 00:48:01.244
<v Speaker 0>whenever I see admin.conf,

00:48:02.609 --> 00:48:04.210
<v Speaker 0>usually a really good indicator this is the

00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:05.890
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes cluster, which means

00:48:06.849 --> 00:48:10.049
<v Speaker 0>we're gonna have our kubelet started via systemd,

00:48:10.049 --> 00:48:11.010
<v Speaker 0>which we do.

00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:13.650
<v Speaker 0>Next we check for the static

00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:14.930
<v Speaker 0>manifest paths.

00:48:16.375 --> 00:48:19.015
<v Speaker 0>You can see here, we've got etcd, API

00:48:19.015 --> 00:48:21.895
<v Speaker 0>server control manager scheduler, scheduler special

00:48:22.055 --> 00:48:22.935
<v Speaker 0>running.

00:48:23.255 --> 00:48:25.575
<v Speaker 0>And now we want to,

00:48:25.895 --> 00:48:27.335
<v Speaker 0>I think what it wants us to do

00:48:27.335 --> 00:48:29.335
<v Speaker 0>here is to know that we can do

00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:31.980
<v Speaker 0>admin dot conf as a way to query

00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:33.740
<v Speaker 0>cluster.

00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:36.940
<v Speaker 0>We can also do a get system, get

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:38.780
<v Speaker 0>pods, and we're looking for the core DNS

00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:41.020
<v Speaker 0>pod or maybe it's kubed DNS, but I

00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:42.860
<v Speaker 0>don't know. Yeah. There we go. Core DNS.

00:48:44.055 --> 00:48:46.455
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Write your findings into this,

00:48:46.535 --> 00:48:48.375
<v Speaker 0>should be structured like so.

00:48:48.775 --> 00:48:50.055
<v Speaker 0>Let's copy it.

00:48:51.494 --> 00:48:52.695
<v Speaker 0>So opt

00:48:53.494 --> 00:48:54.295
<v Speaker 0>course

00:48:54.615 --> 00:48:55.415
<v Speaker 0>eight

00:48:55.895 --> 00:48:58.535
<v Speaker 0>master

00:48:57.260 --> 00:48:58.860
<v Speaker 0>component for text.

00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:00.860
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:49:01.099 --> 00:49:02.620
<v Speaker 0>So kubelet

00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:04.300
<v Speaker 0>systemd.

00:49:09.339 --> 00:49:09.660
<v Speaker 0>Pod?

00:49:10.235 --> 00:49:11.355
<v Speaker 0>Static pod?

00:49:13.275 --> 00:49:14.155
<v Speaker 0>Pathway.

00:49:14.555 --> 00:49:15.675
<v Speaker 0>Read the docs.

00:49:16.235 --> 00:49:20.715
<v Speaker 0>Not installed. Process. Static pod. Okay. Cool. Static

00:49:20.715 --> 00:49:21.195
<v Speaker 0>pod.

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:29.520
<v Speaker 0>That's pod. That's pod. That's pod. Static pod.

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:32.240
<v Speaker 0>And

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:33.600
<v Speaker 0>pod

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:35.040
<v Speaker 0>coordinates.

00:49:39.105 --> 00:49:40.865
<v Speaker 0>Even though the pods aren't actually called core

00:49:40.865 --> 00:49:41.585
<v Speaker 0>DNS,

00:49:41.745 --> 00:49:43.825
<v Speaker 0>the deployment is. I think that's okay.

00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:54.610
<v Speaker 0>Root.

00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:02.450
<v Speaker 0>Help.

00:50:07.995 --> 00:50:09.115
<v Speaker 0>Opt course.

00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:21.380
<v Speaker 0>Is it because I'm, does it want me

00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:23.540
<v Speaker 0>to do it in the SSH or does

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:25.460
<v Speaker 0>it want me to do it on my

00:50:29.085 --> 00:50:30.205
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Okay.

00:50:30.845 --> 00:50:32.365
<v Speaker 0>Let's grab my,

00:50:34.605 --> 00:50:35.645
<v Speaker 0>I think

00:50:36.605 --> 00:50:38.205
<v Speaker 0>it wants me to come out of the

00:50:38.205 --> 00:50:39.245
<v Speaker 0>SSH

00:50:40.445 --> 00:50:42.205
<v Speaker 0>course eight

00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:43.750
<v Speaker 0>master.

00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:46.150
<v Speaker 0>It should make that more clear. I could

00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:47.190
<v Speaker 0>trip people up.

00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.910
<v Speaker 0>Next.

00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:52.789
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:50:52.789 --> 00:50:53.510
<v Speaker 0>So,

00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:55.990
<v Speaker 0>oh, new context. Not the same context.

00:50:57.795 --> 00:50:58.995
<v Speaker 0>Hello, new cluster.

00:51:07.234 --> 00:51:08.035
<v Speaker 0>Okay,

00:51:08.275 --> 00:51:10.835
<v Speaker 0>Navin says that my kubelet type is not

00:51:10.835 --> 00:51:12.115
<v Speaker 0>systemd in process.

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:14.460
<v Speaker 0>Thank

00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:17.820
<v Speaker 0>you.

00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:21.180
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I think I should get extra

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:22.860
<v Speaker 0>points for writing systemd,

00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:23.420
<v Speaker 0>but

00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:25.900
<v Speaker 0>let's leave it like this.

00:51:27.425 --> 00:51:30.385
<v Speaker 0>Thank you for that. Good catch. Alright. 9.

00:51:30.385 --> 00:51:32.225
<v Speaker 0>We've already switched context.

00:51:32.945 --> 00:51:35.825
<v Speaker 0>We're gonna ask the station to cluster two,

00:51:36.225 --> 00:51:37.425
<v Speaker 0>cluster one.

00:51:38.705 --> 00:51:41.265
<v Speaker 0>Temporarily stop the cube scheduler.

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:42.200
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:51:42.599 --> 00:51:45.000
<v Speaker 0>Is it a static manifest on this cluster?

00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:47.160
<v Speaker 0>It is.

00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:50.599
<v Speaker 0>So temporarily stop the kube scheduler, this means

00:51:50.599 --> 00:51:52.039
<v Speaker 0>in a way that you can start it

00:51:52.039 --> 00:51:52.920
<v Speaker 0>again afterwards.

00:51:53.875 --> 00:51:55.555
<v Speaker 0>So you don't want me to delete the

00:51:55.555 --> 00:51:56.195
<v Speaker 0>file?

00:51:58.835 --> 00:51:59.875
<v Speaker 0>This is a

00:52:00.835 --> 00:52:01.475
<v Speaker 0>pod.

00:52:05.555 --> 00:52:06.435
<v Speaker 0>There stopped.

00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:11.369
<v Speaker 0>Create as

00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:14.330
<v Speaker 0>we should confirm it stopped, really.

00:52:15.130 --> 00:52:16.410
<v Speaker 0>KubeConfig,

00:52:16.650 --> 00:52:17.850
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes,

00:52:19.530 --> 00:52:20.170
<v Speaker 0>and

00:52:20.730 --> 00:52:21.610
<v Speaker 0>KubeSystem,

00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:23.690
<v Speaker 0>pods,

00:52:25.525 --> 00:52:27.125
<v Speaker 0>and we have the scheduler.

00:52:27.845 --> 00:52:30.405
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Create a single pod named manual schedule

00:52:30.405 --> 00:52:32.725
<v Speaker 0>of the image, confirm that it started but

00:52:32.725 --> 00:52:35.445
<v Speaker 0>not scheduled on any node. And now you're

00:52:35.445 --> 00:52:37.445
<v Speaker 0>at the scheduler and have all the power

00:52:37.445 --> 00:52:39.845
<v Speaker 0>manually schedule a pod on that. Okay. So

00:52:39.845 --> 00:52:41.790
<v Speaker 0>now this is one node name.

00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:43.470
<v Speaker 0>This is just showing that

00:52:44.110 --> 00:52:46.110
<v Speaker 0>every put the node name, the scheduler is

00:52:46.110 --> 00:52:48.110
<v Speaker 0>removed from all scheduling decisions,

00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:51.230
<v Speaker 0>bypasses almost everything and just does its thing.

00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:52.270
<v Speaker 0>So

00:52:56.895 --> 00:52:57.615
<v Speaker 0>pod.

00:52:58.175 --> 00:52:59.135
<v Speaker 0>Yaml.

00:52:59.615 --> 00:53:00.895
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna type this.

00:53:04.015 --> 00:53:05.055
<v Speaker 0>V1.

00:53:05.695 --> 00:53:06.095
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:53:08.735 --> 00:53:10.015
<v Speaker 0>We'll go type scrappy.

00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:13.070
<v Speaker 0>Spec.

00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:17.870
<v Speaker 0>Containers.

00:53:21.070 --> 00:53:21.950
<v Speaker 0>Name.

00:53:22.590 --> 00:53:23.150
<v Speaker 0>Image.

00:53:25.815 --> 00:53:28.455
<v Speaker 0>Actually, t p d. It's gonna bug me.

00:53:33.255 --> 00:53:34.295
<v Speaker 0>Manage data.

00:53:35.815 --> 00:53:36.455
<v Speaker 0>Name.

00:53:37.815 --> 00:53:38.695
<v Speaker 0>Manual.

00:53:39.175 --> 00:53:39.415
<v Speaker 0>Schedule.

00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:45.060
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's get our kube control. We don't

00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:47.140
<v Speaker 0>wanna do it in that namespace. Apply our

00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:48.500
<v Speaker 0>pod.yaml.

00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:54.340
<v Speaker 0>Can I not even write a pod now?

00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:55.940
<v Speaker 0>Expect to the map and it got an

00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:56.260
<v Speaker 0>array.

00:53:57.435 --> 00:53:58.155
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

00:53:58.715 --> 00:54:00.315
<v Speaker 0>that's just me being silly.

00:54:04.715 --> 00:54:06.555
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we should see

00:54:10.235 --> 00:54:12.475
<v Speaker 0>that it's pending and unscheduled.

00:54:14.339 --> 00:54:15.859
<v Speaker 0>Pods are immutable.

00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:17.540
<v Speaker 0>Can you change the

00:54:18.099 --> 00:54:21.460
<v Speaker 0>I wonder. Not everything's immutable. Most things

00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:23.299
<v Speaker 0>are immutable.

00:54:27.375 --> 00:54:28.815
<v Speaker 0>So let's try.

00:54:30.975 --> 00:54:32.655
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, immutable.

00:54:33.855 --> 00:54:35.295
<v Speaker 0>So let's

00:54:36.495 --> 00:54:37.215
<v Speaker 0>delete,

00:54:38.895 --> 00:54:39.295
<v Speaker 0>apply,

00:54:41.490 --> 00:54:42.290
<v Speaker 0>get

00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:44.290
<v Speaker 0>running.

00:54:46.290 --> 00:54:47.010
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:49.650
<v Speaker 0>Start the kube scheduler again and confirm. Oh,

00:54:49.650 --> 00:54:50.850
<v Speaker 0>wait, did I miss a step?

00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:54.130
<v Speaker 0>No. Okay. Start the schedule again and confirm

00:54:54.130 --> 00:54:56.615
<v Speaker 0>the scheduler is running and then create a

00:54:56.615 --> 00:54:57.655
<v Speaker 0>second pod.

00:55:00.295 --> 00:55:01.815
<v Speaker 0>We call it manual two.

00:55:06.935 --> 00:55:08.214
<v Speaker 0>Manual schedule

00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:09.130
<v Speaker 0>without

00:55:09.130 --> 00:55:10.330
<v Speaker 0>the node name.

00:55:11.290 --> 00:55:13.050
<v Speaker 0>It should run on a worker because it's

00:55:13.050 --> 00:55:14.730
<v Speaker 0>been scheduled like a normal pod.

00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:17.130
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So move

00:55:21.690 --> 00:55:22.250
<v Speaker 0>here,

00:55:24.315 --> 00:55:25.035
<v Speaker 0>Play

00:55:27.195 --> 00:55:27.915
<v Speaker 0>to

00:55:29.595 --> 00:55:30.635
<v Speaker 0>get pods.

00:55:33.355 --> 00:55:34.795
<v Speaker 0>Maybe you just have to wait a minute

00:55:34.795 --> 00:55:36.795
<v Speaker 0>for the scheduler to come on

00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:38.710
<v Speaker 0>and schedule that.

00:55:42.550 --> 00:55:43.430
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:47.750
<v Speaker 0>And it should be running on

00:55:48.310 --> 00:55:49.110
<v Speaker 0>worker.

00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:51.030
<v Speaker 0>But we can do it. Oh, wait. I'm

00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:53.205
<v Speaker 0>just gonna affect the Vogue SIM then. Okay.

00:55:53.205 --> 00:55:54.405
<v Speaker 0>We're just doing all wide

00:55:54.885 --> 00:55:56.965
<v Speaker 0>and we can see it is on worker

00:55:56.965 --> 00:55:57.525
<v Speaker 0>one.

00:55:59.765 --> 00:56:00.485
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:56:01.605 --> 00:56:03.765
<v Speaker 0>Oh, it's a six percenter and I've got

00:56:03.765 --> 00:56:05.125
<v Speaker 0>a few minutes left.

00:56:06.725 --> 00:56:08.005
<v Speaker 0>Oh, it's decision time.

00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:10.630
<v Speaker 0>Create a service account.

00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:13.510
<v Speaker 0>Again, if I can do it quickly. And

00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:15.030
<v Speaker 0>I'll just come back to that question.

00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:17.350
<v Speaker 0>Create daemon set.

00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:21.110
<v Speaker 0>Create deployment. Yeah, I mean I can do

00:56:21.110 --> 00:56:21.830
<v Speaker 0>that pretty quickly.

00:56:23.655 --> 00:56:25.095
<v Speaker 0>Give me something to just

00:56:25.975 --> 00:56:27.655
<v Speaker 0>create part. A lot of yaml have been

00:56:27.655 --> 00:56:28.855
<v Speaker 0>somewhere around on this.

00:56:29.655 --> 00:56:33.095
<v Speaker 0>Okay. You're estimating the thought information about this

00:56:33.095 --> 00:56:33.735
<v Speaker 0>context.

00:56:37.590 --> 00:56:39.110
<v Speaker 0>Answer five questions.

00:56:40.790 --> 00:56:41.430
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:44.070
<v Speaker 0>I'm not finding a question. I can do

00:56:44.070 --> 00:56:45.670
<v Speaker 0>it in a couple of minutes. So

00:56:48.545 --> 00:56:50.545
<v Speaker 0>I will let the chat decide. Do we

00:56:50.545 --> 00:56:52.944
<v Speaker 0>want my answers and score or am I

00:56:52.944 --> 00:56:54.545
<v Speaker 0>coming back to this later

00:56:54.625 --> 00:56:57.665
<v Speaker 0>with another hour and an attempt to complete

00:56:57.825 --> 00:57:00.785
<v Speaker 0>the last ten ish questions? Yeah. Sixty eight

00:57:00.785 --> 00:57:02.820
<v Speaker 0>minutes left. I'm probably a little bit behind

00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:05.140
<v Speaker 0>where I should be, I think and hope.

00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:06.820
<v Speaker 0>And it's just because I'm talking about it

00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:08.180
<v Speaker 0>as I do it and not just heads

00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:09.220
<v Speaker 0>down, but

00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:12.260
<v Speaker 0>I don't get any strong opinions. Who wants

00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:14.180
<v Speaker 0>to see my score and who wants me

00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:15.300
<v Speaker 0>to come back to this later?

00:57:16.295 --> 00:57:18.135
<v Speaker 0>I will give you thirty seconds.

00:57:24.935 --> 00:57:27.015
<v Speaker 0>Oh, thank you, Naveen, for

00:57:27.655 --> 00:57:30.455
<v Speaker 0>becoming a member. Appreciate that, man. Thanks.

00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:37.320
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Nobody's feeling too chatty.

00:57:44.424 --> 00:57:46.825
<v Speaker 0>Part two please, Thomas laugh.

00:57:47.944 --> 00:57:48.744
<v Speaker 0>Alright,

00:57:48.825 --> 00:57:49.865
<v Speaker 0>you got it.

00:57:51.944 --> 00:57:53.305
<v Speaker 0>Can I pause this?

00:57:56.025 --> 00:57:57.944
<v Speaker 0>Or once you start it, you start it.

00:58:01.890 --> 00:58:03.890
<v Speaker 0>What happens if I just close it? Yeah.

00:58:03.890 --> 00:58:06.050
<v Speaker 0>Let's let's find out. I I I'll just

00:58:11.970 --> 00:58:12.530
<v Speaker 0>leave.

00:58:16.185 --> 00:58:19.065
<v Speaker 0>Listen, I'm worried because there's no explicit

00:58:19.065 --> 00:58:21.625
<v Speaker 0>pause is that it's just gonna time out.

00:58:22.105 --> 00:58:25.464
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I've got I've already spoken to the

00:58:25.464 --> 00:58:27.145
<v Speaker 0>team at color

00:58:26.859 --> 00:58:28.060
<v Speaker 0>shell. I don't know what they call it,

00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:29.660
<v Speaker 0>color dot sh color dot shell.

00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:31.100
<v Speaker 0>They've given me

00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:32.859
<v Speaker 0>credits

00:58:32.859 --> 00:58:34.220
<v Speaker 0>to stream this.

00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:35.340
<v Speaker 0>So

00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:37.740
<v Speaker 0>what I'll do is I will have answers

00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:38.300
<v Speaker 0>and score,

00:58:39.385 --> 00:58:42.025
<v Speaker 0>but I will do a full one completely.

00:58:42.025 --> 00:58:43.865
<v Speaker 0>I'll set aside the full

00:58:44.105 --> 00:58:46.745
<v Speaker 0>two hours. We'll do it start to finish

00:58:47.705 --> 00:58:50.265
<v Speaker 0>just because there's no pause. This is gonna

00:58:50.265 --> 00:58:51.865
<v Speaker 0>time out an error. I don't think coming

00:58:51.865 --> 00:58:52.905
<v Speaker 0>back is actually gonna work,

00:58:54.410 --> 00:58:56.170
<v Speaker 0>But I will do this again.

00:58:57.050 --> 00:58:58.250
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

00:58:58.330 --> 00:58:59.050
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

00:59:01.850 --> 00:59:03.450
<v Speaker 0>It just stops the countdown. Yeah. I mean,

00:59:03.450 --> 00:59:05.290
<v Speaker 0>that's what's gonna happen anyway because I don't

00:59:05.290 --> 00:59:06.890
<v Speaker 0>have time to finish it just now.

00:59:08.330 --> 00:59:09.130
<v Speaker 0>Where's my score?

00:59:20.545 --> 00:59:21.825
<v Speaker 0>I got a low score because I never

00:59:21.825 --> 00:59:24.224
<v Speaker 0>get through all the questions. But scenario one,

00:59:24.224 --> 00:59:25.025
<v Speaker 0>tick, tick, tick, tick.

00:59:27.250 --> 00:59:28.050
<v Speaker 0>What?

00:59:30.849 --> 00:59:31.730
<v Speaker 0>Rats.

00:59:32.369 --> 00:59:34.609
<v Speaker 0>So why did I get the stateful step

00:59:34.609 --> 00:59:36.690
<v Speaker 0>one wrong? I didn't maybe I misread a

00:59:36.690 --> 00:59:38.130
<v Speaker 0>question. I didn't know it wanted a record

00:59:38.130 --> 00:59:40.215
<v Speaker 0>of the skill then. So I just went

00:59:40.215 --> 00:59:42.695
<v Speaker 0>into the manifest and edit it to replicas

00:59:44.135 --> 00:59:46.135
<v Speaker 0>because I'm a bit of a a cowboy

00:59:46.135 --> 00:59:47.575
<v Speaker 0>that way, I guess. What I should have

00:59:47.575 --> 00:59:50.695
<v Speaker 0>done was a proper skill down event using

00:59:50.695 --> 00:59:52.455
<v Speaker 0>dash dash record, which actually adds it to

00:59:52.455 --> 00:59:54.420
<v Speaker 0>the audit log as a history or an

00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:56.580
<v Speaker 0>event on the stateful set saying why this

00:59:56.580 --> 00:59:57.940
<v Speaker 0>was skilled down. You can actually add a

00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:00.340
<v Speaker 0>message to it. Really good if you're not

01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:01.860
<v Speaker 0>an amateur like myself.

01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:04.580
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So yeah, I misread that. That's my

01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:04.820
<v Speaker 0>fault.

01:00:06.924 --> 01:00:09.244
<v Speaker 0>And this one, I have no idea scenario

01:00:09.244 --> 01:00:11.644
<v Speaker 0>four pod one is ready. Did I not

01:00:11.644 --> 01:00:13.085
<v Speaker 0>wait for it to be ready? Did I

01:00:13.085 --> 01:00:14.125
<v Speaker 0>get something wrong?

01:00:14.605 --> 01:00:15.724
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure,

01:00:16.045 --> 01:00:17.565
<v Speaker 0>but at least I did get the majority

01:00:17.565 --> 01:00:18.285
<v Speaker 0>of it correct.

01:00:21.550 --> 01:00:23.310
<v Speaker 0>QControl top pod.

01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:26.750
<v Speaker 0>It did work. I ran it. Although we

01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:28.430
<v Speaker 0>didn't have a metrics server working.

01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:33.310
<v Speaker 0>Maybe I wanted it as a plural. I'm

01:00:33.310 --> 01:00:34.430
<v Speaker 0>not sure why I got that wrong.

01:00:37.525 --> 01:00:39.925
<v Speaker 0>We got scenario eight correct, which was just

01:00:39.925 --> 01:00:42.085
<v Speaker 0>understanding control plane components.

01:00:42.965 --> 01:00:44.485
<v Speaker 0>Scenario nine.

01:00:46.165 --> 01:00:48.165
<v Speaker 0>Woah, did I miss an entire thing?

01:00:51.119 --> 01:00:53.040
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, I'm unhappy with that. And then

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:54.800
<v Speaker 0>I didn't actually get through any of the

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:55.840
<v Speaker 0>others. Okay.

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:01.840
<v Speaker 0>Well, that was our first attempt at the

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.320
<v Speaker 0>color shell CTE exam preps.

01:01:04.775 --> 01:01:07.815
<v Speaker 0>I will set aside a complete two hours

01:01:07.815 --> 01:01:10.055
<v Speaker 0>at some point this week. So that will

01:01:10.055 --> 01:01:11.655
