00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:05.645
<v Speaker 0>Hello,

00:02:05.965 --> 00:02:08.044
<v Speaker 0>and welcome back to the Rawkode Academy. My

00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:09.645
<v Speaker 0>name is David Flanagan, although you may know

00:02:09.645 --> 00:02:11.645
<v Speaker 0>me from across the Internet as Rawkode.

00:02:11.725 --> 00:02:13.965
<v Speaker 0>And today, I am your host for another

00:02:13.965 --> 00:02:15.565
<v Speaker 0>episode of Custard.

00:02:15.805 --> 00:02:17.885
<v Speaker 0>Today, we are joined by Alex Jones and

00:02:17.885 --> 00:02:19.680
<v Speaker 0>Alistair Hay, who will be doing their best

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.000
<v Speaker 0>to fix clusters broken by the other.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.560
<v Speaker 0>So before we begin, I just wanna say

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.800
<v Speaker 0>thank you to Equinix Metal. They provide all

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.720
<v Speaker 0>of the hardware that we use for Clustard.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.960
<v Speaker 0>I over provision because it's more fun and

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.535
<v Speaker 0>I enjoy it, but we have tons of

00:02:32.535 --> 00:02:34.614
<v Speaker 0>cores, tons of RAM, and two very broken

00:02:34.614 --> 00:02:37.175
<v Speaker 0>machines for each other to fix. And also

00:02:37.175 --> 00:02:39.015
<v Speaker 0>thank you to Teleport who have been supporting

00:02:39.015 --> 00:02:41.575
<v Speaker 0>Clustard for a long time now, almost since

00:02:41.575 --> 00:02:42.855
<v Speaker 0>the very first episode.

00:02:43.175 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 0>So, you know, appreciate it. There are links

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.129
<v Speaker 0>in the description below which will get you

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.610
<v Speaker 0>$200 of free credits with Equinix Medal and

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.769
<v Speaker 0>some more information on Teleport. So go and

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.330
<v Speaker 0>click away and enjoy. But don't click until

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.250
<v Speaker 0>after the episode because we've got some clusters

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.450
<v Speaker 0>to fix first.

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.170
<v Speaker 0>Now my guests are

00:03:00.845 --> 00:03:03.724
<v Speaker 0>Alex and Alister. You're now on screen. Hello,

00:03:03.724 --> 00:03:04.445
<v Speaker 0>and welcome.

00:03:04.924 --> 00:03:07.005
<v Speaker 1>Hey there. Pleasure to be here.

00:03:07.405 --> 00:03:08.765
<v Speaker 1>My name is

00:03:09.084 --> 00:03:10.765
<v Speaker 1>Alex, as you know. I thought I'd introduce

00:03:10.765 --> 00:03:12.765
<v Speaker 1>myself and just say that I'm super excited

00:03:12.765 --> 00:03:13.485
<v Speaker 1>because

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.519
<v Speaker 1>I think I've got myself into the deep

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.760
<v Speaker 1>end, but I'm excited to to sort of

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.000
<v Speaker 1>compete in a friendly way against Alistair. So,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.200
<v Speaker 1>yeah, looking forward to it.

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.040
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Thank you for sharing.

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.960
<v Speaker 2>Alright. Yeah. Thanks thanks both. I'm Alistair.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Looking forward to,

00:03:29.814 --> 00:03:31.174
<v Speaker 2>what would be the the way to say

00:03:31.174 --> 00:03:32.935
<v Speaker 2>this, making a fool of myself,

00:03:33.974 --> 00:03:36.694
<v Speaker 2>floundering around and mistyping all the commands like

00:03:36.694 --> 00:03:39.015
<v Speaker 2>we do when everyone's watching. So looking forward

00:03:39.015 --> 00:03:40.694
<v Speaker 2>to getting stuck in and seeing what's in

00:03:40.694 --> 00:03:41.495
<v Speaker 2>store for

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.630
<v Speaker 2>for us in the episode. Thanks. Well, that's

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.750
<v Speaker 0>half the fun. Right?

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.030
<v Speaker 0>Like, once it's there's something very weird about

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.630
<v Speaker 0>it, but the minute there's a camera on

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.310
<v Speaker 0>your face or an audience and sat in

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.590
<v Speaker 0>front of you on a bunch of chairs,

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.030
<v Speaker 0>it's like everything that you thought you knew

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.510
<v Speaker 0>just

00:03:55.885 --> 00:03:56.765
<v Speaker 0>disappears.

00:03:57.805 --> 00:03:59.245
<v Speaker 0>Some sort of, I don't know,

00:03:59.805 --> 00:04:00.765
<v Speaker 0>live

00:04:01.245 --> 00:04:02.285
<v Speaker 0>stage effect.

00:04:02.765 --> 00:04:05.245
<v Speaker 0>However, you you were on briefly before. Right?

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:05.965
<v Speaker 0>You did

00:04:06.445 --> 00:04:08.685
<v Speaker 0>Rawkode Yes. Rawkode

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.840
<v Speaker 0>where I set you to all of the

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.440
<v Speaker 0>film miserably. So if we've already seen you,

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.920
<v Speaker 0>you look stupid, that's fine. Yeah. That's true.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.760
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Awesome. Thank you everyone in the comments.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.920
<v Speaker 0>Feel free to say hello and support. And

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 0>remember, your comments are there. You're gonna see

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.085
<v Speaker 0>things that we don't. But whenever you see

00:04:24.085 --> 00:04:25.925
<v Speaker 0>something that we mess, throw it straight into

00:04:25.925 --> 00:04:27.444
<v Speaker 0>the comment section and I will relay that

00:04:27.444 --> 00:04:30.165
<v Speaker 0>on to our two contestants today.

00:04:30.564 --> 00:04:32.085
<v Speaker 0>We are gonna start

00:04:32.485 --> 00:04:35.525
<v Speaker 0>with Alex fixing Alister's cluster.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.930
<v Speaker 0>So if you could please open a session

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.250
<v Speaker 0>on Alex Jones control plane one, I will

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.010
<v Speaker 0>share my screen and join, and we will

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.370
<v Speaker 0>kick things off.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.690
<v Speaker 1>So I should join on my control plane

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.770
<v Speaker 1>one? Oh, sorry. Alister. He control plane one.

00:04:48.224 --> 00:04:50.065
<v Speaker 2>I was worried there for a minute.

00:04:50.705 --> 00:04:52.384
<v Speaker 2>I didn't break that one.

00:04:53.344 --> 00:04:54.625
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:04:54.625 --> 00:04:57.504
<v Speaker 1>Cool. Can you see it? I do indeed.

00:04:57.504 --> 00:04:59.585
<v Speaker 0>So I'm hitting join. I'm just joining first

00:04:59.585 --> 00:05:01.025
<v Speaker 0>so that I don't flash your IP address

00:05:01.025 --> 00:05:01.585
<v Speaker 0>to the world.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.060
<v Speaker 0>Cool. Alright. We can now see everything you

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.139
<v Speaker 0>type. Feel free to export your cube config

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:09.980
<v Speaker 0>and take it away. Best of luck.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.860
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.740
<v Speaker 1>I I think probably what I'm gonna do

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.740
<v Speaker 1>is reverse search on what files have been

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.340
<v Speaker 1>modified on the host OS before I do

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.740
<v Speaker 1>anything else.

00:05:20.875 --> 00:05:22.155
<v Speaker 0>Sneaky sneaky.

00:05:22.795 --> 00:05:24.715
<v Speaker 1>Oops. Sorry. It's dasher. That's it.

00:05:25.755 --> 00:05:28.555
<v Speaker 1>K. So let's go from top to bottom.

00:05:28.555 --> 00:05:30.475
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise, put it into a file.

00:05:30.795 --> 00:05:31.995
<v Speaker 1>There's quite a lot of files on this

00:05:31.995 --> 00:05:33.355
<v Speaker 1>computer, and I'm going through every single one

00:05:33.355 --> 00:05:34.155
<v Speaker 1>of

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.110
<v Speaker 0>The hard part is also the machines are

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.790
<v Speaker 0>spun up on demand, and everything has been

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.470
<v Speaker 0>modified in the last forty eight hours.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. But it'll be it'll be it'll be

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:43.950
<v Speaker 1>in order. True.

00:05:46.765 --> 00:05:49.405
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look what we get. So

00:05:51.965 --> 00:05:54.445
<v Speaker 1>okay. So file parts,

00:05:54.845 --> 00:05:57.085
<v Speaker 1>system b. Yeah. Okay. Nothing interesting.

00:05:57.965 --> 00:05:58.845
<v Speaker 1>K.

00:06:00.525 --> 00:06:02.365
<v Speaker 1>Well, let's see what

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.030
<v Speaker 1>sort of key control points to before we

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.830
<v Speaker 1>run it.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.390
<v Speaker 1>Let's check if that's your binary.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 0>Looking like someone who has seen an episode

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.150
<v Speaker 0>before.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I've worked. Yeah. Exactly.

00:06:16.825 --> 00:06:19.305
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Great. Or since you've shipped before, either

00:06:19.305 --> 00:06:21.225
<v Speaker 0>way, we'll fork. Yeah. And I think I

00:06:21.225 --> 00:06:23.305
<v Speaker 1>think it's a combination of both. That's the

00:06:23.305 --> 00:06:24.585
<v Speaker 1>r c file.

00:06:26.425 --> 00:06:27.225
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:06:28.425 --> 00:06:29.545
<v Speaker 1>Let's check the aliases.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay. I don't think you trusted you, Alistair.

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:37.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. So the

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:40.250
<v Speaker 1>oops. Saying nothing. Okay.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:43.690
<v Speaker 1>Let's try and

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:45.775
<v Speaker 1>just see if we can connect it to

00:06:45.775 --> 00:06:46.335
<v Speaker 1>the cluster.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.640
<v Speaker 1>Oops. Sorry. It's

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.600
<v Speaker 1>keep it complete. Keep

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:03.920
<v Speaker 1>it complete. There we go.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.639
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Let's have a look. Atman.com.

00:07:13.415 --> 00:07:15.735
<v Speaker 1>K. So I can see the cluster. That's

00:07:15.735 --> 00:07:18.295
<v Speaker 1>great. Let's export that like you did.

00:07:19.015 --> 00:07:20.295
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Finished.

00:07:21.655 --> 00:07:23.655
<v Speaker 1>Just grab that. Put that in here.

00:07:25.255 --> 00:07:25.815
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.880
<v Speaker 1>Okay. This is the thing here. This one.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.040
<v Speaker 1>Right? Clustered in the default namespace.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Let's

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.880
<v Speaker 1>make my life easier. I've only got so

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.960
<v Speaker 1>many minutes to live. So let's go on

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.720
<v Speaker 1>my other tab. I'm gonna grab web install.

00:07:41.414 --> 00:07:43.655
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna web install k nines because I've

00:07:43.655 --> 00:07:44.535
<v Speaker 1>got stuff to do.

00:07:44.935 --> 00:07:47.175
<v Speaker 1>So I'm gonna do that. Grab that. There

00:07:47.175 --> 00:07:47.735
<v Speaker 1>we go.

00:07:48.455 --> 00:07:50.134
<v Speaker 1>Web install is a really great project. If

00:07:50.134 --> 00:07:51.735
<v Speaker 1>you've used it, they got sorry, webby dot

00:07:51.735 --> 00:07:53.655
<v Speaker 1>shell, I think it is. The key works

00:07:53.655 --> 00:07:55.175
<v Speaker 1>really hard to make a lot of stuff

00:07:55.175 --> 00:07:55.655
<v Speaker 1>compatible

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.150
<v Speaker 1>apart from when it doesn't run. You have

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.070
<v Speaker 0>to update the export path,

00:08:01.389 --> 00:08:03.630
<v Speaker 0>it looks like. Yeah.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.310
<v Speaker 1>So that should be fine. Right?

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Here we go. Okay.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Let's jump into this and have a look.

00:08:10.875 --> 00:08:12.075
<v Speaker 1>In fact, before we do that, let's just

00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:13.355
<v Speaker 1>see and see any of the part the

00:08:13.355 --> 00:08:14.315
<v Speaker 1>nodes had

00:08:15.195 --> 00:08:17.595
<v Speaker 1>scheduling turned off on them because that's kind

00:08:17.595 --> 00:08:19.595
<v Speaker 1>of an easy thing to do.

00:08:21.275 --> 00:08:24.155
<v Speaker 1>So there's no schedule on the

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.040
<v Speaker 1>worker plane.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.400
<v Speaker 1>That one's got a taint on it.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.919
<v Speaker 1>That one the worker also

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:35.640
<v Speaker 1>has

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.200
<v Speaker 1>no schedule slash oops. I don't think that

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.240
<v Speaker 1>comes with Kubernetes.

00:08:40.274 --> 00:08:41.794
<v Speaker 1>Let's

00:08:41.794 --> 00:08:42.995
<v Speaker 1>remove that taint.

00:08:44.834 --> 00:08:45.714
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:08:46.035 --> 00:08:46.834
<v Speaker 1>Oops.

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:49.954
<v Speaker 1>Let's get rid of the case. So let's

00:08:49.954 --> 00:08:51.154
<v Speaker 1>remove that taint off of there.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:57.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure I can leave a spec

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:58.810
<v Speaker 1>object. Oh,

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:05.370
<v Speaker 1>It's

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:06.890
<v Speaker 1>not got a role, but that should be

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:07.210
<v Speaker 1>fine.

00:09:09.205 --> 00:09:11.125
<v Speaker 1>I'm not scheduling yet, so let's go and

00:09:11.125 --> 00:09:13.045
<v Speaker 1>have a look at what else could be

00:09:13.045 --> 00:09:13.685
<v Speaker 1>broken.

00:09:13.925 --> 00:09:15.365
<v Speaker 1>CoreDNS running.

00:09:17.285 --> 00:09:18.805
<v Speaker 1>Is there a core file?

00:09:19.045 --> 00:09:21.925
<v Speaker 1>I'm being overly cautious, but it's sort of

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.400
<v Speaker 1>covering the. Is there a core file? Because

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.000
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people mess with DNS.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.400
<v Speaker 1>Yep. That's the default core file.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:30.600
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:09:37.235 --> 00:09:37.954
<v Speaker 1>K.

00:09:38.195 --> 00:09:39.714
<v Speaker 1>Gosh. It doesn't show up very well. Hope

00:09:39.714 --> 00:09:41.315
<v Speaker 1>you all can see it. Yeah. It looks

00:09:41.315 --> 00:09:42.515
<v Speaker 0>okay. I'm just saved.

00:09:43.235 --> 00:09:45.555
<v Speaker 1>And it's v two. Right? It's the image.

00:09:45.555 --> 00:09:46.355
<v Speaker 0>Indeed.

00:09:47.394 --> 00:09:48.115
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:09:48.274 --> 00:09:49.475
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what goes wrong.

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:53.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So nothing's happening.

00:09:55.029 --> 00:09:56.950
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look the API server.

00:10:00.709 --> 00:10:01.589
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:03.589
<v Speaker 1>So

00:10:04.149 --> 00:10:05.670
<v Speaker 1>failed calling webhook.

00:10:07.115 --> 00:10:08.395
<v Speaker 1>Default gates.

00:10:08.475 --> 00:10:10.795
<v Speaker 1>This is a warning on the dispatcher.

00:10:11.915 --> 00:10:13.115
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look.

00:10:13.355 --> 00:10:15.435
<v Speaker 1>These are the case in part. Okay.

00:10:16.475 --> 00:10:17.195
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Mission webhooks we've got.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.700
<v Speaker 1>Let's go back and have another look. So

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.980
<v Speaker 1>we should have a type. I'm validating. Yeah.

00:10:31.779 --> 00:10:32.900
<v Speaker 1>Validating. That's what I want.

00:10:34.395 --> 00:10:39.435
<v Speaker 1>Fault takes webhooks on validatingexample.com.

00:10:40.155 --> 00:10:41.595
<v Speaker 1>I can just delete this.

00:10:41.915 --> 00:10:43.995
<v Speaker 1>I don't need a validator in webhook.

00:10:44.475 --> 00:10:46.315
<v Speaker 0>Oh, that hard work. Delete it. I don't

00:10:46.315 --> 00:10:46.555
<v Speaker 0>understand.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So let's just try and delete this

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:51.960
<v Speaker 1>pod

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.120
<v Speaker 1>to see if it will if it will

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.000
<v Speaker 1>recreate.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:55.880
<v Speaker 1>So

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.720
<v Speaker 1>the pod's gone.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.120
<v Speaker 1>Have a look what's going on in the

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:00.440
<v Speaker 1>deployment.

00:11:03.355 --> 00:11:06.875
<v Speaker 1>I'm

00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:08.875
<v Speaker 1>just gonna resize this because I can't quite

00:11:08.875 --> 00:11:10.955
<v Speaker 1>see half of the screen. Okay.

00:11:11.835 --> 00:11:14.235
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna have replicas. It's a replica set.

00:11:14.795 --> 00:11:16.955
<v Speaker 1>So you've got the old one. Just purge

00:11:16.955 --> 00:11:17.275
<v Speaker 1>that.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Current replica set.

00:11:29.925 --> 00:11:31.525
<v Speaker 1>K. So

00:11:33.205 --> 00:11:35.365
<v Speaker 1>we have an issue. Oh, we don't have

00:11:35.365 --> 00:11:37.525
<v Speaker 1>any issues. This is trace garbage.

00:11:38.325 --> 00:11:39.045
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:11:39.525 --> 00:11:41.605
<v Speaker 1>Let's let's

00:11:41.605 --> 00:11:42.725
<v Speaker 1>go deeper. So

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:49.970
<v Speaker 1>okay. So let's look at what's going on

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.730
<v Speaker 1>here. You've got a

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:56.690
<v Speaker 1>bunch of pods here.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:59.410
<v Speaker 1>This is your I c t l. I

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:01.214
<v Speaker 1>think we can also look at the

00:12:04.495 --> 00:12:06.735
<v Speaker 1>current container drilling or current container trying to

00:12:06.735 --> 00:12:07.375
<v Speaker 1>schedule.

00:12:07.935 --> 00:12:09.535
<v Speaker 1>My server is running.

00:12:10.575 --> 00:12:11.774
<v Speaker 1>CTL

00:12:11.774 --> 00:12:12.255
<v Speaker 1>steps.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.220
<v Speaker 1>In a.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.900
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Let's go back and figure out what

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.740
<v Speaker 1>is going on. So our pod is in

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:23.540
<v Speaker 1>scheduling.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.580
<v Speaker 1>Is there a placement issue? Let's have a

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:27.060
<v Speaker 1>look.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Server.

00:12:32.135 --> 00:12:32.935
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:12:33.495 --> 00:12:34.215
<v Speaker 1>I

00:12:34.935 --> 00:12:36.135
<v Speaker 1>need to get a better view of this

00:12:36.135 --> 00:12:37.735
<v Speaker 1>log. It's not very useful looking at it

00:12:37.735 --> 00:12:39.015
<v Speaker 1>in k nine. It's actually like that.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.300
<v Speaker 1>There we go. I got some stuff coming

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.380
<v Speaker 1>out here. That's a while ago.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Request too large.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.260
<v Speaker 1>This is the entire API server log, so

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.780
<v Speaker 1>I regret doing that now.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.900
<v Speaker 1>We've we'll be here a little while. So

00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.945
<v Speaker 1>there we go. So the last stuff we

00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:01.625
<v Speaker 1>have is the webhooks, and then we can

00:13:01.625 --> 00:13:04.105
<v Speaker 1>see now that we can't schedule.

00:13:04.265 --> 00:13:06.185
<v Speaker 1>So if I was to debug this, first

00:13:06.185 --> 00:13:08.425
<v Speaker 1>principle is dictate that you probably want to

00:13:09.144 --> 00:13:11.785
<v Speaker 1>try and replicate it in a simpler example.

00:13:12.024 --> 00:13:14.185
<v Speaker 1>So what we're gonna do is

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:17.459
<v Speaker 1>we are going to grab the simplest pod

00:13:17.459 --> 00:13:19.139
<v Speaker 1>on the web, which is the

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:20.980
<v Speaker 1>NGINX example.

00:13:21.459 --> 00:13:22.740
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna grab that.

00:13:26.819 --> 00:13:27.620
<v Speaker 1>Paste that in.

00:13:28.194 --> 00:13:28.995
<v Speaker 1>Oops.

00:13:30.035 --> 00:13:31.635
<v Speaker 1>No. Not because

00:13:34.435 --> 00:13:35.315
<v Speaker 1>click.

00:13:35.714 --> 00:13:36.194
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:42.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So the deployment creates

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:44.050
<v Speaker 1>so we know that

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:47.010
<v Speaker 1>we know that is working.

00:13:47.649 --> 00:13:49.730
<v Speaker 1>Do we? Yes. We do. So is working.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:51.890
<v Speaker 1>So the actual deployment's being created. It's admitting

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:52.130
<v Speaker 1>it.

00:13:54.195 --> 00:13:55.955
<v Speaker 1>We know that Rawkode is being

00:13:56.275 --> 00:13:56.995
<v Speaker 1>created,

00:13:57.955 --> 00:14:00.115
<v Speaker 1>but we don't have the pods

00:14:00.435 --> 00:14:01.555
<v Speaker 1>being scheduled.

00:14:01.795 --> 00:14:02.595
<v Speaker 1>Typically,

00:14:03.395 --> 00:14:04.995
<v Speaker 1>I would expect to see an issue with

00:14:04.995 --> 00:14:07.235
<v Speaker 1>the the pods in a pending phase.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.800
<v Speaker 1>So let's figure out what we've done wrong

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.960
<v Speaker 1>or what we can't what's not working here.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes what can be useful as well is

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.760
<v Speaker 1>to look directly at the journal.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.240
<v Speaker 1>Not this time, perhaps.

00:14:22.715 --> 00:14:25.355
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look at x e f

00:14:25.355 --> 00:14:26.715
<v Speaker 1>f. Is that right?

00:14:27.755 --> 00:14:28.635
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:14:29.835 --> 00:14:32.555
<v Speaker 1>So we've got our webhook issue here, and

00:14:32.555 --> 00:14:34.475
<v Speaker 1>now we're seeing a direct response

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.839
<v Speaker 1>from logging.go

00:14:36.839 --> 00:14:39.399
<v Speaker 1>on the go restful. Okay. That's not particularly

00:14:39.399 --> 00:14:40.120
<v Speaker 1>useful.

00:14:41.079 --> 00:14:42.759
<v Speaker 1>So what we can try doing is to

00:14:42.759 --> 00:14:43.720
<v Speaker 1>see if

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.959
<v Speaker 1>we're getting anything in

00:14:46.279 --> 00:14:47.560
<v Speaker 1>directly to the syslog.

00:14:56.755 --> 00:14:57.395
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:15:00.355 --> 00:15:03.795
<v Speaker 1>So this is from Teleport, I think. Yep.

00:15:04.595 --> 00:15:07.075
<v Speaker 1>What else we got? We've got

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.650
<v Speaker 1>against teleport teleport. Yeah. Nothing really

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:13.050
<v Speaker 1>going to syslog. I've got here we go.

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:15.610
<v Speaker 1>Fail creating default webhook. Yeah. That's not what

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:16.010
<v Speaker 1>I want.

00:15:19.765 --> 00:15:21.125
<v Speaker 1>Quite a bind.

00:15:21.445 --> 00:15:22.645
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:15:22.885 --> 00:15:24.325
<v Speaker 1>Let's get

00:15:24.725 --> 00:15:26.325
<v Speaker 1>we I mean, we can do

00:15:26.645 --> 00:15:29.045
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to and see what's going on,

00:15:29.045 --> 00:15:30.005
<v Speaker 1>but I don't really want to have to

00:15:30.005 --> 00:15:30.645
<v Speaker 1>do that just yet.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.160
<v Speaker 1>So what else we've got running here? Maybe

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.680
<v Speaker 1>we've got something deleting things.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.839
<v Speaker 1>Got the controller manager. So what's responsible for

00:15:39.839 --> 00:15:42.000
<v Speaker 0>creating a pod after we have a replica

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:42.240
<v Speaker 0>set?

00:15:43.935 --> 00:15:46.975
<v Speaker 1>So I think that we have the

00:15:47.215 --> 00:15:49.615
<v Speaker 1>controller manager to start scheduling placement.

00:15:50.255 --> 00:15:52.255
<v Speaker 1>What would your inclination be here?

00:15:53.695 --> 00:15:57.280
<v Speaker 0>My inclination is that he has changed the

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.520
<v Speaker 0>parameters on the API server and disabled the

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.480
<v Speaker 0>pod controller.

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Let's have a look.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:04.880
<v Speaker 1>Oops.

00:16:14.495 --> 00:16:16.415
<v Speaker 0>On the controller manager, not the API server.

00:16:16.415 --> 00:16:17.295
<v Speaker 0>Sorry. Yeah. Sorry.

00:16:25.389 --> 00:16:26.829
<v Speaker 0>What

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.350
<v Speaker 1>am I not seeing? Okay. So controllers, you've

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:32.910
<v Speaker 1>got

00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:34.190
<v Speaker 1>bootstrapper,

00:16:34.775 --> 00:16:37.255
<v Speaker 1>token cleaner rep minus replica set.

00:16:38.055 --> 00:16:39.175
<v Speaker 1>Can you put a minus in front of

00:16:39.175 --> 00:16:41.415
<v Speaker 1>it? Does that actually emit it? It disables

00:16:41.415 --> 00:16:43.655
<v Speaker 0>the replica set controller, which won't create pods.

00:16:43.655 --> 00:16:45.655
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Yeah. I thought let's have a look.

00:16:45.895 --> 00:16:47.335
<v Speaker 1>There there is a doc for this, isn't

00:16:47.335 --> 00:16:48.690
<v Speaker 1>there? I just wanna check for it.

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:51.730
<v Speaker 1>I thought that the the this it's a

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:54.850
<v Speaker 1>sequence so that the the asterisk wildcard

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.250
<v Speaker 1>will be overwritten by the last argument in

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:57.889
<v Speaker 1>the line.

00:16:58.689 --> 00:16:59.970
<v Speaker 1>I think that might be how it works.

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:02.795
<v Speaker 0>It's like gets expanded and then everybody Yeah.

00:17:02.955 --> 00:17:04.794
<v Speaker 1>In order. Yeah. Okay.

00:17:09.195 --> 00:17:10.395
<v Speaker 1>God. What's it called?

00:17:12.955 --> 00:17:15.115
<v Speaker 1>Cube. It's not cube, but it keeps the

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:17.710
<v Speaker 1>control manager.

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:19.869
<v Speaker 1>It should this shows how It's the cubit.

00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:21.470
<v Speaker 0>The cubit will start to control the manager

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:23.470
<v Speaker 0>as a container. Yeah. It just shows off

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:24.830
<v Speaker 1>now if you do this. Okay. It's not

00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:27.150
<v Speaker 1>that It will probably pick it up, that

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:29.950
<v Speaker 2>change, because it's in the manifest file. It

00:17:29.765 --> 00:17:31.685
<v Speaker 0>can take up to four But if you

00:17:31.685 --> 00:17:33.205
<v Speaker 0>restart it, it speeds it up.

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:47.929
<v Speaker 0>Hey. We have pods.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. And then we have NGINX, and then

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:50.969
<v Speaker 1>we have the

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:53.129
<v Speaker 1>the new version deployed.

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:54.489
<v Speaker 1>I think think that's it.

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.769
<v Speaker 1>We're good? I can't test it. I mean,

00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:59.850
<v Speaker 1>I could download the on local host on

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:00.730
<v Speaker 0>port 30,000.

00:18:00.934 --> 00:18:03.494
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Okay. Let's do that. So so

00:18:03.815 --> 00:18:06.054
<v Speaker 1>let's go to keep control of get pods.

00:18:07.975 --> 00:18:10.455
<v Speaker 1>Keep control of port forwards. Oh, you don't

00:18:10.455 --> 00:18:11.735
<v Speaker 0>have to port forward. That's a node port

00:18:11.735 --> 00:18:14.455
<v Speaker 0>service configured. Oh, okay. Okay. So you can

00:18:14.455 --> 00:18:17.255
<v Speaker 1>probably get service curl

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:17.700
<v Speaker 1>localhost

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:18.899
<v Speaker 1>30,000.

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:22.260
<v Speaker 1>Oops. That's yeah.

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.019
<v Speaker 0>We have more break,

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:26.900
<v Speaker 0>I think. Okay.

00:18:30.225 --> 00:18:31.664
<v Speaker 1>Is the image correct?

00:18:33.585 --> 00:18:35.825
<v Speaker 1>Seems so. Yeah. It looks correct.

00:18:36.625 --> 00:18:38.785
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the node port's not working. Let's see

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:39.664
<v Speaker 1>where we are.

00:18:40.865 --> 00:18:42.465
<v Speaker 1>Actually, before we do that, let's just look

00:18:42.465 --> 00:18:44.465
<v Speaker 1>at the

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:48.590
<v Speaker 1>okay. Let's just have to write down.

00:18:49.549 --> 00:18:52.190
<v Speaker 1>Let's just do an IP table's flush.

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:55.870
<v Speaker 1>That's any Not even looking at the IP

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:57.710
<v Speaker 0>table. It's just flushing them to hell. Yeah.

00:18:59.955 --> 00:19:02.755
<v Speaker 1>I this in production. It always works. No

00:19:02.755 --> 00:19:05.795
<v Speaker 1>no no implications of deleting all the IP

00:19:05.795 --> 00:19:06.835
<v Speaker 1>table chains.

00:19:07.955 --> 00:19:11.155
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Let's flush the IP table rules. Let's

00:19:11.155 --> 00:19:12.115
<v Speaker 1>check the service.

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:14.100
<v Speaker 1>So node port

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:15.940
<v Speaker 1>30,000.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So cluster

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.980
<v Speaker 1>IP 30,000 binds to six six six. That

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:26.260
<v Speaker 1>looks kind of malicious.

00:19:26.505 --> 00:19:28.665
<v Speaker 0>That is correct. I'm sorry. That is the

00:19:28.665 --> 00:19:30.664
<v Speaker 0>real Okay. Okay.

00:19:31.865 --> 00:19:32.664
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:19:37.545 --> 00:19:39.225
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes my key binds don't seem to work.

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.539
<v Speaker 1>There is no there's no port on the

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:44.979
<v Speaker 1>on the deployment.

00:19:46.419 --> 00:19:48.019
<v Speaker 1>Is that the is that the issue?

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.379
<v Speaker 0>Okay. I

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.940
<v Speaker 0>I I do some Kubernetes training, and I

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.225
<v Speaker 0>always talk about the ports on the the

00:19:54.225 --> 00:19:56.305
<v Speaker 0>pod spec, and there is the it doesn't

00:19:56.305 --> 00:19:57.825
<v Speaker 0>do anything. That allows you to name a

00:19:57.825 --> 00:20:00.304
<v Speaker 0>port. Everything other than that, it's documentation.

00:20:00.465 --> 00:20:02.385
<v Speaker 0>There's no We're not need to we're not

00:20:02.385 --> 00:20:04.625
<v Speaker 1>need to define the container ports. Nope. It

00:20:04.625 --> 00:20:05.985
<v Speaker 0>doesn't do it anything at all.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:07.880
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.240
<v Speaker 0>It's perchless.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.000
<v Speaker 1>YOLO.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:12.759
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:15.559
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So at the same time, it's not

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.915
<v Speaker 0>You need to fix your dash, because the

00:20:18.915 --> 00:20:20.675
<v Speaker 0>dash was stolen on image. Okay. Okay. Well,

00:20:20.675 --> 00:20:22.275
<v Speaker 1>I'll just I'll just leave it then. Everyone's

00:20:22.275 --> 00:20:24.835
<v Speaker 1>gonna do this. Okay. Okay. So that's not

00:20:24.835 --> 00:20:25.555
<v Speaker 1>it. Okay.

00:20:26.275 --> 00:20:28.435
<v Speaker 1>Let's try that again. Okay. So it's still

00:20:28.435 --> 00:20:29.075
<v Speaker 1>blocked.

00:20:29.315 --> 00:20:30.755
<v Speaker 0>So there's two reasons for the it may

00:20:30.755 --> 00:20:31.955
<v Speaker 0>not be that it's blocked. It could be

00:20:31.955 --> 00:20:33.155
<v Speaker 0>that it's time and out, and it could

00:20:33.155 --> 00:20:35.710
<v Speaker 0>be the cluster of the application speaks to

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:38.350
<v Speaker 0>a Postgres service. It could be that Postgres

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:40.510
<v Speaker 0>doesn't happen. Okay. Okay. I I don't know

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:42.830
<v Speaker 1>enough about the application. That's true. It's Postgres

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:44.030
<v Speaker 1>running as a stateful set.

00:20:46.315 --> 00:20:47.835
<v Speaker 1>I can sort of see it.

00:20:48.155 --> 00:20:50.875
<v Speaker 1>You're managing, like, running PG bouncer on this,

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:51.515
<v Speaker 1>are you?

00:20:53.755 --> 00:20:55.755
<v Speaker 1>No. App info. No. App info. I should

00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:56.155
<v Speaker 1>know this.

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:03.019
<v Speaker 1>I thought I told you it's installed.

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:07.100
<v Speaker 0>I thought that's

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:08.940
<v Speaker 1>I considered doing this, but I thought it

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:09.820
<v Speaker 1>was too evil.

00:21:10.299 --> 00:21:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:21:13.419 --> 00:21:16.654
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So not PG bouncer. So we could

00:21:16.815 --> 00:21:17.615
<v Speaker 1>try

00:21:17.615 --> 00:21:19.535
<v Speaker 1>and figure out what is going on. Now,

00:21:19.535 --> 00:21:21.215
<v Speaker 1>firstly, let's just check that everything's good with

00:21:21.215 --> 00:21:21.855
<v Speaker 1>curl.

00:21:22.815 --> 00:21:25.615
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So we've got we've got curl working.

00:21:26.495 --> 00:21:28.095
<v Speaker 1>We could then also then try to see

00:21:28.095 --> 00:21:29.135
<v Speaker 1>if it's an issue with the node port.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.160
<v Speaker 1>So if we do get the service and

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.679
<v Speaker 1>we do a direct port forward

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.760
<v Speaker 1>and we put that in background

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.804
<v Speaker 1>actually, I might live to regret that. I

00:21:41.804 --> 00:21:43.485
<v Speaker 1>can't open multiple terminals up here, can I,

00:21:43.485 --> 00:21:44.764
<v Speaker 1>very easily? Is that okay if I connect

00:21:44.764 --> 00:21:46.845
<v Speaker 1>you in another session? Or Yeah. Go. Feel

00:21:46.845 --> 00:21:49.404
<v Speaker 0>free. Okay. I'll just do that so that

00:21:50.524 --> 00:21:52.284
<v Speaker 1>I'll open up the session briefly, and then

00:21:52.284 --> 00:21:53.804
<v Speaker 1>I'll close it again. I'm just gonna validate

00:21:53.804 --> 00:21:56.100
<v Speaker 1>what's going on here. Yeah. Okay.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So I've been mocked in the comments

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.580
<v Speaker 0>anyway from Russell who's saying, you could check

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:01.860
<v Speaker 0>the application logs.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.900
<v Speaker 0>But, unfortunately, I've been meaning to add logging

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.660
<v Speaker 0>for the application for for many, many Yeah.

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:09.299
<v Speaker 1>I didn't I didn't see any logs.

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:11.380
<v Speaker 0>I should think that. I should

00:22:12.125 --> 00:22:13.644
<v Speaker 1>Let's

00:22:13.644 --> 00:22:14.684
<v Speaker 1>go and have a look.

00:22:16.764 --> 00:22:17.644
<v Speaker 1>I don't see.

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:25.549
<v Speaker 1>So

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:28.350
<v Speaker 1>this port for that locate six six six.

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:30.510
<v Speaker 1>In another tab, I'm just gonna complete curl

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:31.070
<v Speaker 1>that.

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:35.070
<v Speaker 1>Yes. It's still not working. Okay.

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:38.110
<v Speaker 1>So let's think about what's going on. We

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:39.710
<v Speaker 1>can't see anything coming out of the application.

00:22:40.155 --> 00:22:41.995
<v Speaker 0>Well, if you do a curl with a

00:22:42.075 --> 00:22:44.475
<v Speaker 0>for both logging, does it show connection accepted

00:22:44.475 --> 00:22:46.395
<v Speaker 0>or connection pending?

00:22:46.795 --> 00:22:47.995
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look.

00:22:48.875 --> 00:22:49.515
<v Speaker 1>K.

00:22:50.555 --> 00:22:51.674
<v Speaker 1>Looks like

00:22:52.475 --> 00:22:54.510
<v Speaker 0>A curl dash v should show

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:57.070
<v Speaker 1>isn't it? That's just trace?

00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:58.510
<v Speaker 0>You can just trace it. Yeah.

00:23:08.415 --> 00:23:11.135
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's it looks like it's hanging.

00:23:13.775 --> 00:23:15.855
<v Speaker 1>What's going on here? Hang on. What's what

00:23:15.855 --> 00:23:16.895
<v Speaker 1>is this garbage?

00:23:18.175 --> 00:23:20.655
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Cluster. Not garbage. No. No. No. No.

00:23:20.655 --> 00:23:21.375
<v Speaker 1>No. I

00:23:21.695 --> 00:23:23.460
<v Speaker 1>I just see I'm I'm just I'll show

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:24.659
<v Speaker 1>you what I was looking at, actually.

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:26.979
<v Speaker 1>It's going

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:28.580
<v Speaker 1>local host.

00:23:29.059 --> 00:23:30.580
<v Speaker 1>I think it's 30,000 there.

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:33.140
<v Speaker 1>So we're seeing that it's connection refused. Yeah.

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:34.740
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Yeah. 100% refused.

00:23:35.985 --> 00:23:36.625
<v Speaker 1>So

00:23:36.945 --> 00:23:38.705
<v Speaker 1>we you know, I again, I I I

00:23:38.705 --> 00:23:40.065
<v Speaker 1>kinda work from what I know, and I

00:23:40.065 --> 00:23:41.425
<v Speaker 1>think that's kind of a good strategy in

00:23:41.425 --> 00:23:43.665
<v Speaker 1>life, generally. And so I would pretty validate

00:23:43.665 --> 00:23:45.664
<v Speaker 1>this by on my NGINX deployment,

00:23:45.745 --> 00:23:47.265
<v Speaker 1>opening up that node port because what we

00:23:47.265 --> 00:23:49.270
<v Speaker 1>can determine from that is, has it been

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:50.790
<v Speaker 1>broken on the entire machine, or is it

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:53.590
<v Speaker 1>specific to this deployment? So where did our

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:55.270
<v Speaker 1>engine x go? I didn't roll out a

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:57.350
<v Speaker 1>didn't roll out a service with that.

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:01.269
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna have

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:04.205
<v Speaker 1>shamelessly steal one. So glamorously on the other

00:24:04.205 --> 00:24:05.325
<v Speaker 1>side of the page, what I'm doing is

00:24:05.325 --> 00:24:07.085
<v Speaker 1>doing Kubernetes..i0

00:24:07.085 --> 00:24:09.885
<v Speaker 1>and just grabbing the default deployment

00:24:09.885 --> 00:24:11.085
<v Speaker 1>and service.

00:24:11.085 --> 00:24:13.085
<v Speaker 0>You could just keep control exposed as a

00:24:13.085 --> 00:24:14.125
<v Speaker 0>command as well.

00:24:14.525 --> 00:24:16.525
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what? I have probably used

00:24:16.525 --> 00:24:17.005
<v Speaker 1>that

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:19.809
<v Speaker 1>four times in my life. Let's do it.

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:22.610
<v Speaker 1>I I honestly I never ever use it.

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:24.050
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look. So let's see if

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:25.330
<v Speaker 1>the API is in the same. So keep

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:26.929
<v Speaker 1>control exposed as an example.

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:28.450
<v Speaker 1>Expose,

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:31.570
<v Speaker 1>rep a cassette. Right? What's what's RC there?

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:33.904
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Port eight. Alright. Let's try that.

00:24:34.545 --> 00:24:37.985
<v Speaker 1>Assuming that RC is oh, yeah. Replication controller.

00:24:38.065 --> 00:24:40.544
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So let's do deployment.

00:24:42.625 --> 00:24:44.545
<v Speaker 1>And the name might think for us. Let's

00:24:44.545 --> 00:24:45.185
<v Speaker 1>just double check.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.840
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Was engine x deployment. Okay.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.600
<v Speaker 1>Next deployment.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:59.799
<v Speaker 1>And I think

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.285
<v Speaker 0>Target port is six six six, and the

00:25:02.285 --> 00:25:03.565
<v Speaker 0>port is I don't know. I'm just checking

00:25:03.565 --> 00:25:05.804
<v Speaker 1>I was just checking my NGINX example so

00:25:05.804 --> 00:25:08.445
<v Speaker 1>I can validate whether it's another issue. Hold

00:25:08.445 --> 00:25:10.285
<v Speaker 1>on. I'm just checking what port it comes

00:25:10.285 --> 00:25:12.365
<v Speaker 1>on. Think it's 80, isn't it? Port 80.

00:25:12.365 --> 00:25:13.804
<v Speaker 1>Oh, it's gonna be a screen. Come on.

00:25:13.804 --> 00:25:14.605
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Target port.

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:18.230
<v Speaker 1>Your screen's wider than mine. Okay. Let's go

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.870
<v Speaker 1>with that.

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Let's now

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:22.789
<v Speaker 1>curl it.

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:24.870
<v Speaker 1>Little v.

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:30.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So we've got connection refused to

00:25:31.024 --> 00:25:31.744
<v Speaker 1>that.

00:25:31.825 --> 00:25:34.065
<v Speaker 0>You just target Porsche on on your exposed.

00:25:34.065 --> 00:25:35.104
<v Speaker 0>That should be 80.

00:25:36.065 --> 00:25:38.464
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I'm sorry. Yes. You're right.

00:25:39.585 --> 00:25:41.825
<v Speaker 0>And yeah. Yeah.

00:25:41.825 --> 00:25:43.104
<v Speaker 1>Chicken and egg problem.

00:25:43.424 --> 00:25:43.825
<v Speaker 1>K.

00:25:47.519 --> 00:25:48.399
<v Speaker 1>I

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.880
<v Speaker 1>prefer it locally if it wasn't bound to

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.960
<v Speaker 1>the h p p h p port.

00:26:01.144 --> 00:26:02.664
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Interesting.

00:26:03.544 --> 00:26:05.304
<v Speaker 1>So if I have that right, what that

00:26:05.304 --> 00:26:07.784
<v Speaker 1>tells me is that I can't no ports

00:26:07.784 --> 00:26:08.744
<v Speaker 1>aren't working

00:26:09.465 --> 00:26:10.744
<v Speaker 1>in the cluster.

00:26:12.825 --> 00:26:14.599
<v Speaker 1>What I can do to verify that, again,

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:15.399
<v Speaker 1>is to

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.960
<v Speaker 1>do a port forward and check

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.999
<v Speaker 1>if the so then I'll get

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.279
<v Speaker 1>I've seen the service type.

00:26:29.325 --> 00:26:31.165
<v Speaker 1>It's just IP right now. Wanted to get

00:26:31.165 --> 00:26:32.045
<v Speaker 1>a report, didn't I?

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:42.770
<v Speaker 1>Okay. I've done that slightly incorrectly.

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:45.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:46.770
<v Speaker 0>Oh, now your now your node port is

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:47.570
<v Speaker 0>32,000

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:48.290
<v Speaker 0>something.

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:49.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah.

00:26:52.385 --> 00:26:54.625
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Into it. Oh, yeah. And I'm also

00:26:54.625 --> 00:26:56.225
<v Speaker 1>on the wrong it's it's not targeting the

00:26:56.225 --> 00:26:57.985
<v Speaker 1>wrong port on the

00:26:58.305 --> 00:26:59.585
<v Speaker 1>on the deployment.

00:27:00.225 --> 00:27:01.585
<v Speaker 1>So you get when you do something in

00:27:01.585 --> 00:27:01.985
<v Speaker 1>a rush.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:10.110
<v Speaker 1>I think the target port's necessary anymore, is

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:12.270
<v Speaker 1>it? I could delete that. Well, the port

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:14.270
<v Speaker 0>is a service port for cluster IP. The

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:16.510
<v Speaker 0>target port defaults to the normal port, and

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:17.870
<v Speaker 0>the target port could be different.

00:27:19.525 --> 00:27:20.805
<v Speaker 0>So services are fun.

00:27:21.685 --> 00:27:22.325
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:27:22.645 --> 00:27:24.565
<v Speaker 1>There we go. That should be correct.

00:27:25.605 --> 00:27:27.445
<v Speaker 0>Can you run cube control get s v

00:27:27.445 --> 00:27:28.645
<v Speaker 0>c comma e p?

00:27:29.285 --> 00:27:32.280
<v Speaker 0>I like to call that there. The Which

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:34.200
<v Speaker 1>sorry. Which one? Delete the

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.919
<v Speaker 0>slash into comma e p. E

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.119
<v Speaker 0>p. Uh-huh. For endpoint. Yeah. There

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.280
<v Speaker 1>we go. It looks good. Yeah. It should

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:47.125
<v Speaker 0>it should be working. I like that. Yeah.

00:27:47.125 --> 00:27:47.684
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:27:50.005 --> 00:27:52.005
<v Speaker 1>So that's been blocked as well.

00:27:53.125 --> 00:27:55.205
<v Speaker 1>Okay. No. You used the wrong port again.

00:27:55.205 --> 00:27:57.685
<v Speaker 0>Remember, it's 632428.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.840
<v Speaker 0>3 2 4 2 8. But

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.600
<v Speaker 0>still blocked. Hanging as well. Okay.

00:28:15.375 --> 00:28:17.775
<v Speaker 1>We'd already looks I've already dumped the table.

00:28:17.775 --> 00:28:18.894
<v Speaker 1>It's not gonna be that.

00:28:19.695 --> 00:28:21.695
<v Speaker 1>Could be this c n I. Let's think

00:28:21.695 --> 00:28:23.455
<v Speaker 1>about that maybe, sort of.

00:28:24.015 --> 00:28:25.615
<v Speaker 1>It could be let's have a look at

00:28:25.615 --> 00:28:28.015
<v Speaker 1>host name. Let's look at

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:30.649
<v Speaker 1>AC hosts.

00:28:31.929 --> 00:28:33.449
<v Speaker 1>Local host is set.

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:39.690
<v Speaker 0>You wanna try it from a worker node?

00:28:40.845 --> 00:28:43.645
<v Speaker 1>We could do that. Yep. Let's so shall

00:28:43.645 --> 00:28:46.205
<v Speaker 1>I do I'll I'll open a worker node

00:28:46.205 --> 00:28:47.405
<v Speaker 1>session, and you can join that one. Is

00:28:47.405 --> 00:28:49.005
<v Speaker 1>that what you Yeah. Want you to Okay.

00:28:49.005 --> 00:28:50.525
<v Speaker 1>So let me just open one. Okay.

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:54.900
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So

00:29:16.115 --> 00:29:19.235
<v Speaker 0>Just try curl local host C2428.

00:29:22.769 --> 00:29:24.850
<v Speaker 0>Hey. How did you configure cube control in

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:25.330
<v Speaker 0>that?

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:27.649
<v Speaker 1>On this node? Yeah.

00:29:28.049 --> 00:29:30.529
<v Speaker 1>We just exported it very quickly. But there's

00:29:30.529 --> 00:29:30.769
<v Speaker 0>no

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:33.490
<v Speaker 0>there shouldn't be an admin.com from that machine.

00:29:34.095 --> 00:29:34.654
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

00:29:36.174 --> 00:29:38.255
<v Speaker 0>you're using a Kubler service account. Right. Okay.

00:29:38.255 --> 00:29:40.495
<v Speaker 1>That's okay, isn't it? Yeah. Sure. It's not

00:29:40.735 --> 00:29:42.495
<v Speaker 1>Oh, so oh, that sounds like something rules,

00:29:42.495 --> 00:29:44.575
<v Speaker 1>is it? I mean, I can't You could

00:29:44.575 --> 00:29:46.414
<v Speaker 0>could create these things for sure, so why

00:29:46.414 --> 00:29:46.655
<v Speaker 0>not?

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:52.720
<v Speaker 0>So, yeah, try the current local host 32428.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.039
<v Speaker 0>Just because I I need to know.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:56.800
<v Speaker 1>3248,

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.080
<v Speaker 1>was it? 428. Yeah.

00:30:00.775 --> 00:30:02.535
<v Speaker 1>There you go. Okay. It works there. So

00:30:02.535 --> 00:30:04.215
<v Speaker 0>try the try 30,000?

00:30:04.455 --> 00:30:06.215
<v Speaker 1>It's been set on that machine.

00:30:07.335 --> 00:30:09.495
<v Speaker 1>No. There's still something broken with that one.

00:30:09.735 --> 00:30:11.414
<v Speaker 0>But your engine x one did work.

00:30:12.934 --> 00:30:13.735
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.

00:30:14.535 --> 00:30:15.254
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:30:15.575 --> 00:30:16.215
<v Speaker 1>So

00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:18.549
<v Speaker 1>I'm just thinking if we go

00:30:19.429 --> 00:30:20.549
<v Speaker 1>let's have a look what's actually

00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:23.830
<v Speaker 0>Got about fifteen minutes left.

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:29.909
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Time goes quick, doesn't it?

00:30:31.245 --> 00:30:32.765
<v Speaker 2>Alex has dropped a lot a lot of

00:30:32.765 --> 00:30:34.125
<v Speaker 2>truth bombs on us. A lot of things

00:30:34.125 --> 00:30:35.805
<v Speaker 2>I'd never thought to look at. Yeah. Your

00:30:35.805 --> 00:30:37.565
<v Speaker 0>camera's gone off. Haven't fixed it yet.

00:30:39.405 --> 00:30:41.085
<v Speaker 1>Haven't fixed it yet. So we'll we'll see.

00:30:41.085 --> 00:30:43.005
<v Speaker 1>I mean, it could be a proxy configuration.

00:30:43.005 --> 00:30:45.325
<v Speaker 1>It could be I p six being forced.

00:30:45.325 --> 00:30:46.125
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. It could be a lot

00:30:46.125 --> 00:30:48.420
<v Speaker 1>of different things. Can you prod your camera,

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:49.059
<v Speaker 0>Alex?

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.540
<v Speaker 0>I think it's Sorry. Yeah. This is what

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:54.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about, my camera. Sorry. Let's

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:56.580
<v Speaker 1>let's try echo. Let's do an env. Is

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:57.700
<v Speaker 1>it an HP proxy?

00:30:57.860 --> 00:30:58.580
<v Speaker 1>Mean, probably not.

00:30:59.235 --> 00:31:01.235
<v Speaker 1>Nope. That's not an echo now.

00:31:02.915 --> 00:31:05.315
<v Speaker 1>Let's just do Could be That

00:31:05.555 --> 00:31:06.514
<v Speaker 0>would be mean.

00:31:07.075 --> 00:31:08.355
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It could be.

00:31:08.835 --> 00:31:10.674
<v Speaker 1>Then I'd be really, really stuck.

00:31:12.035 --> 00:31:12.915
<v Speaker 1>So just looking.

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I mean, I don't see anything that

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:18.210
<v Speaker 1>is currently active on those.

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:20.450
<v Speaker 1>What else can I do? I'm trying to

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:23.570
<v Speaker 1>think proactively. Rogue processes under PSUX

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:24.930
<v Speaker 0>would be what I started to do.

00:31:27.145 --> 00:31:28.025
<v Speaker 1>I could

00:31:30.425 --> 00:31:32.184
<v Speaker 1>oh, that is htop, isn't it?

00:31:33.785 --> 00:31:35.145
<v Speaker 1>What we got here?

00:31:36.585 --> 00:31:37.945
<v Speaker 1>The Chrome process.

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:42.179
<v Speaker 1>Macron Taproot.

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:46.899
<v Speaker 1>What's we got?

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:50.020
<v Speaker 1>Wonder if it's a

00:31:53.059 --> 00:31:54.019
<v Speaker 1>what's that?

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:55.460
<v Speaker 1>That's

00:31:57.485 --> 00:31:59.884
<v Speaker 1>picking up on two thing. Okay.

00:32:02.684 --> 00:32:04.684
<v Speaker 1>I don't see anything that stands out.

00:32:05.804 --> 00:32:08.765
<v Speaker 2>That is a beefy machine. Yeah. 48 cores

00:32:08.765 --> 00:32:09.405
<v Speaker 0>of power

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:12.260
<v Speaker 0>It's 62 gig of RAM.

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:13.539
<v Speaker 0>That's the rule.

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.500
<v Speaker 2>It's what you need for your bad code

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.980
<v Speaker 2>application, isn't it? Yeah. For a Rust application

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:21.460
<v Speaker 0>that takes about 36 bytes of RAM. I

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:22.820
<v Speaker 1>didn't really think about this, but it could

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:24.420
<v Speaker 1>be done in Cilium, couldn't it? It could

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:26.020
<v Speaker 1>be a it could be a

00:32:26.395 --> 00:32:28.315
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It could a network policy. It could

00:32:28.315 --> 00:32:29.835
<v Speaker 1>be a yeah. Could be a network policy.

00:32:29.835 --> 00:32:32.155
<v Speaker 1>Let me just switch. Are you can you

00:32:32.155 --> 00:32:33.434
<v Speaker 1>switch back to other computers just because I

00:32:33.434 --> 00:32:35.515
<v Speaker 1>can change it? Okay. Yep. It's gone. K.

00:32:35.515 --> 00:32:36.155
<v Speaker 0>Nice. Off you go.

00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:40.330
<v Speaker 1>No cost to wide network policies. Okay. Damn.

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:41.610
<v Speaker 1>Thought that was gonna be it. Well, there

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:44.170
<v Speaker 0>are three policies. There's cost to wide network

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:46.170
<v Speaker 0>policies, there's still a network policies, and then

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:48.490
<v Speaker 0>there's networking v one network policy.

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:53.485
<v Speaker 1>Okay. No network policies.

00:32:54.285 --> 00:32:56.525
<v Speaker 0>And what about network and v one network

00:32:56.525 --> 00:32:57.164
<v Speaker 0>policy?

00:32:58.045 --> 00:32:59.245
<v Speaker 1>You see that?

00:32:59.965 --> 00:33:01.245
<v Speaker 1>I don't see that here.

00:33:02.685 --> 00:33:04.605
<v Speaker 1>Egress NAT policies endpoints.

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:08.379
<v Speaker 0>Well, just run kubectl get net net poll.

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:11.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. They're not custom resources. So Yeah. There

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:12.619
<v Speaker 0>we go.

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:17.419
<v Speaker 0>Okay. I don't think it allows all, like,

00:33:17.419 --> 00:33:17.980
<v Speaker 0>at the scrape.

00:33:18.585 --> 00:33:20.424
<v Speaker 1>I was just gonna have a look. I

00:33:22.585 --> 00:33:23.945
<v Speaker 1>think I could just delete that.

00:33:25.225 --> 00:33:28.024
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. There we go. Allowing this traffic none.

00:33:28.985 --> 00:33:29.624
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:33:30.105 --> 00:33:31.945
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It doesn't allow any ingress to the

00:33:31.945 --> 00:33:32.265
<v Speaker 0>cluster.

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:34.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It deletes.

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:38.270
<v Speaker 0>K.

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:40.030
<v Speaker 0>And I was gonna have you looking for

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:43.070
<v Speaker 0>eBPF probes as well. Oh, that that's not

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:44.510
<v Speaker 1>work. How mean do you think I am?

00:33:47.755 --> 00:33:48.874
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:33:49.515 --> 00:33:51.914
<v Speaker 0>Okay. That affects your current local host 30,000?

00:33:51.915 --> 00:33:53.115
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna have a look. What was

00:33:53.115 --> 00:33:54.475
<v Speaker 1>it again? It was thirty

00:33:54.554 --> 00:33:55.674
<v Speaker 1>thirty thousand.

00:33:59.595 --> 00:34:00.235
<v Speaker 1>No. It's

00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:02.290
<v Speaker 1>still sitting.

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:06.770
<v Speaker 0>But that that oh, no. Look. That's Postgres

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:09.730
<v Speaker 0>now waiting because we got we got headers.

00:34:15.165 --> 00:34:16.765
<v Speaker 1>Do have any logs from this?

00:34:17.565 --> 00:34:18.765
<v Speaker 1>Okay. No logs.

00:34:19.005 --> 00:34:20.605
<v Speaker 0>Postgres will have logs.

00:34:21.165 --> 00:34:22.685
<v Speaker 0>But, yeah, cluster point.

00:34:25.005 --> 00:34:26.285
<v Speaker 1>Not in the Postgres cluster.

00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Let's see logs there.

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:32.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Let's see if the service has been

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:33.410
<v Speaker 1>deleted.

00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:38.690
<v Speaker 1>It points to the

00:34:39.489 --> 00:34:41.090
<v Speaker 0>The ports look funny, though. Right?

00:34:42.094 --> 00:34:42.734
<v Speaker 1>Ports.

00:34:43.295 --> 00:34:44.415
<v Speaker 1>Can you see that?

00:34:44.815 --> 00:34:46.655
<v Speaker 0>Zero. Data is zero.

00:34:48.255 --> 00:34:50.574
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no. That's okay. Yeah. It's okay.

00:34:51.454 --> 00:34:52.974
<v Speaker 0>And CA will just throw me off on

00:34:52.974 --> 00:34:54.815
<v Speaker 0>the k nine. Yeah. I think it should

00:34:54.815 --> 00:34:56.734
<v Speaker 2>show zero when it's going to the same

00:34:56.734 --> 00:34:57.054
<v Speaker 2>port.

00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:59.270
<v Speaker 0>Why not just Yeah.

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:01.510
<v Speaker 1>Why not just show nothing on? Or sort

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:02.790
<v Speaker 2>of yeah. I don't know. I've spotted that

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:03.830
<v Speaker 2>in the past. I don't know. I don't

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:05.990
<v Speaker 2>know. Maybe it's not that. I mean, I

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:07.510
<v Speaker 1>don't know what the passwords are, so I

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:08.790
<v Speaker 1>can't tell if you've done if you changed

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:09.350
<v Speaker 1>that.

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:11.750
<v Speaker 1>I'll assume you weren't enough because that would

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:14.625
<v Speaker 1>be unsolved. It says the password was there,

00:35:14.625 --> 00:35:15.825
<v Speaker 2>Postgres password.

00:35:15.985 --> 00:35:17.185
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's hard to put it on the

00:35:17.185 --> 00:35:19.425
<v Speaker 0>app. I I I think that's correct. Okay.

00:35:20.065 --> 00:35:20.705
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:35:22.225 --> 00:35:23.425
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look.

00:35:23.905 --> 00:35:26.065
<v Speaker 1>So it got a little it's it's running.

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:30.269
<v Speaker 1>It's running on it's bound to an interface

00:35:30.269 --> 00:35:31.630
<v Speaker 1>that is bound to

00:35:32.589 --> 00:35:34.670
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't matter there. That's inside the pod.

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:36.109
<v Speaker 1>That's just the library to check.

00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:38.269
<v Speaker 1>What else we got?

00:35:40.745 --> 00:35:42.505
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I I think Postgres is running. I

00:35:42.505 --> 00:35:44.105
<v Speaker 1>can't really tell. I mean, I can install

00:35:44.105 --> 00:35:46.025
<v Speaker 1>p s equal, and we can start playing

00:35:46.025 --> 00:35:47.305
<v Speaker 1>with it, I guess, with the next thing.

00:35:47.305 --> 00:35:48.505
<v Speaker 1>We've only got a few minutes.

00:35:49.705 --> 00:35:51.945
<v Speaker 1>There's no hints in the hints directory. So

00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:57.190
<v Speaker 2>you can ask for him.

00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:58.950
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:01.510
<v Speaker 1>What's for him? I'll for a first hint.

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:03.830
<v Speaker 1>Can I can I get a lifeline?

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:05.670
<v Speaker 2>It's it's DNS.

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:08.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh, it's DNS. Oh, I thought I looked

00:36:08.385 --> 00:36:09.825
<v Speaker 1>at the core file.

00:36:10.785 --> 00:36:13.665
<v Speaker 1>Back to it. We go oversite. There's an

00:36:13.665 --> 00:36:14.385
<v Speaker 1>oversight.

00:36:15.905 --> 00:36:18.145
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's not that. Yeah. That looks okay.

00:36:18.385 --> 00:36:19.265
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That's fine.

00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:23.650
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look at your proxy.

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:28.450
<v Speaker 1>It looks like there is a good proxy

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:30.050
<v Speaker 0>because it's a silly and cluster with your

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:31.810
<v Speaker 0>proxy. Yes. Proxy running.

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:33.810
<v Speaker 1>I kinda haven't used

00:36:34.065 --> 00:36:35.345
<v Speaker 1>I haven't really used how to say the

00:36:35.345 --> 00:36:36.385
<v Speaker 1>inverse DNS.

00:36:38.145 --> 00:36:39.345
<v Speaker 1>Let have a look.

00:36:40.065 --> 00:36:42.145
<v Speaker 1>Is there a resource that you configure it

00:36:42.145 --> 00:36:43.105
<v Speaker 1>as a file?

00:36:43.744 --> 00:36:45.105
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look. We can figure out

00:36:45.105 --> 00:36:46.944
<v Speaker 1>how isn't responsible for DNS.

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:51.619
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look. So disable DNS. Let's

00:36:51.619 --> 00:36:53.060
<v Speaker 1>have a look at host DNS.

00:36:54.099 --> 00:36:56.339
<v Speaker 0>There were no cellular network policies. We still

00:36:56.339 --> 00:36:58.339
<v Speaker 0>have l seven DNS awareness, but we didn't

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.180
<v Speaker 1>I thought I thought we could do local

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:02.565
<v Speaker 1>DNS with Cilium or something like that or,

00:37:02.565 --> 00:37:04.805
<v Speaker 1>you know, DNS based rules. You can if

00:37:04.805 --> 00:37:08.005
<v Speaker 0>you use that Cilium local redirect policy, but

00:37:08.005 --> 00:37:09.445
<v Speaker 0>I don't think we've seen any when we

00:37:09.445 --> 00:37:12.244
<v Speaker 0>looked at k nines earlier. Okay. Well, let's

00:37:12.244 --> 00:37:14.965
<v Speaker 1>let's try something else. So if I spin

00:37:14.965 --> 00:37:15.445
<v Speaker 1>up a quick

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:18.020
<v Speaker 1>pod in the cluster, and I could try

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:19.540
<v Speaker 1>and use some network tools

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:22.100
<v Speaker 1>to do an s already.

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.020
<v Speaker 0>Should give you the to

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:24.980
<v Speaker 1>app.

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:27.540
<v Speaker 1>That's do they have apps in it? Yeah.

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:28.020
<v Speaker 0>It's

00:37:29.205 --> 00:37:30.805
<v Speaker 0>a point to I mean,

00:37:31.445 --> 00:37:32.645
<v Speaker 0>by default.

00:37:32.805 --> 00:37:34.885
<v Speaker 1>It's had I mean, well, unlike Ubuntu, this

00:37:34.885 --> 00:37:37.685
<v Speaker 1>has CVEs in. Ubuntu is the only distribution

00:37:37.685 --> 00:37:40.325
<v Speaker 1>of Linux on zero c major CVEs,

00:37:40.485 --> 00:37:41.730
<v Speaker 1>criticals, apparently.

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:44.530
<v Speaker 1>Whereas NGINX is the one that always comes

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:46.610
<v Speaker 1>up. I should just check this installed.

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:52.210
<v Speaker 0>Maybe Okay. App update first.

00:37:57.305 --> 00:37:57.945
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

00:37:59.385 --> 00:38:00.185
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:38:00.585 --> 00:38:01.465
<v Speaker 1>So the

00:38:02.425 --> 00:38:04.505
<v Speaker 1>so this part itself can't

00:38:05.545 --> 00:38:07.225
<v Speaker 0>yes. It's Yeah. They're doing it. That's the

00:38:07.225 --> 00:38:09.305
<v Speaker 0>cost of a ton. Yeah. Okay. Okay.

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:13.230
<v Speaker 1>K. Let's look at what's going on with

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:14.670
<v Speaker 1>core DNS.

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Let's go to the

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:22.910
<v Speaker 1>logs,

00:38:23.724 --> 00:38:24.845
<v Speaker 1>settings.

00:38:27.964 --> 00:38:29.165
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything you can really

00:38:29.165 --> 00:38:30.285
<v Speaker 1>tweak in there. I think it's just the

00:38:30.285 --> 00:38:31.165
<v Speaker 1>core file.

00:38:34.125 --> 00:38:34.765
<v Speaker 1>Abilities

00:38:34.925 --> 00:38:36.765
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you a question, Alistair.

00:38:36.845 --> 00:38:38.365
<v Speaker 0>Should we be looking on the worker?

00:38:40.650 --> 00:38:42.650
<v Speaker 2>Yes. Yeah. I think I know what this

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:43.930
<v Speaker 0>is, but I'm gonna give Alex

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:46.570
<v Speaker 1>Let's go and have a look at the

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:48.090
<v Speaker 1>worker then and see what's going on.

00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:50.170
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:51.450
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's the worker.

00:38:54.265 --> 00:38:55.465
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:38:59.865 --> 00:39:00.905
<v Speaker 1>Let's do

00:39:02.984 --> 00:39:04.905
<v Speaker 1>let's see if we can do any kind

00:39:04.905 --> 00:39:05.865
<v Speaker 1>of NS lookup.

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:10.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm just thinking whether

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:12.710
<v Speaker 1>whether it's gonna be something you've done at

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:13.590
<v Speaker 1>the host level,

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:14.870
<v Speaker 1>you know, like

00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:18.310
<v Speaker 1>no. We've still got we've got local DNS

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:18.950
<v Speaker 1>on the host.

00:39:20.435 --> 00:39:21.235
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:39:21.555 --> 00:39:22.755
<v Speaker 1>Let's try

00:39:24.755 --> 00:39:26.115
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to think here.

00:39:26.995 --> 00:39:28.355
<v Speaker 1>Coming from the

00:39:29.235 --> 00:39:31.075
<v Speaker 1>one of the pods running from this particular

00:39:31.075 --> 00:39:31.795
<v Speaker 1>node.

00:39:32.435 --> 00:39:35.920
<v Speaker 0>So there's a template setting for DNS configuration,

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.600
<v Speaker 0>which might be Oh, right. Okay.

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:44.960
<v Speaker 1>And the kibble kibble config in the manifests.

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:49.145
<v Speaker 0>You're need to go to Varlib kubelet, probably.

00:39:49.225 --> 00:39:49.785
<v Speaker 0>And

00:39:53.785 --> 00:39:55.305
<v Speaker 0>then config dot YAML.

00:39:55.545 --> 00:39:56.345
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:39:57.545 --> 00:39:58.425
<v Speaker 1>Oh, okay.

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:01.350
<v Speaker 1>So the cluster name is fine.

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:02.790
<v Speaker 1>Cluster DNS,

00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:04.950
<v Speaker 1>is that actually set to the IP address

00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:07.510
<v Speaker 1>of the static parts for core DNS?

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:11.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure. I think that's been modified.

00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:13.430
<v Speaker 0>I don't think it should be 1010.

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:37.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to restart this, do I?

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:39.515
<v Speaker 1>So just auto restart?

00:40:40.395 --> 00:40:42.315
<v Speaker 0>I think you're gonna have to kick some

00:40:42.315 --> 00:40:42.955
<v Speaker 0>pods,

00:40:43.595 --> 00:40:44.795
<v Speaker 0>I think. Right?

00:40:45.515 --> 00:40:47.355
<v Speaker 0>Because the DNS configuration

00:40:47.595 --> 00:40:50.075
<v Speaker 0>is injected into the sandbox, so you'll probably

00:40:50.075 --> 00:40:52.395
<v Speaker 0>have to delete the cluster pod for the

00:40:52.395 --> 00:40:53.195
<v Speaker 0>DNS to do it.

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:54.560
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.640
<v Speaker 0>And that's assuming he's not changed the default

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.080
<v Speaker 0>cluster DNS policy.

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.640
<v Speaker 0>I couldn't see in the config.

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:03.440
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I didn't put enough breaks

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.560
<v Speaker 1>in and mind that. I think I need

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:05.120
<v Speaker 1>to things.

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh, well, we got through quite a few.

00:41:08.825 --> 00:41:10.744
<v Speaker 1>Let's see whether that's worked.

00:41:11.384 --> 00:41:12.425
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:41:13.464 --> 00:41:15.704
<v Speaker 0>Job done. We have v two video in

00:41:15.704 --> 00:41:17.464
<v Speaker 0>there. Well,

00:41:17.464 --> 00:41:19.785
<v Speaker 1>lots of help from you, David. So thank

00:41:19.785 --> 00:41:19.865
<v Speaker 1>you.

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:23.370
<v Speaker 2>Well done. That was fun. Well done.

00:41:23.849 --> 00:41:26.089
<v Speaker 2>Those those were all things that I've fixed

00:41:26.089 --> 00:41:26.970
<v Speaker 2>in the past

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:28.330
<v Speaker 2>on the cluster.

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:30.810
<v Speaker 2>So I tried to keep them real.

00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Awesome. Interesting. My favorite one is,

00:41:37.045 --> 00:41:39.285
<v Speaker 1>I like the I like the net policy.

00:41:39.285 --> 00:41:41.045
<v Speaker 1>I think that was quite funny because you

00:41:41.045 --> 00:41:42.165
<v Speaker 1>can just look at that and, oh, it's

00:41:42.165 --> 00:41:43.285
<v Speaker 1>fine. You know?

00:41:44.085 --> 00:41:46.245
<v Speaker 0>I think that's the the thing about network

00:41:46.245 --> 00:41:48.165
<v Speaker 0>policies. Right? It's like there's

00:41:48.165 --> 00:41:50.550
<v Speaker 0>so much defaulting going on that they passed

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:52.870
<v Speaker 0>the eyeball test when they do literally nothing.

00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:54.230
<v Speaker 0>And then what you have to really you

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:56.310
<v Speaker 0>gotta really understand that actually they they block

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:57.910
<v Speaker 0>all by default. You

00:41:58.150 --> 00:42:00.070
<v Speaker 0>need to start opening things up. Yeah.

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:03.270
<v Speaker 0>And then the DNS change with the eyeball.

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:04.870
<v Speaker 0>It's like 10 dot 10 passes the eyeball

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:06.345
<v Speaker 0>test. I've just seen enough shit that I

00:42:06.345 --> 00:42:09.465
<v Speaker 0>know that that's not right. That's

00:42:09.465 --> 00:42:11.305
<v Speaker 2>a magic IP as well because it's set

00:42:11.305 --> 00:42:12.665
<v Speaker 2>to the same as the service is set

00:42:12.665 --> 00:42:14.825
<v Speaker 2>to. And if it's not right or one

00:42:14.825 --> 00:42:16.825
<v Speaker 2>of them has been changed or something, then

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.560
<v Speaker 2>things get weird. There

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:20.920
<v Speaker 0>we go. I have to I have to

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:21.720
<v Speaker 1>prefix

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:24.359
<v Speaker 1>this as if we go into it. Mine

00:42:24.359 --> 00:42:26.599
<v Speaker 1>was way too hard to begin with. Right?

00:42:26.599 --> 00:42:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Way too hard. It was causing David some

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:30.680
<v Speaker 1>headaches, like because I kept asking to restart

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:32.655
<v Speaker 1>the computer server. So I I think I've

00:42:32.655 --> 00:42:34.335
<v Speaker 1>gone one away now. So I think you

00:42:34.335 --> 00:42:35.775
<v Speaker 1>might end up solving it in about thirty

00:42:35.775 --> 00:42:38.415
<v Speaker 1>seconds. So if that's the case, I apologize.

00:42:39.455 --> 00:42:41.055
<v Speaker 0>Sorry. You could just add more Blake's while

00:42:41.055 --> 00:42:43.695
<v Speaker 0>he's faxing. Like okay. Yeah. That is true.

00:42:43.695 --> 00:42:46.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going in. Live action clustered breaker.

00:42:47.609 --> 00:42:49.210
<v Speaker 0>Red team, blue team. Yeah.

00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:51.130
<v Speaker 2>That'd be fun, wouldn't it?

00:42:51.609 --> 00:42:53.770
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, awesome work, Alex.

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:56.650
<v Speaker 0>You finished under time. You got everything working,

00:42:56.730 --> 00:42:58.330
<v Speaker 0>and we've seen some cool breaks along the

00:42:58.330 --> 00:43:00.635
<v Speaker 0>way. So thank you, Alistair. Alistair, do you

00:43:00.635 --> 00:43:02.635
<v Speaker 0>wanna open up a session on

00:43:02.715 --> 00:43:04.715
<v Speaker 0>Alex Jones control plane one? Let me know

00:43:04.715 --> 00:43:05.915
<v Speaker 0>when you've done it. I'll join it, and

00:43:05.915 --> 00:43:07.035
<v Speaker 0>we'll check over.

00:43:07.835 --> 00:43:08.635
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:43:09.115 --> 00:43:09.835
<v Speaker 2>Yes.

00:43:10.474 --> 00:43:11.835
<v Speaker 2>Control plane one.

00:43:12.555 --> 00:43:13.595
<v Speaker 2>Join that session.

00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:17.190
<v Speaker 2>Okay. Give me a sec.

00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:20.630
<v Speaker 2>It's

00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:22.870
<v Speaker 2>just hanging, I think.

00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:25.910
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I said on the chat saying

00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:28.070
<v Speaker 0>that was great. Alex is still calm while

00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:30.595
<v Speaker 0>debugging. Not only were you calm, like, were

00:43:30.595 --> 00:43:32.835
<v Speaker 0>verbalizing your thought process. Like, we I I

00:43:32.835 --> 00:43:34.434
<v Speaker 0>just I was just sitting back and joined.

00:43:34.434 --> 00:43:35.875
<v Speaker 0>Like, I didn't have to do anything. Thank

00:43:35.875 --> 00:43:38.275
<v Speaker 0>you. If as a word of advice, when

00:43:38.275 --> 00:43:40.115
<v Speaker 1>people do that in interviews, it's really helpful

00:43:40.115 --> 00:43:41.875
<v Speaker 1>for interviewers. You know? If you're doing a

00:43:41.875 --> 00:43:43.555
<v Speaker 1>coding interview and you don't feel you feel

00:43:43.555 --> 00:43:45.980
<v Speaker 1>really stressed or nervous, just vocalize it because

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:48.140
<v Speaker 1>I actually I find it helps me stay

00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:48.780
<v Speaker 1>calm.

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:52.060
<v Speaker 0>Can you not connect, Alistair?

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:53.020
<v Speaker 2>Yes.

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:55.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm in now. It took a long time.

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:58.484
<v Speaker 0>I'm sure that's a good sign. I'm sure

00:43:58.484 --> 00:44:01.365
<v Speaker 0>that is Everything's very slow. Oh, no.

00:44:04.484 --> 00:44:06.644
<v Speaker 1>You should have seen the sadistic people I

00:44:06.644 --> 00:44:08.724
<v Speaker 1>work with. You should have seen the things

00:44:08.724 --> 00:44:11.125
<v Speaker 1>they were suggesting I do. I have held

00:44:11.125 --> 00:44:11.444
<v Speaker 1>back.

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.000
<v Speaker 0>Well, we had a nice welcome message as

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:16.560
<v Speaker 0>we

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:17.760
<v Speaker 0>approached.

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:17.920
<v Speaker 2>So

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:20.720
<v Speaker 2>Well, I'm I'm doing the same, Alex. Sorry.

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.640
<v Speaker 0>Sorry. You're doing that. No. K nine s

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:23.280
<v Speaker 2>first.

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.520
<v Speaker 2>But it's being very slow,

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.000
<v Speaker 2>which is filling me with thread.

00:44:28.885 --> 00:44:29.605
<v Speaker 2>So

00:44:30.165 --> 00:44:32.485
<v Speaker 2>we we have some hose breaks, I assume.

00:44:32.645 --> 00:44:34.245
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna grab a glass of water.

00:44:34.645 --> 00:44:35.445
<v Speaker 2>Alright.

00:44:37.285 --> 00:44:39.205
<v Speaker 2>It is doing it, but it is slow.

00:44:42.485 --> 00:44:44.620
<v Speaker 2>So Give that a second. Running h top

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:45.980
<v Speaker 0>after this and see if we

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:48.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Maybe I give you one of the

00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:50.380
<v Speaker 0>machines with one VCP here.

00:44:56.345 --> 00:44:58.665
<v Speaker 2>Okay. What does that say? It's telling you

00:44:58.665 --> 00:45:00.105
<v Speaker 0>to source that mail.

00:45:00.425 --> 00:45:01.625
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Okay.

00:45:01.945 --> 00:45:03.705
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing more annoying than you're on a

00:45:03.705 --> 00:45:04.905
<v Speaker 1>really slow machine.

00:45:06.025 --> 00:45:08.265
<v Speaker 1>Gosh. No. You got a nice machine too.

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:12.690
<v Speaker 0>But it's likely that any performance degradation you're

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:13.890
<v Speaker 0>seeing is intentional.

00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:15.810
<v Speaker 0>Good luck.

00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:19.970
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:22.290
<v Speaker 2>At least you could taste. Thing.

00:45:24.445 --> 00:45:26.765
<v Speaker 2>Which one is it? E f minus h.

00:45:28.445 --> 00:45:29.965
<v Speaker 2>Have we got a full disc?

00:45:30.205 --> 00:45:30.845
<v Speaker 2>No.

00:45:32.605 --> 00:45:33.405
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:45:34.765 --> 00:45:36.560
<v Speaker 1>Can I ask a question? I I is

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:38.080
<v Speaker 1>it another part which is why you're doing

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:39.440
<v Speaker 1>so we'd throw them off?

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.120
<v Speaker 0>Sorry. Say that again? Say again. I was

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:44.560
<v Speaker 1>wondering if you're okay if I ask questions,

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:45.840
<v Speaker 1>or is it gonna throw you off whilst

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:47.440
<v Speaker 1>you're doing this? I just was wondering why

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:49.200
<v Speaker 1>would that be your default go to? Why

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:51.200
<v Speaker 1>would the disk being full, why do you

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:53.545
<v Speaker 1>think that will slow down the CPU?

00:45:55.145 --> 00:45:56.825
<v Speaker 1>Well, it just slows everything down.

00:45:59.705 --> 00:46:02.825
<v Speaker 2>From from from his from my past experience,

00:46:02.825 --> 00:46:04.585
<v Speaker 2>I don't I don't really

00:46:05.349 --> 00:46:06.230
<v Speaker 2>know the

00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:08.230
<v Speaker 2>ins and outs of it. But when I've

00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:09.990
<v Speaker 2>when I've SSHed onto a machine, which is

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.550
<v Speaker 2>full,

00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:12.230
<v Speaker 2>it's usually pretty slow.

00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:14.550
<v Speaker 0>Normally, because all the processes are trying to

00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:16.390
<v Speaker 0>write logs, and they can't and you get

00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:18.630
<v Speaker 0>lockups. But I think they're okay. There are

00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:20.785
<v Speaker 0>I mean, there is some rules because there's

00:46:20.865 --> 00:46:22.785
<v Speaker 0>one of them has no saturation attack. So

00:46:22.865 --> 00:46:25.185
<v Speaker 1>We should it's largely through swapping as well.

00:46:25.345 --> 00:46:28.145
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Just a problem. So I'll send them

00:46:29.665 --> 00:46:31.425
<v Speaker 2>I think it's not there now.

00:46:32.225 --> 00:46:32.865
<v Speaker 0>Is it gone?

00:46:33.869 --> 00:46:36.349
<v Speaker 2>I don't know. What what now? It's there.

00:46:36.349 --> 00:46:38.349
<v Speaker 2>I know. It's it's oh, it's It's slow.

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:41.790
<v Speaker 2>Guys, very slow.

00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:43.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:48.029
<v Speaker 2>Why is it slow?

00:46:50.265 --> 00:46:51.305
<v Speaker 1>What's happening?

00:46:52.744 --> 00:46:54.425
<v Speaker 1>Nothing

00:46:58.984 --> 00:47:00.505
<v Speaker 1>showing as

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:02.440
<v Speaker 2>using

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:03.720
<v Speaker 2>too much CPU.

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:06.600
<v Speaker 2>In fact, this command is the slowest one.

00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:15.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.

00:47:21.605 --> 00:47:22.724
<v Speaker 0>I mean, all you need to do is

00:47:22.724 --> 00:47:24.884
<v Speaker 0>update v one to v two. It doesn't

00:47:24.884 --> 00:47:26.085
<v Speaker 0>matter if it's slow, really.

00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:32.650
<v Speaker 2>Give

00:47:33.609 --> 00:47:34.170
<v Speaker 2>oh

00:47:34.410 --> 00:47:35.850
<v Speaker 2>my god. Mistype.

00:47:41.605 --> 00:47:42.165
<v Speaker 2>And

00:47:42.565 --> 00:47:44.165
<v Speaker 2>it's admin.com,

00:47:44.165 --> 00:47:45.605
<v Speaker 2>isn't it? It is indeed.

00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:56.270
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do my export. He doesn't source

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:56.910
<v Speaker 0>the

00:47:57.070 --> 00:48:03.070
<v Speaker 0>yeah. I've

00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:04.590
<v Speaker 2>gotta fill this time with talk, and I

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:05.870
<v Speaker 2>have no chat. So

00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:08.990
<v Speaker 1>okay.

00:48:09.665 --> 00:48:10.545
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:48:11.025 --> 00:48:12.145
<v Speaker 0>What do we have?

00:48:13.665 --> 00:48:15.105
<v Speaker 2>Unable to connect.

00:48:15.665 --> 00:48:17.984
<v Speaker 2>Of course. We have no context, no cluster,

00:48:17.984 --> 00:48:19.745
<v Speaker 0>no API server potentially.

00:48:20.145 --> 00:48:20.945
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:48:21.185 --> 00:48:21.505
<v Speaker 2>So

00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:26.830
<v Speaker 0>Not the best amount to test the APIs

00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:30.110
<v Speaker 0>ever. I've gotta say. Quit.

00:48:30.590 --> 00:48:32.430
<v Speaker 1>K nine is quite heavy, isn't it? There's

00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:33.230
<v Speaker 1>quite a few calls.

00:48:37.065 --> 00:48:38.744
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I feel like you're trying to give

00:48:38.744 --> 00:48:40.185
<v Speaker 2>me a hint, but I'm too stupid to

00:48:40.185 --> 00:48:41.145
<v Speaker 2>know what it means.

00:48:41.625 --> 00:48:43.065
<v Speaker 1>I can give you a hint if you

00:48:43.065 --> 00:48:44.744
<v Speaker 1>would like. Because this might if you don't

00:48:44.744 --> 00:48:46.425
<v Speaker 1>know this, it might be quite difficult.

00:48:47.945 --> 00:48:49.145
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Go for it.

00:48:49.945 --> 00:48:51.545
<v Speaker 0>Oh, come on. It's too early for that.

00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:56.580
<v Speaker 1>Me just

00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:00.260
<v Speaker 1>say this. The the the speed

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:03.140
<v Speaker 1>slowdown is not gonna impede you, like David

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:04.740
<v Speaker 1>said. That's not gonna stop you from doing

00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:05.380
<v Speaker 1>what you're trying to do.

00:49:07.225 --> 00:49:08.665
<v Speaker 0>If you're worried about

00:49:09.065 --> 00:49:10.025
<v Speaker 0>slow down,

00:49:10.105 --> 00:49:10.745
<v Speaker 0>like,

00:49:11.385 --> 00:49:12.745
<v Speaker 0>best CTL

00:49:12.905 --> 00:49:14.825
<v Speaker 0>would be something I start exploring.

00:49:14.985 --> 00:49:15.705
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:49:19.385 --> 00:49:21.065
<v Speaker 0>We don't need that. We can do this.

00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:22.670
<v Speaker 0>Come on. Yeah.

00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:24.590
<v Speaker 2>Let's have a look.

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:34.349
<v Speaker 2>Container d is not running.

00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:36.190
<v Speaker 0>We don't need Container d.

00:49:39.875 --> 00:49:41.795
<v Speaker 2>So the qubits in the crash loop.

00:49:46.435 --> 00:49:48.515
<v Speaker 2>Dynamic file. Dynamic.

00:49:50.035 --> 00:49:51.940
<v Speaker 2>It suddenly got really hot in here.

00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:56.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm just gonna turn the heating off. Alexa,

00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:59.060
<v Speaker 2>turn off the office floor. Oh, actually hot.

00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:00.340
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I thought you were just nervous and

00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:00.980
<v Speaker 0>sweating.

00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:03.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh, no. No. The temperature is it? It's

00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:04.660
<v Speaker 2>only 22.

00:50:06.115 --> 00:50:06.675
<v Speaker 1>But I only

00:50:07.475 --> 00:50:07.955
<v Speaker 1>updated

00:50:08.275 --> 00:50:10.515
<v Speaker 1>your Alexa, so it's increasing the temperature in

00:50:10.515 --> 00:50:11.315
<v Speaker 1>your office.

00:50:13.315 --> 00:50:14.675
<v Speaker 2>Next level clustered.

00:50:14.995 --> 00:50:15.475
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:50:18.035 --> 00:50:19.715
<v Speaker 2>Would that be causing it to be super

00:50:19.715 --> 00:50:20.595
<v Speaker 2>slow? Probably not.

00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:23.240
<v Speaker 0>I mean, if we're seeing a slowdown like

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.280
<v Speaker 0>this without

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:26.680
<v Speaker 0>CPUs and RAM being hammered,

00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:28.760
<v Speaker 0>my immediate thing is I I mean, I

00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:30.360
<v Speaker 0>would wanna start looking at this control and

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:32.120
<v Speaker 0>see maybe modify the table to see if

00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:35.325
<v Speaker 0>it is running processes under nice, like, control

00:50:35.325 --> 00:50:36.845
<v Speaker 0>groups for random

00:50:37.165 --> 00:50:38.285
<v Speaker 0>system processes.

00:50:42.205 --> 00:50:43.405
<v Speaker 0>That for CPU.

00:50:46.445 --> 00:50:47.885
<v Speaker 2>Is it That guy.

00:50:48.609 --> 00:50:50.050
<v Speaker 0>Mean, it should all be lowercase, but just

00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:51.250
<v Speaker 0>okay. Yeah.

00:50:56.369 --> 00:50:58.370
<v Speaker 2>Mine is alright. Yeah.

00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:00.690
<v Speaker 2>Max percent 25.

00:51:02.105 --> 00:51:03.465
<v Speaker 2>Or CPU.

00:51:04.664 --> 00:51:06.825
<v Speaker 0>So it could be it depends how it's

00:51:06.825 --> 00:51:08.345
<v Speaker 0>been. Right? So you could have processed these

00:51:08.345 --> 00:51:10.345
<v Speaker 0>changes to some sort of fail. In which

00:51:10.345 --> 00:51:11.785
<v Speaker 0>case, you could try just running

00:51:12.345 --> 00:51:13.865
<v Speaker 0>you you could try resetting

00:51:14.025 --> 00:51:14.825
<v Speaker 0>all these things.

00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:19.660
<v Speaker 0>But, yeah, that pair of CPU 10 max

00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:20.380
<v Speaker 0>percent.

00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:23.340
<v Speaker 0>I I don't know if that's just normal

00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:24.940
<v Speaker 0>or we're just looking at it under the

00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:27.020
<v Speaker 0>context of things being broken, but I would

00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:27.580
<v Speaker 0>maybe change it.

00:51:33.825 --> 00:51:35.185
<v Speaker 2>How do you set one?

00:51:36.065 --> 00:51:37.184
<v Speaker 2>MSW?

00:51:37.184 --> 00:51:37.744
<v Speaker 2>No.

00:51:38.144 --> 00:51:39.984
<v Speaker 0>Well, just do sys control dash dash system.

00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:46.330
<v Speaker 0>Does that reset them? I think so. So

00:51:46.330 --> 00:51:47.930
<v Speaker 0>no graphic for CPU again?

00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:50.010
<v Speaker 2>Still very slow.

00:52:02.295 --> 00:52:03.095
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:52:03.175 --> 00:52:05.095
<v Speaker 0>Is that something we should be looking at,

00:52:05.095 --> 00:52:07.335
<v Speaker 0>Alex, that pair of CPU time max percent,

00:52:07.335 --> 00:52:09.815
<v Speaker 0>or is that a redhead? Yeah. That that

00:52:09.815 --> 00:52:12.535
<v Speaker 1>has not been modified. Okay. That's not because

00:52:12.535 --> 00:52:13.335
<v Speaker 1>of the speed.

00:52:31.275 --> 00:52:32.715
<v Speaker 1>What command was that?

00:52:33.675 --> 00:52:34.235
<v Speaker 2>Message.

00:52:34.475 --> 00:52:36.235
<v Speaker 2>D message. Alright.

00:52:36.555 --> 00:52:37.195
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:52:39.115 --> 00:52:40.795
<v Speaker 1>I mean, that's going very low level.

00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:47.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:52.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I have literally no idea.

00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:57.310
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I would just

00:52:56.565 --> 00:52:59.125
<v Speaker 2>kill this machine from the auto scanning group,

00:52:59.125 --> 00:53:00.485
<v Speaker 2>and it would come back to life.

00:53:00.964 --> 00:53:02.805
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's let's do some

00:53:03.285 --> 00:53:05.045
<v Speaker 0>searching. Alright? So

00:53:05.365 --> 00:53:06.885
<v Speaker 0>alright. Or you can just keep typing d

00:53:06.885 --> 00:53:07.445
<v Speaker 0>message.

00:53:07.765 --> 00:53:09.444
<v Speaker 2>Sorry. I didn't know what was happening.

00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:13.560
<v Speaker 2>That was fun.

00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:14.680
<v Speaker 0>I don't know. I

00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 0>alright. Maybe not then.

00:53:31.855 --> 00:53:32.655
<v Speaker 2>Mhmm.

00:53:39.375 --> 00:53:40.895
<v Speaker 0>What have you done? Let me see.

00:53:44.550 --> 00:53:46.390
<v Speaker 0>Well, processes look alright.

00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:49.350
<v Speaker 0>The slowness

00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:50.150
<v Speaker 0>I mean,

00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:52.630
<v Speaker 0>yeah, the the typing

00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:54.790
<v Speaker 0>speed is a little slow. Right?

00:53:55.350 --> 00:53:57.750
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm. What if we

00:54:01.325 --> 00:54:03.245
<v Speaker 0>oh, I wanna see if we can actually

00:54:05.405 --> 00:54:07.885
<v Speaker 0>cause the course to actually do some work

00:54:09.485 --> 00:54:10.685
<v Speaker 0>because

00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:13.630
<v Speaker 0>yeah.

00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:17.150
<v Speaker 0>Alex has been mean, hasn't he?

00:54:18.270 --> 00:54:20.270
<v Speaker 1>I've done far fewer fit things than you

00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:20.830
<v Speaker 1>have.

00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:24.350
<v Speaker 1>You

00:54:25.390 --> 00:54:26.705
<v Speaker 1>were up over, I think, five or six

00:54:26.705 --> 00:54:29.105
<v Speaker 1>different things. So you had me running through

00:54:29.105 --> 00:54:30.785
<v Speaker 1>hoops, jumping through hoops.

00:54:32.385 --> 00:54:35.105
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We'll take a hand then. I feel

00:54:35.105 --> 00:54:37.185
<v Speaker 0>like you've disabled some of the CPUs,

00:54:37.505 --> 00:54:39.345
<v Speaker 0>maybe constrained the IOPS over this.

00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:41.480
<v Speaker 0>But I to be honest, I'm not sure

00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:42.440
<v Speaker 0>how to check.

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:44.840
<v Speaker 1>If you were physically in front of the

00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:45.560
<v Speaker 1>machine

00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:47.720
<v Speaker 1>typing on the terminal, you wouldn't see this

00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:48.440
<v Speaker 2>latency.

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:49.960
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:54:50.119 --> 00:54:51.080
<v Speaker 2>So some

00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:56.105
<v Speaker 1>may Just to slightly speed this up, you're

00:54:56.105 --> 00:54:57.625
<v Speaker 1>still gonna have to work out the answer,

00:54:57.945 --> 00:54:59.545
<v Speaker 1>but it it's

00:54:59.945 --> 00:55:01.705
<v Speaker 1>using traffic control.

00:55:06.185 --> 00:55:08.265
<v Speaker 0>The TC control. Which is a program.

00:55:11.590 --> 00:55:13.590
<v Speaker 0>We've all ever seen traffic control once on

00:55:13.590 --> 00:55:14.390
<v Speaker 0>clustered.

00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:17.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's pretty nice, and not a lot

00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:18.550
<v Speaker 1>of people use it.

00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:23.350
<v Speaker 2>Where's its comp?

00:55:24.105 --> 00:55:25.545
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't have one.

00:55:25.705 --> 00:55:26.585
<v Speaker 2>Oh, no.

00:55:27.225 --> 00:55:27.945
<v Speaker 2>It's everywhere.

00:55:29.465 --> 00:55:32.425
<v Speaker 0>Run PC commands and you apply

00:55:32.984 --> 00:55:34.345
<v Speaker 0>constraint.

00:55:34.345 --> 00:55:36.025
<v Speaker 0>We've seen that in the past where one

00:55:36.025 --> 00:55:39.030
<v Speaker 0>person applied a 50% network packet drop on

00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:40.390
<v Speaker 0>all is OTCP

00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:41.030
<v Speaker 0>traffic.

00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:43.270
<v Speaker 2>Wow. That's mean.

00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Also breaks teleport,

00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:51.030
<v Speaker 1>apparently.

00:55:53.085 --> 00:55:54.445
<v Speaker 0>Less

00:55:54.925 --> 00:55:55.805
<v Speaker 0>constraint.

00:55:55.805 --> 00:55:57.085
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna Google it.

00:56:01.325 --> 00:56:02.205
<v Speaker 2>Me too.

00:56:02.605 --> 00:56:03.725
<v Speaker 0>Traffic control.

00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:20.805
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So we have some sort of queuing

00:56:20.805 --> 00:56:21.765
<v Speaker 0>discipline.

00:56:24.165 --> 00:56:25.525
<v Speaker 0>We have filters

00:56:25.685 --> 00:56:26.405
<v Speaker 0>for

00:56:29.845 --> 00:56:30.405
<v Speaker 0>going to just

00:56:31.204 --> 00:56:33.525
<v Speaker 0>how do we list all those traffic control

00:56:33.525 --> 00:56:34.484
<v Speaker 0>modifications?

00:56:34.484 --> 00:56:35.605
<v Speaker 0>That's what I wanna know.

00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:39.520
<v Speaker 0>If that's even possible.

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:43.200
<v Speaker 0>Qdesk seems to be the command they mentioned

00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:43.760
<v Speaker 0>them more.

00:56:51.755 --> 00:56:52.715
<v Speaker 0>There you go.

00:56:55.674 --> 00:56:57.835
<v Speaker 0>So we have a limit thousand delay one

00:56:57.835 --> 00:56:59.674
<v Speaker 0>point five seconds and a limit thousand delay

00:56:59.674 --> 00:57:01.195
<v Speaker 0>five hundred millisecond

00:57:01.515 --> 00:57:02.395
<v Speaker 0>applied

00:57:02.395 --> 00:57:04.315
<v Speaker 0>to east zero and east one.

00:57:05.770 --> 00:57:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:57:09.849 --> 00:57:11.530
<v Speaker 0>I don't know how to delete them.

00:57:16.970 --> 00:57:18.250
<v Speaker 1>You can just live with it.

00:57:19.045 --> 00:57:21.605
<v Speaker 0>You could just live with it. Mean Yeah.

00:57:21.605 --> 00:57:22.325
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah.

00:57:26.165 --> 00:57:28.005
<v Speaker 1>You're getting, like, the experience of running a

00:57:28.005 --> 00:57:29.685
<v Speaker 1>Pentium four six five or, like, you know,

00:57:29.685 --> 00:57:31.525
<v Speaker 1>early nineties computers. Yes.

00:57:32.130 --> 00:57:33.970
<v Speaker 2>From half the country away

00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:35.810
<v Speaker 2>before my time.

00:57:39.569 --> 00:57:40.930
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I I don't know if I

00:57:40.930 --> 00:57:42.289
<v Speaker 0>should be allowed to make up commands. I

00:57:42.450 --> 00:57:43.490
<v Speaker 0>I'm not feeling brave.

00:57:45.569 --> 00:57:47.329
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's just Google it. I guess it's

00:57:47.329 --> 00:57:48.315
<v Speaker 0>what we do when we talk to the

00:57:48.315 --> 00:57:49.835
<v Speaker 0>answer to something. So

00:57:50.315 --> 00:57:51.675
<v Speaker 0>how do we remove

00:57:55.115 --> 00:57:56.954
<v Speaker 2>What was it called? And So you can

00:57:56.954 --> 00:57:59.595
<v Speaker 0>do a t c q dash del dev

00:57:59.595 --> 00:58:00.395
<v Speaker 0>dev

00:58:00.555 --> 00:58:03.090
<v Speaker 0>root. Right? So let's modify that

00:58:04.849 --> 00:58:06.690
<v Speaker 0>to try and match those two rules that

00:58:06.690 --> 00:58:09.010
<v Speaker 0>we have there. So q dash del

00:58:09.490 --> 00:58:11.569
<v Speaker 0>dev probably stays dev, but the dev in

00:58:11.569 --> 00:58:13.490
<v Speaker 0>uppercase is probably

00:58:13.565 --> 00:58:16.125
<v Speaker 0>EF0 and EF1. E F 0. Wanna run

00:58:16.125 --> 00:58:18.845
<v Speaker 2>it for those two, I think. Okay.

00:58:19.965 --> 00:58:21.885
<v Speaker 0>And if we lose access to Teleport, we'll

00:58:21.885 --> 00:58:23.245
<v Speaker 0>just go to the pub and have a

00:58:23.245 --> 00:58:23.485
<v Speaker 0>beer.

00:58:25.830 --> 00:58:27.510
<v Speaker 2>Well, I set it to a thousand seconds

00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:28.150
<v Speaker 2>then.

00:58:29.590 --> 00:58:30.230
<v Speaker 2>Alright.

00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:34.310
<v Speaker 0>Try the Oh my god. It's so quick.

00:58:39.075 --> 00:58:39.795
<v Speaker 0>Yay.

00:58:40.515 --> 00:58:42.355
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I feel like a running arch there.

00:58:42.515 --> 00:58:43.235
<v Speaker 0>No?

00:58:45.955 --> 00:58:47.875
<v Speaker 2>There we go. It's so quick.

00:58:50.675 --> 00:58:52.435
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen somebody so happy.

00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:53.900
<v Speaker 1>Oh,

00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:58.620
<v Speaker 2>it's so good. Right. There you go, DJ.

00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:00.380
<v Speaker 2>Right. Yes.

00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:03.980
<v Speaker 2>That

00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:05.740
<v Speaker 2>was fun.

00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:06.780
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:08.540
<v Speaker 2>These are the cubelet logs.

00:59:09.955 --> 00:59:11.395
<v Speaker 0>What happens if you try and keep control

00:59:11.395 --> 00:59:13.635
<v Speaker 0>get nodes? Do we just have no API

00:59:13.635 --> 00:59:14.355
<v Speaker 0>server?

00:59:14.755 --> 00:59:16.595
<v Speaker 2>The Kubelet is crashing.

00:59:17.395 --> 00:59:18.835
<v Speaker 0>You don't need a Kubelet for an API

00:59:18.835 --> 00:59:19.234
<v Speaker 0>server.

00:59:24.210 --> 00:59:25.490
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Probably.

00:59:28.450 --> 00:59:29.090
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:35.170
<v Speaker 2>This one, CTL.

00:59:35.170 --> 00:59:35.490
<v Speaker 2>No.

00:59:37.295 --> 00:59:38.095
<v Speaker 2>Status.

00:59:39.215 --> 00:59:40.175
<v Speaker 2>Okay. No.

00:59:45.295 --> 00:59:46.655
<v Speaker 0>Inactive and dead.

00:59:47.215 --> 00:59:47.615
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

00:59:55.070 --> 00:59:56.910
<v Speaker 0>Do enable that session error,

00:59:57.310 --> 00:59:58.510
<v Speaker 0>and that will start with the.

01:00:04.115 --> 01:00:05.235
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Look.

01:00:14.275 --> 01:00:15.234
<v Speaker 0>Hey. He's doing stuff.

01:00:17.050 --> 01:00:18.410
<v Speaker 2>Something not found.

01:00:20.170 --> 01:00:21.849
<v Speaker 2>Versatile part. Let's see.

01:00:30.315 --> 01:00:31.115
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

01:00:32.235 --> 01:00:35.115
<v Speaker 0>You didn't trust cube control, did you? Oh.

01:00:50.610 --> 01:00:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Fine.

01:01:03.005 --> 01:01:04.365
<v Speaker 0>So that is a binary.

01:01:04.605 --> 01:01:05.645
<v Speaker 2>It's a go binary.

01:01:09.089 --> 01:01:10.450
<v Speaker 0>Try control

01:01:10.450 --> 01:01:11.410
<v Speaker 0>version.

01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:12.930
<v Speaker 0>I'll leave it all that.

01:01:14.530 --> 01:01:15.170
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:01:15.490 --> 01:01:16.690
<v Speaker 0>I was gonna say I should It's just

01:01:16.690 --> 01:01:17.010
<v Speaker 0>the one.

01:01:21.025 --> 01:01:23.425
<v Speaker 0>So you did a fail on the actual

01:01:23.425 --> 01:01:25.905
<v Speaker 0>binary, but try to type your control without

01:01:25.905 --> 01:01:26.705
<v Speaker 0>the which.

01:01:29.265 --> 01:01:31.025
<v Speaker 0>It may not you may not be executing

01:01:31.025 --> 01:01:31.825
<v Speaker 0>the binary.

01:01:32.145 --> 01:01:32.545
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:34.589
<v Speaker 2>Oh, there you go.

01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:36.190
<v Speaker 1>That

01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:38.589
<v Speaker 1>was that was last year originally. That's been

01:01:38.589 --> 01:01:39.470
<v Speaker 1>turned out.

01:01:41.309 --> 01:01:43.630
<v Speaker 0>That's Control delete all namespaces.

01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:46.349
<v Speaker 0>Shift code tag. Shift all alpha echo.

01:01:46.349 --> 01:01:47.950
<v Speaker 2>Terminal echo. Okay.

01:01:49.445 --> 01:01:51.205
<v Speaker 0>Think you have a pretty broken cluster right

01:01:51.205 --> 01:01:51.685
<v Speaker 0>now.

01:01:52.405 --> 01:01:53.045
<v Speaker 2>Yep.

01:01:54.805 --> 01:01:56.244
<v Speaker 0>In fact, I think it's in worse shape

01:01:56.244 --> 01:01:58.405
<v Speaker 0>than it was when you started.

01:02:00.805 --> 01:02:01.525
<v Speaker 2>Oh, yeah.

01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:07.820
<v Speaker 1>But you can you can unalias. You can

01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:09.340
<v Speaker 1>re alias kube control.

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:12.780
<v Speaker 2>Is it unalias?

01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:14.300
<v Speaker 1>I I will just say I will just

01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:17.165
<v Speaker 1>alias kube control back to slash bin slash

01:02:17.165 --> 01:02:19.484
<v Speaker 1>kubectl, then it will work properly. I'm alias.

01:02:19.484 --> 01:02:21.005
<v Speaker 0>Sorry. Need to give you a just to

01:02:21.005 --> 01:02:22.365
<v Speaker 1>give you a hint because we're kinda

01:02:23.405 --> 01:02:24.365
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. There you go.

01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:32.310
<v Speaker 2>Meow.

01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:34.390
<v Speaker 2>Really, it's a cat meow.

01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:36.230
<v Speaker 0>Thanks.

01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:41.750
<v Speaker 0>I like that one. That was nice.

01:02:50.805 --> 01:02:52.965
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I mean, we don't need the emissary,

01:02:52.965 --> 01:02:54.849
<v Speaker 0>so I'm not terribly fast for that. So

01:02:54.849 --> 01:02:57.410
<v Speaker 0>you definitely use cube control lease.

01:02:58.210 --> 01:03:00.690
<v Speaker 2>Cube node leases. We've we've made we should

01:03:00.690 --> 01:03:02.130
<v Speaker 0>be alright with that. As

01:03:02.770 --> 01:03:04.050
<v Speaker 2>long as you don't need to

01:03:05.250 --> 01:03:07.585
<v Speaker 2>get a new one. Alright. Just

01:03:16.065 --> 01:03:17.345
<v Speaker 2>gonna check the event.

01:03:17.505 --> 01:03:20.225
<v Speaker 0>We have lost the worker node as well.

01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:26.500
<v Speaker 0>You wanna open a session on the worker?

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:26.980
<v Speaker 0>Or Yeah.

01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:28.900
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:31.140
<v Speaker 0>You don't have to fix the worker. I'm

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:32.260
<v Speaker 0>just throwing it out there.

01:03:35.535 --> 01:03:37.295
<v Speaker 2>Has he done the same on this one?

01:03:37.375 --> 01:03:38.095
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

01:03:39.535 --> 01:03:41.135
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. You can just schedule on a control

01:03:41.135 --> 01:03:41.855
<v Speaker 0>plan if you want.

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:49.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm still on the same frame. It's just

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.280
<v Speaker 2>so fun.

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:52.960
<v Speaker 2>I will leave that.

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:57.040
<v Speaker 2>If I just remove the no schedule on

01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.720
<v Speaker 1>the control on the

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:01.200
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Control plane, does that do it? It

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:01.680
<v Speaker 0>doesn't do.

01:04:04.345 --> 01:04:05.704
<v Speaker 2>So edit node.

01:04:05.785 --> 01:04:06.425
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

01:04:09.625 --> 01:04:10.265
<v Speaker 0>No.

01:04:10.664 --> 01:04:11.625
<v Speaker 0>Shit.

01:04:12.585 --> 01:04:13.464
<v Speaker 0>Capital

01:04:13.464 --> 01:04:16.310
<v Speaker 0>n, capital f on the node schedule.

01:04:22.070 --> 01:04:24.230
<v Speaker 2>Just get rid of them. Yeah. Yep.

01:04:31.964 --> 01:04:33.805
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. They ate the wrong node.

01:04:43.885 --> 01:04:45.005
<v Speaker 0>Delete one of your nodes.

01:04:46.690 --> 01:04:47.570
<v Speaker 0>You

01:04:47.570 --> 01:04:49.810
<v Speaker 0>have node nodes. You can either use node

01:04:49.810 --> 01:04:51.890
<v Speaker 0>space or or slash, but you can't use.

01:04:52.050 --> 01:04:53.650
<v Speaker 0>Node nodes. Node nodes.

01:05:01.115 --> 01:05:01.675
<v Speaker 0>Alrighty.

01:05:16.130 --> 01:05:17.250
<v Speaker 0>That was aggressive.

01:05:19.329 --> 01:05:21.250
<v Speaker 2>I wanna move him off that note. So

01:05:22.450 --> 01:05:23.890
<v Speaker 0>I mean, a card that would have been

01:05:23.890 --> 01:05:25.329
<v Speaker 0>fine, but, I mean, that's Yeah.

01:05:29.654 --> 01:05:31.174
<v Speaker 0>You can control c that. You don't need

01:05:31.174 --> 01:05:33.095
<v Speaker 0>to wait for the second half of all

01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:33.974
<v Speaker 0>that crap.

01:05:38.694 --> 01:05:41.270
<v Speaker 0>Cluster is not scheduled. Add a add a

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:43.510
<v Speaker 0>dash of white just to confirm where where.

01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:44.790
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:48.550
<v Speaker 0>Control point. There we go. Yeah. And because

01:05:48.550 --> 01:05:50.710
<v Speaker 0>the postgres is a stateful set, might wanna

01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:52.790
<v Speaker 0>delete whatever force and just

01:05:53.270 --> 01:05:54.869
<v Speaker 0>because in fact, people start running, it will

01:05:54.869 --> 01:05:55.910
<v Speaker 0>never do a status check.

01:05:58.335 --> 01:05:59.695
<v Speaker 0>I dashed the I

01:06:08.735 --> 01:06:10.495
<v Speaker 0>don't think you need the grace period anymore,

01:06:10.495 --> 01:06:10.575
<v Speaker 0>but

01:06:11.319 --> 01:06:13.160
<v Speaker 2>No. I don't think so. Conditioned.

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:13.480
<v Speaker 0>So

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:15.480
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:19.400
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.119
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So that that kubelet is not healthy,

01:06:22.119 --> 01:06:24.415
<v Speaker 0>which is why we've got stuck in terminating.

01:06:24.815 --> 01:06:27.055
<v Speaker 0>Because the would never check-in to see it.

01:06:27.055 --> 01:06:28.495
<v Speaker 0>It's actually gone. Yeah.

01:06:37.454 --> 01:06:38.494
<v Speaker 2>It's healthy, funny.

01:06:40.030 --> 01:06:41.710
<v Speaker 1>WD Fortnite chair.

01:06:42.109 --> 01:06:44.270
<v Speaker 2>I know. Can't stand the one.

01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:47.070
<v Speaker 2>It is very old.

01:06:49.390 --> 01:06:50.510
<v Speaker 2>The canine's.

01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:51.390
<v Speaker 1>That's

01:06:51.390 --> 01:06:52.750
<v Speaker 1>why he's got the loud keyboard, so you

01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:54.384
<v Speaker 0>can't hear the chair. You can't hear the

01:06:54.384 --> 01:06:54.945
<v Speaker 1>chair.

01:06:57.424 --> 01:06:59.744
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't have any logs. It has no logs.

01:07:01.025 --> 01:07:02.305
<v Speaker 0>Is it running v one or v two?

01:07:02.305 --> 01:07:03.665
<v Speaker 0>Did you update the v one?

01:07:04.785 --> 01:07:06.464
<v Speaker 2>I did update it. It's still v one.

01:07:06.625 --> 01:07:07.105
<v Speaker 2>Not changed.

01:07:10.890 --> 01:07:13.610
<v Speaker 2>Okay. It's not to create a replica set.

01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:18.570
<v Speaker 2>Just check I changed that. No. Oh. Something.

01:07:20.025 --> 01:07:21.785
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I didn't think I changed it.

01:07:22.505 --> 01:07:24.025
<v Speaker 2>I forgot. Maybe I did.

01:07:24.904 --> 01:07:26.424
<v Speaker 2>Did I edit the pod? I did the

01:07:26.424 --> 01:07:27.545
<v Speaker 2>pod. That's why.

01:07:28.025 --> 01:07:30.665
<v Speaker 0>Pod specs are immutable except for the image.

01:07:30.825 --> 01:07:31.145
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

01:07:33.810 --> 01:07:36.370
<v Speaker 0>I guess, every bit almost is the point.

01:07:38.370 --> 01:07:40.690
<v Speaker 2>Mean, that is v two.

01:07:41.890 --> 01:07:42.610
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:07:43.570 --> 01:07:45.250
<v Speaker 0>So that is done? What was it?

01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:47.490
<v Speaker 2>Three

01:07:49.045 --> 01:07:49.525
<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

01:07:51.365 --> 01:07:52.245
<v Speaker 2>No.

01:07:53.045 --> 01:07:53.445
<v Speaker 2>Of course.

01:07:57.045 --> 01:07:58.805
<v Speaker 0>So you're getting headers. That's Yep.

01:08:00.165 --> 01:08:00.565
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:08:02.070 --> 01:08:02.790
<v Speaker 2>So

01:08:03.350 --> 01:08:05.990
<v Speaker 2>network oh, just put Postgres is running. Yeah.

01:08:07.030 --> 01:08:08.790
<v Speaker 2>May not have initialized, actually.

01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:14.390
<v Speaker 2>Okay. Yeah. It has.

01:08:16.114 --> 01:08:18.755
<v Speaker 0>Run get pod service endpoint.

01:08:19.154 --> 01:08:20.354
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I don't know why people

01:08:20.354 --> 01:08:21.955
<v Speaker 0>don't run that more. I don't know why

01:08:22.114 --> 01:08:24.274
<v Speaker 0>I don't get the AI inside.

01:08:24.675 --> 01:08:26.594
<v Speaker 0>I just You don't like it? No.

01:08:29.890 --> 01:08:31.329
<v Speaker 0>I hate too much. I

01:08:32.370 --> 01:08:33.649
<v Speaker 1>don't think this is something that I've done.

01:08:33.649 --> 01:08:34.689
<v Speaker 1>This is exciting.

01:08:37.810 --> 01:08:39.729
<v Speaker 0>I think you just nervous.

01:08:40.210 --> 01:08:42.385
<v Speaker 0>Well, actually, there's there's a weird thing that

01:08:42.385 --> 01:08:43.905
<v Speaker 0>I've never really gotten to the bottom of

01:08:43.905 --> 01:08:45.425
<v Speaker 0>where the node ports don't work on the

01:08:45.425 --> 01:08:46.865
<v Speaker 0>control plane sometimes,

01:08:46.865 --> 01:08:47.825
<v Speaker 0>and you have to do it on the

01:08:47.825 --> 01:08:50.864
<v Speaker 0>worker node. But here, it should definitely work.

01:08:51.265 --> 01:08:51.985
<v Speaker 0>We'll try again.

01:08:54.109 --> 01:08:55.469
<v Speaker 2>Well Yeah.

01:09:04.030 --> 01:09:04.750
<v Speaker 1>I

01:09:05.310 --> 01:09:07.069
<v Speaker 1>know it's it's simple to know to do

01:09:07.069 --> 01:09:07.950
<v Speaker 1>do all that stuff.

01:09:11.694 --> 01:09:13.934
<v Speaker 2>Well, I'll just check these as well.

01:09:14.335 --> 01:09:14.894
<v Speaker 2>No.

01:09:17.135 --> 01:09:18.814
<v Speaker 2>You press not policies.

01:09:19.534 --> 01:09:20.734
<v Speaker 2>Endpoints.

01:09:21.135 --> 01:09:23.000
<v Speaker 2>What was the other one? Let's see the

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.680
<v Speaker 2>network policy now.

01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:26.040
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:28.200
<v Speaker 2>So

01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:29.399
<v Speaker 2>we're good.

01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:32.359
<v Speaker 2>Control c.

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:37.524
<v Speaker 2>Okay. So pod's running. Postgres is running, but

01:09:37.524 --> 01:09:38.484
<v Speaker 2>networking

01:09:39.045 --> 01:09:40.165
<v Speaker 0>IP table?

01:09:40.965 --> 01:09:41.764
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:09:48.005 --> 01:09:48.885
<v Speaker 0>No

01:09:48.885 --> 01:09:50.325
<v Speaker 0>rejections. I don't see anything.

01:10:05.385 --> 01:10:07.144
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know what I'm looking at.

01:10:07.144 --> 01:10:08.104
<v Speaker 2>Some firewall

01:10:09.545 --> 01:10:10.344
<v Speaker 2>pulls.

01:10:11.304 --> 01:10:12.664
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Sorry.

01:10:13.304 --> 01:10:15.144
<v Speaker 1>That will keeps Kubernetes running.

01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:22.580
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:24.100
<v Speaker 0>That looks suspicious.

01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:26.179
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:29.460
<v Speaker 0>You see the drops?

01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:30.580
<v Speaker 2>The

01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:32.340
<v Speaker 2>bottom. Yeah.

01:10:39.224 --> 01:10:41.624
<v Speaker 2>We're blocking He's commented them for us.

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:43.864
<v Speaker 2>So kind.

01:10:45.385 --> 01:10:47.545
<v Speaker 2>Drop all anywhere anywhere.

01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:51.790
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's dropping it's dropping all packets where

01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:53.870
<v Speaker 0>the source haven't been marked. As as local

01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:54.830
<v Speaker 0>host. Yeah.

01:10:56.830 --> 01:10:59.150
<v Speaker 0>I think. Sometimes I read these wrong, but

01:10:59.150 --> 01:11:01.525
<v Speaker 0>I I would flush them out. Just go

01:11:01.525 --> 01:11:02.085
<v Speaker 0>there.

01:11:04.405 --> 01:11:07.205
<v Speaker 2>What is it? Dash dot capital f.

01:11:08.725 --> 01:11:10.804
<v Speaker 0>And then run dash l again just to

01:11:15.685 --> 01:11:16.479
<v Speaker 1>yeah. That's a.

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:21.119
<v Speaker 0>Nice. Well done.

01:11:22.719 --> 01:11:23.440
<v Speaker 0>That

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:26.159
<v Speaker 0>was pretty mean.

01:11:27.425 --> 01:11:29.185
<v Speaker 2>I've gotta see what the tweet is.

01:11:29.825 --> 01:11:30.784
<v Speaker 0>What's the tweet?

01:11:34.305 --> 01:11:36.385
<v Speaker 2>Productivity does not determine your value. You have

01:11:36.385 --> 01:11:37.345
<v Speaker 2>value in just being you.

01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:41.140
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I mean, we don't fill up the

01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:42.980
<v Speaker 0>website much anymore because we just rely on

01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:43.699
<v Speaker 0>curls.

01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:45.620
<v Speaker 0>You know what I mean? The downside is

01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:47.460
<v Speaker 0>people don't get to see me back. But

01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:51.780
<v Speaker 0>yeah. Those are those are pretty harsh breaks,

01:11:52.275 --> 01:11:55.074
<v Speaker 0>I think. The traffic control one was particularly

01:11:55.795 --> 01:11:57.395
<v Speaker 0>mean. Like, I don't think we'd ever have

01:11:57.395 --> 01:11:59.235
<v Speaker 0>got that. Like, if you had I had

01:11:59.235 --> 01:12:00.994
<v Speaker 2>just slipped with it. Yeah.

01:12:01.795 --> 01:12:02.435
<v Speaker 1>But We

01:12:03.554 --> 01:12:05.554
<v Speaker 1>as we said, I I I scaled it

01:12:05.554 --> 01:12:07.395
<v Speaker 1>back because it you know, as you said

01:12:07.150 --> 01:12:09.070
<v Speaker 1>before, like, sometimes you don't know what a

01:12:09.070 --> 01:12:10.510
<v Speaker 1>good level is to do. Like, it was

01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:12.350
<v Speaker 1>actually doing a seg fault every five minutes,

01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:14.430
<v Speaker 1>and that just felt, like, really mean. So

01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:15.630
<v Speaker 1>we're not doing that anymore.

01:12:19.455 --> 01:12:21.455
<v Speaker 0>I mean, it's tough. Right? Because he he

01:12:21.455 --> 01:12:23.775
<v Speaker 0>never it's hard to understand the experience the

01:12:23.775 --> 01:12:26.255
<v Speaker 0>other person brings like there are you could

01:12:26.255 --> 01:12:28.495
<v Speaker 0>do two breaks and someone never finds them.

01:12:28.495 --> 01:12:29.935
<v Speaker 0>But if you get the right person that

01:12:29.935 --> 01:12:31.375
<v Speaker 0>knows what they're looking for, then you need

01:12:31.375 --> 01:12:33.930
<v Speaker 0>20 breaks. Like it's just it's a complete

01:12:33.930 --> 01:12:35.690
<v Speaker 0>game of cat and mouse and as again,

01:12:35.690 --> 01:12:37.450
<v Speaker 0>it's not about the fixing and it's not

01:12:37.450 --> 01:12:39.290
<v Speaker 0>about how quickly you do it or how

01:12:39.290 --> 01:12:40.890
<v Speaker 0>sneaky you are with the breaks. It's just

01:12:40.890 --> 01:12:43.770
<v Speaker 0>about getting two smart people who know what

01:12:43.770 --> 01:12:45.610
<v Speaker 0>they're doing and seeing how they handle and

01:12:45.610 --> 01:12:48.015
<v Speaker 0>debug a situation. I think, to me, that's

01:12:48.015 --> 01:12:49.855
<v Speaker 0>always the most valuable thing about what we're

01:12:49.855 --> 01:12:51.775
<v Speaker 0>doing here. And I

01:12:52.495 --> 01:12:53.055
<v Speaker 1>really liked

01:12:53.855 --> 01:12:55.935
<v Speaker 1>you know, we both approached the the the

01:12:55.935 --> 01:12:58.175
<v Speaker 1>breaks at different layers, which was quite cool.

01:12:58.175 --> 01:12:59.135
<v Speaker 1>You know, you were doing them more in

01:12:59.135 --> 01:13:01.020
<v Speaker 1>the kind of case and config, and I

01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:02.300
<v Speaker 1>was just using some more of the Linux

01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:04.460
<v Speaker 1>capabilities. I think it's quite a nice overlap

01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:05.500
<v Speaker 1>to to explore.

01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:09.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I I pretty much never run Kubernetes

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:12.220
<v Speaker 2>in production. Actually, the control plane because I've

01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:14.060
<v Speaker 2>always used managed. So for me, it was

01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:15.660
<v Speaker 2>like, I'm just gonna break it in, like,

01:13:16.125 --> 01:13:18.445
<v Speaker 2>user space almost as much as I can

01:13:18.445 --> 01:13:20.524
<v Speaker 2>and things that I actually have control over.

01:13:22.045 --> 01:13:23.565
<v Speaker 0>I mean, saying that, you have disabled the

01:13:23.565 --> 01:13:24.844
<v Speaker 0>replica set controller.

01:13:25.804 --> 01:13:27.324
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Okay. That one's just

01:13:27.930 --> 01:13:30.570
<v Speaker 2>because I hate the. I always fail to

01:13:30.570 --> 01:13:32.970
<v Speaker 2>look there. And I'm like, nothing's happening. And

01:13:32.970 --> 01:13:35.290
<v Speaker 2>it's usually an admission, a validate workbook or

01:13:35.290 --> 01:13:37.930
<v Speaker 2>a mutate workbook fail or something. And it

01:13:37.930 --> 01:13:40.010
<v Speaker 2>just, like, stops in that layer and disappears.

01:13:40.010 --> 01:13:40.410
<v Speaker 2>Nobody

01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:43.445
<v Speaker 0>ever looks in that file or at the

01:13:43.445 --> 01:13:45.845
<v Speaker 0>controls. I don't think most people know that

01:13:45.845 --> 01:13:47.925
<v Speaker 0>you can disable individual controls with a controller

01:13:47.925 --> 01:13:50.245
<v Speaker 0>manager. I think it's always me that kinda

01:13:50.245 --> 01:13:51.845
<v Speaker 0>really points that one out. And, it's just

01:13:51.845 --> 01:13:54.165
<v Speaker 0>because I've seen stuff on cluster.

01:13:54.245 --> 01:13:55.925
<v Speaker 0>We've we've seen a lot of these things.

01:13:55.925 --> 01:13:58.490
<v Speaker 0>The other one, which I I felt hilarious.

01:13:58.490 --> 01:13:59.850
<v Speaker 0>I can't remember when it was, but maybe

01:13:59.850 --> 01:14:01.770
<v Speaker 0>about a year ago. Someone just set the

01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:03.210
<v Speaker 0>deployment to pause and

01:14:03.930 --> 01:14:06.170
<v Speaker 0>it just doesn't roll out any new pods.

01:14:06.170 --> 01:14:08.250
<v Speaker 0>But if you don't know that that's there,

01:14:08.490 --> 01:14:11.195
<v Speaker 0>you just you never find it. It's just

01:14:11.114 --> 01:14:12.954
<v Speaker 2>it's just the Nothing in the logs. Why

01:14:12.954 --> 01:14:15.034
<v Speaker 0>it's strange to do this? Yeah. Yeah. It's

01:14:15.034 --> 01:14:16.875
<v Speaker 0>it's like, oh, you can pause the deployment

01:14:16.875 --> 01:14:18.474
<v Speaker 0>and then you have to explain again what's

01:14:18.474 --> 01:14:20.315
<v Speaker 0>actually this whole rule out command and you

01:14:20.315 --> 01:14:21.675
<v Speaker 0>can finish this stuff.

01:14:22.074 --> 01:14:23.994
<v Speaker 0>It's just there's so many different parts of

01:14:23.994 --> 01:14:27.550
<v Speaker 0>the Kubernetes API. Nobody could very unlikely nobody

01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:29.550
<v Speaker 0>could know them all. And again, it's just

01:14:29.550 --> 01:14:31.310
<v Speaker 0>to get people with different backgrounds as you

01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:31.790
<v Speaker 0>know.

01:14:32.350 --> 01:14:34.110
<v Speaker 0>This was awesome. Thank you both for for

01:14:34.110 --> 01:14:35.870
<v Speaker 0>taking time. I know this could be quite

01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:37.790
<v Speaker 0>stressful, so I really appreciate you both breaking

01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:40.590
<v Speaker 0>clusters and fixing them live on the stream.

01:14:41.284 --> 01:14:42.885
<v Speaker 1>Oh, thank you for having me.

01:14:43.925 --> 01:14:45.925
<v Speaker 0>Any last words before we we say goodbye

01:14:45.925 --> 01:14:47.364
<v Speaker 0>to our audience for today?

01:14:49.045 --> 01:14:50.565
<v Speaker 1>I think just to say that this is

01:14:50.565 --> 01:14:52.565
<v Speaker 1>awesome. We've I've certainly enjoyed it. I I

01:14:52.565 --> 01:14:54.804
<v Speaker 1>I I think as well. It was very

01:14:54.804 --> 01:14:55.284
<v Speaker 1>educational.

01:14:56.090 --> 01:14:57.690
<v Speaker 1>I think I learned a lot as well,

01:14:57.690 --> 01:14:59.369
<v Speaker 1>and, you know, it's great to have you

01:14:59.369 --> 01:15:01.050
<v Speaker 1>as the host, David. So thank you, and

01:15:01.050 --> 01:15:02.250
<v Speaker 1>please keep doing it because I know I'll

01:15:02.250 --> 01:15:02.889
<v Speaker 1>be watching.

01:15:04.409 --> 01:15:06.170
<v Speaker 0>Thank you very much. Yeah. Shout out to

01:15:06.170 --> 01:15:08.010
<v Speaker 2>everyone watching. Get involved if you can.

01:15:09.035 --> 01:15:10.635
<v Speaker 2>Reach out to David, I guess.

01:15:11.035 --> 01:15:13.355
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Are you planning to carry on these?

01:15:13.355 --> 01:15:15.195
<v Speaker 2>I know at one point you were struggling

01:15:15.195 --> 01:15:16.715
<v Speaker 2>to find people to come on. It's hard

01:15:16.715 --> 01:15:19.114
<v Speaker 0>to find victims. I mean, contestants.

01:15:19.115 --> 01:15:19.675
<v Speaker 0>So

01:15:20.235 --> 01:15:22.680
<v Speaker 2>It it was less bad than I thought.

01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:24.600
<v Speaker 2>I'll just leave that with everyone. Well, this

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:26.360
<v Speaker 0>is the thing. Right? It's like there.

01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:28.600
<v Speaker 0>I I know both of you. I know

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:30.840
<v Speaker 0>you're both incredibly smart. You're both very,

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:32.199
<v Speaker 0>very aware with Kubernetes,

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.845
<v Speaker 0>but it's intimidating.

01:15:34.845 --> 01:15:36.285
<v Speaker 0>Right? You have to be very vulnerable to

01:15:36.285 --> 01:15:37.965
<v Speaker 0>set on a livestream and do something like

01:15:37.965 --> 01:15:39.085
<v Speaker 0>this. And it's like,

01:15:39.565 --> 01:15:41.805
<v Speaker 0>you know, so it's difficult to find people

01:15:41.805 --> 01:15:43.565
<v Speaker 0>that are willing to make themselves that vulnerable

01:15:43.565 --> 01:15:45.005
<v Speaker 0>and and do this. And I would love

01:15:45.005 --> 01:15:46.205
<v Speaker 0>to be able to encourage more people to

01:15:46.205 --> 01:15:47.245
<v Speaker 0>do it, but I don't want people to

01:15:47.245 --> 01:15:49.510
<v Speaker 0>be uncomfortable either. So it's like, you know,

01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:51.270
<v Speaker 0>I'll I will continue to do a cluster

01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:52.710
<v Speaker 0>for as long as I can convince you

01:15:52.710 --> 01:15:54.469
<v Speaker 0>two and others to come on and join

01:15:54.469 --> 01:15:56.469
<v Speaker 0>me into it. And, you know, when I

01:15:56.469 --> 01:15:58.150
<v Speaker 0>can, I'm happy to be the one that

01:15:58.150 --> 01:15:59.989
<v Speaker 0>looks silly. So, you know, if you just

01:15:59.989 --> 01:16:02.389
<v Speaker 0>wanna break a cluster and watch me laugh

01:16:02.115 --> 01:16:03.715
<v Speaker 0>and laugh at me try to fix it,

01:16:03.715 --> 01:16:05.075
<v Speaker 0>I'm I'm happy to do that too. Let's

01:16:05.075 --> 01:16:06.675
<v Speaker 0>let's we'll do that all day. Anyway,

01:16:07.635 --> 01:16:10.355
<v Speaker 0>thank you both again. Absolute pleasure too. Very

01:16:10.355 --> 01:16:12.755
<v Speaker 0>sneaky breaks, and best of luck for that.

01:16:12.755 --> 01:16:14.115
<v Speaker 0>Well done for fixing them, and I'll see

01:16:14.115 --> 01:16:16.195
<v Speaker 0>you both again next time. Thank you. Thank

01:16:16.195 --> 01:16:16.835
<v Speaker 1>you. Bye bye.
