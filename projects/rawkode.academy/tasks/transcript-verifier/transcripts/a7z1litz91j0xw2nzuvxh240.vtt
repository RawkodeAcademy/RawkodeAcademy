00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:51.115
<v Speaker 0>Hello,

00:01:51.195 --> 00:01:52.155
<v Speaker 0>and welcome

00:01:52.155 --> 00:01:54.634
<v Speaker 0>to today's episode of Clustered.

00:01:55.755 --> 00:01:57.835
<v Speaker 0>Today's a bit different than normal.

00:01:58.395 --> 00:01:59.594
<v Speaker 0>Today is

00:01:59.914 --> 00:02:02.875
<v Speaker 0>Clustered versus Rawkode versus the community.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.690
<v Speaker 0>Not really sure how it's gonna work,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.170
<v Speaker 0>but let me share some stuff with you.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:09.530

<v Speaker 0>episodes

00:02:21.665 --> 00:02:25.185
<v Speaker 0>where I explore cloud native products and technologies

00:02:25.185 --> 00:02:27.504
<v Speaker 0>with their founders and make this all a

00:02:27.504 --> 00:02:29.025
<v Speaker 0>little bit easier for us all.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.180
<v Speaker 0>There's also a Discord server available at Rawkode.chat.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.940
<v Speaker 0>There's nearly 500 of us on there now

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.180
<v Speaker 0>talking all things cloud native Kubernetes

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.100
<v Speaker 0>and everything in between.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.980
<v Speaker 0>I started doing something a little bit different

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.460
<v Speaker 0>lately, and I'm giving away a lot of

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.020
<v Speaker 0>swag.

00:02:46.005 --> 00:02:47.845
<v Speaker 0>Some people have asked, what if I just

00:02:47.845 --> 00:02:49.605
<v Speaker 0>wanna buy a t shirt and support it?

00:02:49.605 --> 00:02:50.965
<v Speaker 0>So I have included

00:02:51.685 --> 00:02:53.685
<v Speaker 0>the link there. So please feel free to

00:02:53.685 --> 00:02:55.365
<v Speaker 0>check out store.rawco.com.

00:02:55.685 --> 00:02:58.005
<v Speaker 0>But also, I will be giving away lots

00:02:58.005 --> 00:03:00.005
<v Speaker 0>of swag over the next weeks and months.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.590
<v Speaker 0>So stay tuned, enjoy the episodes,

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.350
<v Speaker 0>and I hope you get to win something.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.790
<v Speaker 0>There's a couple of little links on this

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:08.990
<v Speaker 0>site there.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.710
<v Speaker 0>So

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.790
<v Speaker 0>custard.live

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 0>is a thing that I threw together

00:03:14.755 --> 00:03:16.595
<v Speaker 0>literally in the last couple of days to

00:03:16.595 --> 00:03:19.075
<v Speaker 0>try and make our streams more interactive and

00:03:19.075 --> 00:03:20.915
<v Speaker 0>more engaging and give you an opportunity to

00:03:20.915 --> 00:03:21.475
<v Speaker 0>win.

00:03:22.195 --> 00:03:23.555
<v Speaker 0>It was painful

00:03:23.555 --> 00:03:25.875
<v Speaker 0>fighting with the Twitter API,

00:03:26.435 --> 00:03:28.680
<v Speaker 0>but we do have something that works, and

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.280
<v Speaker 0>I'll walk you through that in just a

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.840
<v Speaker 0>moment.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.800
<v Speaker 0>Today's episode is

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.200
<v Speaker 0>Versys episode with myself.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.640
<v Speaker 0>So we have a cluster broken by some

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.200
<v Speaker 0>regulars.

00:03:40.815 --> 00:03:42.495
<v Speaker 0>You may know no

00:03:42.495 --> 00:03:43.855
<v Speaker 0>or fresbo and

00:03:44.175 --> 00:03:45.455
<v Speaker 0>Russell w.

00:03:46.015 --> 00:03:47.935
<v Speaker 0>I had a third cluster, which I asked

00:03:47.935 --> 00:03:50.735
<v Speaker 0>someone to break, but unfortunately, due to constraints,

00:03:50.735 --> 00:03:51.775
<v Speaker 0>time, and,

00:03:52.415 --> 00:03:53.055
<v Speaker 0>well,

00:03:53.215 --> 00:03:54.015
<v Speaker 0>life,

00:03:54.495 --> 00:03:56.110
<v Speaker 0>it wasn't able to be broken in time

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.630
<v Speaker 0>for today's episode. So you'll also notice here,

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.069
<v Speaker 0>there is a Rawkode.live/destroy-

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.710
<v Speaker 0>it.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.430
<v Speaker 0>This is a public

00:04:06.635 --> 00:04:07.915
<v Speaker 0>KubeConfig

00:04:08.075 --> 00:04:09.915
<v Speaker 0>to a Kubernetes cluster

00:04:09.995 --> 00:04:11.835
<v Speaker 0>running on Equinix metal.

00:04:12.954 --> 00:04:14.555
<v Speaker 0>My challenge to you lot

00:04:14.954 --> 00:04:16.394
<v Speaker 0>is go fuck with it.

00:04:17.115 --> 00:04:19.355
<v Speaker 0>I will be using

00:04:19.595 --> 00:04:22.395
<v Speaker 0>well, I will be blocking access to it

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:22.750
<v Speaker 0>very soon.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.430
<v Speaker 0>But for the next thirty minutes, feel free

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.270
<v Speaker 0>to try and break it as you wish.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.110
<v Speaker 0>I also want to thank Teleport for sponsoring,

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.350
<v Speaker 0>sponsoring custard.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.190
<v Speaker 0>You know, I've been using Teleport since the

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.350
<v Speaker 0>first episode. I think it's an absolutely fantastic

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.635
<v Speaker 0>product. It's just wonderful that I get to

00:04:38.635 --> 00:04:40.155
<v Speaker 0>use it on the stream every week and

00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:41.435
<v Speaker 0>get to show you all how cool it

00:04:41.435 --> 00:04:43.595
<v Speaker 0>is. So you should go check it out.

00:04:43.835 --> 00:04:45.755
<v Speaker 0>They support the show. They're providing the swag.

00:04:45.755 --> 00:04:47.035
<v Speaker 0>They're the ones that are making all of

00:04:47.035 --> 00:04:49.275
<v Speaker 0>this, all of these giveaways possible. So thank

00:04:49.275 --> 00:04:50.075
<v Speaker 0>you to Teleport.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.150
<v Speaker 0>To support the show, go to raw Rawkode

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:55.990
<v Speaker 0>Live / Teleport.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.590
<v Speaker 0>It is a UTM link, but it just

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.790
<v Speaker 0>means that they have a little bit of

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.030
<v Speaker 0>feedback that shows, you know, supporting

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.389
<v Speaker 0>this channel works for them.

00:05:03.655 --> 00:05:04.935
<v Speaker 0>That's quite a lot of talk for the

00:05:04.935 --> 00:05:07.255
<v Speaker 0>start of this episode. I'm also very nervous

00:05:07.255 --> 00:05:09.335
<v Speaker 0>about this episode because I'm fixing things alone,

00:05:09.335 --> 00:05:11.175
<v Speaker 0>so I do have a beer.

00:05:14.055 --> 00:05:15.895
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's take a look at today.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.860
<v Speaker 0>This is clustered.live.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.980
<v Speaker 0>Let me remove our sponsor message for the

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:24.860
<v Speaker 0>time being,

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.980
<v Speaker 0>where we can click

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.300
<v Speaker 0>saying I'm with Twitter.

00:05:32.335 --> 00:05:33.855
<v Speaker 0>Now there have been a few people that

00:05:33.855 --> 00:05:35.855
<v Speaker 0>have mentioned that the permissions

00:05:36.175 --> 00:05:38.255
<v Speaker 0>to access this application

00:05:39.615 --> 00:05:40.895
<v Speaker 0>are a little

00:05:41.055 --> 00:05:43.775
<v Speaker 0>permissive, but unfortunately, the Twitter API only really

00:05:43.775 --> 00:05:46.430
<v Speaker 0>exposes read or read write. There is nothing

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.430
<v Speaker 0>in between. So I'm really sorry about that,

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:49.390
<v Speaker 0>but it is the best that we can

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.870
<v Speaker 0>do.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.350
<v Speaker 0>I also ask for those permissions because when

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.710
<v Speaker 0>you enter the competition,

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:54.430
<v Speaker 0>it will

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 0>follow my account, follow the Teleport account, and

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.395
<v Speaker 0>repeat retweet the tweet. Now I don't see

00:06:00.395 --> 00:06:01.995
<v Speaker 0>it here because I've already entered,

00:06:02.155 --> 00:06:03.915
<v Speaker 0>but there is lots of warning messages. I'm

00:06:03.915 --> 00:06:05.595
<v Speaker 0>not doing this without your permission.

00:06:05.915 --> 00:06:07.835
<v Speaker 0>I hope you understand that. It's really just

00:06:07.835 --> 00:06:10.315
<v Speaker 0>a workaround the Twitter API and the fact

00:06:10.315 --> 00:06:11.515
<v Speaker 0>that I can't check,

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:15.000
<v Speaker 0>painfully cannot check if you follow an account

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.759
<v Speaker 0>or if you have re tweeted a tweet.

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:19.240
<v Speaker 0>I cannot stress it enough. This is not

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.439
<v Speaker 0>the way that I wanted this to go,

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:22.120
<v Speaker 0>but it's the best that I could come

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.360
<v Speaker 0>up with at least in this amount of

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.800
<v Speaker 0>time. So I'm gonna try and make this

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.385
<v Speaker 0>better, but if you do want to win

00:06:27.385 --> 00:06:29.945
<v Speaker 0>some swag today, we have three Rawkode swag

00:06:29.945 --> 00:06:32.105
<v Speaker 0>packs, we have three Teleport swag packs, and

00:06:32.105 --> 00:06:35.145
<v Speaker 0>we have 10 copies of Siam Patak's

00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:37.225
<v Speaker 0>SKS training manual.

00:06:37.945 --> 00:06:40.505
<v Speaker 0>So enter the competition. Your odds are really,

00:06:40.505 --> 00:06:43.620
<v Speaker 0>really good of winning. Right? We've got ten,

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.340
<v Speaker 0>thirteen,

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:45.940
<v Speaker 0>six

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.980
<v Speaker 0>16 prizes, and we don't even have 16

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.460
<v Speaker 0>entries yet. So chances are click that button

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.740
<v Speaker 0>and you can win something today.

00:06:54.574 --> 00:06:56.655
<v Speaker 0>Rawkode.live/destroyit

00:06:56.655 --> 00:06:58.095
<v Speaker 0>will take you to this guest where there

00:06:58.095 --> 00:06:59.615
<v Speaker 0>is a KubeConfig.

00:06:59.695 --> 00:07:02.335
<v Speaker 0>Download it, attack the cluster. I'll be getting

00:07:02.335 --> 00:07:04.095
<v Speaker 0>to that in around thirty minutes time.

00:07:04.415 --> 00:07:06.175
<v Speaker 0>And also, I know the permissions on my

00:07:06.175 --> 00:07:07.375
<v Speaker 0>application are

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.340
<v Speaker 0>a bit wild. They allow me to upgrade

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.380
<v Speaker 0>your profile. They allowed me to delete your

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.820
<v Speaker 0>account, I think. There's a whole bunch of

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.180
<v Speaker 0>things. Again,

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.700
<v Speaker 0>not by choice, but the code for all

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.220
<v Speaker 0>of it is open source. You can find

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:23.260
<v Speaker 0>that at github.com/rockodeacademy/clustered.live.

00:07:25.155 --> 00:07:25.875
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:07:26.995 --> 00:07:27.875
<v Speaker 0>Today,

00:07:29.635 --> 00:07:31.635
<v Speaker 0>we are gonna fix some clusters.

00:07:32.275 --> 00:07:33.635
<v Speaker 0>So I have three here.

00:07:34.195 --> 00:07:36.770
<v Speaker 0>We're gonna start with Russell w's cluster. So

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.290
<v Speaker 0>thank you for taking the time out of

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.210
<v Speaker 0>your day to break this.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.210
<v Speaker 0>What I'm gonna do

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:43.330
<v Speaker 0>is

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:46.770
<v Speaker 0>start my timer.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:49.170
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

00:07:53.145 --> 00:07:54.825
<v Speaker 0>And zoom in.

00:07:56.905 --> 00:07:58.105
<v Speaker 0>Oh, hold on a minute. Why have I

00:07:58.105 --> 00:08:00.185
<v Speaker 0>given myself four or five minutes? Alright. We'll

00:08:00.185 --> 00:08:00.985
<v Speaker 0>do what I can.

00:08:01.865 --> 00:08:03.145
<v Speaker 0>I actually have much less than four to

00:08:03.145 --> 00:08:04.985
<v Speaker 0>five minutes per cluster because I have three.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.320
<v Speaker 0>So really, I've got, twenty minutes per cluster.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.800
<v Speaker 0>And I can't really keep up with the

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.160
<v Speaker 0>chat and all the talking,

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.640
<v Speaker 0>so I'll try and keep my eye out

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.640
<v Speaker 0>there. Who broke Teleport?

00:08:18.355 --> 00:08:19.555
<v Speaker 0>Come on, Kevin.

00:08:20.195 --> 00:08:21.955
<v Speaker 0>You're not allowed to break Teleport.

00:08:23.075 --> 00:08:25.075
<v Speaker 0>You're also telling me it's a Twitter page.

00:08:25.475 --> 00:08:26.835
<v Speaker 0>It's absolute shame.

00:08:27.555 --> 00:08:29.315
<v Speaker 0>Awful. Cannot stand it.

00:08:30.835 --> 00:08:31.635
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:08:31.955 --> 00:08:32.835
<v Speaker 0>Let's see what we've got.

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:35.860
<v Speaker 0>The reason I'm starting with Brussels because I

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.339
<v Speaker 0>did look at nulls and notice we don't

00:08:38.339 --> 00:08:39.779
<v Speaker 0>even have any worker nodes. I'm gonna come

00:08:39.779 --> 00:08:42.019
<v Speaker 0>back to that one. Instead, we'll start with

00:08:42.019 --> 00:08:42.659
<v Speaker 0>this one.

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:45.860
<v Speaker 0>We'll log on to the admin account

00:08:46.495 --> 00:08:49.214
<v Speaker 0>and I'll export my kube config.

00:08:53.615 --> 00:08:54.975
<v Speaker 0>Alias key

00:08:56.654 --> 00:08:57.855
<v Speaker 0>and I run get notes.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.610
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I have no control plan. Thank you,

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:02.329
<v Speaker 0>Russell.

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:04.170
<v Speaker 0>Need a bigger drink.

00:09:07.769 --> 00:09:09.209
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So what do we do when we

00:09:09.209 --> 00:09:10.009
<v Speaker 0>have no control plan?

00:09:11.695 --> 00:09:12.975
<v Speaker 0>First thing I'm gonna do

00:09:15.774 --> 00:09:17.375
<v Speaker 0>is check our kubelet.

00:09:18.175 --> 00:09:20.575
<v Speaker 0>I can see the service is loaded, but

00:09:20.575 --> 00:09:21.774
<v Speaker 0>it is stopped.

00:09:22.894 --> 00:09:25.055
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna try just starting that back up.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.400
<v Speaker 0>And while that starts, I'm gonna jump into

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.960
<v Speaker 0>our Kubernetes manifest. Thanks.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.280
<v Speaker 0>Thanks, Russell.

00:09:44.435 --> 00:09:46.035
<v Speaker 0>I hope you scripted that.

00:09:49.395 --> 00:09:50.995
<v Speaker 0>Have yourself for each break.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.640
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It may go that way now.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.520
<v Speaker 0>I don't have any static manifests.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.200
<v Speaker 0>They all appear

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.200
<v Speaker 0>to be the same number of baits.

00:10:10.685 --> 00:10:12.205
<v Speaker 0>Think they're all

00:10:13.805 --> 00:10:14.605
<v Speaker 0>alright. Okay.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.940
<v Speaker 0>They're not all the same number of bytes.

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:22.060
<v Speaker 0>The letters are the same number of bytes.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.300
<v Speaker 0>So I think

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:25.339
<v Speaker 0>a, b,

00:10:26.699 --> 00:10:27.420
<v Speaker 0>c,

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.540
<v Speaker 0>d, and e

00:10:29.834 --> 00:10:32.875
<v Speaker 0>are the fails I need and everything else

00:10:32.875 --> 00:10:34.154
<v Speaker 0>is noise.

00:10:35.115 --> 00:10:36.395
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:10:37.435 --> 00:10:38.955
<v Speaker 0>I am gonna move

00:10:39.755 --> 00:10:42.315
<v Speaker 0>a, b, c, d, e

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:43.755
<v Speaker 0>dot yaml

00:10:43.755 --> 00:10:44.635
<v Speaker 0>to temp

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:47.570
<v Speaker 0>run ls.

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:48.530
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:50.530
<v Speaker 0>And I don't trust,

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.250
<v Speaker 0>I don't need these. So we'll call this

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:54.370
<v Speaker 0>dumping ground.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:58.210
<v Speaker 0>Gonna move everything to our dumping ground.

00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:59.730
<v Speaker 0>We're gonna move everything back.

00:11:01.545 --> 00:11:02.505
<v Speaker 0>YAML

00:11:02.585 --> 00:11:03.305
<v Speaker 0>to here.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.240
<v Speaker 0>Where did that Selen come from?

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.280
<v Speaker 0>Good thing that's mine, I'm gonna push that

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:18.920
<v Speaker 0>back.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.120
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.160
<v Speaker 0>Now we have a, b, c, d, e,

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.320
<v Speaker 0>and e. Yaml. I'm actually not fussed about

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.760
<v Speaker 0>the names. I just wanna make sure I've

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.895
<v Speaker 0>got the right components. So in fact, we'll

00:11:28.895 --> 00:11:29.455
<v Speaker 0>just

00:11:29.855 --> 00:11:31.135
<v Speaker 0>star.yaml.

00:11:31.455 --> 00:11:33.375
<v Speaker 0>So we've got our API server,

00:11:33.774 --> 00:11:34.815
<v Speaker 0>etcd

00:11:34.975 --> 00:11:37.135
<v Speaker 0>controller manager, scheduler,

00:11:37.135 --> 00:11:38.095
<v Speaker 0>kubect.

00:11:38.575 --> 00:11:38.975
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:11:41.779 --> 00:11:42.579
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully

00:11:43.139 --> 00:11:45.860
<v Speaker 0>that gets me a control plane online.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.060
<v Speaker 0>I guess what we want to see now

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:50.420
<v Speaker 0>is do we have

00:11:50.819 --> 00:11:52.339
<v Speaker 0>an API server?

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:54.980
<v Speaker 0>Do we have a controller?

00:11:56.445 --> 00:11:59.085
<v Speaker 0>Not quite. Do we have an actual working

00:11:59.085 --> 00:12:00.205
<v Speaker 0>kubelet yet?

00:12:02.765 --> 00:12:05.725
<v Speaker 0>No. Okay. So our kubelet is broken.

00:12:06.525 --> 00:12:08.045
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna take a look at our kubelet

00:12:08.045 --> 00:12:09.085
<v Speaker 0>logs

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:14.490
<v Speaker 0>and it is misconfigured.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:15.370
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.730
<v Speaker 0>We shouldn't have an Etsy kubelet fail.

00:12:19.769 --> 00:12:22.970
<v Speaker 0>We're gonna go into our with the system,

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:25.450
<v Speaker 0>system control

00:12:27.214 --> 00:12:27.935
<v Speaker 0>cat,

00:12:28.255 --> 00:12:29.055
<v Speaker 0>kuplet,

00:12:30.574 --> 00:12:32.415
<v Speaker 0>and we're going to check

00:12:32.815 --> 00:12:35.375
<v Speaker 0>and make sure there's nothing weird here.

00:12:37.134 --> 00:12:39.375
<v Speaker 0>Exact start here has been tampered with,

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.580
<v Speaker 0>and that is in this drop in here.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.820
<v Speaker 0>Our kubelet should be in user

00:12:56.475 --> 00:12:57.274
<v Speaker 0>ben

00:12:58.154 --> 00:13:00.955
<v Speaker 0>user ben kuplet, maybe user ben local kuplet.

00:13:02.954 --> 00:13:04.315
<v Speaker 0>User ben kuplet,

00:13:05.115 --> 00:13:06.635
<v Speaker 0>the daemon reload,

00:13:08.315 --> 00:13:09.115
<v Speaker 0>restart

00:13:09.435 --> 00:13:09.915
<v Speaker 0>kuplet.

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:18.530
<v Speaker 0>And we'll take a look at those logs

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:20.050
<v Speaker 0>and that looks a bit better.

00:13:23.945 --> 00:13:25.785
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully those errors go away.

00:13:27.625 --> 00:13:28.985
<v Speaker 0>Let's see what we've got in the chat

00:13:28.985 --> 00:13:29.785
<v Speaker 0>so far.

00:13:34.185 --> 00:13:36.585
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Well, brought an account then during the

00:13:36.585 --> 00:13:37.385
<v Speaker 0>team stuff

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:39.850
<v Speaker 0>just to make sure that he gave appropriate

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:41.290
<v Speaker 0>time to each of the clusters that we

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:42.810
<v Speaker 0>have. So it's it's really more of a

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:44.810
<v Speaker 0>guide. It's not always enforced, but

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:46.810
<v Speaker 0>yeah. I try to keep it there.

00:13:49.915 --> 00:13:53.675
<v Speaker 0>Some love for Russell's break. People laughing.

00:13:53.915 --> 00:13:55.195
<v Speaker 0>I'm

00:13:55.195 --> 00:13:56.075
<v Speaker 0>not laughing.

00:13:57.195 --> 00:13:59.515
<v Speaker 0>That's a lot of yaml. Lots of alright.

00:13:59.515 --> 00:14:01.595
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Selim was not you, Russell. Thank you.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.470
<v Speaker 0>That helps. I'm not sure why that Selim.YAML

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:06.110
<v Speaker 0>was there.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:10.910
<v Speaker 0>You're a gentleman. Okay. So we do have

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:12.510
<v Speaker 0>hints if we need them and slash root

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:13.150
<v Speaker 0>hints.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:14.430
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:15.710
<v Speaker 0>I'm curious

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.190
<v Speaker 0>if we have an API server. We do

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:18.430
<v Speaker 0>not.

00:14:22.245 --> 00:14:23.125
<v Speaker 0>Controller,

00:14:23.525 --> 00:14:25.445
<v Speaker 0>cube. All right, we've got a few things.

00:14:25.685 --> 00:14:28.165
<v Speaker 0>So now our API server is failing.

00:14:29.125 --> 00:14:31.605
<v Speaker 0>We can go to varlog containers

00:14:32.085 --> 00:14:33.525
<v Speaker 0>and we can tail

00:14:33.605 --> 00:14:34.965
<v Speaker 0>cube API server,

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.139
<v Speaker 0>and it's been shut down.

00:14:48.095 --> 00:14:48.975
<v Speaker 0>Structural

00:14:48.975 --> 00:14:50.894
<v Speaker 0>schema condition controller.

00:14:56.815 --> 00:14:57.855
<v Speaker 0>Interesting.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:04.029
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. They're called funny names.

00:15:05.149 --> 00:15:09.070
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's see. API server, advertise address, low

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:10.029
<v Speaker 0>privileged

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:11.070
<v Speaker 0>authorization

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:11.790
<v Speaker 0>mode.

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:15.230
<v Speaker 0>All fine, fine, fine. Admission plugins, no destruction

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:15.949
<v Speaker 0>is okay.

00:15:17.845 --> 00:15:18.725
<v Speaker 0>LCD

00:15:18.965 --> 00:15:20.645
<v Speaker 0>should be alright. It should check that it's

00:15:20.645 --> 00:15:21.605
<v Speaker 0>running though.

00:15:22.965 --> 00:15:23.605
<v Speaker 0>And

00:15:27.765 --> 00:15:28.645
<v Speaker 0>that looks alright.

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:34.610
<v Speaker 0>Not sure about the probes. Hard coded IP

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:37.330
<v Speaker 0>address is probably a private IP before that

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:38.130
<v Speaker 0>machine,

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.050
<v Speaker 0>not something I often look at. I'm gonna

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:40.930
<v Speaker 0>assume it's all right.

00:15:47.254 --> 00:15:48.694
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure if we should have a

00:15:48.694 --> 00:15:51.255
<v Speaker 0>default seccomp profile on API server,

00:15:51.975 --> 00:15:52.695
<v Speaker 0>but

00:15:52.935 --> 00:15:54.454
<v Speaker 0>I can't think of this just running on

00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:56.260
<v Speaker 0>a web server. Yeah. It should should be

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:57.940
<v Speaker 0>alright. It's not scheduling anything.

00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:02.180
<v Speaker 0>Okay. That looked alright. So I

00:16:02.899 --> 00:16:04.899
<v Speaker 0>because I'm confused,

00:16:10.795 --> 00:16:12.475
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna take a look

00:16:12.875 --> 00:16:15.274
<v Speaker 0>cdb at the top. Not probably a good

00:16:15.274 --> 00:16:15.834
<v Speaker 0>sign, right?

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.540
<v Speaker 0>Yeah,

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:27.540
<v Speaker 0>think I'm just okay.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:29.380
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.220
<v Speaker 0>Let's see, kubectl.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.460
<v Speaker 0>Look at this in a bit more detail.

00:16:40.775 --> 00:16:42.135
<v Speaker 0>When's this last

00:16:42.375 --> 00:16:44.935
<v Speaker 0>start? This is sixteen o two. Hey, that's

00:16:44.935 --> 00:16:45.975
<v Speaker 0>a while ago.

00:16:48.775 --> 00:16:49.975
<v Speaker 0>So we're starting here.

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:53.530
<v Speaker 0>Oh, we got a shutdown

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:57.450
<v Speaker 0>here. How can I shut down before it

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:57.850
<v Speaker 0>starts?

00:17:07.895 --> 00:17:08.694
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

00:17:09.895 --> 00:17:10.694
<v Speaker 0>That's funny.

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:25.649
<v Speaker 0>I'm not in there.

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:26.609
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:33.570
<v Speaker 0>It could be API server, a control plane.

00:17:44.325 --> 00:17:45.365
<v Speaker 0>It looks

00:17:46.965 --> 00:17:47.765
<v Speaker 0>looks fine.

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.380
<v Speaker 0>I can never remember this stuff. Oh, no.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.299
<v Speaker 0>It is the crisis here.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:01.740
<v Speaker 0>Runtime endpoint.

00:18:10.805 --> 00:18:13.125
<v Speaker 0>Okay. API server four minutes ago.

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:18.690
<v Speaker 0>Let me do logs.

00:18:26.929 --> 00:18:29.409
<v Speaker 0>Container ID. All right. Okay. So we can

00:18:29.409 --> 00:18:31.195
<v Speaker 0>do logs, but we need

00:18:32.554 --> 00:18:34.394
<v Speaker 0>ps and

00:18:34.955 --> 00:18:36.074
<v Speaker 0>then log

00:18:36.235 --> 00:18:38.475
<v Speaker 0>on our API servers dot again. Okay.

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:51.490
<v Speaker 0>Strange.

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:58.130
<v Speaker 0>I guess this is just the pod shows

00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:59.890
<v Speaker 0>because the pod is created even though the

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:01.410
<v Speaker 0>container doesn't exist.

00:19:08.875 --> 00:19:09.754
<v Speaker 0>I

00:19:11.915 --> 00:19:12.874
<v Speaker 0>move

00:19:15.195 --> 00:19:15.595
<v Speaker 0>fail.

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.700
<v Speaker 0>Just try and encourage the kubelet to reschedule

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:21.020
<v Speaker 0>it.

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:46.070
<v Speaker 0>K.

00:20:09.504 --> 00:20:11.264
<v Speaker 0>So the KubePad errors are because it can't

00:20:11.264 --> 00:20:12.544
<v Speaker 0>speak to the API server,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.760
<v Speaker 0>But I'm not seeing one.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:21.280
<v Speaker 0>Start.

00:20:29.565 --> 00:20:31.565
<v Speaker 0>I'm not getting any more logs.

00:20:37.405 --> 00:20:39.165
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna restart

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.039
<v Speaker 0>Kubler.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:51.040
<v Speaker 0>I really wanna see this Kube API server

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.200
<v Speaker 0>failable too. So I'm just gonna remove it,

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.960
<v Speaker 0>which I'm gonna regret in five minutes.

00:21:01.655 --> 00:21:02.534
<v Speaker 0>Watch.

00:21:04.295 --> 00:21:05.655
<v Speaker 0>And we'll wait for that fail to come

00:21:05.655 --> 00:21:06.775
<v Speaker 0>back, see if we can get some more

00:21:06.775 --> 00:21:08.695
<v Speaker 0>logs out of that API server. I'm not

00:21:08.695 --> 00:21:11.175
<v Speaker 0>sure what is happening here at the moment,

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.119
<v Speaker 0>but I'm doing okay for time, I think.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.960
<v Speaker 0>Russell is just happy it took more than

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:23.520
<v Speaker 0>five minutes.

00:21:24.495 --> 00:21:26.575
<v Speaker 0>You know, people always worry when I invite

00:21:26.575 --> 00:21:28.815
<v Speaker 0>them on to break clusters that their effects

00:21:28.815 --> 00:21:30.654
<v Speaker 0>are too superficial.

00:21:31.535 --> 00:21:34.735
<v Speaker 0>It just doesn't work that way. It's

00:21:34.735 --> 00:21:36.735
<v Speaker 0>really hard debugging clusters.

00:21:37.615 --> 00:21:38.975
<v Speaker 0>I'll see that because I'm doing one.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:50.230
<v Speaker 0>The kubelet is running. We're still almost again.

00:21:54.975 --> 00:21:56.655
<v Speaker 0>Add our messages here.

00:22:02.735 --> 00:22:05.375
<v Speaker 0>And I wanna be able to filter that.

00:22:05.535 --> 00:22:06.975
<v Speaker 0>So let's remove

00:22:07.055 --> 00:22:08.015
<v Speaker 0>the follow.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.640
<v Speaker 0>Search for API.

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:46.590
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So fail is creating a matter of

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:47.229
<v Speaker 0>pod.

00:22:47.549 --> 00:22:49.950
<v Speaker 0>I finally got something that looks like it's

00:22:50.269 --> 00:22:51.710
<v Speaker 0>useful

00:22:52.845 --> 00:22:56.684
<v Speaker 0>and it's failing because the pod already exists.

00:22:59.164 --> 00:23:00.924
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So we did see that behavior with

00:23:00.924 --> 00:23:02.684
<v Speaker 0>the CryoControl PS.

00:23:03.485 --> 00:23:05.325
<v Speaker 0>That's it was created a few minutes ago.

00:23:05.325 --> 00:23:07.485
<v Speaker 0>I suspect that's gonna be even

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.259
<v Speaker 0>newer now. No.

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:14.460
<v Speaker 0>Is that RMP?

00:23:20.075 --> 00:23:21.835
<v Speaker 0>So I've removed that pod.

00:23:26.075 --> 00:23:27.674
<v Speaker 0>Let's see if it comes back.

00:23:29.195 --> 00:23:29.675
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:34.649
<v Speaker 0>Nope.

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:41.609
<v Speaker 0>No API server logs.

00:23:43.049 --> 00:23:43.530
<v Speaker 0>Kipla.

00:23:50.745 --> 00:23:52.585
<v Speaker 0>What's happening just now?

00:24:09.529 --> 00:24:10.169
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:10.649
<v Speaker 0>So,

00:24:14.784 --> 00:24:17.345
<v Speaker 0>okay. So we've got API server crash loop

00:24:17.345 --> 00:24:18.304
<v Speaker 0>back off.

00:24:21.985 --> 00:24:23.904
<v Speaker 0>And there's a component skipping field to start

00:24:23.904 --> 00:24:25.904
<v Speaker 0>container for the cube API server with a

00:24:25.904 --> 00:24:27.505
<v Speaker 0>crash loop back off. Okay.

00:24:31.159 --> 00:24:32.679
<v Speaker 0>Then why am I not getting logs?

00:24:51.065 --> 00:24:52.585
<v Speaker 0>That's a good idea, Kevin. I think I

00:24:52.585 --> 00:24:54.505
<v Speaker 0>will take a hint. I'm gonna take a

00:24:54.505 --> 00:24:56.025
<v Speaker 0>look at our IPS. I'm gonna take a

00:24:56.025 --> 00:24:57.465
<v Speaker 0>look this one more time

00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.440
<v Speaker 0>because I feel

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.000
<v Speaker 0>Why are we not getting logs?

00:25:17.735 --> 00:25:18.135
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:23.570
<v Speaker 0>Is that a directory? Yep.

00:25:24.929 --> 00:25:27.009
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we're past the beach.

00:25:28.289 --> 00:25:30.210
<v Speaker 0>What's the second ten? Oh, there's a read

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:30.769
<v Speaker 0>me. Okay.

00:25:34.455 --> 00:25:36.455
<v Speaker 0>Welcome to oh, you never told me there

00:25:36.455 --> 00:25:38.615
<v Speaker 0>was a bag story. Okay. So welcome to

00:25:38.615 --> 00:25:40.135
<v Speaker 0>the Crystal Maze Cluster. You will need to

00:25:40.135 --> 00:25:41.975
<v Speaker 0>travel through four zones in order to solve

00:25:41.975 --> 00:25:44.534
<v Speaker 0>their puzzles. Good luck. I hope it's challenging

00:25:44.534 --> 00:25:46.054
<v Speaker 0>enough without being too frustrating.

00:25:46.639 --> 00:25:49.360
<v Speaker 0>Well, you failed. It's frustrating. Let's begin. Picture

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.960
<v Speaker 0>zone. If you want hints, I'll just drive

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.559
<v Speaker 0>straight in. Beach. Just a view of the

00:25:52.559 --> 00:25:55.279
<v Speaker 0>beach. Yeah. We we we've done the beach.

00:26:00.745 --> 00:26:02.585
<v Speaker 0>So I don't think this is

00:26:06.105 --> 00:26:08.024
<v Speaker 0>the industrial networking one.

00:26:11.865 --> 00:26:14.664
<v Speaker 0>Something with the stairs and then

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:19.170
<v Speaker 0>there is a phrase you can't see the

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:20.690
<v Speaker 0>wood for the trees.

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:25.890
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I don't want you to start opening

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:27.490
<v Speaker 0>all these hints, Russell. So

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:31.170
<v Speaker 0>which one which hint should I look at

00:26:30.675 --> 00:26:32.515
<v Speaker 0>for the API server break?

00:26:32.995 --> 00:26:34.195
<v Speaker 0>Give me a heads up.

00:26:39.395 --> 00:26:40.275
<v Speaker 0>And I'll think.

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:48.070
<v Speaker 0>Really annoying me if there's more logs.

00:26:57.075 --> 00:26:59.075
<v Speaker 0>I need to know why it's breaking.

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:20.940
<v Speaker 0>Must be something in here.

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:43.340
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Trees.

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.779
<v Speaker 0>Thank you, Russell.

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:48.299
<v Speaker 0>The forest.

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:50.220
<v Speaker 0>Oh, we got a couple of hints here.

00:27:55.605 --> 00:27:56.405
<v Speaker 0>Okay,

00:27:57.365 --> 00:27:59.445
<v Speaker 0>so many questions, which fails do you need

00:27:59.445 --> 00:28:02.005
<v Speaker 0>to edit? However, there's many fails in the

00:28:02.005 --> 00:28:04.085
<v Speaker 0>static manifest directory, but only a few containers

00:28:04.085 --> 00:28:04.965
<v Speaker 0>being run.

00:28:06.565 --> 00:28:08.725
<v Speaker 0>Where is the API server? Right, well,

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:11.420
<v Speaker 0>I think I fixed the first part of

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:12.300
<v Speaker 0>the forest.

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:22.540
<v Speaker 0>Ah, sneaky.

00:28:30.955 --> 00:28:31.995
<v Speaker 0>Very sneaky.

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:41.390
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, I do not need any of

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:42.030
<v Speaker 0>your aliases.

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:07.910
<v Speaker 0>Should have paid more attention to them now

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:09.429
<v Speaker 0>that I've just deleted them all

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:11.270
<v Speaker 0>because I wasn't actually sure what you were

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:12.790
<v Speaker 0>doing. It looks like you were just intercepting

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:14.230
<v Speaker 0>my LS and CD,

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:16.710
<v Speaker 0>which I meant, I thought you had modified

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:17.670
<v Speaker 0>my

00:29:19.825 --> 00:29:21.105
<v Speaker 0>manifest directory.

00:29:28.865 --> 00:29:30.305
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It was far too quick to delete

00:29:30.305 --> 00:29:31.905
<v Speaker 0>those aliases. I should have paid attention.

00:29:51.825 --> 00:29:54.865
<v Speaker 0>Okay. It was intercepted in CD and LS.

00:29:54.945 --> 00:29:57.505
<v Speaker 0>I now know I've got the proper LS.

00:30:03.639 --> 00:30:05.399
<v Speaker 0>We're take another hint just because I deleted

00:30:05.399 --> 00:30:06.679
<v Speaker 0>that stuff too quickly.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.600
<v Speaker 0>I shouldn't have to log in or nor

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:15.399
<v Speaker 0>log out.

00:30:22.155 --> 00:30:23.995
<v Speaker 0>So I don't think you'd maybe change the

00:30:23.995 --> 00:30:26.315
<v Speaker 0>manifest. That's why I did that. The

00:30:26.635 --> 00:30:28.155
<v Speaker 0>cat on the couplet, and I was gonna

00:30:28.155 --> 00:30:30.875
<v Speaker 0>start poking around to see if you'd maybe

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:33.690
<v Speaker 0>told it to live in a different location.

00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:39.050
<v Speaker 0>Let's take a look.

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:41.610
<v Speaker 0>There we

00:30:43.035 --> 00:30:44.715
<v Speaker 0>And you know I should have trusted my

00:30:44.715 --> 00:30:45.275
<v Speaker 0>gut.

00:30:49.355 --> 00:30:49.835
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:12.230
<v Speaker 0>This is the actual static manifesto retro.

00:31:17.085 --> 00:31:18.365
<v Speaker 0>API server.

00:31:23.005 --> 00:31:23.645
<v Speaker 0>Good.

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:30.380
<v Speaker 0>Good.

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:33.980
<v Speaker 0>Good.

00:31:38.715 --> 00:31:41.434
<v Speaker 0>I I I don't think there's anything wrong

00:31:44.475 --> 00:31:46.235
<v Speaker 0>with that API server.

00:31:51.275 --> 00:31:52.875
<v Speaker 0>Got me going around in circles here.

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:56.529
<v Speaker 0>We've got twenty minutes left.

00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:58.850
<v Speaker 0>Might as well read all the forest hence

00:31:58.850 --> 00:31:59.809
<v Speaker 0>while we're here.

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:03.570
<v Speaker 0>So this one was the battery aliases. We

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:04.610
<v Speaker 0>found the real manifest.

00:32:07.115 --> 00:32:08.954
<v Speaker 0>So yes, I am frustrated.

00:32:13.754 --> 00:32:16.075
<v Speaker 0>I did try calling user Ben.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.080
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so you basically broken

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.720
<v Speaker 0>everything is what you're telling me.

00:32:42.235 --> 00:32:43.995
<v Speaker 0>This is definitely this.

00:32:45.595 --> 00:32:46.555
<v Speaker 0>That's the same.

00:33:08.105 --> 00:33:09.304
<v Speaker 0>And I still have

00:33:11.785 --> 00:33:13.705
<v Speaker 0>Kube API server that I think is all

00:33:13.705 --> 00:33:14.345
<v Speaker 0>right.

00:33:15.465 --> 00:33:17.145
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you're telling me there's two problems in

00:33:17.145 --> 00:33:18.745
<v Speaker 0>this API site. Thank you, Russell.

00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:20.389
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:22.389
<v Speaker 0>Line by line and stop rushing.

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:25.429
<v Speaker 0>So there's definitely a direct command, advertiser address.

00:33:33.145 --> 00:33:34.264
<v Speaker 0>Should be okay.

00:33:34.665 --> 00:33:36.024
<v Speaker 0>I have IPv4.

00:33:45.145 --> 00:33:46.425
<v Speaker 0>Okay. User thing.

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:52.460
<v Speaker 0>Hoping it'll have to check all the cert

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:53.419
<v Speaker 0>paths.

00:33:54.539 --> 00:33:55.820
<v Speaker 0>Secure port is okay.

00:34:06.895 --> 00:34:07.615
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:14.590
<v Speaker 0>Unless that is the poor. I've just never

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:15.790
<v Speaker 0>noticed that before.

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:22.590
<v Speaker 0>I don't even know if that's a fixer.

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:23.710
<v Speaker 0>I'm breaking it more.

00:34:37.045 --> 00:34:38.244
<v Speaker 0>I wonder

00:34:38.404 --> 00:34:41.924
<v Speaker 0>if I couldn't see logs because of that

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.560
<v Speaker 0>CD intercept.

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:46.320
<v Speaker 0>Maybe that was an old log.

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.000
<v Speaker 0>I still don't have any API.

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:12.660
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Well, the probe ports,

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:14.340
<v Speaker 0>the two issues in that spec.

00:35:30.895 --> 00:35:32.095
<v Speaker 0>Oh, this is wrong too.

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:37.990
<v Speaker 0>All the ports are wrong.

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:41.670
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:35:42.789 --> 00:35:43.510
<v Speaker 0>Let's try that.

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.440
<v Speaker 0>Log yet.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.360
<v Speaker 0>We start in a kubelet.

00:36:51.025 --> 00:36:52.065
<v Speaker 0>I hate you.

00:36:56.305 --> 00:36:56.785
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.319
<v Speaker 0>I'm just gonna keep restarting the cubelet till

00:37:04.319 --> 00:37:05.280
<v Speaker 0>I get an API server.

00:37:18.355 --> 00:37:19.474
<v Speaker 0>Why is it not taping?

00:37:47.565 --> 00:37:49.005
<v Speaker 0>Teleport was broken.

00:37:50.445 --> 00:37:51.565
<v Speaker 0>What have I done?

00:38:09.055 --> 00:38:10.655
<v Speaker 0>Cool department up.

00:38:14.414 --> 00:38:16.095
<v Speaker 0>We have an API server at least.

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:19.990
<v Speaker 0>And

00:38:26.869 --> 00:38:28.710
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if I broke

00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:30.470
<v Speaker 0>Teleport or,

00:38:32.785 --> 00:38:34.305
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Don't know what happened there.

00:38:34.705 --> 00:38:36.225
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's

00:38:36.305 --> 00:38:37.345
<v Speaker 0>export.

00:38:43.265 --> 00:38:43.665
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:50.820
<v Speaker 0>It pods.

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:52.660
<v Speaker 0>I think they've been

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.100
<v Speaker 0>cordoned.

00:38:59.140 --> 00:38:59.460
<v Speaker 0>Nope.

00:39:07.805 --> 00:39:08.605
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:39:11.244 --> 00:39:14.045
<v Speaker 0>So Russell says that's forest and cryptography

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:16.980
<v Speaker 0>covered. It's just the industrial stage now.

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:21.540
<v Speaker 0>So

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:24.980
<v Speaker 0>let's see. These are gonna wait.

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:28.340
<v Speaker 0>Worker one, worker one,

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:29.620
<v Speaker 0>worker two,

00:39:31.035 --> 00:39:33.355
<v Speaker 0>worker one. Okay. So I

00:39:34.714 --> 00:39:37.995
<v Speaker 0>think your readme suggested that everything is on

00:39:39.115 --> 00:39:40.395
<v Speaker 0>the control plane.

00:39:41.115 --> 00:39:42.954
<v Speaker 0>I've not touched the worker nodes at all.

00:39:42.954 --> 00:39:43.195
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:53.990
<v Speaker 0>Let's see if we've got any

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:55.910
<v Speaker 0>10x rules. We don't.

00:39:58.185 --> 00:40:00.345
<v Speaker 0>We are, these clusters are all one twenty

00:40:00.345 --> 00:40:00.985
<v Speaker 0>two.

00:40:01.625 --> 00:40:02.025
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:40:03.225 --> 00:40:05.545
<v Speaker 0>Started provisioning them the day after release.

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.280
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.480
<v Speaker 0>we've got some networking problem.

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:19.480
<v Speaker 0>And what we can do,

00:40:21.095 --> 00:40:23.175
<v Speaker 0>see if we can get any

00:40:23.654 --> 00:40:25.974
<v Speaker 0>logs from this pod here.

00:40:28.535 --> 00:40:30.615
<v Speaker 0>Unable to reach the API server that may

00:40:30.615 --> 00:40:31.415
<v Speaker 0>just need,

00:40:32.934 --> 00:40:34.135
<v Speaker 0>oh, come down.

00:40:34.934 --> 00:40:36.295
<v Speaker 0>May just need a wee nudge.

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:46.530
<v Speaker 0>And

00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:47.650
<v Speaker 0>nudge.

00:40:54.585 --> 00:40:56.744
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's see if that's something that's happy

00:40:56.744 --> 00:40:57.545
<v Speaker 0>again.

00:41:00.265 --> 00:41:02.025
<v Speaker 0>I wonder if that's the same reason the

00:41:02.025 --> 00:41:04.265
<v Speaker 0>ambassador is potentially broken.

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:11.670
<v Speaker 0>I will just start rotating pods.

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:13.430
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:16.869
<v Speaker 0>Okay. That's definitely healthier.

00:41:17.815 --> 00:41:19.575
<v Speaker 0>So that means I could do a k

00:41:19.575 --> 00:41:20.295
<v Speaker 0>get

00:41:20.535 --> 00:41:21.495
<v Speaker 0>deployments

00:41:23.015 --> 00:41:24.455
<v Speaker 0>and deployments

00:41:24.695 --> 00:41:25.655
<v Speaker 0>clustered

00:41:26.695 --> 00:41:28.215
<v Speaker 0>image

00:41:31.859 --> 00:41:32.420
<v Speaker 0>two.

00:41:34.339 --> 00:41:35.540
<v Speaker 0>Let's see if that works.

00:41:56.015 --> 00:41:56.815
<v Speaker 0>And it did.

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:04.430
<v Speaker 0>Let's see what happens.

00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:09.230
<v Speaker 0>And I've got the dance.

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:12.015
<v Speaker 0>So I'm not sure what your industrial problem

00:42:12.015 --> 00:42:14.495
<v Speaker 0>was, Russell, but it did not stop me

00:42:15.055 --> 00:42:17.135
<v Speaker 0>from deploying version two.

00:42:18.415 --> 00:42:19.295
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:42:21.615 --> 00:42:25.215
<v Speaker 0>Cluster fix. Thank you, Russell. That was infuriating,

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:26.780
<v Speaker 0>but very good.

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:32.620
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. The bash alias is that, you know,

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:33.660
<v Speaker 0>I just don't even

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:38.380
<v Speaker 0>I don't think, you know, there's nothing, there's

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:39.980
<v Speaker 0>no feedback to let you know

00:42:40.895 --> 00:42:42.895
<v Speaker 0>that you're working with any leads or anything

00:42:42.895 --> 00:42:44.655
<v Speaker 0>like that. So yeah, maybe something I should

00:42:44.655 --> 00:42:46.255
<v Speaker 0>start checking by default

00:42:46.575 --> 00:42:47.775
<v Speaker 0>in the future.

00:42:50.974 --> 00:42:52.734
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. And that image

00:42:53.609 --> 00:42:54.410
<v Speaker 0>sneaky.

00:42:55.049 --> 00:42:55.770
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:42:57.049 --> 00:42:59.770
<v Speaker 0>Let's jump on to node cluster,

00:43:00.329 --> 00:43:02.490
<v Speaker 0>which isn't looking very healthy at the moment.

00:43:03.769 --> 00:43:05.210
<v Speaker 0>We have no worker nodes.

00:43:10.035 --> 00:43:12.515
<v Speaker 0>Alias, k, control.

00:43:15.235 --> 00:43:17.715
<v Speaker 0>At least I'm getting real LAS CDs are

00:43:17.715 --> 00:43:18.515
<v Speaker 0>built in.

00:43:19.235 --> 00:43:19.555
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:21.950
<v Speaker 0>K. Get notes.

00:43:39.994 --> 00:43:41.755
<v Speaker 0>Which kip control.

00:43:50.410 --> 00:43:52.010
<v Speaker 0>It's CTL.

00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:53.450
<v Speaker 0>Looks all right.

00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:54.810
<v Speaker 0>Version.

00:43:55.930 --> 00:43:57.770
<v Speaker 0>I've got an API server.

00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:02.010
<v Speaker 0>But something.

00:44:13.984 --> 00:44:15.905
<v Speaker 0>We have no apps we want our core

00:44:15.905 --> 00:44:16.385
<v Speaker 0>v one.

00:44:30.575 --> 00:44:31.375
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:44:34.414 --> 00:44:36.575
<v Speaker 0>So how would this be possible? Well,

00:44:37.375 --> 00:44:39.855
<v Speaker 0>we're going straight back to our static manifest.

00:44:39.855 --> 00:44:41.214
<v Speaker 0>We're taking a look at our API server

00:44:41.214 --> 00:44:42.175
<v Speaker 0>configuration.

00:44:42.335 --> 00:44:44.654
<v Speaker 0>Disappointed in my cursor did not start halfway

00:44:44.654 --> 00:44:45.214
<v Speaker 0>down the file.

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:49.620
<v Speaker 0>Do we have all our controllers running?

00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:58.260
<v Speaker 0>Certainly looks like it

00:45:00.615 --> 00:45:02.055
<v Speaker 0>didn't start my timer.

00:45:04.615 --> 00:45:05.175
<v Speaker 0>There you go.

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:21.220
<v Speaker 0>I mean, you could have reset the times

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:22.980
<v Speaker 0>on the files, of course, but

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:24.340
<v Speaker 0>it looks clean.

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:28.500
<v Speaker 0>Double check the image.

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:30.180
<v Speaker 0>We're getting bit by that twice.

00:45:32.295 --> 00:45:33.015
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:45:38.935 --> 00:45:39.655
<v Speaker 0>So

00:45:40.295 --> 00:45:42.055
<v Speaker 0>either I don't have access

00:45:43.655 --> 00:45:44.694
<v Speaker 0>to these types.

00:45:58.050 --> 00:46:00.210
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's get

00:46:01.674 --> 00:46:02.555
<v Speaker 0>cluster

00:46:02.555 --> 00:46:03.515
<v Speaker 0>roles.

00:46:05.194 --> 00:46:06.714
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully it's not

00:46:07.275 --> 00:46:09.595
<v Speaker 0>our back. Please don't be our back.

00:46:13.115 --> 00:46:13.755
<v Speaker 0>So

00:46:15.035 --> 00:46:16.474
<v Speaker 0>I have my admin account.

00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:18.930
<v Speaker 0>Let's take a look at the context for

00:46:18.930 --> 00:46:20.450
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes admin.

00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:25.890
<v Speaker 0>Speaking to the correct cluster.

00:46:31.895 --> 00:46:33.735
<v Speaker 0>Cluster admin here.

00:46:39.974 --> 00:46:41.335
<v Speaker 0>Not our back.

00:46:42.695 --> 00:46:43.494
<v Speaker 0>That's good.

00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:47.670
<v Speaker 0>That was the only lead I had. No.

00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:49.190
<v Speaker 0>So

00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:50.710
<v Speaker 0>let's check.

00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:54.870
<v Speaker 0>Make sure this matches what we can expect

00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:57.190
<v Speaker 0>it to see from the static pod manifest.

00:46:59.325 --> 00:47:02.205
<v Speaker 0>No sneaky static admission controllers,

00:47:04.765 --> 00:47:06.685
<v Speaker 0>no controllers being disabled.

00:47:12.045 --> 00:47:12.525
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:18.860
<v Speaker 0>I should have brought two beers to this

00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:19.580
<v Speaker 0>episode.

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:22.700
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:25.580
<v Speaker 0>How are you removing pods?

00:47:26.025 --> 00:47:27.704
<v Speaker 0>How are you to moving pods?

00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:42.370
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's roll that out. What do we

00:47:42.370 --> 00:47:43.250
<v Speaker 0>have access to?

00:48:07.015 --> 00:48:08.935
<v Speaker 0>I'm able to retrieve the complete list of

00:48:08.935 --> 00:48:10.935
<v Speaker 0>server APIs. Apps v one, the server could

00:48:10.935 --> 00:48:12.700
<v Speaker 0>not How did you remove apps to be

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:14.860
<v Speaker 0>one? And where's core of e one?

00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:22.060
<v Speaker 0>I've never seen that before.

00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:24.380
<v Speaker 0>I'm impressed.

00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:26.300
<v Speaker 0>Shit.

00:48:34.934 --> 00:48:35.734
<v Speaker 0>I mean,

00:48:36.055 --> 00:48:37.095
<v Speaker 0>it has to be

00:48:37.654 --> 00:48:39.414
<v Speaker 0>it has to be API server.

00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:44.830
<v Speaker 0>Unless she did something in the cluster and

00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:46.190
<v Speaker 0>then out of the cluster.

00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:48.110
<v Speaker 0>You know what? I think I'm I'm gonna

00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:49.070
<v Speaker 0>have to reach for a hintel.

00:49:01.585 --> 00:49:03.105
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So the APIs

00:49:03.185 --> 00:49:05.265
<v Speaker 0>have decided to play hide and seek.

00:49:07.745 --> 00:49:08.705
<v Speaker 0>Where have they gone?

00:49:09.849 --> 00:49:10.970
<v Speaker 0>Nasty Goose.

00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:17.609
<v Speaker 0>That's a hint.

00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:44.750
<v Speaker 0>This is sneaky.

00:49:52.135 --> 00:49:54.535
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So you could have modified kubectl,

00:49:54.535 --> 00:49:55.975
<v Speaker 0>even though it's a binary.

00:49:59.415 --> 00:50:00.535
<v Speaker 0>May not be

00:50:02.695 --> 00:50:03.655
<v Speaker 0>the correct one.

00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:11.670
<v Speaker 0>It does to get tree state clean.

00:50:19.445 --> 00:50:21.605
<v Speaker 0>Make sure I'm calling this kubectl.

00:50:26.245 --> 00:50:28.005
<v Speaker 0>I am calling this kubectl.

00:50:28.005 --> 00:50:29.605
<v Speaker 0>Do we have any other kubectl?

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:35.880
<v Speaker 0>Shooter,

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:36.119
<v Speaker 0>Ben.

00:50:55.935 --> 00:50:57.295
<v Speaker 0>This is too funny.

00:50:58.895 --> 00:50:59.935
<v Speaker 0>There it is.

00:51:02.095 --> 00:51:04.335
<v Speaker 0>Runtime config v one equals false and ask

00:51:04.335 --> 00:51:05.535
<v Speaker 0>v one equals false. Okay.

00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:07.720
<v Speaker 0>So I can see it here.

00:51:10.039 --> 00:51:11.160
<v Speaker 0>Runtime,

00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:16.200
<v Speaker 0>but not there.

00:51:18.935 --> 00:51:20.775
<v Speaker 0>You've moved the stack there. You've done the

00:51:20.775 --> 00:51:21.735
<v Speaker 0>same, right?

00:51:29.175 --> 00:51:30.935
<v Speaker 0>So let's take a look

00:51:31.015 --> 00:51:32.935
<v Speaker 0>and our config

00:51:32.935 --> 00:51:33.255
<v Speaker 0>here.

00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:35.300
<v Speaker 0>It's not been moved.

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:39.060
<v Speaker 0>The static pod manifest is the same.

00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:43.780
<v Speaker 0>How is that run

00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:45.700
<v Speaker 0>time config again

00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:47.780
<v Speaker 0>and to the API server?

00:51:55.135 --> 00:51:56.735
<v Speaker 0>What if it's not running as a static

00:51:56.735 --> 00:51:57.215
<v Speaker 0>pod?

00:52:16.765 --> 00:52:17.565
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:52:19.725 --> 00:52:23.005
<v Speaker 0>It's

00:52:23.005 --> 00:52:25.565
<v Speaker 0>definitely not an as fail, right?

00:52:27.485 --> 00:52:28.285
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:52:29.325 --> 00:52:31.405
<v Speaker 0>So it could be

00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:34.760
<v Speaker 0>there's two static manifests

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:36.280
<v Speaker 0>and one of these fails.

00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:38.840
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:45.640
<v Speaker 0>I like this.

00:52:46.235 --> 00:52:47.355
<v Speaker 0>I could see

00:52:48.235 --> 00:52:49.355
<v Speaker 0>the problem.

00:52:55.275 --> 00:52:56.555
<v Speaker 0>Do we trust a Qublet?

00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:06.950
<v Speaker 0>And those tell me to read the hints

00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:07.349
<v Speaker 0>again.

00:53:10.725 --> 00:53:11.525
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:53:11.525 --> 00:53:13.205
<v Speaker 0>The API is to say play hide and

00:53:13.205 --> 00:53:15.285
<v Speaker 0>seek. Where have they gone? Those are nasty

00:53:15.285 --> 00:53:18.245
<v Speaker 0>gifts. Don't worry. Let me think. I'm

00:53:20.165 --> 00:53:21.445
<v Speaker 0>trying to think my kubelet is not a

00:53:21.445 --> 00:53:21.845
<v Speaker 0>kubelet.

00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:24.980
<v Speaker 0>Know I should go to directory here.

00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:35.140
<v Speaker 0>Can't really tell what you were building.

00:53:40.895 --> 00:53:43.055
<v Speaker 0>I should have hidden it from PS as

00:53:43.055 --> 00:53:45.215
<v Speaker 0>well. This is also a hint.

00:53:49.295 --> 00:53:50.654
<v Speaker 0>You all are cruel.

00:53:54.539 --> 00:53:56.619
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we could be in a position

00:53:56.619 --> 00:53:57.420
<v Speaker 0>where

00:53:58.539 --> 00:54:00.619
<v Speaker 0>our API server scheduled by the kubelet just

00:54:00.619 --> 00:54:01.500
<v Speaker 0>isn't running.

00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:07.099
<v Speaker 0>That may be the case because

00:54:11.305 --> 00:54:12.665
<v Speaker 0>got it. Okay.

00:54:13.145 --> 00:54:16.105
<v Speaker 0>So that's nice. Our Kubelet can't actually schedule

00:54:16.105 --> 00:54:18.105
<v Speaker 0>the API server via container D because the

00:54:18.105 --> 00:54:19.305
<v Speaker 0>port has already been bound.

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:22.570
<v Speaker 0>So no has managed to

00:54:22.810 --> 00:54:24.570
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I don't think system D and

00:54:24.570 --> 00:54:25.610
<v Speaker 0>I took a look in the system D

00:54:25.610 --> 00:54:26.890
<v Speaker 0>directory, but I guess it's been a lot

00:54:26.890 --> 00:54:27.770
<v Speaker 0>more sneaky

00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:28.730
<v Speaker 0>than that,

00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:30.170
<v Speaker 0>which means

00:54:30.890 --> 00:54:31.610
<v Speaker 0>in theory,

00:54:36.065 --> 00:54:38.545
<v Speaker 0>I could probably just kill this process.

00:54:45.265 --> 00:54:46.704
<v Speaker 0>No, it came straight back.

00:55:10.515 --> 00:55:12.035
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna stop the cube there.

00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:16.250
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna kill

00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:18.650
<v Speaker 0>this.

00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:21.850
<v Speaker 0>It's gone.

00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:24.410
<v Speaker 0>Install,

00:55:24.650 --> 00:55:25.610
<v Speaker 0>install,

00:55:25.930 --> 00:55:27.050
<v Speaker 0>reinstall,

00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:27.930
<v Speaker 0>kubelet.

00:55:31.165 --> 00:55:32.525
<v Speaker 0>If you hacked my kubelet.

00:55:59.755 --> 00:56:01.435
<v Speaker 0>That's taken a little bit longer than I

00:56:01.435 --> 00:56:03.195
<v Speaker 0>was kind of expecting it to, but that's

00:56:03.195 --> 00:56:04.235
<v Speaker 0>good or bad.

00:56:11.195 --> 00:56:12.155
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

00:56:13.994 --> 00:56:15.170
<v Speaker 0>And And then I'm going to restart the

00:56:15.170 --> 00:56:16.529
<v Speaker 0>Kubelet. I'm going to assume you compare join

00:56:16.529 --> 00:56:18.369
<v Speaker 0>Kubelet to spin up its own API server

00:56:18.369 --> 00:56:20.690
<v Speaker 0>before running a static MatterPods.

00:56:21.329 --> 00:56:22.930
<v Speaker 0>I think that's maybe what you've done.

00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:46.830
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:56:48.030 --> 00:56:48.589
<v Speaker 0>Darn it.

00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:24.160
<v Speaker 0>Okay, I'm gonna stop the Kubelet again. I

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:24.960
<v Speaker 0>wanna confirm

00:57:26.325 --> 00:57:28.565
<v Speaker 0>that kubelet is definitely starting this process.

00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:49.830
<v Speaker 0>Desperation

00:57:49.830 --> 00:57:50.950
<v Speaker 0>on the Linux command.

00:57:52.515 --> 00:57:53.394
<v Speaker 0>Container

00:57:53.394 --> 00:57:54.035
<v Speaker 0>D.

00:57:56.755 --> 00:57:58.275
<v Speaker 0>I think that is actually just part of

00:57:58.275 --> 00:57:58.835
<v Speaker 0>CTR.

00:58:29.585 --> 00:58:31.505
<v Speaker 0>Okay. That's a pretty big hint.

00:58:32.865 --> 00:58:35.345
<v Speaker 0>Noel says, do you trust the manifest fails

00:58:35.345 --> 00:58:35.985
<v Speaker 0>that you see?

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.320
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I think so.

00:59:08.310 --> 00:59:10.150
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So you've not done something through a

00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.550
<v Speaker 0>shell.

00:59:17.924 --> 00:59:19.525
<v Speaker 0>This better not be eBPF.

00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:32.420
<v Speaker 0>Do I trust the manifest files I see?

00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:34.660
<v Speaker 0>Okay. The API server does have an extra

00:59:34.660 --> 00:59:35.620
<v Speaker 0>line in it.

00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:39.060
<v Speaker 0>It's kinda what I think you're telling me.

00:59:45.835 --> 00:59:47.115
<v Speaker 0>But I can't see it.

01:00:21.930 --> 01:00:23.290
<v Speaker 0>I hate computers.

01:00:31.930 --> 01:00:32.970
<v Speaker 0>I may have asked

01:00:33.290 --> 01:00:34.089
<v Speaker 0>stop my QP.

01:00:47.704 --> 01:00:48.744
<v Speaker 0>The kubelet.com

01:00:48.744 --> 01:00:50.505
<v Speaker 0>should just be the

01:00:50.665 --> 01:00:51.785
<v Speaker 0>user to connect to it.

01:00:53.369 --> 01:00:54.970
<v Speaker 0>I don't think there would be anything in

01:00:54.970 --> 01:00:55.530
<v Speaker 0>there.

01:00:58.730 --> 01:00:59.770
<v Speaker 0>Seems normal.

01:01:02.730 --> 01:01:04.810
<v Speaker 0>Woodworking is a great idea.

01:01:06.970 --> 01:01:07.369
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

01:01:09.905 --> 01:01:10.625
<v Speaker 0>So

01:01:13.745 --> 01:01:14.625
<v Speaker 0>I have no idea.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:28.920
<v Speaker 0>I'm curious what happens if I add desktop.

01:01:57.610 --> 01:02:01.130
<v Speaker 0>I don't think it's adding. Let's

01:02:01.130 --> 01:02:02.490
<v Speaker 0>kill the process to be sure.

01:02:11.444 --> 01:02:14.085
<v Speaker 0>I think this has to be BPS and

01:02:14.085 --> 01:02:15.525
<v Speaker 0>there's no way to debug that.

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:20.100
<v Speaker 0>Have I broke it?

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:30.820
<v Speaker 0>It's not getting my flags I added either.

01:02:33.385 --> 01:02:35.065
<v Speaker 0>You've stumped me now. Tell me what it

01:02:35.065 --> 01:02:35.305
<v Speaker 0>is.

01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:56.020
<v Speaker 0>I just don't know where to start now.

01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:57.540
<v Speaker 0>So you're gonna have to

01:03:03.865 --> 01:03:05.785
<v Speaker 0>I don't know how to use BPF tool.

01:03:10.839 --> 01:03:12.600
<v Speaker 0>And here is the though.

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:19.079
<v Speaker 0>Russell, I did add a new param to

01:03:19.079 --> 01:03:20.839
<v Speaker 0>the gamble. It didn't show up.

01:03:25.155 --> 01:03:27.555
<v Speaker 0>But I I I don't know. So Nolan

01:03:27.555 --> 01:03:29.155
<v Speaker 0>said he left tool,

01:03:29.715 --> 01:03:30.675
<v Speaker 0>which means

01:03:32.275 --> 01:03:34.435
<v Speaker 0>there is an eBPF hack in somewhere.

01:03:45.130 --> 01:03:46.890
<v Speaker 0>No. No more hunch, just tell us.

01:03:51.305 --> 01:03:52.025
<v Speaker 0>Do

01:03:52.185 --> 01:03:54.185
<v Speaker 0>I trust the off system into the nodes

01:03:54.185 --> 01:03:55.145
<v Speaker 0>teleport?

01:03:57.465 --> 01:04:00.025
<v Speaker 0>Not particularly. You tell me I can SSH

01:04:00.025 --> 01:04:00.665
<v Speaker 0>in manually.

01:04:20.015 --> 01:04:23.295
<v Speaker 0>You're saying run system control cat teleport d.

01:04:45.865 --> 01:04:49.305
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So you're using VARTEP EPPF kit.

01:04:53.545 --> 01:04:56.265
<v Speaker 0>The source, so there's a Rawkode Kube API

01:04:56.265 --> 01:04:58.025
<v Speaker 0>server manifest in VARTEP,

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:01.800
<v Speaker 0>which is targeting a fail over there.

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:09.160
<v Speaker 0>So

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:11.319
<v Speaker 0>you've got an eBPF

01:05:11.885 --> 01:05:13.885
<v Speaker 0>probe that whenever the kubelet tries to access

01:05:13.885 --> 01:05:16.125
<v Speaker 0>the kubelet server YAML and save them the

01:05:16.125 --> 01:05:17.245
<v Speaker 0>manifest directory,

01:05:17.325 --> 01:05:19.005
<v Speaker 0>you're actually redirecting

01:05:19.005 --> 01:05:20.285
<v Speaker 0>it to var

01:05:20.685 --> 01:05:21.165
<v Speaker 0>temp.

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:26.760
<v Speaker 0>Was that supposed to happen?

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:40.120
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I'm gonna just kill it.

01:05:40.795 --> 01:05:43.915
<v Speaker 0>It does not like that. Stop the kubelet.

01:05:46.715 --> 01:05:48.235
<v Speaker 0>Kill the process

01:05:51.915 --> 01:05:53.115
<v Speaker 0>of our temp.

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:55.760
<v Speaker 0>Oh yeah, it does not like me doing

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:56.320
<v Speaker 0>that.

01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:00.320
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you have to, okay, got it. So

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:02.240
<v Speaker 0>no, and the chat is saying I'll have

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:02.800
<v Speaker 0>to

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:08.400
<v Speaker 0>stop the teleport the process with the eBPF

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:08.800
<v Speaker 0>kit.

01:06:25.570 --> 01:06:27.890
<v Speaker 0>That's nicest of eBPF

01:06:28.369 --> 01:06:30.450
<v Speaker 0>and really difficult to track down.

01:06:31.570 --> 01:06:33.170
<v Speaker 0>I think it's fair to say that eBPF

01:06:33.170 --> 01:06:34.450
<v Speaker 0>is a devil's work.

01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:38.849
<v Speaker 0>Let's jump back over to here just now.

01:06:39.885 --> 01:06:42.605
<v Speaker 0>I really, what I should have done at

01:06:42.605 --> 01:06:43.405
<v Speaker 0>some point

01:06:44.285 --> 01:06:45.725
<v Speaker 0>is run a status

01:06:46.045 --> 01:06:47.725
<v Speaker 0>and take a look at everything in this

01:06:47.725 --> 01:06:48.365
<v Speaker 0>list.

01:06:49.325 --> 01:06:52.045
<v Speaker 0>And I would have spotted our phony teleportee.

01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:53.780
<v Speaker 0>I think

01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:55.700
<v Speaker 0>think I would have spotted it.

01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:59.380
<v Speaker 0>So there we go. Couple of learnings

01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:00.980
<v Speaker 0>there. Always take a look at the system,

01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:02.820
<v Speaker 0>process table service list

01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:06.580
<v Speaker 0>and never let Noel and Russell near cluster

01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:06.900
<v Speaker 0>again.

01:07:09.045 --> 01:07:10.565
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I don't know what's happening here, so

01:07:10.565 --> 01:07:12.645
<v Speaker 0>I'm just going to leave.

01:07:15.525 --> 01:07:17.525
<v Speaker 0>And I'm gonna assume that eBPF kit is

01:07:17.525 --> 01:07:19.765
<v Speaker 0>not gonna show up here. I'm curious how

01:07:19.765 --> 01:07:20.405
<v Speaker 0>you had that,

01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:25.109
<v Speaker 0>But we'll just leave it. That was tricky.

01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:27.110
<v Speaker 0>Really, really tricky. Good work, Noel.

01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:33.430
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I gave you all access to this

01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:35.670
<v Speaker 0>cluster. I don't know if anyone has access

01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:36.310
<v Speaker 0>to machine.

01:07:38.214 --> 01:07:39.895
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if anyone's run or no

01:07:39.895 --> 01:07:40.535
<v Speaker 0>one's

01:07:40.695 --> 01:07:42.695
<v Speaker 0>SSH channel would give you access to.

01:07:46.855 --> 01:07:48.454
<v Speaker 0>All right, I have removed.

01:07:50.070 --> 01:07:51.910
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, Waleed, thanks for joining us.

01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:54.310
<v Speaker 0>We'll

01:07:54.310 --> 01:07:55.990
<v Speaker 0>quickly check if anyone did anything to this

01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:56.710
<v Speaker 0>cluster.

01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:59.910
<v Speaker 0>And if not, we'll call it an eight.

01:08:12.095 --> 01:08:13.615
<v Speaker 0>There has been a guess.

01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:18.460
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:21.179
<v Speaker 0>Guess I'm fixing one more.

01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:27.660
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We have a kubelet.

01:08:31.305 --> 01:08:33.145
<v Speaker 0>I have an API server.

01:08:42.025 --> 01:08:44.025
<v Speaker 0>It's got secure port six six three.

01:08:52.429 --> 01:08:54.029
<v Speaker 0>I bet there's nothing wrong with this cluster

01:08:54.029 --> 01:08:55.149
<v Speaker 0>except for me.

01:08:58.270 --> 01:08:59.869
<v Speaker 0>I didn't do the export properly.

01:09:06.935 --> 01:09:07.654
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:09:10.295 --> 01:09:12.295
<v Speaker 0>Well, maybe someone did break something. Okay.

01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:19.630
<v Speaker 0>Well, let's see why our application

01:09:19.950 --> 01:09:21.310
<v Speaker 0>is crashing.

01:09:22.350 --> 01:09:23.950
<v Speaker 0>There's no logs on that, of course. I

01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:24.910
<v Speaker 0>should know that by now.

01:09:35.365 --> 01:09:36.965
<v Speaker 0>Someone changed the label.

01:09:37.205 --> 01:09:38.245
<v Speaker 0>Sneaky.

01:09:40.885 --> 01:09:42.885
<v Speaker 0>Although, maybe it's here. So maybe it's a

01:09:42.885 --> 01:09:44.645
<v Speaker 0>typo in my automation. That would be funny.

01:09:45.619 --> 01:09:47.539
<v Speaker 0>Let's just bump it up to V2

01:09:47.779 --> 01:09:48.739
<v Speaker 0>always.

01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:51.539
<v Speaker 0>Oh, someone's changed the probes.

01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:57.219
<v Speaker 0>Can't remember the ports on this application.

01:10:01.284 --> 01:10:02.724
<v Speaker 0>I think it's eighty eighty.

01:10:04.245 --> 01:10:05.284
<v Speaker 0>And here,

01:10:05.764 --> 01:10:07.284
<v Speaker 0>a death by a thousand cuts I can

01:10:07.284 --> 01:10:07.844
<v Speaker 0>see.

01:10:10.885 --> 01:10:12.650
<v Speaker 0>And resource limits look okay.

01:10:15.050 --> 01:10:16.809
<v Speaker 0>And what do we get here?

01:10:20.409 --> 01:10:22.250
<v Speaker 0>Okay, I can't change the labels, so maybe

01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:23.850
<v Speaker 0>that is part of my

01:10:24.745 --> 01:10:25.864
<v Speaker 0>automation.

01:10:31.225 --> 01:10:32.185
<v Speaker 0>Fix that back.

01:10:40.179 --> 01:10:41.139
<v Speaker 0>Let's see what happens.

01:11:02.765 --> 01:11:03.405
<v Speaker 0>Okay,

01:11:03.645 --> 01:11:06.205
<v Speaker 0>the probes aren't passing. That's typically what the

01:11:06.205 --> 01:11:07.885
<v Speaker 0>internal server error means.

01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:11.420
<v Speaker 0>It does look okay.

01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:13.020
<v Speaker 0>Maybe I should expect to

01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:15.500
<v Speaker 0>No, it's broken.

01:11:22.554 --> 01:11:23.354
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

01:11:23.434 --> 01:11:24.235
<v Speaker 0>Let's

01:11:24.235 --> 01:11:24.954
<v Speaker 0>see.

01:11:26.954 --> 01:11:29.354
<v Speaker 0>It should be a node port service.

01:11:31.434 --> 01:11:33.355
<v Speaker 0>Maybe someone's modified that too.

01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:44.620
<v Speaker 0>Selector is wrong. Okay. So I think someone

01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:46.940
<v Speaker 0>actually deleted that deployment and you applied it

01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:49.580
<v Speaker 0>with the broken labels. So it's probably not

01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:50.300
<v Speaker 0>my automation.

01:11:55.345 --> 01:11:57.505
<v Speaker 0>And we've got an endpoint now.

01:12:02.545 --> 01:12:04.545
<v Speaker 0>Is that healthier? I think that's healthier.

01:12:17.105 --> 01:12:19.264
<v Speaker 0>Possibly gonna time out because,

01:12:22.705 --> 01:12:23.585
<v Speaker 0>Postgres

01:12:23.585 --> 01:12:25.025
<v Speaker 0>does have endpoints.

01:12:26.065 --> 01:12:27.505
<v Speaker 0>What happens if I curl?

01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:37.719
<v Speaker 0>Okay. What's wrong with my application?

01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:43.640
<v Speaker 0>And see, don't even know who to ask

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:44.360
<v Speaker 0>for help now.

01:12:50.835 --> 01:12:52.835
<v Speaker 0>I actually think if we pull up my

01:12:52.835 --> 01:12:53.715
<v Speaker 0>automation,

01:12:56.114 --> 01:12:57.635
<v Speaker 0>I think it just runs on port 80.

01:12:57.635 --> 01:12:58.915
<v Speaker 0>I don't think it has eighty eighty at

01:12:58.915 --> 01:13:00.274
<v Speaker 0>all, but I could be

01:13:01.554 --> 01:13:02.275
<v Speaker 0>could be wrong.

01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:05.699
<v Speaker 0>No, it's okay.

01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:10.659
<v Speaker 0>Or 88.

01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:13.940
<v Speaker 0>Okay,

01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:15.940
<v Speaker 0>so what is wrong?

01:13:18.185 --> 01:13:19.145
<v Speaker 0>Clustered.

01:13:22.345 --> 01:13:23.865
<v Speaker 0>We've got an endpoint.

01:13:33.490 --> 01:13:34.370
<v Speaker 0>It's running.

01:13:45.915 --> 01:13:48.554
<v Speaker 0>But I'm not really able to

01:13:50.074 --> 01:13:51.354
<v Speaker 0>do anything.

01:13:51.355 --> 01:13:52.315
<v Speaker 0>So let's

01:13:52.715 --> 01:13:53.594
<v Speaker 0>try

01:13:53.675 --> 01:13:54.635
<v Speaker 0>getting a shell.

01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:09.940
<v Speaker 0>Let's see what happens. Let's see if gonna

01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:11.540
<v Speaker 0>time out from the database

01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:13.140
<v Speaker 0>or something else.

01:14:22.695 --> 01:14:25.094
<v Speaker 0>Failed to connect to the base. Okay. So,

01:14:25.575 --> 01:14:26.935
<v Speaker 0>alright, can it resolve?

01:14:31.770 --> 01:14:32.890
<v Speaker 0>No. Okay.

01:14:33.610 --> 01:14:34.330
<v Speaker 0>So

01:14:34.730 --> 01:14:37.290
<v Speaker 0>get pods all. Where's core DNS?

01:14:39.370 --> 01:14:40.330
<v Speaker 0>It is running.

01:14:50.405 --> 01:14:53.125
<v Speaker 0>Let's see if it is broken DNS

01:14:54.165 --> 01:14:55.045
<v Speaker 0>and everything.

01:15:11.025 --> 01:15:12.945
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if that's resolving.

01:15:15.745 --> 01:15:16.385
<v Speaker 0>No.

01:15:22.545 --> 01:15:23.985
<v Speaker 0>Okay. I have no networking.

01:15:24.619 --> 01:15:26.459
<v Speaker 0>So it's probably not DNS.

01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:28.459
<v Speaker 0>Never said that before

01:15:29.099 --> 01:15:31.179
<v Speaker 0>and possibly that I just can't

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:33.020
<v Speaker 0>create a DNS within the cluster.

01:15:38.095 --> 01:15:39.935
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Host is fine.

01:15:44.495 --> 01:15:46.335
<v Speaker 0>Selim appears to be okay.

01:15:58.610 --> 01:16:00.050
<v Speaker 0>I'm kinda running out of time because I

01:16:00.050 --> 01:16:01.650
<v Speaker 0>do have a hard stop, but I'll see

01:16:01.650 --> 01:16:02.770
<v Speaker 0>how far I can get through this.

01:16:04.275 --> 01:16:06.435
<v Speaker 0>If anybody made changes to this cluster and

01:16:06.435 --> 01:16:08.355
<v Speaker 0>you're still watching, drop a message in

01:16:08.675 --> 01:16:09.555
<v Speaker 0>the chat

01:16:09.715 --> 01:16:11.315
<v Speaker 0>and maybe we can speed this up a

01:16:11.315 --> 01:16:12.035
<v Speaker 0>little bit.

01:16:13.555 --> 01:16:14.355
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So

01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:25.190
<v Speaker 0>Wonder if someone just applied cluster policies

01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:28.310
<v Speaker 0>rather than modifying the config map. Because modifying

01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:30.550
<v Speaker 0>the config map would be a bit mean.

01:16:45.330 --> 01:16:46.130
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

01:16:57.315 --> 01:16:59.155
<v Speaker 0>See, sometimes you make it more difficult for

01:16:59.155 --> 01:17:01.635
<v Speaker 0>yourself by looking into like, oh, they could

01:17:01.635 --> 01:17:03.635
<v Speaker 0>have broken suddenly when it can just be

01:17:03.635 --> 01:17:04.515
<v Speaker 0>the really,

01:17:04.995 --> 01:17:06.275
<v Speaker 0>really, really simple things.

01:17:06.835 --> 01:17:08.675
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we've got some swag to give

01:17:08.675 --> 01:17:08.995
<v Speaker 0>away.

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.960
<v Speaker 0>And thank you to anyone who

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:15.880
<v Speaker 0>broke that cluster.

01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:19.080
<v Speaker 0>That was a nice easy one, which is

01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:19.880
<v Speaker 0>appreciated

01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:21.960
<v Speaker 0>after those two car crashes that we had.

01:17:25.195 --> 01:17:27.355
<v Speaker 0>And what do we need to do? Well,

01:17:27.355 --> 01:17:29.835
<v Speaker 0>we need to go to Rawkode Academy clustered

01:17:29.835 --> 01:17:30.555
<v Speaker 0>live.

01:17:30.875 --> 01:17:32.475
<v Speaker 0>So like I said, this repository is all

01:17:32.475 --> 01:17:33.195
<v Speaker 0>online.

01:17:35.035 --> 01:17:36.395
<v Speaker 0>We can run

01:17:36.555 --> 01:17:37.355
<v Speaker 0>chicken dinner.

01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:41.320
<v Speaker 0>And we'll see we have 19 participants in

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:42.599
<v Speaker 0>today's competition.

01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:45.000
<v Speaker 0>I can stop by the timer now. We

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.840
<v Speaker 0>don't need that. Right. There we go.

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:51.640
<v Speaker 0>And we have 10 winners. So thank you

01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:53.480
<v Speaker 0>to our sponsor Teleport

01:17:53.685 --> 01:17:55.125
<v Speaker 0>who are providing

01:17:56.005 --> 01:17:57.045
<v Speaker 0>10

01:17:57.045 --> 01:18:00.245
<v Speaker 0>copies of SIAM's CTS book,

01:18:00.885 --> 01:18:03.284
<v Speaker 0>and they are providing three vouchers

01:18:03.365 --> 01:18:04.485
<v Speaker 0>for swag.

01:18:06.070 --> 01:18:08.550
<v Speaker 0>I am also gonna be giving away three

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:11.030
<v Speaker 0>Rawkode t shirts. So in total, we are

01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:13.830
<v Speaker 0>looking for 16 winners today.

01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:15.910
<v Speaker 0>The way this is gonna work

01:18:16.150 --> 01:18:19.030
<v Speaker 0>is the script just doesn't, you know, it's

01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:19.270
<v Speaker 0>it's

01:18:21.474 --> 01:18:22.994
<v Speaker 0>I need to be able to run it

01:18:22.994 --> 01:18:25.315
<v Speaker 0>like so. It's just gonna spell 16 names.

01:18:25.315 --> 01:18:26.675
<v Speaker 0>So what I'm gonna say is the first

01:18:26.675 --> 01:18:28.754
<v Speaker 0>three names get the Rawkode t shirts.

01:18:29.474 --> 01:18:31.554
<v Speaker 0>The next three names will get the teleport

01:18:31.554 --> 01:18:31.954
<v Speaker 0>swag,

01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:35.580
<v Speaker 0>and the final 10 names will get the

01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:36.700
<v Speaker 0>CKS

01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:37.340
<v Speaker 0>book.

01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:40.620
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully, you all are happy with that. I

01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:43.740
<v Speaker 0>will make the code around this competition a

01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:45.660
<v Speaker 0>bit more sophisticated over the next days and

01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:47.180
<v Speaker 0>weeks, but it just needs a bit more

01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:49.155
<v Speaker 0>time. This is what I could put on

01:18:49.155 --> 01:18:50.034
<v Speaker 0>very quickly,

01:18:50.275 --> 01:18:51.715
<v Speaker 0>and I'm gonna go back to fighting the

01:18:51.715 --> 01:18:53.394
<v Speaker 0>Twitter API very soon.

01:18:54.835 --> 01:18:55.554
<v Speaker 0>So

01:18:55.875 --> 01:18:59.955
<v Speaker 0>Python three chicken dinner, 16 winners, please. Only

01:18:59.955 --> 01:19:01.990
<v Speaker 0>three if you're not gonna win. I'm I'm

01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:03.270
<v Speaker 0>really sorry about that,

01:19:03.670 --> 01:19:04.230
