00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.480
<v Speaker 0>Hello,

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.440
<v Speaker 0>and welcome back to the Rawkode Academy.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.840
<v Speaker 0>My name is David Flanagan, although you'll know

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.280
<v Speaker 0>me as Rawkode,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.520
<v Speaker 0>and there's a nice big articular area as

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.640
<v Speaker 0>I took this arm.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.235
<v Speaker 0>Thanks. This is custard. We have two great

00:01:40.235 --> 00:01:41.435
<v Speaker 0>teams today competing,

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:44.555
<v Speaker 0>trying to affect each other's sabotage and broken

00:01:44.555 --> 00:01:47.115
<v Speaker 0>cluster. Now, we get started with that, I

00:01:47.115 --> 00:01:49.354
<v Speaker 0>do just need to say hello and thanks

00:01:49.354 --> 00:01:50.395
<v Speaker 0>to our sponsors.

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.740
<v Speaker 0>So first up, we have Teleport. We've been

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.380
<v Speaker 0>using Teleport on clusters since the very beginning.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.659
<v Speaker 0>It's how we secure access to the servers.

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.740
<v Speaker 0>It's how we collaborate and pair on the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.635
<v Speaker 0>debug session and fixing these clusters. And it's

00:02:04.635 --> 00:02:06.955
<v Speaker 0>just an absolutely wonderful tool that I genuinely

00:02:06.955 --> 00:02:08.875
<v Speaker 0>believe every kind of Google cluster should have

00:02:08.875 --> 00:02:12.155
<v Speaker 0>installed. So go check it out. It's

00:02:14.075 --> 00:02:15.515
<v Speaker 0>just the best product. I'm so happy with

00:02:15.515 --> 00:02:17.730
<v Speaker 0>it. I also wanna thank Equinix Metal. I

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:18.849
<v Speaker 0>see all the comments in the chat. I'll

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:19.810
<v Speaker 0>get to use in a second.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.209
<v Speaker 0>I also wanna thank Equinix Metal. They provide

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.970
<v Speaker 0>all the hardware that we use on Clustered.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.330
<v Speaker 0>We go through six

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.970
<v Speaker 0>heavy duty bare metal machines every single week

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.290
<v Speaker 0>with tons of cores, tons of RAM. Why?

00:02:30.645 --> 00:02:32.885
<v Speaker 0>Well, because it makes it more fun. So

00:02:32.885 --> 00:02:34.485
<v Speaker 0>thank you to Equinix Medal.

00:02:35.365 --> 00:02:37.685
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's jump over to our first team

00:02:37.685 --> 00:02:39.605
<v Speaker 0>of the day. We have

00:02:39.765 --> 00:02:41.045
<v Speaker 0>team Kong.

00:02:41.125 --> 00:02:42.565

<v Speaker 1>Good. Good. Good. Alright. Well, thanks having us.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.750
<v Speaker 0>No. No. It's my pleasure. Definitely. And I've

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.350
<v Speaker 0>got alarms going off. Like, it this is

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.110
<v Speaker 0>just the challenge we've been in the middle

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.510
<v Speaker 0>of a random industrial estate. However, we'll we'll

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.245
<v Speaker 0>just ignore that. Could you please both say

00:02:57.245 --> 00:02:59.725
<v Speaker 0>hello, introduce yourselves, and then we'll get started

00:02:59.725 --> 00:03:01.005
<v Speaker 0>with today's session?

00:03:01.885 --> 00:03:03.885
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Sure. I'll go first. My name is

00:03:03.885 --> 00:03:05.645
<v Speaker 2>Kat Morgan. I am

00:03:05.965 --> 00:03:06.765
<v Speaker 2>with Kong.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.650
<v Speaker 2>Colin and I are both joining from Kong.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 2>I am in the Pacific Northwest US and

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.090
<v Speaker 2>happy to be here to see if I

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.329
<v Speaker 2>could actually live up to expectations

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:18.930
<v Speaker 2>trying to solve this cluster stuff.

00:03:19.695 --> 00:03:21.855
<v Speaker 2>It's madness. It's all madness.

00:03:22.095 --> 00:03:22.895
<v Speaker 2>Colin?

00:03:23.855 --> 00:03:25.935
<v Speaker 1>Thanks, Kat. Yeah. My name is Colin Loader.

00:03:25.935 --> 00:03:28.255
<v Speaker 1>As Kat said, we're both from Kong. We're

00:03:28.255 --> 00:03:30.655
<v Speaker 1>field engineers within Kong, so we

00:03:31.135 --> 00:03:32.815
<v Speaker 1>are kind of, like, in the professional services

00:03:32.815 --> 00:03:35.760
<v Speaker 1>side of things, help out customers with issues

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.880
<v Speaker 1>they have with Kong.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.400
<v Speaker 1>I came from both Red Hat and VMware,

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.720
<v Speaker 1>working more on the Kubernetes side. So been

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 1>in the Kubernetes

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.640
<v Speaker 1>work for the last few years. So, yeah,

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.400
<v Speaker 1>excited to see what the

00:03:49.125 --> 00:03:50.885
<v Speaker 1>what the the breaks that we have are

00:03:50.885 --> 00:03:52.405
<v Speaker 1>that we need to fix. It's gonna be

00:03:52.405 --> 00:03:55.205
<v Speaker 1>fun. Awesome. Thank you both for sharing. Well,

00:03:55.205 --> 00:03:57.205
<v Speaker 0>your cluster was broken by team ARMOR. They

00:03:57.205 --> 00:03:59.045
<v Speaker 0>will be joining us later to the cluster

00:03:59.045 --> 00:04:01.205
<v Speaker 0>that you have prepared for them. I am

00:04:01.205 --> 00:04:03.925
<v Speaker 0>going to pop up my screen share here,

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.240
<v Speaker 0>and I am going to give you access

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:09.600
<v Speaker 0>to the clusters.

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.880
<v Speaker 0>So I'm gonna audit a change or a

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.760
<v Speaker 0>common rule

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:21.565
<v Speaker 0>And now you have access.

00:04:21.725 --> 00:04:23.085
<v Speaker 0>Nice and simple.

00:04:23.245 --> 00:04:25.725
<v Speaker 0>So I will open the first session on

00:04:25.725 --> 00:04:28.445
<v Speaker 0>the armo control plane. If you could please

00:04:28.445 --> 00:04:30.525
<v Speaker 0>both use the activity page

00:04:30.925 --> 00:04:33.380
<v Speaker 0>and active sessions, join the one at the

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.740
<v Speaker 0>bottom. And if you could just do me

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.419
<v Speaker 0>a favor and type echo hello or anything

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:37.699
<v Speaker 0>so that I know you're in here and

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:39.540
<v Speaker 0>then we will get things underway.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.660
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:04:54.004 --> 00:04:55.764
<v Speaker 0>Like, we're flying already.

00:04:56.884 --> 00:04:58.965
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I wish you the best of luck.

00:04:59.044 --> 00:05:01.444
<v Speaker 0>I can encourage you to export your cube

00:05:01.444 --> 00:05:03.470
<v Speaker 0>config, set up any aliases that you need,

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.390
<v Speaker 0>and check for the control plane. Best of

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.950
<v Speaker 0>luck.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.910
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.590
<v Speaker 0>Straight into t mux.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.430
<v Speaker 0>No. I I'm gonna use that muscle memory

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.485
<v Speaker 2>and be mad if it's not there. So,

00:05:19.525 --> 00:05:21.044
<v Speaker 2>Colin, do you wanna drive first or you

00:05:21.044 --> 00:05:22.085
<v Speaker 2>want me to dive in?

00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:24.245
<v Speaker 1>Sure. Yeah. I can let me start some

00:05:24.245 --> 00:05:26.884
<v Speaker 1>stuff. Let me just add some completions and

00:05:26.884 --> 00:05:27.604
<v Speaker 1>whatnot first.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.980
<v Speaker 1>And

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.860
<v Speaker 1>if we get it, I also will mess

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.740
<v Speaker 1>up if I don't have that. Yep. And

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.860
<v Speaker 1>I think this is the right syntax.

00:05:45.615 --> 00:05:48.335
<v Speaker 1>Q t p l k, I believe.

00:05:49.055 --> 00:05:49.775
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:05:49.855 --> 00:05:50.895
<v Speaker 1>And then we can take.

00:05:52.175 --> 00:05:53.535
<v Speaker 0>I didn't know you could set up the

00:05:53.535 --> 00:05:55.615
<v Speaker 0>auto complete for the k. That's pretty cool.

00:05:56.895 --> 00:05:59.615
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. It's a lifesaver. Oh, it's admin.com.

00:05:59.615 --> 00:06:00.015
<v Speaker 1>It's not.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.660
<v Speaker 2>And also Kubernetes. Kubernetes.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.500
<v Speaker 1>So let's see, see what we have first.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.340
<v Speaker 2>Alright. K. Well, we have a lot of,

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.660
<v Speaker 1>a lot of restarts. That's always fun

00:06:17.285 --> 00:06:20.725
<v Speaker 1>for both the app and Postgres. Alright. What

00:06:20.725 --> 00:06:22.085
<v Speaker 1>do you wanna check first, Kat?

00:06:23.525 --> 00:06:25.845
<v Speaker 2>We can go ahead and check events in

00:06:25.845 --> 00:06:27.045
<v Speaker 2>the namespace if we want to.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.090
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Liveness probes. That's

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:36.210
<v Speaker 1>easy enough.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.570
<v Speaker 0>Ready That's that's a bold statement right off

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.730
<v Speaker 0>the back. Yeah. That's actually yeah. So I

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.250
<v Speaker 1>probably shouldn't say that. But

00:06:44.884 --> 00:06:47.044
<v Speaker 1>okay. So liveness and readiness.

00:06:47.685 --> 00:06:49.765
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna check the deployment.

00:06:53.445 --> 00:06:54.165
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.

00:06:54.645 --> 00:06:56.165
<v Speaker 1>Deployment.

00:06:58.245 --> 00:06:58.965
<v Speaker 1>Clustered.

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:06.650
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:11.210
<v Speaker 1>we have for liveness probe,

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.610
<v Speaker 1>slash health on eighty eighty.

00:07:17.555 --> 00:07:19.955
<v Speaker 1>Don't look bad to me, but

00:07:22.195 --> 00:07:23.795
<v Speaker 0>I believe they're okay.

00:07:24.435 --> 00:07:24.835
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.580
<v Speaker 1>Billing thresholds look okay.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.300
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Well, I do see something already.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's just the virus. CPU.

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:40.540
<v Speaker 1>I I don't like that.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:41.259
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:07:42.845 --> 00:07:44.685
<v Speaker 0>I mean, there's a rust application, but it

00:07:44.685 --> 00:07:47.005
<v Speaker 0>doesn't require a lot of resources.

00:07:47.005 --> 00:07:49.165
<v Speaker 0>So I'd say That's a lot of faith

00:07:49.165 --> 00:07:50.365
<v Speaker 2>in that application.

00:07:53.245 --> 00:07:55.885
<v Speaker 2>Alright. This Equinix metal better really hold up.

00:07:59.469 --> 00:08:00.190
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.229
<v Speaker 1>So let's start with getting rid of those.

00:08:06.349 --> 00:08:07.949
<v Speaker 2>Are you are you just gonna delete out

00:08:07.949 --> 00:08:08.830
<v Speaker 2>the limits?

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:10.189
<v Speaker 2>I sure

00:08:13.485 --> 00:08:15.885
<v Speaker 3>Who needs limits? Yeah. Who needs resource limits?

00:08:15.885 --> 00:08:17.085
<v Speaker 0>Just remove

00:08:17.085 --> 00:08:17.725
<v Speaker 0>them.

00:08:21.245 --> 00:08:22.205
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:08:22.285 --> 00:08:25.430
<v Speaker 1>So let's see what's what what that does.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Well,

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.710
<v Speaker 1>that's better ish. Seems happier. Yeah.

00:08:37.505 --> 00:08:39.424
<v Speaker 1>But we didn't see we didn't see anything

00:08:39.424 --> 00:08:40.225
<v Speaker 1>for the

00:08:42.225 --> 00:08:44.545
<v Speaker 2>Postgres pod on events.

00:08:45.345 --> 00:08:46.785
<v Speaker 2>I yeah. I didn't see it.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Because that's all on the cluster pod. Okay.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.120
<v Speaker 1>one thing we can check,

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.960
<v Speaker 1>what are these

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.040
<v Speaker 1>this is on Port 30000.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.465
<v Speaker 1>Right? Yes. Port. Okay.

00:09:08.425 --> 00:09:10.265
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Well, we can at least connect to

00:09:10.265 --> 00:09:12.665
<v Speaker 1>the app. Obviously, we know that database connection

00:09:12.665 --> 00:09:15.130
<v Speaker 1>is gonna be not good now since we're

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:17.210
<v Speaker 1>not check? Would you like me to open

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:18.490
<v Speaker 0>it? Just

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:21.610
<v Speaker 1>Sure. Yeah. Yeah. We can see the That'd

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:23.210
<v Speaker 2>be fine. The image.

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:28.010
<v Speaker 0>This is the RML cluster. Right?

00:09:30.535 --> 00:09:32.295
<v Speaker 2>Hey, Colin. Can I check and see what

00:09:32.295 --> 00:09:33.335
<v Speaker 2>pods the

00:09:33.495 --> 00:09:35.415
<v Speaker 2>or what nodes our pods are on? See

00:09:35.415 --> 00:09:37.255
<v Speaker 2>if they're on the same nodes or not?

00:09:37.975 --> 00:09:38.615
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Absolutely.

00:09:42.209 --> 00:09:43.570
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Connection

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:44.529
<v Speaker 0>with you.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.490
<v Speaker 2>They are on different nodes. Oh, wait. I

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:50.209
<v Speaker 2>don't know. We might

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That's that's something definitely to check.

00:09:57.615 --> 00:09:59.695
<v Speaker 1>So we can look at I assume this

00:09:59.695 --> 00:10:01.135
<v Speaker 1>is a deployment as well.

00:10:03.695 --> 00:10:06.255
<v Speaker 0>Postgres as a stateful state. Stateful state. Yeah.

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:16.460
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:17.900
<v Speaker 1>What is in here?

00:10:30.075 --> 00:10:32.795
<v Speaker 1>So I don't see a problem with the

00:10:32.795 --> 00:10:33.995
<v Speaker 1>health checks.

00:10:34.715 --> 00:10:35.355
<v Speaker 2>Not yet.

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:38.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Let's keep going.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:45.209
<v Speaker 2>Health.

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:46.810
<v Speaker 2>Let's

00:10:49.485 --> 00:10:51.965
<v Speaker 2>one thing we might check next is our

00:10:52.845 --> 00:10:55.645
<v Speaker 2>storage to see if there's a PVC available.

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:04.050
<v Speaker 1>Defaulting to this. I don't know. I didn't

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.450
<v Speaker 2>actually see So the one is being used.

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:09.570
<v Speaker 0>There's no CSI configured. No persistent volumes. I

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:11.330
<v Speaker 0>used it. That's right. That's right. Okay. It's

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.250
<v Speaker 0>an empty Dir Postgres.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:15.170
<v Speaker 2>Okay. Okay. Got it.

00:11:17.505 --> 00:11:20.305
<v Speaker 1>Maybe something else in here that is

00:11:22.065 --> 00:11:22.465
<v Speaker 1>off.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So I don't see anything here, so

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.210
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's not that. Can you

00:11:42.455 --> 00:11:42.935
<v Speaker 2>Can check

00:11:44.615 --> 00:11:46.055
<v Speaker 2>our actually,

00:11:46.295 --> 00:11:48.055
<v Speaker 2>I was just wondering if the image I

00:11:48.055 --> 00:11:49.735
<v Speaker 2>didn't check the spelling and stuff on the

00:11:49.735 --> 00:11:51.575
<v Speaker 2>image if that's there or not.

00:11:53.495 --> 00:11:55.175
<v Speaker 1>I I think it was okay. It looks

00:11:55.175 --> 00:11:56.855
<v Speaker 1>like it was just the Postgres

00:11:57.015 --> 00:11:57.655
<v Speaker 1>13.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.990
<v Speaker 1>13 outbound. That looks okay.

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Looks good. Think.

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:09.870
<v Speaker 0>No. No. That looks good. I assume that's

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:10.350
<v Speaker 1>the default.

00:12:14.145 --> 00:12:16.065
<v Speaker 1>I mean, we can see if there's any

00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:19.105
<v Speaker 1>doubt that this is gonna have any logs.

00:12:21.025 --> 00:12:23.425
<v Speaker 0>So the thing that you're debugging right now

00:12:23.585 --> 00:12:25.665
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I pulled up the page. So

00:12:25.665 --> 00:12:27.025
<v Speaker 0>just make sure you're working on the right

00:12:27.025 --> 00:12:27.745
<v Speaker 0>header here.

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.750
<v Speaker 1>Server connection timed out. I mean, I think

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.430
<v Speaker 1>we have to get past this since the

00:12:34.589 --> 00:12:36.029
<v Speaker 1>it it's not even started.

00:12:38.589 --> 00:12:38.910
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:12:42.135 --> 00:12:43.495
<v Speaker 1>But I guess if it is timing out,

00:12:43.495 --> 00:12:45.175
<v Speaker 1>that does point to a network issue as

00:12:45.175 --> 00:12:45.335
<v Speaker 1>well.

00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:59.590
<v Speaker 1>Kat, do you have any ideas or anything

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:00.630
<v Speaker 1>else you wanna check?

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:03.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Let me jump into

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:06.230
<v Speaker 0>So your post guys pod is crash lit

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:07.430
<v Speaker 0>back off. What does that mean?

00:13:12.235 --> 00:13:13.995
<v Speaker 1>Something's preventing it from starting.

00:13:14.315 --> 00:13:15.835
<v Speaker 0>Preventing it from starting?

00:13:16.475 --> 00:13:19.195
<v Speaker 2>Well, that that means it's not running or

00:13:19.195 --> 00:13:20.475
<v Speaker 2>it it's not

00:13:21.195 --> 00:13:23.820
<v Speaker 2>passing liveness. So But it was

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.780
<v Speaker 0>running and now it isn't. Maybe

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.300
<v Speaker 0>log?

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.860
<v Speaker 2>Actually, we might

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:31.500
<v Speaker 2>here.

00:13:36.425 --> 00:13:38.505
<v Speaker 2>So if we do that

00:13:45.785 --> 00:13:47.865
<v Speaker 0>Navin Kumar is saying, check the log.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.520
<v Speaker 2>Okay. So we should have

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.600
<v Speaker 0>You'd be surprised how often that actually fix

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.520
<v Speaker 0>these things on clustered. Just delete them.

00:14:07.095 --> 00:14:08.535
<v Speaker 0>Usually quite effective.

00:14:11.654 --> 00:14:13.175
<v Speaker 1>Can can we look at the logs cap

00:14:13.175 --> 00:14:14.775
<v Speaker 1>for that? Yeah.

00:14:15.334 --> 00:14:16.615
<v Speaker 2>Hang on. I

00:14:17.334 --> 00:14:19.415
<v Speaker 2>think I've been relying a little too much

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:20.970
<v Speaker 2>on Lens lately,

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.209
<v Speaker 2>and my cuddle is a little rusty for

00:14:23.209 --> 00:14:24.010
<v Speaker 2>debugging.

00:14:27.529 --> 00:14:30.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Bad in its script. That's interesting.

00:14:32.635 --> 00:14:33.915
<v Speaker 2>We could check that.

00:14:35.195 --> 00:14:37.435
<v Speaker 2>There's no. They wouldn't have changed because we

00:14:37.435 --> 00:14:39.035
<v Speaker 2>don't have persistent.

00:14:41.835 --> 00:14:43.675
<v Speaker 2>The command could have been

00:14:45.515 --> 00:14:46.795
<v Speaker 2>edited by chance.

00:14:47.435 --> 00:14:49.890
<v Speaker 0>So the way the Postgres works on custard

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:52.290
<v Speaker 0>is there is

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.970
<v Speaker 0>conflict map mounted into the container,

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:57.970
<v Speaker 0>which is put into a special There is

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:00.770
<v Speaker 2>a conflict map. That Postgres will load.

00:15:29.145 --> 00:15:30.905
<v Speaker 1>Is it as easy as getting rid of

00:15:30.905 --> 00:15:31.545
<v Speaker 1>the

00:15:31.785 --> 00:15:33.225
<v Speaker 1>echo and the exit?

00:15:37.465 --> 00:15:38.185
<v Speaker 0>I mean,

00:15:38.665 --> 00:15:40.345
<v Speaker 0>those look suspicious. Right?

00:15:40.665 --> 00:15:41.865
<v Speaker 2>They do to me.

00:15:42.665 --> 00:15:43.065
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:46.350
<v Speaker 2>Oh, well, yeah, there's no test unit test

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:46.750
<v Speaker 2>on them.

00:16:04.695 --> 00:16:06.855
<v Speaker 1>Alright. It's looking a little better if it

00:16:06.855 --> 00:16:07.655
<v Speaker 1>comes up.

00:16:10.055 --> 00:16:11.575
<v Speaker 0>Well, that's two weeks in a row we've

00:16:11.575 --> 00:16:13.860
<v Speaker 0>had people attack pull squares, which is the

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:16.180
<v Speaker 0>first two times we've ever had anyone attack

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.060
<v Speaker 0>Postgres,

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.540
<v Speaker 0>believe it or not. It's getting popular then.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:20.980
<v Speaker 2>Alright. So

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.060
<v Speaker 1>David, do you mind checking to see if

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.540
<v Speaker 1>it's at least connecting to the database now?

00:16:26.395 --> 00:16:28.235
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it is on the curl,

00:16:28.235 --> 00:16:30.795
<v Speaker 1>but okay. So it looks good. You've got

00:16:30.795 --> 00:16:32.875
<v Speaker 0>the the watch tab. So yeah.

00:16:33.435 --> 00:16:34.555
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So

00:16:35.035 --> 00:16:35.915
<v Speaker 1>let's

00:16:36.795 --> 00:16:39.755
<v Speaker 1>go for editing the deployment then for cluster

00:16:39.755 --> 00:16:41.399
<v Speaker 1>then just change it to v two. I

00:16:41.399 --> 00:16:43.480
<v Speaker 1>assume it's not gonna be that easy, but

00:16:44.279 --> 00:16:45.399
<v Speaker 1>try it.

00:16:51.399 --> 00:16:52.120
<v Speaker 1>Oops. Sorry.

00:16:54.005 --> 00:16:55.125
<v Speaker 2>Oh, you're good.

00:16:59.285 --> 00:17:01.365
<v Speaker 2>And it should be seconds ago.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.020
<v Speaker 1>It's does that doesn't look good to me.

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:11.980
<v Speaker 0>It's still watch tap.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.300
<v Speaker 0>So v one. The curl will show you

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.220
<v Speaker 0>the file name and the title.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:19.980
<v Speaker 0>Yep. V one and v one. So yes.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So let's take a look at that

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:22.300
<v Speaker 1>pod and

00:17:23.474 --> 00:17:24.755
<v Speaker 1>just verify that it is

00:17:26.194 --> 00:17:27.875
<v Speaker 1>if it's changing it back to v one

00:17:27.875 --> 00:17:28.595
<v Speaker 1>or

00:17:28.675 --> 00:17:29.955
<v Speaker 1>if we have bigger problems.

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So just changing it back to v

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:41.499
<v Speaker 1>one.

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:50.380
<v Speaker 1>But it's v two That one's fine.

00:17:51.095 --> 00:17:52.215
<v Speaker 1>So that

00:17:53.095 --> 00:17:54.615
<v Speaker 1>feels like it's

00:18:00.695 --> 00:18:02.615
<v Speaker 1>does that seem like a mutation to you?

00:18:02.615 --> 00:18:03.815
<v Speaker 1>Can we check that?

00:18:05.015 --> 00:18:05.815
<v Speaker 2>Go for it.

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the CRD name is.

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.220
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Carlos in the chat. It's not a

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.780
<v Speaker 1>CRD, but The mutation webhook.

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.900
<v Speaker 0>It's a mutating webhook

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.660
<v Speaker 0>configuration. Mutating webhook?

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:21.180
<v Speaker 0>Oh, there it is. Okay.

00:18:22.255 --> 00:18:24.255
<v Speaker 1>There's a Cilium one.

00:18:30.095 --> 00:18:31.135
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what's in there.

00:18:48.745 --> 00:18:50.184
<v Speaker 1>Failure policy.

00:18:50.265 --> 00:18:50.745
<v Speaker 1>I

00:18:55.065 --> 00:18:56.424
<v Speaker 2>Is that the whole thing?

00:18:59.225 --> 00:19:01.225
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I think so. That's all I see.

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:08.030
<v Speaker 0>What are you thinking?

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:11.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't know for sure. I would say

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:13.870
<v Speaker 1>that that's probably not real.

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:15.070
<v Speaker 0>But it's called Solium.

00:19:18.485 --> 00:19:19.924
<v Speaker 0>You think they have a sneaker n as

00:19:19.924 --> 00:19:20.965
<v Speaker 0>their real name?

00:19:21.365 --> 00:19:22.085
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

00:19:28.565 --> 00:19:30.405
<v Speaker 1>Oh, we haven't, like, been looked at labels

00:19:30.405 --> 00:19:30.725
<v Speaker 1>yet.

00:19:38.539 --> 00:19:40.220
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So you don't think the web hook

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:41.739
<v Speaker 0>is real. What's your options?

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:44.940
<v Speaker 0>Delete it and break the cluster more.

00:19:45.805 --> 00:19:47.164
<v Speaker 0>Investigate it.

00:19:47.485 --> 00:19:49.885
<v Speaker 2>I'm

00:19:49.885 --> 00:19:50.445
<v Speaker 2>wondering

00:19:50.765 --> 00:19:51.404
<v Speaker 2>so

00:19:51.565 --> 00:19:52.525
<v Speaker 2>I know that

00:19:54.285 --> 00:19:55.804
<v Speaker 2>I know that in

00:19:57.565 --> 00:19:58.605
<v Speaker 2>registries.com,

00:19:58.605 --> 00:20:00.445
<v Speaker 2>if you can create aliases and things like

00:20:00.445 --> 00:20:00.685
<v Speaker 2>that,

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:04.930
<v Speaker 2>That would be on the worker nodes themselves

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:06.690
<v Speaker 2>if we were doing that, though.

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:11.010
<v Speaker 0>What do you think the aliases are doing?

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:11.570
<v Speaker 4>Go back to.

00:20:14.465 --> 00:20:15.665
<v Speaker 2>What's that, Colin?

00:20:16.145 --> 00:20:17.745
<v Speaker 2>I kinda wanna go back to the to

00:20:17.745 --> 00:20:19.585
<v Speaker 1>that webhook, though, because I I mean, I

00:20:19.585 --> 00:20:20.385
<v Speaker 1>don't know

00:20:20.945 --> 00:20:22.465
<v Speaker 1>I don't work with these a lot, so

00:20:22.465 --> 00:20:24.865
<v Speaker 1>I I don't know for sure. But, like,

00:20:24.865 --> 00:20:26.465
<v Speaker 1>I don't like this URL thing. I kinda

00:20:26.465 --> 00:20:27.825
<v Speaker 1>wanna see what's what's there.

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:29.710
<v Speaker 0>Curl it.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:38.190
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:20:40.429 --> 00:20:42.669
<v Speaker 1>Not allowed for this. Okay.

00:20:54.765 --> 00:20:55.645
<v Speaker 0>Python.

00:20:55.645 --> 00:20:57.805
<v Speaker 0>Oh, okay. Python application

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:01.020
<v Speaker 0>and root stuff Kubernetes webhook example.

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.820
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I I don't feel like this is

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.740
<v Speaker 1>good, like, a real thing. So

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:06.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm just leaning towards deleting that webhook, to

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:10.060
<v Speaker 1>be honest.

00:21:10.905 --> 00:21:13.705
<v Speaker 0>Go for it. I encourage it. We can

00:21:13.705 --> 00:21:15.785
<v Speaker 2>we can we can save it off if

00:21:15.785 --> 00:21:17.625
<v Speaker 2>we wanted to first. But, yeah, if we

00:21:17.625 --> 00:21:19.305
<v Speaker 2>would just wanna live crazy,

00:21:19.305 --> 00:21:20.985
<v Speaker 2>let's go for let's delete it.

00:21:21.945 --> 00:21:24.410
<v Speaker 1>I guess so. I'm happy to confirm that.

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:26.010
<v Speaker 0>I don't think n as in Cilium is

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:27.530
<v Speaker 0>written in Python. So

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:30.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That seems weird to me. That's true.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:33.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay. I'm deleting this.

00:21:38.995 --> 00:21:40.995
<v Speaker 2>Alright. Do we want us to smash

00:21:40.995 --> 00:21:43.075
<v Speaker 2>our pod again, or do we need to

00:21:43.715 --> 00:21:44.674
<v Speaker 2>I don't yeah.

00:21:44.995 --> 00:21:47.235
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I'm gonna delete that and have it

00:21:47.235 --> 00:21:48.595
<v Speaker 1>pull a new one and see if the

00:21:48.595 --> 00:21:49.794
<v Speaker 1>image has changed.

00:21:50.755 --> 00:21:53.980
<v Speaker 2>We need to flip the cluster d pod,

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.580
<v Speaker 2>not the post cross pod.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:59.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh, yeah. Right. Sorry.

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:01.419
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.700
<v Speaker 0>Just delete all. Delete dash dash all. I

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:04.940
<v Speaker 0>mean,

00:22:07.164 --> 00:22:08.684
<v Speaker 0>what bad thing ever happened from deleting all

00:22:08.684 --> 00:22:10.044
<v Speaker 0>the parts in our namespace?

00:22:18.044 --> 00:22:18.765
<v Speaker 0>Now.

00:22:20.669 --> 00:22:22.109
<v Speaker 1>David, do you mind checking

00:22:22.509 --> 00:22:24.029
<v Speaker 0>Happy tip. The browser.

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:29.789
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Alright. That's not a good sign.

00:22:30.269 --> 00:22:31.629
<v Speaker 0>That's funny, though.

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:33.070
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.

00:22:36.565 --> 00:22:38.804
<v Speaker 0>Nice work, team Arvo. Nice work.

00:22:40.085 --> 00:22:42.165
<v Speaker 0>Very well done. Makes me think that

00:22:42.565 --> 00:22:44.485
<v Speaker 1>it is messing with the

00:22:45.285 --> 00:22:46.965
<v Speaker 1>container d. The image.

00:22:47.605 --> 00:22:50.965
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. So because it's the correct well, sensibly,

00:22:50.965 --> 00:22:52.220
<v Speaker 1>it's the correct URL

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.340
<v Speaker 1>to the image.

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:57.500
<v Speaker 2>So we can go ahead and jump over

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:58.140
<v Speaker 2>to

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.860
<v Speaker 2>the worker node that that's scheduled on

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:04.860
<v Speaker 2>Yep. And jump into our registries.com

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:05.660
<v Speaker 2>for starters.

00:23:07.185 --> 00:23:09.585
<v Speaker 1>So they're both on worker two.

00:23:10.465 --> 00:23:11.265
<v Speaker 1>K.

00:23:11.825 --> 00:23:13.505
<v Speaker 1>David, do you mind creating a session for

00:23:13.505 --> 00:23:14.625
<v Speaker 0>worker two?

00:23:15.985 --> 00:23:16.945
<v Speaker 0>Armour

00:23:17.185 --> 00:23:17.585
<v Speaker 0>worker.

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:24.349
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:32.990
<v Speaker 1>I

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:34.830
<v Speaker 1>do not remember where that lives. Is it

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:35.950
<v Speaker 1>let's see.

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:38.269
<v Speaker 2>No. I think I can find it.

00:23:38.875 --> 00:23:40.315
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Go for it.

00:23:48.635 --> 00:23:51.355
<v Speaker 0>Oh, snap. The ARMOR team are laughing in

00:23:51.355 --> 00:23:53.034
<v Speaker 0>the chat. It's just FYI.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.600
<v Speaker 2>Alright. That's fine. Well, actually, there is a

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.000
<v Speaker 1>good point. Local image which is used. I

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.279
<v Speaker 1>didn't check to see what the Wait. Policy

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.320
<v Speaker 1>was. But

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh, shush. That's

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:08.440
<v Speaker 2>a good

00:24:09.495 --> 00:24:10.135
<v Speaker 1>call.

00:24:10.775 --> 00:24:12.375
<v Speaker 1>We could just change it to always just

00:24:12.375 --> 00:24:13.335
<v Speaker 1>to be safe.

00:24:14.055 --> 00:24:14.934
<v Speaker 1>Do what?

00:24:16.055 --> 00:24:17.655
<v Speaker 1>We could change the image pool policy to

00:24:17.655 --> 00:24:19.255
<v Speaker 1>always just to be safe, make sure it's

00:24:19.255 --> 00:24:21.735
<v Speaker 1>not using a local I believe it was

00:24:21.735 --> 00:24:23.679
<v Speaker 0>always the last time you edit Oh, was

00:24:23.679 --> 00:24:25.119
<v Speaker 0>deployment at least.

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:26.399
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:24:27.759 --> 00:24:30.000
<v Speaker 0>You can check, but I'm I'm pretty confident

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:30.720
<v Speaker 0>I did see it.

00:24:41.985 --> 00:24:42.625
<v Speaker 1>This is

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Okay.

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Okay. So, yeah, we'll need to

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.640
<v Speaker 1>probably look at the history. In that case,

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to

00:24:59.360 --> 00:24:59.840
<v Speaker 2>or

00:25:05.075 --> 00:25:07.154
<v Speaker 2>because we're not running see, I'm coming from,

00:25:07.154 --> 00:25:09.874
<v Speaker 2>like, OpenShift mindset where there's, like, an image

00:25:10.355 --> 00:25:12.034
<v Speaker 2>stream policy stream

00:25:12.195 --> 00:25:13.075
<v Speaker 2>craziness,

00:25:13.154 --> 00:25:14.835
<v Speaker 2>but this is not OpenShift.

00:25:14.835 --> 00:25:15.154
<v Speaker 2>So

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:21.850
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't getting yeah. So

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:25.050
<v Speaker 2>there should be a registries.com,

00:25:31.304 --> 00:25:32.985
<v Speaker 2>But it's not where I was thinking to

00:25:32.985 --> 00:25:35.225
<v Speaker 2>find it. I think that may be an

00:25:35.225 --> 00:25:36.825
<v Speaker 0>OpenShift centric thing. What

00:25:38.505 --> 00:25:39.544
<v Speaker 0>does Redshift.com

00:25:39.544 --> 00:25:41.144
<v Speaker 0>do with OpenShift? And I'll see if I

00:25:41.144 --> 00:25:42.505
<v Speaker 0>can correlate it back to Cube admin.

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:44.610
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:45.170
<v Speaker 2>So

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:49.650
<v Speaker 2>well, on I know on cryo that registries.conf

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:52.610
<v Speaker 2>gives you

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:57.090
<v Speaker 2>the ability to, like, set insecure registries and

00:25:57.135 --> 00:25:59.135
<v Speaker 2>but maybe it's in container d Yeah. But

00:25:59.135 --> 00:26:01.615
<v Speaker 2>I'm not finding any container directory.

00:26:02.255 --> 00:26:04.495
<v Speaker 2>No Etsy container directory.

00:26:04.815 --> 00:26:06.575
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So container d does allow you to

00:26:06.575 --> 00:26:07.455
<v Speaker 0>dump its config,

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.400
<v Speaker 0>which would show you if there were any

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.399
<v Speaker 0>aliases in that regard.

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.120
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:26:16.679 --> 00:26:18.679
<v Speaker 0>So I can't remember the exact So tag.

00:26:18.679 --> 00:26:21.320
<v Speaker 0>But I think it's container. Learn container d?

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.160
<v Speaker 0>If you run container d dash dash help,

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.520
<v Speaker 0>it should give you what you needed.

00:26:28.715 --> 00:26:31.515
<v Speaker 0>But there's a, yeah, config dump as Okay.

00:26:33.355 --> 00:26:35.435
<v Speaker 2>That's the container d as a default.

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:41.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Yeah. Because, likely, they haven't configured container

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:42.390
<v Speaker 0>d in that way.

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:50.230
<v Speaker 2>Oh, wait. It's just config. Yes. Update. Config.

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:26:53.025 --> 00:26:54.065
<v Speaker 0>And then dump.

00:27:04.705 --> 00:27:06.545
<v Speaker 0>So that filter with TOML means they have

00:27:06.545 --> 00:27:08.850
<v Speaker 0>not tweaked container d in any way with

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:12.610
<v Speaker 0>fake registry. So it's just running normal. Okay.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:12.930
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:27:20.155 --> 00:27:22.635
<v Speaker 0>So if they're not pulling a fake image

00:27:22.715 --> 00:27:23.755
<v Speaker 0>in place,

00:27:25.515 --> 00:27:26.875
<v Speaker 0>what other options out there?

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. That wouldn't have worked any I don't

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.639
<v Speaker 2>know. Why don't you confirm something? Can you

00:27:44.639 --> 00:27:47.120
<v Speaker 0>exec into the cluster pod and curl local

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:47.360
<v Speaker 0>host?

00:27:49.255 --> 00:27:49.895
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:27:51.655 --> 00:27:53.895
<v Speaker 2>Oh, sorry. Colin, go for it. Oh, sorry.

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:04.629
<v Speaker 2>Do you jump into the other container?

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:08.070
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. You need to jump into the cluster

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:09.509
<v Speaker 0>pod, which does have,

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.509
<v Speaker 0>I believe, s h available.

00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:12.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh, okay.

00:28:17.455 --> 00:28:18.975
<v Speaker 0>I don't think it's slash s h, so

00:28:18.975 --> 00:28:20.575
<v Speaker 0>we'll just try. And

00:28:23.295 --> 00:28:24.575
<v Speaker 0>Carl should be there.

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:32.409
<v Speaker 0>8080?

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:33.289
<v Speaker 2>80.

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:37.929
<v Speaker 0>Oh, what we see here is video v

00:28:37.929 --> 00:28:38.649
<v Speaker 0>two. Yeah.

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:40.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:43.529
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:45.850
<v Speaker 1>so

00:28:49.125 --> 00:28:50.565
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what can

00:28:51.125 --> 00:28:53.365
<v Speaker 0>The pod looks alright. Oh, unless it's

00:28:54.805 --> 00:28:56.885
<v Speaker 0>But if I if we browse to DNS.

00:28:57.765 --> 00:28:58.405
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:28:59.045 --> 00:28:59.685
<v Speaker 0>We get that.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.120
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute. You

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:06.440
<v Speaker 2>is it

00:29:22.235 --> 00:29:22.875
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:29:24.155 --> 00:29:26.659
<v Speaker 0>The image is fine. The pod workload is

00:29:26.659 --> 00:29:28.980
<v Speaker 0>fine. A curl to that IP address on

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:30.580
<v Speaker 0>that port is not fine.

00:29:37.059 --> 00:29:39.220
<v Speaker 0>So the cluster service runs as a node

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:40.980
<v Speaker 0>port on port 30,000.

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:42.100
<v Speaker 0>I would maybe start there.

00:29:50.554 --> 00:29:53.514
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Like, is my service still configured correctly?

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:02.370
<v Speaker 0>I guess you're in the control plane. Yeah.

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:05.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. That's alright. I'll keep

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:05.570
<v Speaker 0>up.

00:30:23.385 --> 00:30:24.185
<v Speaker 0>Looks alright.

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:32.750
<v Speaker 1>So how else would it be sending traffic

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:33.789
<v Speaker 1>somewhere else?

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:38.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm sitting here thinking of all the ways

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:39.710
<v Speaker 2>that, like,

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:42.030
<v Speaker 2>an ingress controller could do all of this

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:44.765
<v Speaker 2>stuff, but, obviously, we don't have that in

00:30:44.765 --> 00:30:45.405
<v Speaker 2>play.

00:30:49.485 --> 00:30:51.085
<v Speaker 1>So we haven't looked to see we've only

00:30:51.085 --> 00:30:52.845
<v Speaker 1>looked at the default workspace. We haven't actually

00:30:52.845 --> 00:30:54.285
<v Speaker 1>seen what else is

00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:57.370
<v Speaker 1>running in other places. Fair. Well, we could

00:30:57.370 --> 00:30:59.049
<v Speaker 2>check, yeah, other services.

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:02.649
<v Speaker 0>There are heads as well if required.

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:08.570
<v Speaker 1>Is it just me or is the TMUX

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:11.045
<v Speaker 1>very small? Yeah. I just had to kinda

00:31:11.045 --> 00:31:13.765
<v Speaker 0>jump around. I think the TMUX is causing

00:31:13.765 --> 00:31:16.245
<v Speaker 0>some dying. Issues. Oh, if you resize your

00:31:16.245 --> 00:31:18.405
<v Speaker 2>window just a little bit, it'll refresh the

00:31:18.405 --> 00:31:20.164
<v Speaker 2>the TMUX frame. Okay.

00:31:23.045 --> 00:31:25.765
<v Speaker 2>So we're gonna do

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:32.220
<v Speaker 2>is there anything else?

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:37.900
<v Speaker 2>No.

00:31:41.345 --> 00:31:42.304
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.159
<v Speaker 0>So I think that hint is for the

00:31:58.159 --> 00:31:59.039
<v Speaker 0>webhook.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.799
<v Speaker 0>Maybe it should be a hint one or

00:32:00.799 --> 00:32:01.839
<v Speaker 0>two. Yeah.

00:32:02.639 --> 00:32:04.959
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I think each one's referencing a different

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:06.799
<v Speaker 1>thing, but

00:32:08.125 --> 00:32:10.125
<v Speaker 1>so labeling things is not nice. We haven't

00:32:10.125 --> 00:32:13.004
<v Speaker 1>done anything with labels yet, but no.

00:32:15.885 --> 00:32:18.124
<v Speaker 0>I think number one is the

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:20.860
<v Speaker 0>yeah. Don't know.

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:23.900
<v Speaker 0>Those are those are very subtle hints. They're

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.580
<v Speaker 0>correct when they said that. Right? So

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:29.660
<v Speaker 2>It's one thing to live and other things

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:30.220
<v Speaker 2>to answer.

00:32:32.305 --> 00:32:35.105
<v Speaker 0>Oh, okay. So hence one is subtle hints,

00:32:35.105 --> 00:32:37.025
<v Speaker 0>but for this four different problems.

00:32:37.585 --> 00:32:40.145
<v Speaker 2>Right. So okay. Each one

00:32:41.265 --> 00:32:44.065
<v Speaker 2>Okay. And then each. So it's a yeah.

00:32:44.065 --> 00:32:45.185
<v Speaker 2>A series of

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.279
<v Speaker 2>related hints.

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:49.440
<v Speaker 0>So those two middle ones seem relevant. Who

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.120
<v Speaker 0>owns has the right to answer, and it's

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:53.039
<v Speaker 0>one thing to live and another to answer.

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.879
<v Speaker 0>So our pod is alive

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.880
<v Speaker 0>and running, and we verified it, but it's

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:57.840
<v Speaker 0>not answering

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.080
<v Speaker 0>the HTTP request.

00:33:01.115 --> 00:33:02.794
<v Speaker 1>So I think that one had to do

00:33:02.794 --> 00:33:05.115
<v Speaker 1>with the the limits that were set because

00:33:05.115 --> 00:33:06.394
<v Speaker 1>that's the the same

00:33:07.914 --> 00:33:09.754
<v Speaker 1>number in each of those. It's like the

00:33:09.835 --> 00:33:11.674
<v Speaker 1>it is tight here. I can't remember. That

00:33:11.674 --> 00:33:12.794
<v Speaker 1>has to do with the limits. So I

00:33:12.794 --> 00:33:14.315
<v Speaker 1>think that one's it, but it's the second

00:33:14.315 --> 00:33:15.115
<v Speaker 1>one that we need.

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:17.900
<v Speaker 1>So everything has to do with Kates.

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:20.700
<v Speaker 1>Python Python is everywhere.

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:24.380
<v Speaker 0>Oh, not everything has to do with Kubernetes.

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:24.540
<v Speaker 0>But

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:26.700
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:33:31.365 --> 00:33:32.565
<v Speaker 0>So how does

00:33:32.645 --> 00:33:35.285
<v Speaker 0>node port work? If we're seeing that any

00:33:35.285 --> 00:33:37.205
<v Speaker 0>request to this IP address Oh. For that

00:33:37.205 --> 00:33:39.765
<v Speaker 0>port gets re registered to the service. We

00:33:39.765 --> 00:33:40.085
<v Speaker 2>could

00:33:40.965 --> 00:33:42.565
<v Speaker 2>well, the pod wouldn't

00:33:42.804 --> 00:33:44.885
<v Speaker 2>start if something else was listening on that

00:33:44.885 --> 00:33:46.885
<v Speaker 2>port that was not in Kubernetes.

00:33:47.149 --> 00:33:49.710
<v Speaker 0>Well, the pod isn't exposing a high port

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:50.509
<v Speaker 0>number.

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:54.109
<v Speaker 0>I think you're onto something there. K.

00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:57.309
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:33:58.509 --> 00:34:00.750
<v Speaker 1>Can see what else is running. Alright. I'm

00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:01.870
<v Speaker 2>on the worker.

00:34:05.335 --> 00:34:07.095
<v Speaker 0>Oh, next steps coming up.

00:34:07.335 --> 00:34:07.975
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:34:12.135 --> 00:34:13.895
<v Speaker 0>No. 830000

00:34:13.895 --> 00:34:15.735
<v Speaker 0>is the port we're worried about just now.

00:34:15.735 --> 00:34:16.855
<v Speaker 2>That's right. Sorry.

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:22.910
<v Speaker 0>More Python. Okay.

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:29.310
<v Speaker 1>I'd say it's probably pretty safe to kill

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:30.190
<v Speaker 1>that process.

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:31.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:34:37.304 --> 00:34:38.105
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:34:41.704 --> 00:34:43.704
<v Speaker 0>Straight in with a sick kill.

00:34:46.505 --> 00:34:47.704
<v Speaker 0>Hope it's not supervised.

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:55.770
<v Speaker 2>Alright. How's our

00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:58.410
<v Speaker 2>service looking now? Have a look.

00:35:02.155 --> 00:35:03.435
<v Speaker 1>You got the dance.

00:35:03.675 --> 00:35:05.195
<v Speaker 1>Much better. There we go.

00:35:05.515 --> 00:35:06.315

<v Speaker 0>That was that was really good. What I'm

00:35:19.079 --> 00:35:20.839
<v Speaker 0>curious about is do you think you have

00:35:20.839 --> 00:35:22.200

<v Speaker 0>Thank you. Thank you for joining us. I

00:37:03.305 --> 00:37:05.225
<v Speaker 0>think we're just waiting on one more.

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.920
<v Speaker 0>And then we'll start the introductions, get you

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.640
<v Speaker 0>access to the Kong Cluster,

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.720
<v Speaker 0>and then we'll see how that goes.

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.120
<v Speaker 0>Are you impressed with Team Kong?

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.320
<v Speaker 3>They did a great job. Very nice.

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:20.960
<v Speaker 4>Wow.

00:37:21.365 --> 00:37:22.965
<v Speaker 4>Wow. That was awesome.

00:37:24.964 --> 00:37:27.365
<v Speaker 4>Okay. So there is a problem with login.

00:37:27.365 --> 00:37:30.325
<v Speaker 4>Wait a second. I haven't given you access

00:37:30.484 --> 00:37:32.405
<v Speaker 0>yet. Wait a second for

00:37:34.405 --> 00:37:36.085
<v Speaker 4>let's check her check with her.

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:38.099
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. She said

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:40.740
<v Speaker 3>she's she's saying she has problems with login.

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:41.380
<v Speaker 4>Wait

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:44.900
<v Speaker 4>a second. I think that she's using the

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:45.700
<v Speaker 4>not the right

00:37:46.339 --> 00:37:47.140
<v Speaker 4>link.

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:47.779
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:38:00.555 --> 00:38:02.955
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, while we wait, I will just

00:38:02.955 --> 00:38:05.115
<v Speaker 0>enable access to

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:09.350
<v Speaker 0>the cluster. So I'm gonna edit the role

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:12.230
<v Speaker 0>for team armo.

00:38:22.425 --> 00:38:25.225
<v Speaker 4>Okay. Rawkode is moving to to different

00:38:26.025 --> 00:38:26.825
<v Speaker 4>machine.

00:38:26.825 --> 00:38:28.585
<v Speaker 4>She's going to be with us within a

00:38:28.585 --> 00:38:30.984
<v Speaker 4>few Yeah. No worries. Seconds. We're all good

00:38:30.984 --> 00:38:31.224
<v Speaker 0>here.

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:35.740
<v Speaker 0>Oh, we're trying to calm control plan one.

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:38.619
<v Speaker 0>So I have opened a session. If you

00:38:38.619 --> 00:38:41.340
<v Speaker 0>all just want to use activity active sessions

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:43.340
<v Speaker 0>and join, type echo hello to let me

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:44.865
<v Speaker 0>know that you're there. And then when we

00:38:44.865 --> 00:38:46.145
<v Speaker 0>have a full team, we will get the

00:38:46.145 --> 00:38:47.745
<v Speaker 0>introductions underway.

00:38:48.465 --> 00:38:49.425
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

00:38:50.225 --> 00:38:52.225
<v Speaker 4>So this is the last one. Right?

00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:58.450
<v Speaker 3>Which one is it?

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:01.010
<v Speaker 3>Control plane one. So you go to the

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:02.370
<v Speaker 0>very bottom of the list.

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:06.530
<v Speaker 0>So activity,

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:08.690
<v Speaker 0>active sessions, and then at the very bottom,

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:11.410
<v Speaker 0>you will see a con control plane one

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:11.810
<v Speaker 0>session.

00:39:15.925 --> 00:39:16.645
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:39:25.445 --> 00:39:27.205
<v Speaker 0>And I will join it too.

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.760
<v Speaker 0>Because sometimes VEM looks a bit weird on

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:32.560
<v Speaker 0>the CLI.

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:15.645
<v Speaker 4>the cube config. Oh, we need to export

00:44:15.645 --> 00:44:16.925
<v Speaker 3>the kube config. You

00:44:18.205 --> 00:44:20.285

<v Speaker 4>just write

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:32.710
<v Speaker 0>You can just run the alias command to

00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:35.590

<v Speaker 0>at least?

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:32.540
<v Speaker 3>Mhmm. Oh, okay. Here we go. Oh, this

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.700
<v Speaker 3>also explains the auto complete.

00:46:35.135 --> 00:46:36.735
<v Speaker 0>It it does did.

00:46:36.815 --> 00:46:37.694
<v Speaker 4>No.

00:46:37.694 --> 00:46:39.135
<v Speaker 4>It's it's still not

00:46:39.295 --> 00:46:41.775
<v Speaker 4>it it's still not Let's try where is

00:46:41.775 --> 00:46:43.855
<v Speaker 3>keeps keep CTL. Wait

00:46:44.815 --> 00:46:46.974
<v Speaker 4>a second. Let me there's shrinking.

00:46:48.039 --> 00:46:49.880
<v Speaker 4>No.

00:46:56.599 --> 00:46:58.359
<v Speaker 4>That that it's still not the one.

00:46:58.599 --> 00:46:59.160
<v Speaker 4>So,

00:46:59.799 --> 00:47:01.880
<v Speaker 4>yeah, it's usually

00:47:02.495 --> 00:47:03.535
<v Speaker 3>Let's try.

00:47:04.575 --> 00:47:05.535
<v Speaker 4>Echo.

00:47:05.535 --> 00:47:07.295
<v Speaker 4>What what do we have here?

00:47:08.015 --> 00:47:08.735
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

00:47:10.335 --> 00:47:10.975
<v Speaker 4>What

00:47:12.735 --> 00:47:13.935
<v Speaker 4>a mean thing to do.

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:17.320
<v Speaker 3>Let's try Oh, because it no. Because it's

00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:19.400
<v Speaker 4>returned it from the bash RC. Sorry.

00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:22.760
<v Speaker 4>So or somewhere.

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:25.240
<v Speaker 4>Wait a second.

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:29.625
<v Speaker 4>Let's see. You could always absolute path your

00:47:29.625 --> 00:47:30.665
<v Speaker 0>kube control.

00:47:31.224 --> 00:47:34.664
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. That's Another option another option is to

00:47:34.664 --> 00:47:36.585
<v Speaker 3>overwrite the what they put over there nears

00:47:36.585 --> 00:47:38.184
<v Speaker 3>the games and just to copy there the

00:47:38.184 --> 00:47:38.904
<v Speaker 3>kube CTL.

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:41.660
<v Speaker 0>That's a good idea. Yeah. That's that's a

00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:44.140
<v Speaker 4>good idea. Let's try doing that. This will

00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:47.260
<v Speaker 3>probably solve it pretty quickly. L l slash

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:49.020
<v Speaker 4>user local

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:49.900
<v Speaker 4>game.

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:52.940
<v Speaker 4>Where is the real one?

00:47:54.225 --> 00:47:56.945
<v Speaker 3>Try let's try where is kubectl,

00:47:57.185 --> 00:47:58.945
<v Speaker 3>the command of where is.

00:47:59.745 --> 00:48:00.705
<v Speaker 4>Where is?

00:48:01.585 --> 00:48:02.305
<v Speaker 3>Yep.

00:48:03.185 --> 00:48:04.465
<v Speaker 3>Kubectl.

00:48:04.625 --> 00:48:07.105
<v Speaker 3>Okay. Great. So we have user local as

00:48:07.105 --> 00:48:08.785
<v Speaker 3>bin kubectl. Let's move

00:48:09.585 --> 00:48:12.160
<v Speaker 3>let's let's let's see p to user games.

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:14.000
<v Speaker 0>Come on. Let's at least look at user

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.200
<v Speaker 0>games kubectl.

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:16.400
<v Speaker 0>Open it in Vendor.

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:20.080
<v Speaker 4>Okay. S bin. In curiosity. Oh,

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:23.040
<v Speaker 3>let's see what yeah. Let's see if this

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:23.360
<v Speaker 3>works.

00:48:25.715 --> 00:48:27.555
<v Speaker 3>Did they What do mean? Oh, they they

00:48:27.555 --> 00:48:29.475
<v Speaker 3>maybe changed the name of the binary. That

00:48:29.475 --> 00:48:30.995
<v Speaker 3>also that's also possible.

00:48:31.795 --> 00:48:34.275
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. But, also, it's usually fine. Not not

00:48:34.515 --> 00:48:35.795
<v Speaker 4>nothing has been.

00:48:37.635 --> 00:48:38.675
<v Speaker 0>So the

00:48:38.995 --> 00:48:40.115
<v Speaker 0>cat from

00:48:40.410 --> 00:48:43.770
<v Speaker 0>ThemeKong has asked if help is actually helpful.

00:48:43.849 --> 00:48:45.130
<v Speaker 0>Or maybe maybe

00:48:45.369 --> 00:48:47.609
<v Speaker 0>kubectl help will give you a hint. Oh,

00:48:47.609 --> 00:48:48.570
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting.

00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:51.610
<v Speaker 3>Okay. Kubectl help. Let's see what happens.

00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:53.849
<v Speaker 3>Oh, maybe we have over there another joke.

00:48:56.825 --> 00:48:59.305
<v Speaker 4>Or we download simply. We we should install

00:48:59.945 --> 00:49:01.625
<v Speaker 4>Deepgram from scratch.

00:49:01.785 --> 00:49:03.705
<v Speaker 0>Well, let's look at the script. Come on.

00:49:03.705 --> 00:49:05.465
<v Speaker 0>Let's I wanna know what I've done.

00:49:06.265 --> 00:49:07.145
<v Speaker 4>Oh, okay.

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:12.460
<v Speaker 3>You're saying it back. Yeah. I mean, Kat

00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:13.819
<v Speaker 0>and it seems a bit brave, but go

00:49:13.819 --> 00:49:14.540
<v Speaker 0>for it.

00:49:16.859 --> 00:49:19.020
<v Speaker 4>What why you say it's crazy? You said

00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:20.460
<v Speaker 4>you thought it was a script.

00:49:27.135 --> 00:49:29.775
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Ascii. That was good. You can catch

00:49:29.775 --> 00:49:30.894
<v Speaker 1>it. Yeah. That that's a

00:49:31.535 --> 00:49:32.175
<v Speaker 4>yeah.

00:49:32.494 --> 00:49:33.454
<v Speaker 4>Okay. Oh, it's

00:49:35.454 --> 00:49:37.454
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. Yeah. Okay. No. It's funny. Now let's

00:49:37.454 --> 00:49:39.135
<v Speaker 3>see let's see what the echo from.

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:41.670
<v Speaker 3>So it's from kubectl

00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:46.950
<v Speaker 3>they oh, they simply just let's

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:49.990
<v Speaker 3>see. No. Okay. Now the other kubectl

00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:53.030
<v Speaker 3>let's see what the other kubectl is.

00:49:55.415 --> 00:49:57.975
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. In in user local has been.

00:50:00.695 --> 00:50:03.415
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming that's possibly the same. Right?

00:50:04.375 --> 00:50:05.415
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. So

00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:10.770
<v Speaker 4>I would download, David, the I would download

00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:12.210
<v Speaker 4>simply the the

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:15.330
<v Speaker 4>the root of KubeCTL.

00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:18.370
<v Speaker 3>Okay. Let's do that. Download

00:50:18.609 --> 00:50:19.650
<v Speaker 3>KubeCTL.

00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:21.970
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Zero trust Kubernetes. That's what we need.

00:50:22.985 --> 00:50:23.865
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.

00:50:23.865 --> 00:50:24.425
<v Speaker 3>So

00:50:25.865 --> 00:50:27.465
<v Speaker 3>then you want me to do it? Well,

00:50:29.705 --> 00:50:32.345
<v Speaker 4>whatever. Just copy kubeCTL

00:50:32.345 --> 00:50:34.905
<v Speaker 4>to where the in this game directory.

00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:38.230
<v Speaker 4>Let's continue with the nice game directory.

00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:38.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:41.430
<v Speaker 3>Let the games begin.

00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:46.150
<v Speaker 4>Are you using it?

00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:48.710
<v Speaker 3>Downloading it. Let's see.

00:50:50.535 --> 00:50:51.415
<v Speaker 4>Wait a second.

00:50:52.214 --> 00:50:53.895
<v Speaker 3>Oh, are you are you also?

00:50:54.615 --> 00:50:56.934
<v Speaker 4>No. Wait a second. Someone has put something

00:50:56.934 --> 00:50:59.734
<v Speaker 4>here. Let me try something. Okay? Cool. Sure.

00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:06.520
<v Speaker 4>Okay. Get pods.

00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:08.760
<v Speaker 4>Mods.

00:51:16.994 --> 00:51:17.715
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

00:51:17.875 --> 00:51:20.515
<v Speaker 4>That's better. Okay. So this is great. Okay.

00:51:21.635 --> 00:51:25.155
<v Speaker 4>This is this is something. Okay. Now Right.

00:51:25.714 --> 00:51:27.315
<v Speaker 3>I Now let's copy this.

00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:31.770
<v Speaker 3>Let now let's copy Chip CTL to the

00:51:31.770 --> 00:51:32.650
<v Speaker 3>games. Right?

00:51:42.355 --> 00:51:43.235
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

00:51:43.875 --> 00:51:44.355
<v Speaker 4>That's

00:51:44.755 --> 00:51:45.395
<v Speaker 4>okay.

00:51:45.555 --> 00:51:46.275
<v Speaker 4>So

00:51:48.115 --> 00:51:50.355
<v Speaker 4>it's not connecting the API server.

00:51:50.755 --> 00:51:53.155
<v Speaker 3>Right. We need to find the cube the

00:51:53.155 --> 00:51:54.595
<v Speaker 3>cube config file.

00:51:54.915 --> 00:51:56.590
<v Speaker 3>Okay. Right? K.

00:51:57.070 --> 00:51:58.270
<v Speaker 4>Have the

00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:01.869
<v Speaker 4>kube config where it is. It is sequence

00:52:01.869 --> 00:52:03.150
<v Speaker 4>admin config.

00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:07.310
<v Speaker 3>That's what we can that's what we can

00:52:07.310 --> 00:52:07.550
<v Speaker 4>figure.

00:52:09.224 --> 00:52:10.665
<v Speaker 4>Let's try to

00:52:11.065 --> 00:52:12.265
<v Speaker 4>David, let's let's try sorry?

00:52:15.385 --> 00:52:16.905
<v Speaker 3>How about just

00:52:17.144 --> 00:52:20.585
<v Speaker 3>let's say, is it over here? What is

00:52:20.585 --> 00:52:21.865
<v Speaker 3>it possible they put it here?

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:23.520
<v Speaker 3>Cube.

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:27.520
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure though. Why do you think

00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:29.360
<v Speaker 4>that it's not right? I mean, the IP

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:30.240
<v Speaker 4>Oh.

00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:32.720
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It may just be there's no API

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:34.640
<v Speaker 0>server running. Have you checked that? Yeah. Yeah.

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:37.440
<v Speaker 4>The yeah. So let's let's first of check

00:52:38.225 --> 00:52:40.545
<v Speaker 4>if with NetStats whether it is running.

00:52:41.185 --> 00:52:44.705
<v Speaker 3>Right. Okay. So just NetStats

00:52:44.865 --> 00:52:45.825
<v Speaker 4>are you writing?

00:52:46.225 --> 00:52:48.785
<v Speaker 4>NetStats? I thought you were writing. Are you

00:52:48.785 --> 00:52:49.825
<v Speaker 3>writing? Okay.

00:52:50.225 --> 00:52:51.665
<v Speaker 3>Go ahead. Something is wrote.

00:52:55.339 --> 00:52:58.060
<v Speaker 4>What is it? T u n

00:52:58.140 --> 00:52:59.660
<v Speaker 4>l p. Right?

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:01.500
<v Speaker 4>Rev six.

00:53:04.905 --> 00:53:07.465
<v Speaker 4>Not really running something. Something Did you mean

00:53:07.465 --> 00:53:08.585
<v Speaker 3>8414?

00:53:10.425 --> 00:53:11.785
<v Speaker 4>Oh. Kubelet is running.

00:53:13.145 --> 00:53:15.945
<v Speaker 4>Kube VIP is running. Salesforce is running,

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:20.680
<v Speaker 4>but no API server is running. So let's

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:21.400
<v Speaker 4>just

00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:24.120
<v Speaker 4>check one more thing.

00:53:24.839 --> 00:53:25.800
<v Speaker 4>API.

00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:29.240
<v Speaker 4>No. Definitely not running. You

00:53:29.515 --> 00:53:32.235
<v Speaker 4>can definitely not running. So

00:53:32.555 --> 00:53:34.715
<v Speaker 4>the API server isn't running,

00:53:35.115 --> 00:53:37.675
<v Speaker 4>and, obviously, this is not so good.

00:53:39.915 --> 00:53:42.315
<v Speaker 4>So we need to bring up the API

00:53:42.315 --> 00:53:42.635
<v Speaker 4>server.

00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:44.440
<v Speaker 4>This

00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:45.960
<v Speaker 4>is the time you need to say how

00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:48.520
<v Speaker 4>we are bringing up your our API servers.

00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:51.640
<v Speaker 3>Let's think.

00:53:57.335 --> 00:54:00.215
<v Speaker 4>So I I'm sure that it was

00:54:00.535 --> 00:54:02.855
<v Speaker 4>putting up the counter plan with Kube admin.

00:54:03.335 --> 00:54:05.495
<v Speaker 0>Yep. These are Kube admin clusters. Definitely.

00:54:06.454 --> 00:54:08.214
<v Speaker 4>Okay. So

00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:14.619
<v Speaker 3>I don't know The kube admin uses static

00:54:14.619 --> 00:54:15.820
<v Speaker 0>manifest for

00:54:16.619 --> 00:54:18.060
<v Speaker 0>the control plane component,

00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:21.420
<v Speaker 0>which are in let's say Kubernetes manifest.

00:54:23.225 --> 00:54:23.945
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.

00:54:24.105 --> 00:54:25.945
<v Speaker 4>It was in its right

00:54:26.985 --> 00:54:29.545
<v Speaker 4>to put up the the control plane

00:54:30.265 --> 00:54:31.145
<v Speaker 4>and

00:54:32.105 --> 00:54:33.465
<v Speaker 4>manifest. Yeah.

00:54:33.785 --> 00:54:35.785
<v Speaker 3>Let's look to let's look for the manifest.

00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:41.470
<v Speaker 3>Let's let's let's look for the manifest maybe.

00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:43.710
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I would go to Etsy Kubernetes manifest

00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:45.150
<v Speaker 0>and see what you've got.

00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:46.830
<v Speaker 4>Mhmm.

00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:50.030
<v Speaker 4>There is something is wrong with my browser.

00:54:52.195 --> 00:54:53.075
<v Speaker 4>Slash

00:54:53.075 --> 00:54:54.355
<v Speaker 4>f c d

00:54:54.595 --> 00:54:55.715
<v Speaker 4>Kubernetes.

00:54:57.075 --> 00:55:00.355
<v Speaker 3>Right. Okay. We have admins kind of manifest.

00:55:01.875 --> 00:55:02.675
<v Speaker 4>QAPI

00:55:02.675 --> 00:55:04.355
<v Speaker 4>server. API server.

00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:13.000
<v Speaker 3>Great. You wanna let's let's take a quick

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.840
<v Speaker 3>look. And if it looks okay, yeah, let's

00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:16.440
<v Speaker 3>let's just supply this.

00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:18.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. Do

00:55:19.095 --> 00:55:20.775
<v Speaker 4>some of you know how we are supplying

00:55:20.775 --> 00:55:21.815
<v Speaker 4>to kubeadmin?

00:55:21.815 --> 00:55:22.375
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.

00:55:24.375 --> 00:55:27.175
<v Speaker 0>So kubeadmin monitors this directory and the kubel

00:55:27.175 --> 00:55:29.335
<v Speaker 0>the kubelet monitors this directory and will attempt

00:55:29.335 --> 00:55:30.935
<v Speaker 0>to deploy anything inside of it.

00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:34.550
<v Speaker 0>So you don't need to run any kube

00:55:34.550 --> 00:55:35.750
<v Speaker 0>admin commands.

00:55:36.790 --> 00:55:37.430
<v Speaker 3>So

00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:40.950
<v Speaker 4>you're saying

00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:45.110
<v Speaker 4>you don't need to run. The question is,

00:55:45.705 --> 00:55:47.945
<v Speaker 4>who's who should we bring this up? Because

00:55:47.945 --> 00:55:50.425
<v Speaker 4>I didn't see Kubelden running on this machine.

00:55:50.585 --> 00:55:53.145
<v Speaker 0>The Kubelden is responsible for bringing them up.

00:55:53.385 --> 00:55:55.385
<v Speaker 4>Oh, the Kubelden is The Kubelden. Yeah.

00:55:59.390 --> 00:56:01.390
<v Speaker 4>Kubelet kubelet conf.

00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:03.150
<v Speaker 4>I see here

00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:05.710
<v Speaker 4>configuration of kubelet,

00:56:06.110 --> 00:56:06.990
<v Speaker 4>bootstrap

00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:08.430
<v Speaker 4>Mhmm. Container.

00:56:08.830 --> 00:56:10.910
<v Speaker 4>I I think it there should be a

00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:12.510
<v Speaker 4>static pods here

00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:13.310
<v Speaker 4>somewhere.

00:56:15.455 --> 00:56:17.615
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you wanna try to keep it config?

00:56:18.415 --> 00:56:19.055
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

00:56:20.575 --> 00:56:22.255
<v Speaker 4>Oh, it should be

00:56:28.799 --> 00:56:32.319
<v Speaker 4>Kubernetes.com.

00:56:32.319 --> 00:56:33.839
<v Speaker 3>It's in Varlib. Here.

00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:40.725
<v Speaker 4>We are not in oh, sorry. We're not

00:56:40.725 --> 00:56:42.165
<v Speaker 4>in the first directory.

00:56:48.965 --> 00:56:49.685
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

00:56:49.845 --> 00:56:51.765
<v Speaker 4>So let's see the file.

00:56:54.770 --> 00:56:56.130
<v Speaker 4>Control plane.

00:56:57.170 --> 00:56:57.810
<v Speaker 4>Service.

00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:02.930
<v Speaker 3>Check the varlib. Let's config.

00:57:03.170 --> 00:57:04.690
<v Speaker 3>Let's see if we see there anything.

00:57:06.865 --> 00:57:08.545
<v Speaker 0>I think that's good advice.

00:57:10.465 --> 00:57:12.305
<v Speaker 3>That's Rawkode's idea.

00:57:15.105 --> 00:57:15.985
<v Speaker 4>Which one?

00:57:16.785 --> 00:57:21.345
<v Speaker 3>The var lib kubelet config. Yeah. The lib

00:57:21.390 --> 00:57:22.430
<v Speaker 3>kubelet

00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:23.470
<v Speaker 3>config.

00:57:23.549 --> 00:57:24.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:27.550
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.

00:57:28.349 --> 00:57:28.750
<v Speaker 3>K.

00:57:35.565 --> 00:57:36.605
<v Speaker 4>Authorization.

00:57:41.245 --> 00:57:44.845
<v Speaker 4>There is some parameter there that is Static

00:57:44.845 --> 00:57:46.685
<v Speaker 4>bot path seems right.

00:57:48.045 --> 00:57:49.325
<v Speaker 0>Yep. Looks okay.

00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:55.460
<v Speaker 4>Volume streams also shut

00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:58.500
<v Speaker 4>down then. It is time out. Notes.

00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:02.900
<v Speaker 3>Alright. And the static static pod pod path

00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:03.860
<v Speaker 3>also looks okay.

00:58:04.985 --> 00:58:08.745
<v Speaker 3>Right? Manifests. Yep. It is Kubernetes manifests.

00:58:08.745 --> 00:58:10.505
<v Speaker 0>We have a comment from Russell on the

00:58:10.505 --> 00:58:12.825
<v Speaker 0>chat highlighting that there may be a small

00:58:12.825 --> 00:58:13.705
<v Speaker 0>error

00:58:14.105 --> 00:58:16.345
<v Speaker 0>with an s on the end. What was

00:58:16.345 --> 00:58:18.425
<v Speaker 0>the directory called under Etsy Kubernetes?

00:58:20.970 --> 00:58:22.330
<v Speaker 4>Manif manifest

00:58:22.330 --> 00:58:23.610
<v Speaker 4>or manifest?

00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:25.930
<v Speaker 4>Oh my god. I

00:58:31.130 --> 00:58:32.970
<v Speaker 4>don't know what is the right one, by

00:58:32.970 --> 00:58:35.265
<v Speaker 4>the way, for savings. As long as they

00:58:35.265 --> 00:58:36.945
<v Speaker 0>match, you're you're all good.

00:58:37.744 --> 00:58:38.785
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.

00:58:44.145 --> 00:58:44.705
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:51.010
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

00:58:51.010 --> 00:58:53.570
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what causes the queue. Should

00:58:53.570 --> 00:58:55.170
<v Speaker 4>we restart the Qubelet?

00:58:55.170 --> 00:58:57.410
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's a system deserviced, so you both

00:58:57.410 --> 00:58:58.210
<v Speaker 0>have to

00:58:58.530 --> 00:58:59.490
<v Speaker 0>to restart.

00:59:06.905 --> 00:59:08.345

<v Speaker 0>System CTL.

00:59:11.625 --> 00:59:12.985
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. System

00:59:14.505 --> 00:59:15.705

<v Speaker 4>kubelet.

00:59:20.559 --> 00:59:21.600
<v Speaker 3>Restart. Mhmm.

00:59:22.559 --> 00:59:25.040
<v Speaker 0>And that's your system five stuff coming out.

00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:27.200
<v Speaker 0>System control restart Kubelet.

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:34.160
<v Speaker 0>Delete the service. Yeah. And then the Yeah.

00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:34.799
<v Speaker 4>And restart

00:59:35.605 --> 00:59:36.325
<v Speaker 4>Why?

00:59:38.005 --> 00:59:39.765
<v Speaker 0>This is attempt where I was working with

00:59:39.765 --> 00:59:40.485
<v Speaker 4>Ubuntu.

00:59:41.605 --> 00:59:42.725
<v Speaker 0>Fingers crossed.

00:59:42.965 --> 00:59:44.725
<v Speaker 0>That looks better. Much

00:59:44.725 --> 00:59:45.685
<v Speaker 0>better. Okay.

00:59:47.045 --> 00:59:50.405
<v Speaker 3>Very nice. Team team Kong, very nice. Well

00:59:50.405 --> 00:59:50.645
<v Speaker 3>done.

00:59:52.859 --> 00:59:53.580
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:56.220
<v Speaker 4>Sir, reject a request for unknown

00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:57.740
<v Speaker 4>reason. Let's

00:59:57.740 --> 01:00:00.140
<v Speaker 3>look for okay. Let's try events.

01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:04.940
<v Speaker 3>Let's try We are we are not talking.

01:00:05.675 --> 01:00:07.035
<v Speaker 3>We are not talking. Oh, this is a

01:00:07.035 --> 01:00:10.555
<v Speaker 3>bad request. Try get pod minus v

01:00:10.555 --> 01:00:12.555
<v Speaker 3>minus v equals six.

01:00:13.835 --> 01:00:14.475
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.

01:00:14.715 --> 01:00:16.475
<v Speaker 4>I know, but I don't I'm not sure

01:00:16.475 --> 01:00:17.595
<v Speaker 4>that this is the issue.

01:00:18.075 --> 01:00:19.835
<v Speaker 4>We have an issue. Let's see. Here we

01:00:19.835 --> 01:00:23.350
<v Speaker 3>go. This shows us exactly what we requested.

01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:25.270
<v Speaker 3>Just

01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:26.710
<v Speaker 3>go upload it from

01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:31.430
<v Speaker 3>here we go. I think that dash v

01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:33.270
<v Speaker 0>six was an absolutely great idea.

01:00:35.244 --> 01:00:36.285
<v Speaker 0>I think you've got

01:00:37.244 --> 01:00:39.645
<v Speaker 3>Here, it couldn't get let's see. Body was

01:00:39.645 --> 01:00:42.685
<v Speaker 3>not decodable, unable to check for status.

01:00:43.725 --> 01:00:44.925
<v Speaker 3>I'll get version kind.

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:50.300
<v Speaker 3>Okay. So the object that's returned Client sent

01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:51.580
<v Speaker 4>an h t h t p request to

01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:53.500
<v Speaker 4>an h t p server, again with the

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:54.460
<v Speaker 4>s, I think.

01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:59.100
<v Speaker 4>Same issue. Okay. So go go to the

01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:00.620
<v Speaker 4>kube config, David.

01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:02.060
<v Speaker 4>Go to kube config.

01:01:03.355 --> 01:01:04.075
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

01:01:04.155 --> 01:01:05.835
<v Speaker 0>Russell in the chat is asking what is

01:01:05.835 --> 01:01:07.515
<v Speaker 0>the dash v syntax.

01:01:07.515 --> 01:01:09.195
<v Speaker 0>So dash v followed by a number will

01:01:09.195 --> 01:01:10.955
<v Speaker 0>give you for boss a logging from one

01:01:10.955 --> 01:01:13.115
<v Speaker 0>till nine. No. No. Not not here. Not

01:01:13.115 --> 01:01:21.160
<v Speaker 4>to to the /etc/etc/tc/etc

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:22.760
<v Speaker 4>Kubernetes

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:23.960
<v Speaker 4>admin

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:28.200
<v Speaker 4>I see. Admincom.

01:01:31.575 --> 01:01:34.455
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. Yeah. Here we exactly. That's the problem.

01:01:34.455 --> 01:01:36.295
<v Speaker 4>The HTTP needs an I love it when

01:01:36.295 --> 01:01:38.135
<v Speaker 0>the cursor starts in the right place.

01:01:38.615 --> 01:01:39.575
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Yeah.

01:01:41.015 --> 01:01:42.695
<v Speaker 4>Dude, HTTP

01:01:42.695 --> 01:01:43.970
<v Speaker 4>s s.

01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:45.250
<v Speaker 0>You're in you're in

01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:47.650
<v Speaker 0>yeah. You're

01:01:47.650 --> 01:01:48.770
<v Speaker 0>you're in the wrong mode. Yeah.

01:01:49.650 --> 01:01:51.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. I'm getting out of there.

01:01:51.809 --> 01:01:53.170
<v Speaker 0>Let's do it again.

01:01:54.690 --> 01:01:55.089
<v Speaker 3>Hi.

01:01:56.625 --> 01:01:58.305
<v Speaker 3>There we go. Nothing wrong.

01:01:58.945 --> 01:01:59.505
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.

01:01:59.745 --> 01:02:03.585
<v Speaker 4>That's it. Okay. So retry kubectl again.

01:02:04.065 --> 01:02:05.985
<v Speaker 3>Let's try again. Get pods.

01:02:07.025 --> 01:02:10.349
<v Speaker 3>Okay. Okay. Nice. Now this is sending less

01:02:10.349 --> 01:02:11.710
<v Speaker 3>wires to sending.

01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:14.430
<v Speaker 0>May want some less verbosity there.

01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:16.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.

01:02:16.270 --> 01:02:18.190
<v Speaker 4>So an s miss s is missing also.

01:02:22.145 --> 01:02:23.825
<v Speaker 0>You think that went for a theme, Ben,

01:02:23.825 --> 01:02:25.425
<v Speaker 0>just removing all the s's?

01:02:26.224 --> 01:02:28.464
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. So I think that from now on,

01:02:28.464 --> 01:02:30.224
<v Speaker 4>every time I get another from the our

01:02:30.224 --> 01:02:32.225
<v Speaker 4>production, I'm going to look for s's.

01:02:34.464 --> 01:02:35.825
<v Speaker 3>It's actually not a bad idea.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:37.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:39.480
<v Speaker 4>Clustered.

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:41.800
<v Speaker 0>Alright. These are halfway through. So we got

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.640
<v Speaker 0>a whole twenty two minutes left. You're you're

01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:45.000
<v Speaker 0>smashing it. Three

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:47.960
<v Speaker 3>out of notes available. Okay. So they did

01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.800
<v Speaker 3>the same trick we did to them. Let's

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:50.760
<v Speaker 3>remove the limits.

01:02:55.265 --> 01:02:55.905
<v Speaker 4>Right?

01:02:56.944 --> 01:02:59.265
<v Speaker 4>Do you think so? I'm I'm not

01:03:00.065 --> 01:03:02.145
<v Speaker 4>okay. Get note. Just do a get note.

01:03:02.145 --> 01:03:04.625
<v Speaker 3>One second. Let's let's first let's

01:03:05.265 --> 01:03:05.585
<v Speaker 3>so

01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:09.490
<v Speaker 4>Let's do a get note

01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:12.450
<v Speaker 4>just to be You want get note? Yeah.

01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:14.850
<v Speaker 4>Just to see what is going on here.

01:03:15.090 --> 01:03:16.530
<v Speaker 3>Let's see what's going on. It's a good

01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:17.170
<v Speaker 3>idea.

01:03:17.890 --> 01:03:21.355
<v Speaker 4>Okay. Scheduling disabled on work with two. Okay?

01:03:21.595 --> 01:03:24.955
<v Speaker 4>So we need to enable scheduling there.

01:03:25.435 --> 01:03:29.835
<v Speaker 3>And Alright. Let's

01:03:29.835 --> 01:03:31.595
<v Speaker 3>first look at the describe

01:03:32.315 --> 01:03:34.235
<v Speaker 3>to make sure this is the problem.

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:36.960
<v Speaker 3>Describe

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:41.040
<v Speaker 3>notes. Let's try the worker node. V

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:42.160
<v Speaker 3>two.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:45.120
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.

01:03:52.365 --> 01:03:53.965
<v Speaker 3>Labels, annotation.

01:03:55.325 --> 01:03:57.085
<v Speaker 0>So how can you set a note that's

01:03:57.085 --> 01:03:58.445
<v Speaker 0>not schedulable in Kubernetes?

01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:02.390
<v Speaker 4>Actually,

01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:04.310
<v Speaker 4>I haven't tried. I always trying to make

01:04:04.310 --> 01:04:05.270
<v Speaker 4>them scheduled.

01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:06.150
<v Speaker 4>Are

01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:10.470
<v Speaker 0>you familiar with the carding command?

01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:12.310
<v Speaker 3>No.

01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:14.950
<v Speaker 3>The carding command? Do you?

01:04:16.134 --> 01:04:17.175
<v Speaker 0>Carden.

01:04:17.335 --> 01:04:18.775
<v Speaker 0>Sorry. Suppose to call you Shanks then coming

01:04:18.775 --> 01:04:19.335
<v Speaker 0>through.

01:04:19.734 --> 01:04:20.935
<v Speaker 3>No. It's okay.

01:04:22.055 --> 01:04:23.894
<v Speaker 3>No. I haven't tried that, but we can

01:04:23.894 --> 01:04:25.335
<v Speaker 3>play with it. Let's see.

01:04:26.934 --> 01:04:29.140
<v Speaker 3>Oh, I'm sorry. Did you I was just

01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:30.660
<v Speaker 0>sure I was just typing the command so

01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:32.260
<v Speaker 0>that you could get past my Oh, okay.

01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:34.740
<v Speaker 0>My funny person accent. But We have two

01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:37.220
<v Speaker 0>commands that to play with nodes, cordon and

01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:38.340
<v Speaker 0>uncordon.

01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:40.020
<v Speaker 4>Oh, okay.

01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:42.020
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.

01:04:44.405 --> 01:04:47.285
<v Speaker 4>I get it. So just write anchor q

01:04:47.285 --> 01:04:48.245
<v Speaker 4>c t l,

01:04:49.045 --> 01:04:50.405
<v Speaker 4>I think note.

01:04:50.485 --> 01:04:53.205

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:27.840
<v Speaker 0>Come on.

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:32.000

<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Just run batch.

01:06:59.790 --> 01:07:01.710
<v Speaker 0>Although, you'll lose your export to config.

01:07:02.955 --> 01:07:05.835
<v Speaker 3>Oh, okay. So I'm okay with this. Here,

01:07:05.835 --> 01:07:08.075
<v Speaker 3>I I would come here, I'll do it.

01:07:08.315 --> 01:07:09.995
<v Speaker 3>Let's see. Kube

01:07:09.995 --> 01:07:11.115
<v Speaker 3>CTL.

01:07:11.435 --> 01:07:12.155
<v Speaker 3>Good.

<v Speaker 3>No resources found.

01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:18.940
<v Speaker 3>No resources found.

01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:21.180
<v Speaker 3>Let's try the validation.

01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:26.060
<v Speaker 4>You have admission controller also in the API

01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:28.780
<v Speaker 4>server. You can Exactly. Static admission controllers.

01:07:29.775 --> 01:07:31.454
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. You can also

01:07:31.934 --> 01:07:34.494
<v Speaker 4>API. Let let's look at the like, let

01:07:34.575 --> 01:07:37.135
<v Speaker 4>yeah. Let's look at the API server configuration.

01:07:39.135 --> 01:07:41.454
<v Speaker 4>Where was it? It was in

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:45.720
<v Speaker 4>it was I don't remember if it was

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:47.880
<v Speaker 0>Etsy Kubernetes manifests.

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:50.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. Yeah. Look at the Etsy data Kubernetes

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:51.960
<v Speaker 4>manifests.

01:07:52.519 --> 01:07:55.315
<v Speaker 3>Okay. One second. It's always I'm sorry. Just

01:07:55.315 --> 01:07:56.675
<v Speaker 3>looking at the

01:08:06.435 --> 01:08:09.590
<v Speaker 4>Okay. And Just look at the Orest, yeah,

01:08:09.590 --> 01:08:11.590
<v Speaker 4>open it in Vim. Okay? So they will

01:08:11.590 --> 01:08:14.390
<v Speaker 4>going to edit it. I heard from David's

01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:15.030
<v Speaker 4>voice.

01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:17.429
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry. Say again?

01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:19.670
<v Speaker 4>So just open for editing.

01:08:22.455 --> 01:08:23.975
<v Speaker 0>I'd like to see an episode of Clustard

01:08:23.975 --> 01:08:25.895
<v Speaker 0>where people just open Vem and have enough

01:08:25.895 --> 01:08:28.535
<v Speaker 0>plugins to just, like, navigate the directory system

01:08:28.535 --> 01:08:31.335
<v Speaker 0>and run cube control and never even bother

01:08:31.335 --> 01:08:31.975
<v Speaker 0>machine.

01:08:32.615 --> 01:08:34.615
<v Speaker 3>We want the controller manager or the API

01:08:34.615 --> 01:08:35.335
<v Speaker 3>server?

01:08:35.655 --> 01:08:36.615
<v Speaker 4>The API server.

01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:38.120
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:42.439
<v Speaker 3>Okay. So you have this

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:44.359
<v Speaker 4>what's

01:08:44.359 --> 01:08:45.000
<v Speaker 4>the name?

01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:45.960
<v Speaker 4>Enable boost

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:49.399
<v Speaker 4>enable admission control no restriction.

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:50.359
<v Speaker 4>Always

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:51.320
<v Speaker 4>Plug in.

01:08:52.715 --> 01:08:54.554
<v Speaker 0>Always the nice that's bad. Right?

01:08:55.114 --> 01:08:56.074
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.

01:08:59.434 --> 01:09:00.954
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't move with the old node restriction.

01:09:00.954 --> 01:09:03.514
<v Speaker 3>Did we remove also the the node restriction?

01:09:03.514 --> 01:09:04.715
<v Speaker 0>No. Leave that one, please.

01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:09.340
<v Speaker 4>No. So

01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:12.700
<v Speaker 4>let me check out whether the whether the

01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:14.300
<v Speaker 4>API server has restarted.

01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:16.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you can check. So

01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:19.260
<v Speaker 3>that that keeps c t l

01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:20.540
<v Speaker 3>get pods.

01:09:20.895 --> 01:09:22.895
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe because it's a oh, yeah.

01:09:22.895 --> 01:09:24.895
<v Speaker 3>Here it is. It's off right now. No.

01:09:24.895 --> 01:09:26.255
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Give it a wee minute. It should

01:09:26.255 --> 01:09:28.094
<v Speaker 0>come back. Not a lot of teams would

01:09:28.094 --> 01:09:30.414
<v Speaker 0>have got a static admission controller. That was

01:09:30.574 --> 01:09:31.215
<v Speaker 0>well done.

01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:35.500
<v Speaker 2>Very nice. Yeah. It's probably, you know, these

01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:37.420
<v Speaker 4>are things that are, like, coincidences of your

01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:38.460
<v Speaker 4>last week.

01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:40.939
<v Speaker 4>I needed to wrote a paper about it,

01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:43.420
<v Speaker 4>and I didn't know it was beforehand also.

01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:45.100
<v Speaker 4>So some things are

01:09:45.545 --> 01:09:46.665
<v Speaker 4>just coincidentally.

01:09:46.665 --> 01:09:48.425
<v Speaker 0>So if it's taken too long, you can

01:09:48.425 --> 01:09:50.104
<v Speaker 0>restart the kubelet to speed it up a

01:09:50.104 --> 01:09:50.744
<v Speaker 0>wee bit.

01:09:52.344 --> 01:09:54.905
<v Speaker 3>Oh, yeah. Oh, there you go. Yeah. Okay.

01:09:54.905 --> 01:09:55.544
<v Speaker 3>So

01:09:57.304 --> 01:09:58.585
<v Speaker 4>Get pods. Okay.

01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:00.180
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:02.340
<v Speaker 3>So this is still pending. Let's see why.

01:10:02.739 --> 01:10:04.660
<v Speaker 0>Well, you were you were trying to encode

01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:06.580
<v Speaker 0>and I know it. Yeah. There you go.

01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:07.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. Yeah.

01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:10.420
<v Speaker 3>So let's do that again. Encore.

01:10:12.455 --> 01:10:14.375
<v Speaker 3>Okay. That's better.

01:10:15.815 --> 01:10:17.655
<v Speaker 3>Now let's do let me get

01:10:18.295 --> 01:10:19.255
<v Speaker 3>node.

01:10:22.135 --> 01:10:23.175
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

01:10:23.175 --> 01:10:25.575
<v Speaker 3>This looks much better. It it it it

01:10:25.575 --> 01:10:28.215
<v Speaker 4>it's a little less complicated. Container creating. This

01:10:28.215 --> 01:10:29.390
<v Speaker 3>is better. Okay.

01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:31.710
<v Speaker 3>Let's make sure this works.

01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:32.670
<v Speaker 3>And

01:10:36.190 --> 01:10:39.310
<v Speaker 4>Comp it's stuck in container creating. And it's

01:10:39.390 --> 01:10:40.030
<v Speaker 4>Uh-oh.

01:10:40.350 --> 01:10:42.910
<v Speaker 3>Okay. Let's see what Probably pulling the image.

01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:43.710
<v Speaker 0>I think you're

01:10:44.235 --> 01:10:45.434
<v Speaker 0>maybe okay.

01:10:46.635 --> 01:10:49.275
<v Speaker 3>Let's let's so let's let's

01:10:49.275 --> 01:10:51.434
<v Speaker 3>look at this this container.

01:10:54.315 --> 01:10:55.195
<v Speaker 4>Describe.

01:10:55.195 --> 01:10:55.594

<v Speaker 3>annoying.

01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:00.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry. Yeah. What was that command that

01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:02.680
<v Speaker 0>was run by team Kong, the complete command?

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:04.039
<v Speaker 0>I think we're missing that.

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:07.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. I I took this from kubectl. They

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.079
<v Speaker 3>have their complete command, but I guess

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:11.239
<v Speaker 3>clustered. Clustered.

01:11:12.755 --> 01:11:13.475
<v Speaker 3>Yep.

01:11:18.755 --> 01:11:20.595
<v Speaker 0>That's yeah. That's the command from Colin and

<v Speaker 0>Oh, that's the f of the alias. That's

01:11:25.235 --> 01:11:26.355
<v Speaker 0>how they made it work.

01:11:26.755 --> 01:11:27.875
<v Speaker 3>Okay. Let's see.

01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:30.639
<v Speaker 0>So you have a ready replica?

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:31.519
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:34.560

<v Speaker 3>that everything is over okay. Over here, like,

01:11:36.639 --> 01:11:38.800
<v Speaker 3>match labels Look at clustered.

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:41.824
<v Speaker 3>There are no describe on this. Do describe

01:11:41.824 --> 01:11:43.344

<v Speaker 0>cluster.

01:12:21.275 --> 01:12:23.114
<v Speaker 0>Let me try the worker node. Sometimes it's

01:12:23.114 --> 01:12:24.235
<v Speaker 0>a control plane.

01:12:25.035 --> 01:12:26.795
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. Funny. Refuse.

01:12:26.795 --> 01:12:28.920

<v Speaker 3>Yeah. I missed it.

01:12:50.345 --> 01:12:52.025
<v Speaker 4>It's the best thing that someone is working

01:12:52.025 --> 01:12:53.385
<v Speaker 4>in the terminal. Right.

01:12:54.585 --> 01:12:57.145
<v Speaker 4>It's it's easier. Let's see what services are

01:12:57.145 --> 01:12:59.040
<v Speaker 3>we looking at. 30000

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:00.800
<v Speaker 0>is what? 30000.

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:01.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:03.120
<v Speaker 3>30000? Yeah.

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:05.040
<v Speaker 3>Okay. One moment then.

01:13:12.655 --> 01:13:14.815
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We have a networking issue by the

01:13:14.815 --> 01:13:17.615
<v Speaker 0>looks of it. Yeah. And twelve minutes to

01:13:17.615 --> 01:13:18.094
<v Speaker 0>go.

01:13:18.575 --> 01:13:21.055
<v Speaker 4>Oh, that's nice. So

01:13:21.055 --> 01:13:22.735
<v Speaker 4>let's look into the service.

01:13:23.935 --> 01:13:24.975
<v Speaker 4>Get SBC.

01:13:25.295 --> 01:13:26.015
<v Speaker 4>It's there.

01:13:28.410 --> 01:13:30.890
<v Speaker 4>Okay. No port at 30,000.

01:13:32.650 --> 01:13:34.730
<v Speaker 4>Wait a second, David. Let's try something else.

01:13:34.730 --> 01:13:37.130
<v Speaker 4>Let's try to

01:13:37.370 --> 01:13:38.330
<v Speaker 4>do a

01:13:39.610 --> 01:13:40.650
<v Speaker 4>port forwarding.

01:13:40.730 --> 01:13:42.170
<v Speaker 4>Let's check where the issue is.

01:13:42.665 --> 01:13:44.905
<v Speaker 3>Okay. Can I I'm gonna look for the

01:13:45.385 --> 01:13:47.705
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking here of something else? Let's just

01:13:47.705 --> 01:13:48.824
<v Speaker 3>check this. Okay?

01:13:49.385 --> 01:13:50.744
<v Speaker 3>Get all

01:13:50.825 --> 01:13:51.625
<v Speaker 3>my

01:13:54.105 --> 01:13:54.825
<v Speaker 3>cube

01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:58.280
<v Speaker 3>Sorry. Clustered.

01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:03.960
<v Speaker 3>Okay. So we have oh, there's an old

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:06.199
<v Speaker 3>service. So the service, it doesn't have

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:08.920
<v Speaker 3>right? Let's see. Let's look at take a

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:09.720
<v Speaker 3>look at the service.

01:14:11.905 --> 01:14:12.865
<v Speaker 3>Describe.

01:14:14.545 --> 01:14:16.385
<v Speaker 3>This is so annoying.

01:14:18.065 --> 01:14:21.985
<v Speaker 4>Let's

01:14:21.985 --> 01:14:23.025
<v Speaker 3>look at the service.

01:14:26.090 --> 01:14:28.170
<v Speaker 0>You're missing a s. Yeah.

01:14:29.370 --> 01:14:30.410
<v Speaker 0>On describe.

01:14:30.410 --> 01:14:31.610
<v Speaker 3>Describe.

01:14:31.610 --> 01:14:33.290
<v Speaker 3>Oh, sorry. Thank you.

01:14:35.290 --> 01:14:38.330
<v Speaker 3>K. So the selector is clustered.

01:14:39.775 --> 01:14:42.175
<v Speaker 3>Okay. So this looks fine. Right? And it

01:14:42.175 --> 01:14:43.214
<v Speaker 0>has an endpoint?

01:14:44.335 --> 01:14:46.815
<v Speaker 3>No. Okay. Now let's see the port. It's

01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:48.974
<v Speaker 3>eighty eighty. The target port is also eighty

01:14:48.974 --> 01:14:51.375
<v Speaker 3>eighty. The north the node port is three

01:14:51.614 --> 01:14:52.255
<v Speaker 3>30,000.

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:55.040
<v Speaker 0>It looks good. Endpoints

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:56.560
<v Speaker 3>are eighty eighty.

01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:59.520
<v Speaker 3>Now let's do we wanna look yeah. Sure.

01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:02.320
<v Speaker 3>Now you take try the I will track

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:03.920
<v Speaker 4>a port forwarding here.

01:15:05.055 --> 01:15:07.375
<v Speaker 4>Do we have the name of k. Let's

01:15:07.375 --> 01:15:08.015
<v Speaker 4>try.

01:15:13.935 --> 01:15:15.215
<v Speaker 4>TL port.

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:19.220
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.

01:15:19.700 --> 01:15:22.100
<v Speaker 3>Colin, thank you. We tried that source, but

01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:23.540
<v Speaker 3>it didn't work for us for some reason.

01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:24.580
<v Speaker 3>Yes, Ben.

01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:25.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:31.220
<v Speaker 0>Oh, it won't work because we downloaded kubectl

01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:34.715
<v Speaker 0>and it's not the up into app version.

01:15:35.114 --> 01:15:37.594
<v Speaker 0>So it probably doesn't have what you need.

01:15:37.594 --> 01:15:38.235
<v Speaker 3>Right.

01:15:40.554 --> 01:15:43.034
<v Speaker 0>Maybe. I have I'm

01:15:43.034 --> 01:15:45.675
<v Speaker 4>sorry guys. I'm trying to copy paste here.

01:15:47.290 --> 01:15:48.170
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

01:15:49.290 --> 01:15:52.330
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry for everyone. So let's try to

01:15:52.410 --> 01:15:55.290
<v Speaker 4>I don't know. 10,000

01:15:55.290 --> 01:15:56.170
<v Speaker 4>from here

01:15:57.290 --> 01:15:58.970
<v Speaker 4>to eighty eighty. Right?

01:15:59.614 --> 01:16:01.534
<v Speaker 4>This Mhmm. Is where it should go.

01:16:01.775 --> 01:16:02.494
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

01:16:02.735 --> 01:16:04.815
<v Speaker 4>So that's not good because

01:16:10.975 --> 01:16:12.335
<v Speaker 0>That doesn't look good.

01:16:13.054 --> 01:16:16.460
<v Speaker 4>That's all good. Good. That's good. Okay.

01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:18.700
<v Speaker 4>Let's try. Okay. So

01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:28.860
<v Speaker 0>So you can exec into the pod and

01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:29.900
<v Speaker 0>Carol is available.

01:16:30.715 --> 01:16:31.755
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

01:16:31.755 --> 01:16:33.514
<v Speaker 3>That's a good idea. Let's try that.

01:16:40.955 --> 01:16:43.035
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. Minus minus Wait a second. You

01:16:44.555 --> 01:16:46.955
<v Speaker 4>yeah. But I think that

01:16:52.450 --> 01:16:53.330
<v Speaker 3>Okay. Do we

01:16:53.970 --> 01:16:55.810
<v Speaker 3>let's see what's blocking us.

01:16:57.330 --> 01:16:58.530
<v Speaker 4>So the there maybe

01:16:59.010 --> 01:17:00.050
<v Speaker 4>a network policy?

01:17:02.364 --> 01:17:03.245
<v Speaker 3>That's

01:17:03.245 --> 01:17:03.885
<v Speaker 3>interesting.

01:17:04.364 --> 01:17:06.284
<v Speaker 0>Members are our heads as well.

01:17:07.085 --> 01:17:07.804
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm.

01:17:09.085 --> 01:17:10.364
<v Speaker 0>You got eight minute.

01:17:11.324 --> 01:17:14.205
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. Wait a second. More problem is that

01:17:14.205 --> 01:17:15.485
<v Speaker 4>I cannot

01:17:15.485 --> 01:17:16.525
<v Speaker 4>x

01:17:17.449 --> 01:17:19.130
<v Speaker 4>error for okay.

01:17:19.290 --> 01:17:20.969
<v Speaker 4>So it looks like

01:17:21.850 --> 01:17:23.610
<v Speaker 4>problem connection with the

01:17:24.250 --> 01:17:25.370
<v Speaker 4>with the cubelets.

01:17:31.845 --> 01:17:33.925
<v Speaker 0>Yep. Port one zero two fifty is a

01:17:33.925 --> 01:17:37.364
<v Speaker 0>cubelet port. So something is strange there.

01:17:38.325 --> 01:17:39.525
<v Speaker 3>Let's try.

01:17:42.005 --> 01:17:43.605
<v Speaker 4>See, like, on every node you must.

01:17:44.389 --> 01:17:46.789
<v Speaker 4>Okay. So let's try the other node.

01:17:48.869 --> 01:17:50.949
<v Speaker 3>Let's try Bandtest on this one. Let's see

01:17:50.949 --> 01:17:52.070
<v Speaker 3>now. Yeah. Okay.

01:17:52.150 --> 01:17:54.389
<v Speaker 4>I know that. Perfect. I don't know

01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:55.909
<v Speaker 4>who's who can

01:17:56.869 --> 01:17:58.790
<v Speaker 4>David, I will join you another node.

01:17:59.675 --> 01:18:02.715
<v Speaker 0>I will open on Gong worker. What what

01:18:02.715 --> 01:18:04.875
<v Speaker 0>worker do you want? Where's the payload scheduled?

01:18:05.355 --> 01:18:07.755
<v Speaker 4>Wait a second. It should be

01:18:09.355 --> 01:18:10.315
<v Speaker 0>Oops. Sorry.

01:18:10.715 --> 01:18:11.755
<v Speaker 3>What what so sorry.

01:18:19.650 --> 01:18:22.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. Alright. Worker 2. Worker 2. Right. There

01:18:22.530 --> 01:18:24.370
<v Speaker 0>is no station on Worker 2. Please feel

01:18:24.370 --> 01:18:26.290
<v Speaker 0>free to go to activity, active sessions, and

01:18:26.290 --> 01:18:26.690
<v Speaker 0>join.

01:18:28.405 --> 01:18:29.125
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

01:18:29.525 --> 01:18:32.325
<v Speaker 4>There is a Worker 2. Oh, maybe it's

01:18:32.325 --> 01:18:34.165
<v Speaker 0>not gonna get a session on Worker 2.

01:18:34.565 --> 01:18:37.845
<v Speaker 4>No. There there is no worker. Worker

01:18:37.845 --> 01:18:40.320
<v Speaker 4>1 session is available. Worker two. No. I

01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:41.999
<v Speaker 0>cannot get to Worker 2.

01:18:43.119 --> 01:18:44.880
<v Speaker 3>Now both of them are running in Worker

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:45.439
<v Speaker 3>2. You

01:18:46.159 --> 01:18:47.199
<v Speaker 3>you neither.

01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:51.199
<v Speaker 0>Because we can't access Worker 2, I will

01:18:51.199 --> 01:18:52.080
<v Speaker 0>encourage you to

01:18:52.775 --> 01:18:55.095
<v Speaker 0>record in it and move the workload to

01:18:55.095 --> 01:18:56.135
<v Speaker 0>another machine.

01:18:56.775 --> 01:18:59.495
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. Let may let's restrict maybe the the

01:18:59.655 --> 01:19:02.055
<v Speaker 3>let's restrict it to run-in worker one. Let's

01:19:02.055 --> 01:19:02.775
<v Speaker 3>try that.

01:19:03.575 --> 01:19:06.620
<v Speaker 4>What is it saying? So so should should

01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:08.780
<v Speaker 4>or should I cord but wait one second.

01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:11.020
<v Speaker 4>We started by Okay. Because I can't get

01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:12.860
<v Speaker 0>to worker one or worker two,

01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:15.900
<v Speaker 0>I am gonna help you out a little

01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:18.060
<v Speaker 0>bit here because if we can't get to

01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:19.580
<v Speaker 0>the machines, we can't fix them.

01:19:20.265 --> 01:19:21.784
<v Speaker 0>So Okay.

01:19:22.665 --> 01:19:24.585
<v Speaker 0>We're gonna card on marker one, card on

01:19:24.585 --> 01:19:26.985
<v Speaker 0>marker two Card on marker two. And we're

01:19:26.985 --> 01:19:28.265
<v Speaker 0>going to untaint

01:19:28.265 --> 01:19:29.145
<v Speaker 0>control

01:19:29.145 --> 01:19:30.025
<v Speaker 0>plan

01:19:30.025 --> 01:19:32.744
<v Speaker 0>one, and I can never remember the command.

01:19:32.745 --> 01:19:34.585
<v Speaker 0>So I'm gonna do it the hard way.

01:19:35.690 --> 01:19:36.650
<v Speaker 0>Tense.

01:19:37.290 --> 01:19:38.250
<v Speaker 4>Tense.

01:19:38.890 --> 01:19:41.130
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Your workloads can now be scheduled on

01:19:41.130 --> 01:19:42.170
<v Speaker 0>the control plan.

01:19:42.970 --> 01:19:43.690
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

01:19:44.970 --> 01:19:46.489
<v Speaker 4>So, David

01:19:47.050 --> 01:19:47.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. Okay. D

01:19:48.410 --> 01:19:49.210
<v Speaker 4>w try to

01:19:50.115 --> 01:19:51.795
<v Speaker 4>let's go and check on where the pods

01:19:51.795 --> 01:19:52.435
<v Speaker 4>are.

01:19:52.915 --> 01:19:55.555
<v Speaker 3>Yep. One second. I'm just finding the right

01:19:55.555 --> 01:19:57.635
<v Speaker 3>the right thing in the YAML.

01:19:57.875 --> 01:19:58.355
<v Speaker 3>And

01:20:01.795 --> 01:20:03.635
<v Speaker 0>The workload should have been moved for you.

01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:05.559
<v Speaker 4>Oh,

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:08.199
<v Speaker 3>okay. Let's see.

01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:10.280
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:11.320
<v Speaker 4>So

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:12.760
<v Speaker 4>let's check again.

01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:15.640
<v Speaker 4>And you need to concur.

01:20:17.115 --> 01:20:19.195
<v Speaker 0>So if that kubelet isn't able to speak

01:20:19.195 --> 01:20:21.275
<v Speaker 0>to the API server, you will have to

01:20:21.995 --> 01:20:23.915
<v Speaker 0>make a change to their deployment to force

01:20:23.915 --> 01:20:24.795
<v Speaker 0>a new one.

01:20:25.835 --> 01:20:27.035
<v Speaker 4>Oh, or

01:20:27.035 --> 01:20:28.315
<v Speaker 4>just delete the pod?

01:20:28.635 --> 01:20:30.075
<v Speaker 0>Well, the then we'll have to wait for

01:20:30.075 --> 01:20:31.755
<v Speaker 0>the five minute time out because the kubelet

01:20:31.755 --> 01:20:32.475
<v Speaker 0>isn't responsive.

01:20:34.099 --> 01:20:36.260
<v Speaker 3>Okay. So you're saying You you can try

01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:36.659
<v Speaker 0>it, but

01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:40.260
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking of deleting the replica sets.

01:20:41.219 --> 01:20:42.579
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Go for it. Let's try it and

01:20:42.579 --> 01:20:43.780
<v Speaker 0>then we'll make a decision.

<v Speaker 3>the You don't have to worry about the

01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:07.580
<v Speaker 0>stateful set. Yeah. Avid's CV and get the

01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:08.300
<v Speaker 0>pod rescheduled.

01:21:11.875 --> 01:21:12.834
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

01:21:13.155 --> 01:21:14.675
<v Speaker 0>Yes. So do you need to do the

01:21:14.675 --> 01:21:16.594
<v Speaker 0>same for the status table set now. Yeah.

01:21:17.635 --> 01:21:19.795
<v Speaker 4>We need the same for the postgres.

01:21:21.155 --> 01:21:22.435
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. So let's delete it.

01:21:26.110 --> 01:21:27.310

<v Speaker 4>No. No. Delete.

01:21:29.470 --> 01:21:31.869
<v Speaker 4>There's a typo in the delete. Typo.

01:21:33.870 --> 01:21:36.510
<v Speaker 4>And while you're there, I I would also

01:21:37.065 --> 01:21:40.185
<v Speaker 4>I would also edit the the the deployment.

01:21:40.185 --> 01:21:42.425
<v Speaker 4>Already trying to we don't have much time.

01:21:43.785 --> 01:21:45.625
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Let's get that version bumped.

01:21:45.864 --> 01:21:49.224
<v Speaker 4>Can yeah. Let's kubectl Okay. Kubectl edit

01:21:50.265 --> 01:21:51.625
<v Speaker 4>edit deployment

01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:53.500
<v Speaker 4>cluster.

01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:54.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm

01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:56.139
<v Speaker 3>sorry. I'm persistent.

01:21:56.699 --> 01:21:58.539
<v Speaker 3>You know, old habits.

01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:00.699
<v Speaker 3>Good habits also,

01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:05.820
<v Speaker 3>edit deployment. Clustered.

01:22:08.195 --> 01:22:09.875
<v Speaker 4>Enter and

01:22:10.195 --> 01:22:12.034
<v Speaker 4>down That's fine. Under from the

01:22:12.595 --> 01:22:14.195
<v Speaker 4>we want to be two.

01:22:16.195 --> 01:22:16.994
<v Speaker 4>Exit.

01:22:17.075 --> 01:22:20.115
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. So let's check on the pods.

01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:23.199
<v Speaker 3>Let's see if they did the same trick

01:22:23.199 --> 01:22:23.999
<v Speaker 3>we did.

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:27.439
<v Speaker 3>Five seconds. Okay. It's running.

01:22:28.239 --> 01:22:31.199
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's test it. Okay. So let just

01:22:37.885 --> 01:22:40.045
<v Speaker 0>Connection refused. Do you wanna try the curl?

01:22:40.765 --> 01:22:42.125
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Let's try the curl. Yeah.

01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:52.260
<v Speaker 3>Okay. So what do we see here? Felt

01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:54.179
<v Speaker 3>the connected database error

01:22:54.179 --> 01:22:56.260
<v Speaker 3>connecting to server connection time out.

01:22:56.660 --> 01:22:58.500
<v Speaker 3>Well, this is better. Okay. So so

01:22:58.980 --> 01:22:59.780
<v Speaker 4>concerns.

01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:01.060
<v Speaker 4>Somewhat.

01:23:03.185 --> 01:23:05.105
<v Speaker 4>So let's try to see, okay, what is

01:23:05.105 --> 01:23:07.185
<v Speaker 4>going with the with the post

01:23:07.665 --> 01:23:09.185
<v Speaker 4>Better based service.

01:23:11.105 --> 01:23:13.505
<v Speaker 4>It's connecting to the service, not the same

01:23:13.505 --> 01:23:14.145
<v Speaker 4>port.

01:23:14.305 --> 01:23:14.865
<v Speaker 4>Do you want?

01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:17.550
<v Speaker 4>David, do you want me to take over?

01:23:17.950 --> 01:23:19.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. Yeah. Sure. You can what do you

01:23:19.950 --> 01:23:21.870
<v Speaker 3>what do you suggest over here?

01:23:22.910 --> 01:23:23.550
<v Speaker 4>What?

01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:28.750
<v Speaker 3>No. I looked at the service of the

01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:30.565
<v Speaker 3>cluster. Maybe we should look also the service

01:23:30.645 --> 01:23:32.405
<v Speaker 3>There's no logs on the cluster pods. On

01:23:32.405 --> 01:23:33.364
<v Speaker 4>the postgres.

01:23:33.365 --> 01:23:33.925
<v Speaker 4>No.

01:23:35.045 --> 01:23:37.365
<v Speaker 4>No. There is no logs in postgres? I

01:23:37.365 --> 01:23:39.525
<v Speaker 0>would check postgres has logs. Yes.

01:23:40.085 --> 01:23:41.845
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. Let's try the postgres logs.

01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:52.820
<v Speaker 4>Okay. Server stopped.

01:23:53.619 --> 01:23:54.820
<v Speaker 4>There It looks good.

01:23:56.340 --> 01:23:57.460
<v Speaker 4>It's ain't good.

01:23:59.455 --> 01:24:00.815
<v Speaker 4>So this initialized

01:24:00.815 --> 01:24:02.015
<v Speaker 4>some functions.

01:24:02.815 --> 01:24:05.215
<v Speaker 3>Is it possible they changed the

01:24:05.455 --> 01:24:07.535
<v Speaker 3>similar to what we did with the config

01:24:07.535 --> 01:24:08.175
<v Speaker 3>file?

01:24:09.135 --> 01:24:11.695
<v Speaker 3>The config map? No. There's a create table

01:24:11.695 --> 01:24:12.575
<v Speaker 0>with an answer.

01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:15.540
<v Speaker 0>It does say your database is ready to

01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:17.940
<v Speaker 0>accept connection. I would maybe start looking at

01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:18.820
<v Speaker 0>the service.

01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:23.139
<v Speaker 4>No. But but I think okay. So this

01:24:23.139 --> 01:24:25.460
<v Speaker 4>is oh, okay. I guess so. Maybe.

01:24:28.145 --> 01:24:30.545
<v Speaker 3>Let's see if the service yep.

01:24:31.985 --> 01:24:32.785
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

01:24:33.105 --> 01:24:33.745
<v Speaker 4>So

01:24:34.065 --> 01:24:37.265
<v Speaker 4>Postgres is bound to app Postgres.

01:24:37.745 --> 01:24:39.025
<v Speaker 3>Oh, look at the port.

01:24:39.505 --> 01:24:40.705
<v Speaker 3>5431.

01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:44.999
<v Speaker 3>You see the port, Ben? Good catch. Yeah.

01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:47.400
<v Speaker 3>It's the wrong port.

01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:50.999
<v Speaker 3>Let yeah. Let's confirm just that the

01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:53.559
<v Speaker 3>our server is connecting.

01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:58.264
<v Speaker 4>Do you oh, 5432.

01:24:58.264 --> 01:25:00.344
<v Speaker 4>That's it. That should be 5432.

01:25:00.344 --> 01:25:00.985
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:25:01.225 --> 01:25:02.264
<v Speaker 3>So

01:25:10.985 --> 01:25:11.545
<v Speaker 4>2.

01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:23.320
<v Speaker 4>Okay. Let's try to David,

01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:25.800
<v Speaker 4>do we need to restart the the

01:25:25.405 --> 01:25:27.645
<v Speaker 4>clustered or or or is it No. You

01:25:27.645 --> 01:25:28.765
<v Speaker 0>should be able to try the Yeah.

01:25:29.485 --> 01:25:31.725
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. We don't need to start. And done.

01:25:31.725 --> 01:25:33.165
<v Speaker 0>Fixed. Oh,

01:25:33.725 --> 01:25:35.565
<v Speaker 4>yeah. Let's try to check.

01:25:36.445 --> 01:25:38.925
<v Speaker 0>You there? Yep. V2 and V2.

01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:41.429

<v Speaker 0>cluster.

01:26:25.405 --> 01:26:27.324
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Okay. So the reason I couldn't get

01:26:27.324 --> 01:26:29.084

<v Speaker 0>oh, well,

01:26:31.165 --> 01:26:33.565
<v Speaker 0>USW was enabled on some of the notes,

01:26:33.804 --> 01:26:35.324
<v Speaker 0>but it's not a big deal. We were

01:26:35.324 --> 01:26:36.764
<v Speaker 0>able to curl the page and that's all

01:26:36.764 --> 01:26:37.724
