<v Speaker 0>a few hundred other technologists focused in cloud

00:01:05.955 --> 00:01:08.355
<v Speaker 0>native Kubernetes and Docker and containers and all

00:01:08.355 --> 00:01:10.835
<v Speaker 0>that cool fun stuff, there's a Discord server.

00:01:10.835 --> 00:01:11.875

<v Speaker 0>in credits.

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.179
<v Speaker 0>There's roughly around four hundred hours of compute

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:27.619
<v Speaker 0>if you spend it wisely.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:28.979

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.310
<v Speaker 1>on the Internet, I'm known as Jiffy, so

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.670
<v Speaker 1>they're kinda interchangeable.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm a principal software engineer at Red Hat.

00:02:02.085 --> 00:02:05.365
<v Speaker 1>I focus mainly on CICD with, managed distributed

00:02:05.365 --> 00:02:07.445

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.060
<v Speaker 1>And I help out with Kubernetes

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.260
<v Speaker 1>community and also Slack admin, YouTube admin, that

<v Speaker 2>My day job is a customer engineer with,

00:02:33.095 --> 00:02:35.495
<v Speaker 2>the Canadian public sector at Google Cloud.

00:02:36.535 --> 00:02:39.015
<v Speaker 2>In my off hours, I do, do some,

00:02:39.335 --> 00:02:39.815
<v Speaker 2>committee.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm nervous and terrified and excited right now,

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.740
<v Speaker 2>so I'm gonna stumble a lot. It's gonna

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.380
<v Speaker 2>be fun.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.500
<v Speaker 2>I

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.459
<v Speaker 2>contribute to Kubernetes as much as I can

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.700
<v Speaker 2>where I can. I got the fun little

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.660
<v Speaker 2>Kubernetes

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.780
<v Speaker 2>contributor shirt.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.045
<v Speaker 2>I do this primarily through the monthly office

00:02:56.045 --> 00:02:58.845
<v Speaker 2>hours, which is also cohosted by, by David

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:01.405
<v Speaker 2>here and, as well Pop. So, if you're

00:03:01.405 --> 00:03:03.645
<v Speaker 2>looking to learn more about Kubernetes, that's another

00:03:03.645 --> 00:03:05.965
<v Speaker 2>great way to engage and interact with the

00:03:05.965 --> 00:03:07.485
<v Speaker 2>community and learn a lot of fun stuff.

00:03:07.485 --> 00:03:07.965
<v Speaker 2>So,

00:03:09.165 --> 00:03:11.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm excited to see what we can do

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.830
<v Speaker 2>today.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.110
<v Speaker 0>Well, anxious, excited, and scared is the three

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.270
<v Speaker 0>things I want people to feel unclustered. You're

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 0>hitting all the targets.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.070
<v Speaker 0>Quite a little sweaty.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.525
<v Speaker 0>I just wanna thank you both joining me

00:03:22.525 --> 00:03:24.685
<v Speaker 0>because you're both cornerstones of the Kubernetes and

00:03:24.685 --> 00:03:26.525
<v Speaker 0>cloud native communities. It's a pleasure to do

00:03:26.525 --> 00:03:28.845
<v Speaker 0>this with you today. So Thank you.

00:03:30.045 --> 00:03:33.004
<v Speaker 2>Alright. Quite in watch. That's the niceties over.

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:34.685
<v Speaker 0>Now we go straight out to debug.

00:03:35.805 --> 00:03:36.845
<v Speaker 2>Alright. Hold on. Hold on.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.780
<v Speaker 0>And that's nicely leads us into. We are

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.420
<v Speaker 0>starting with Jeffrey's cluster first. So, Chris, you

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.660
<v Speaker 0>and I are up. I am gonna connect

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.900
<v Speaker 0>to the control plane node of this cluster.

00:03:51.295 --> 00:03:53.375
<v Speaker 0>If you could join the active session and

00:03:53.375 --> 00:03:55.055
<v Speaker 0>type echo hello to confirm that we are

00:03:55.055 --> 00:03:57.695
<v Speaker 0>sharing a buffer, that would be appreciated.

00:03:58.495 --> 00:04:00.015
<v Speaker 2>Okay. So this is gonna show up under

00:04:00.015 --> 00:04:02.575
<v Speaker 2>activity active session? That is right. Yeah.

00:04:02.974 --> 00:04:04.780
<v Speaker 2>Okay. I was waiting for it to refresh

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:05.420
<v Speaker 2>then.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.700
<v Speaker 2>Come on.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh, maybe I'm looking at the wrong cluster.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.700
<v Speaker 0>Yep. One four five, please. Yeah. The two

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.139
<v Speaker 2>tabs open, and I definitely went to the

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.074
<v Speaker 2>wrong one. So we're off to a blazing

00:04:20.074 --> 00:04:22.074
<v Speaker 2>good start today. Alright. Well, you just joined

00:04:22.074 --> 00:04:25.514
<v Speaker 0>because my alias set forth. Thank you. Yeah.

00:04:25.514 --> 00:04:26.315
<v Speaker 0>Getting

00:04:26.315 --> 00:04:27.755
<v Speaker 0>the cube config and alias out of way

00:04:27.755 --> 00:04:29.755
<v Speaker 0>just saves so much pain as we dive

00:04:29.755 --> 00:04:31.195
<v Speaker 0>in. But I am gonna give you the

00:04:31.195 --> 00:04:33.270
<v Speaker 0>honors to run the first cube control command

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.430
<v Speaker 0>and see if we have a control plane

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.510
<v Speaker 0>or at least an API server.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.190
<v Speaker 2>Let's see let's see what we we have

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.630
<v Speaker 2>here. What kind of journey are we going

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.110
<v Speaker 2>on today?

00:04:46.425 --> 00:04:49.865
<v Speaker 2>Let's check to what notes we got. It's

00:04:49.865 --> 00:04:53.225
<v Speaker 0>all ready and working. That's that's

00:04:53.225 --> 00:04:54.505
<v Speaker 0>refreshing. Very nice.

00:04:55.625 --> 00:04:56.824
<v Speaker 2>I know I've given this.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.630
<v Speaker 0>No. There's no niceties here. You got basic

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.949
<v Speaker 0>tip control, and that's it. I thought I'd

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:02.590
<v Speaker 2>check.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. And I'm just worried that this is

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.550
<v Speaker 2>like an exam. I'm gonna forget everything I

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.510
<v Speaker 2>ever learned.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.190
<v Speaker 0>That's alright. We're just gonna be And we're

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.630
<v Speaker 0>doing this together. Talks. Yeah.

00:05:17.095 --> 00:05:17.975
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

00:05:18.455 --> 00:05:20.455
<v Speaker 0>So we have one or two restarts.

00:05:20.455 --> 00:05:23.015
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. We have both of our workloads here

00:05:23.015 --> 00:05:24.615
<v Speaker 0>at the default namespace,

00:05:24.695 --> 00:05:27.175
<v Speaker 0>but crash it back off and over a

00:05:27.175 --> 00:05:28.295
<v Speaker 0>thousand restarts.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.380
<v Speaker 2>Control c works as the copy and paste.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.860
<v Speaker 2>Right?

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.700
<v Speaker 0>It's probably gonna send a sec term to

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.180
<v Speaker 0>the

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.220
<v Speaker 0>the terminal. It does capture it and work

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.980
<v Speaker 0>it. So you might wanna do a shift

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:41.940
<v Speaker 0>and insert.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.820
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:05:44.974 --> 00:05:47.855
<v Speaker 0>Control shift and insert, whatever that is. Yeah.

00:05:50.335 --> 00:05:52.414
<v Speaker 2>Oh, I'm doing a bunch of bad stuff

00:05:52.414 --> 00:05:53.775
<v Speaker 2>right now. I'm just gonna type it out

00:05:53.775 --> 00:05:55.615
<v Speaker 2>because this is already off to a good

00:05:55.615 --> 00:05:58.014
<v Speaker 2>start. Sorry. I'll just Web terminals are my

00:05:58.014 --> 00:05:59.455
<v Speaker 2>forte. No worries. Here we go.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.150
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. There was the clustered, what,

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.630
<v Speaker 0>two months ago where I pasted down my

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.870
<v Speaker 0>password or typed my password into the session.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.310
<v Speaker 0>That was a that was a good thing.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:11.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.070
<v Speaker 2>I I might do something like that. I

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.070
<v Speaker 2>haven't done a debug on a computer in

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.070
<v Speaker 2>probably about a year, so this is gonna

00:06:16.485 --> 00:06:18.005
<v Speaker 2>be a this is good times.

00:06:19.925 --> 00:06:22.004
<v Speaker 0>I just have to reload, but I'm good.

00:06:22.004 --> 00:06:24.965
<v Speaker 0>Okay. What have we got? Readiness probe failed.

00:06:25.604 --> 00:06:26.965
<v Speaker 0>The probe failed?

00:06:27.444 --> 00:06:28.004
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.480
<v Speaker 0>let's see.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.920
<v Speaker 2>Let's see if Postgres is giving the same

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:34.640
<v Speaker 2>error.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.720
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it should be also checking

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.000
<v Speaker 2>for CRDs,

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.880
<v Speaker 2>but we'll get to that.

00:06:41.705 --> 00:06:43.785
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Let's take a look at Postgres first.

00:06:44.345 --> 00:06:44.985
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:06:48.905 --> 00:06:49.865
<v Speaker 2>Paste it.

00:06:54.425 --> 00:06:54.905
<v Speaker 2>There we go.

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:00.330
<v Speaker 0>We're just getting loads of evil faces from

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.090
<v Speaker 0>g p in the chat. So I'm not

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.610
<v Speaker 2>even looking at me. It's you're looking inside

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:04.889
<v Speaker 2>of my face. I'm like, in the terminal

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:06.729
<v Speaker 2>over here, and then the camera's over here.

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:09.095
<v Speaker 2>So hope you enjoy the side of this.

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.455
<v Speaker 2>This isn't a good bet.

00:07:11.335 --> 00:07:12.135
<v Speaker 0>So

00:07:12.135 --> 00:07:14.375
<v Speaker 0>what we see with this one then, he's

00:07:14.375 --> 00:07:16.215
<v Speaker 0>obviously changed the image because this is the

00:07:16.215 --> 00:07:18.775
<v Speaker 0>Jimmy Hong Carnetti's image on our post credits.

00:07:19.095 --> 00:07:20.775
<v Speaker 2>Apologies. I didn't even look at the images.

00:07:20.615 --> 00:07:21.415
<v Speaker 2>Was looking at what it described.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.800
<v Speaker 2>That makes that makes sense. Yeah.

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:27.120
<v Speaker 0>I wonder if that's gonna be as easy

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.120
<v Speaker 0>as just fixing that back to the postage

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.759
<v Speaker 0>image that we expect or not. But we

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:33.759
<v Speaker 0>can get we can get that a try.

00:07:38.705 --> 00:07:39.825
<v Speaker 2>Robot history.

00:07:40.225 --> 00:07:42.225
<v Speaker 0>Robot history. How fancy.

00:07:42.785 --> 00:07:43.905
<v Speaker 2>Oh, yeah.

00:07:44.145 --> 00:07:45.345
<v Speaker 2>That's what I came here for.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:48.470
<v Speaker 2>Alright.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:50.710
<v Speaker 0>Like, I think for the first four episodes,

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.070
<v Speaker 0>I would just do, like, a cube control,

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.070
<v Speaker 0>delete pods slash dash all, and then people

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.150
<v Speaker 0>kept yelling at me going, roll out, restart.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:57.990
<v Speaker 0>What are you doing, you animal? And then

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:59.430
<v Speaker 0>so I

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.190
<v Speaker 0>started to try to clean up my act

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.255
<v Speaker 0>a little bit. Less sledgehammer,

00:08:03.255 --> 00:08:04.615
<v Speaker 0>more dancing.

00:08:05.175 --> 00:08:05.655
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.600
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So we can see the

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:19.960
<v Speaker 0>revision.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.680
<v Speaker 0>But you never left a change cause. That

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.360
<v Speaker 0>was rude. No comment.

00:08:28.585 --> 00:08:31.465
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious how much of your screen is

00:08:31.465 --> 00:08:33.784
<v Speaker 1>actually off the screen because I only just

00:08:33.784 --> 00:08:36.345
<v Speaker 1>now saw error Okay. With no history. I'll

00:08:36.345 --> 00:08:37.784
<v Speaker 2>try to keep it up top. I've dragged

00:08:37.784 --> 00:08:39.704
<v Speaker 0>it back up. We should be good. Cool.

00:08:39.704 --> 00:08:42.549
<v Speaker 0>Cool. Yeah. There's yep. Yeah. Thanks for the

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:43.270
<v Speaker 0>reminder.

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:45.510
<v Speaker 0>We got a reminder in chat as well.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:46.630
<v Speaker 0>I need to stop.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:50.790
<v Speaker 1>I have Thank you. I use this window

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.870
<v Speaker 0>thing that adds padding to all my windows,

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.149
<v Speaker 0>but not quite enough for the bottom of

00:08:54.149 --> 00:08:54.870
<v Speaker 0>the screen.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:08:57.085 --> 00:08:58.205
<v Speaker 2>So I just need to check to see

00:08:58.205 --> 00:09:00.205
<v Speaker 2>if there's a hunker NetEase or something in

00:09:00.205 --> 00:09:02.925
<v Speaker 2>there, but no. I'm just gonna spin up

00:09:02.925 --> 00:09:05.005
<v Speaker 0>a local item so I've got access to

00:09:05.005 --> 00:09:07.645
<v Speaker 0>the real resources and manifests if we need

00:09:07.645 --> 00:09:08.125
<v Speaker 0>to.

00:09:08.925 --> 00:09:10.525
<v Speaker 0>Well, we will probably need to take a

00:09:10.525 --> 00:09:11.165
<v Speaker 0>look. Yeah.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.020
<v Speaker 2>Let's see what happens if I kill that

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:15.660
<v Speaker 2>pod.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.820
<v Speaker 0>Let me just do.

00:09:28.955 --> 00:09:31.515
<v Speaker 2>Journey is he gonna send me on? The

00:09:33.675 --> 00:09:36.875
<v Speaker 0>postgres image is just postgres with the tag

00:09:36.875 --> 00:09:39.435
<v Speaker 0>13 dash Alpine if you wanna try

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.480
<v Speaker 0>spinning it back. I don't know. Did you

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.760
<v Speaker 0>revert to manually there?

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.240
<v Speaker 2>Not yet. I just killed it just to

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.840
<v Speaker 2>see what would happen if when it spawns

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.480
<v Speaker 2>back up.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.440
<v Speaker 2>So I'm just waiting for it to do

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.440
<v Speaker 2>it. So it's saying, and then, yeah, we'll

00:09:52.725 --> 00:09:54.645
<v Speaker 2>we'll change the take back to normal.

00:09:57.605 --> 00:09:59.365
<v Speaker 2>This is where we twiddle our thumbs.

00:10:01.045 --> 00:10:01.845
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:10:03.605 --> 00:10:06.245
<v Speaker 1>I just want you to know that I'm

00:10:06.245 --> 00:10:07.765
<v Speaker 1>even nervous, and I'm the one that broke

00:10:07.765 --> 00:10:07.925
<v Speaker 1>it.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.199
<v Speaker 2>We're getting closer, warmer, colder?

00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:16.399
<v Speaker 1>Yes. Oh.

00:10:21.915 --> 00:10:23.435
<v Speaker 2>Alright. This is the restart. So I think

00:10:23.435 --> 00:10:26.475
<v Speaker 0>that that probe's gonna fail after x attempts.

00:10:27.915 --> 00:10:28.635
<v Speaker 2>Yep.

00:10:29.274 --> 00:10:31.035
<v Speaker 0>I I I say we just revert the

00:10:31.035 --> 00:10:33.355
<v Speaker 0>image. Oh, hello. Now Derek came to say

00:10:33.355 --> 00:10:33.915
<v Speaker 0>hello.

00:10:34.315 --> 00:10:35.035
<v Speaker 0>Say we just replaced

00:10:36.315 --> 00:10:36.875
<v Speaker 0>the image

00:10:37.629 --> 00:10:39.470
<v Speaker 0>to what we expect and then we'll try

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:41.870
<v Speaker 0>and tackle this this clustered one maybe.

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:44.110
<v Speaker 1>You know, I will I will say one

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.190
<v Speaker 1>thing. One one little tiny thing.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:48.029
<v Speaker 1>You haven't checked the logs yet.

00:10:52.695 --> 00:10:54.615
<v Speaker 1>Don't don't get me wrong. It's not gonna

00:10:54.615 --> 00:10:55.335
<v Speaker 1>help you.

00:10:55.815 --> 00:10:58.455
<v Speaker 1>Uh-oh. You just wanna show the logs. Right?

00:10:58.455 --> 00:11:00.135
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Oh, yeah.

00:11:00.455 --> 00:11:02.695
<v Speaker 2>My process is a little dated, I guess.

00:11:04.455 --> 00:11:04.855
<v Speaker 2>Alright.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:09.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. It's still running. Okay. It restarted.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:11.150
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:13.150
<v Speaker 2>fully

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:16.750
<v Speaker 2>crawled.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:18.750
<v Speaker 2>Stateful set?

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:19.790
<v Speaker 2>No.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:22.190
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. The pro schedules are the stateful set.

00:11:22.904 --> 00:11:23.545
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:11:29.545 --> 00:11:31.225
<v Speaker 0>Are you gonna update the image?

00:11:32.024 --> 00:11:34.185
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Oh, let's let's take a look at

00:11:34.185 --> 00:11:35.625
<v Speaker 0>those logs first. I wanna see what Jiffy

00:11:35.625 --> 00:11:36.584
<v Speaker 0>said in Forest.

00:11:37.464 --> 00:11:37.865
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:11:55.334 --> 00:11:57.495
<v Speaker 2>Oh, right. Because that's implied. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

00:11:57.575 --> 00:11:59.255
<v Speaker 2>That's a bad habit of mine. I always

00:11:59.255 --> 00:12:00.214
<v Speaker 2>specify.

00:12:01.654 --> 00:12:02.055
<v Speaker 2>Let's

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:06.970
<v Speaker 2>Alright. Alright.

00:12:10.009 --> 00:12:11.930
<v Speaker 0>I think it's safe to throw the image

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:13.290
<v Speaker 0>back to normal now.

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:15.930
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:19.930
<v Speaker 2>Nope. Cool.

00:12:28.245 --> 00:12:31.045
<v Speaker 2>And where are we? That's about 20 lanes.

00:12:31.045 --> 00:12:33.205
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I think it went past it. Yeah.

00:12:33.205 --> 00:12:34.085
<v Speaker 0>There you go.

00:12:34.485 --> 00:12:35.125
<v Speaker 0>Oh, wow.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.640
<v Speaker 0>Sneaky.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.600
<v Speaker 2>See what else is in here.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.520
<v Speaker 2>Expect containers.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.600
<v Speaker 0>Can you search for honk in this file?

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.680
<v Speaker 2>You're

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.720
<v Speaker 2>gonna have to remind me how to search

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.080
<v Speaker 2>in UI. Forward slash.

00:12:54.055 --> 00:12:55.175
<v Speaker 2>Forward slash.

00:12:57.654 --> 00:12:58.295
<v Speaker 2>No?

00:12:59.495 --> 00:13:00.775
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So

00:13:01.095 --> 00:13:03.015
<v Speaker 0>the state's okay. Being thought he was a

00:13:03.015 --> 00:13:04.375
<v Speaker 2>mutating webhook?

00:13:04.935 --> 00:13:06.375
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It has to be right.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.680
<v Speaker 0>Configurations,

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.920
<v Speaker 0>mutating web configuration.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.320
<v Speaker 0>We there's no auto complete. It's really annoying.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.519
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry. K get.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.160
<v Speaker 0>Mutating would you want me to type for

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:21.720
<v Speaker 0>a bit?

00:13:22.199 --> 00:13:24.575
<v Speaker 2>There you go. I have it. That hooks.

00:13:26.575 --> 00:13:29.055
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. That'd be great. Yeah. You're it's just

00:13:29.055 --> 00:13:30.575
<v Speaker 0>configurate. It's just such a weird

00:13:32.495 --> 00:13:32.735
<v Speaker 2>Nope.

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:38.810
<v Speaker 0>So it doesn't mean that there isn't one.

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:41.370
<v Speaker 0>There could be a static one in the

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:43.370
<v Speaker 0>API server manifest.

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:45.690
<v Speaker 0>Although that would be sneaky because it'd have

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:47.209
<v Speaker 0>to compile his own API server.

00:13:57.275 --> 00:13:59.275
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. You are a sneaky gif.

00:14:01.595 --> 00:14:03.675
<v Speaker 2>Okay. We can switch over to

00:14:04.075 --> 00:14:05.595
<v Speaker 2>just drop out of that and go into

00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:07.515
<v Speaker 2>one of the

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:08.150
<v Speaker 2>nodes. Right?

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:10.070
<v Speaker 0>What do you wanna check on the nodes?

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:10.470
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.190
<v Speaker 0>Oh, we can. I'm just not sure what

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:16.470
<v Speaker 0>to check on the nodes.

00:14:17.029 --> 00:14:18.630
<v Speaker 0>Like, let's let's try and think this out

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:19.430
<v Speaker 0>because this is

00:14:20.225 --> 00:14:21.425
<v Speaker 0>annoying me already.

00:14:24.464 --> 00:14:25.745
<v Speaker 0>Something is Yeah.

00:14:27.745 --> 00:14:30.144
<v Speaker 2>Just wanna take a look at the stateful

00:14:30.144 --> 00:14:31.025
<v Speaker 2>set again

00:14:31.425 --> 00:14:32.385
<v Speaker 2>or say the pod.

00:14:46.555 --> 00:14:47.595
<v Speaker 2>Map.

00:14:52.714 --> 00:14:54.875
<v Speaker 2>See if there's anything weird in here.

00:14:55.514 --> 00:14:57.675
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Do you mind if I try something?

00:14:57.915 --> 00:14:58.954
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Go for it.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:04.700
<v Speaker 0>Ever

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:06.700
<v Speaker 0>run for

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.060
<v Speaker 0>dot

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.140
<v Speaker 0>stock.

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.660
<v Speaker 0>Can you list images? Yeah. Okay.

00:15:16.485 --> 00:15:19.445
<v Speaker 2>There it is. I was wondering if there's

00:15:20.005 --> 00:15:22.005
<v Speaker 0>maybe, like, there was multiple aliases on the

00:15:22.005 --> 00:15:23.685
<v Speaker 0>image and it was you've shown us the

00:15:23.685 --> 00:15:25.125
<v Speaker 0>default even with the other one and there

00:15:25.125 --> 00:15:27.525
<v Speaker 0>was, an image pool policy perhaps,

00:15:27.765 --> 00:15:28.005
<v Speaker 0>but

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:33.410
<v Speaker 0>I don't think that's the case.

00:15:33.889 --> 00:15:35.810
<v Speaker 0>But we can rule that out

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:39.329
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm. By switching this to always.

00:15:45.735 --> 00:15:47.014
<v Speaker 0>It's not doing anything.

00:15:49.894 --> 00:15:52.935
<v Speaker 0>So I don't think my my idea is

00:15:53.735 --> 00:15:54.214
<v Speaker 0>right.

00:16:02.779 --> 00:16:03.580
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.300
<v Speaker 0>Okay. That time's gone.

00:16:11.725 --> 00:16:13.165
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. No. I keep coming back to the

00:16:13.165 --> 00:16:15.965
<v Speaker 2>webhook, but yeah. So what else could modify

00:16:15.965 --> 00:16:18.285
<v Speaker 0>something in the cluster?

00:16:21.965 --> 00:16:23.005
<v Speaker 2>So I'm

00:16:23.485 --> 00:16:24.525
<v Speaker 2>trying to think.

00:16:25.165 --> 00:16:27.085
<v Speaker 0>Let's see if there's anything

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:31.700
<v Speaker 0>suspect in the API resources.

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.500
<v Speaker 0>And I'll check one more thing before maybe

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.420
<v Speaker 0>I start trying to talk it load again,

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:41.860
<v Speaker 0>but what if we got running across the

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:42.259
<v Speaker 0>whole thing?

00:16:51.535 --> 00:16:52.175
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:16:53.214 --> 00:16:55.454
<v Speaker 0>There's only one

00:16:55.454 --> 00:16:58.100
<v Speaker 0>other thing I think this could be. And

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.180
<v Speaker 0>then I'm probably completely out of my depth.

00:17:02.339 --> 00:17:04.980
<v Speaker 0>Container d allows you to set overrides on

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:05.779
<v Speaker 0>an image.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:07.779
<v Speaker 2>I

00:17:08.179 --> 00:17:10.179
<v Speaker 2>was worried there would be some yeah.

00:17:11.054 --> 00:17:11.855
<v Speaker 2>Is

00:17:11.855 --> 00:17:14.494
<v Speaker 2>not something I've played around with yet. So

00:17:14.494 --> 00:17:16.494
<v Speaker 2>this is gonna be a fun adventure, a

00:17:16.494 --> 00:17:17.774
<v Speaker 2>learning experience.

00:17:18.575 --> 00:17:19.934
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'm not a fan of trying to

00:17:19.934 --> 00:17:20.974
<v Speaker 0>debug this stuff either.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.859
<v Speaker 2>Where is it? Container d is in Etsy.

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:28.940
<v Speaker 2>Cry?

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:32.780
<v Speaker 0>I

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:36.935
<v Speaker 2>just started studying for my CKS.

00:17:36.935 --> 00:17:39.015
<v Speaker 2>This is going to keep up with me.

00:17:41.815 --> 00:17:43.735
<v Speaker 0>So container d is running as a system

00:17:43.735 --> 00:17:46.615
<v Speaker 0>d unit, so there could be a system

00:17:46.615 --> 00:17:47.735
<v Speaker 0>d overlay maybe.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:56.590
<v Speaker 0>You try

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:01.150
<v Speaker 0>system d cat system d cat container d,

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:02.110
<v Speaker 0>and it shows

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:02.750
<v Speaker 0>the.

00:18:03.514 --> 00:18:04.794
<v Speaker 2>Alright. Sisters.

00:18:05.674 --> 00:18:07.994
<v Speaker 2>Sorry. Can't, did you say? Yeah. Cat.

00:18:08.554 --> 00:18:10.475
<v Speaker 2>Oh, cat. Yeah. That should print out all

00:18:10.475 --> 00:18:11.114
<v Speaker 0>of the

00:18:11.755 --> 00:18:13.674
<v Speaker 0>not called overlays and system d. Can't remember

00:18:13.674 --> 00:18:15.595
<v Speaker 0>what they're called. System

00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:18.394
<v Speaker 0>system CTL. We've been really Oh, sorry.

00:18:18.715 --> 00:18:19.809
<v Speaker 2>No. No worries.

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:28.930
<v Speaker 0>Nothing. I'm seeing honk just in the root

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:29.650
<v Speaker 2>words.

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:32.690
<v Speaker 2>Where is it?

00:18:36.615 --> 00:18:39.094
<v Speaker 0>And there was definitely no container d here.

00:18:40.054 --> 00:18:41.014
<v Speaker 0>There's no.

00:18:43.495 --> 00:18:44.934
<v Speaker 1>I'm a very naughty goose.

00:18:47.179 --> 00:18:48.700
<v Speaker 2>I I I appreciate it,

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.379
<v Speaker 2>This is good.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.460
<v Speaker 1>Some someone said, what's up with the guy

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:57.419
<v Speaker 1>in the middle? And I'm not talking. It's

00:18:57.419 --> 00:18:59.100
<v Speaker 1>because if I talk, I might give a

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:00.140
<v Speaker 1>hint and give it away.

00:19:00.805 --> 00:19:02.645
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Okay. So I think gonna get you

00:19:02.645 --> 00:19:04.805
<v Speaker 2>talking. We need to get you monologuing. Is

00:19:04.805 --> 00:19:06.805
<v Speaker 2>that it? I think Tahira is just not

00:19:06.805 --> 00:19:08.565
<v Speaker 0>familiar with the new format where we have

00:19:08.565 --> 00:19:11.285
<v Speaker 0>the breaker live to laugh at us. So

00:19:11.285 --> 00:19:13.685
<v Speaker 0>the breaker will be mostly quiet during their

00:19:13.685 --> 00:19:14.404
<v Speaker 0>cluster.

00:19:14.885 --> 00:19:16.740
<v Speaker 1>That's very true. Because NF, as they say,

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.380
<v Speaker 0>can be used against them. So Yeah.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:20.660
<v Speaker 0>This is

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.100
<v Speaker 0>my

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.420
<v Speaker 0>brain is struggling to understand what's going on

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:25.059
<v Speaker 0>here.

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:28.605
<v Speaker 1>Do you do you want a hint? Not

00:19:28.605 --> 00:19:29.245
<v Speaker 0>yet.

00:19:29.565 --> 00:19:30.205
<v Speaker 0>K.

00:19:32.365 --> 00:19:33.005
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:19:33.245 --> 00:19:34.684
<v Speaker 0>So the

00:19:35.325 --> 00:19:37.405
<v Speaker 0>stateful set shows the right image. That's what

00:19:37.645 --> 00:19:40.125
<v Speaker 0>that's the best grading on me because Yeah.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to think if you can

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:45.100
<v Speaker 2>have a stateful set that the pod be

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.019
<v Speaker 2>controlled by something else, but

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:50.139
<v Speaker 2>can't.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.660
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's check the control plane. It's not

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.465
<v Speaker 0>been messed with. Can we go to the

00:19:55.465 --> 00:19:58.184
<v Speaker 0>static manifests and maybe see if any of

00:19:58.184 --> 00:19:59.864
<v Speaker 0>those files look like they've been

00:20:01.145 --> 00:20:01.544
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:20:02.745 --> 00:20:03.624
<v Speaker 2>Where is it?

00:20:04.345 --> 00:20:06.424
<v Speaker 0>It's a true Kubernetes

00:20:06.424 --> 00:20:06.664
<v Speaker 0>manifest. Yeah.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. We're Kubernetes.

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:14.820
<v Speaker 2>Seeing every small Kubernetes.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.900
<v Speaker 0>That's the pressure of people watching you typing

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.020
<v Speaker 0>always just

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.380
<v Speaker 2>It's Yeah. It's a combination of stuff. Right?

00:20:24.865 --> 00:20:27.504
<v Speaker 0>Oops. Sorry. I just did the long

00:20:27.825 --> 00:20:29.345
<v Speaker 2>I was gonna do the exact same thing.

00:20:30.385 --> 00:20:32.785
<v Speaker 2>Great minds think alike, fools seldom differ. Right?

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:40.790
<v Speaker 2>So he's not been tinkering.

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:42.710
<v Speaker 0>I mean, he What did you give us

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:43.750
<v Speaker 2>access to this?

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:47.270
<v Speaker 0>Well, he could have changed the dates on

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:48.790
<v Speaker 0>them. I don't know if he'd be that

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.550
<v Speaker 0>of a terrible goose, but I'm trying to

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:51.910
<v Speaker 0>look look at his smile and see if

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:52.870
<v Speaker 0>anything's slipping out.

00:20:54.025 --> 00:20:56.265
<v Speaker 1>I'm really this is my poker face. My

00:20:56.265 --> 00:20:58.345
<v Speaker 1>my stupid smile face.

00:21:00.505 --> 00:21:03.625
<v Speaker 1>Just just take comfort in knowing in, fifteen,

00:21:03.625 --> 00:21:04.905
<v Speaker 1>twenty minutes, I'm gonna be the one in

00:21:04.905 --> 00:21:07.145
<v Speaker 1>pain. Yeah. Yeah. That's true.

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:12.619
<v Speaker 2>Where could it be?

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:16.700
<v Speaker 0>So there wasn't any mutating admission controllers.

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:20.539
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. We didn't see Kiverno. He hadn't deployed

00:21:20.539 --> 00:21:21.980
<v Speaker 0>anything new to the cluster. Right?

00:21:23.915 --> 00:21:26.475
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I did that whole namespace, I think.

00:21:26.715 --> 00:21:28.235
<v Speaker 2>I just wanna double check.

00:21:29.195 --> 00:21:29.515
<v Speaker 2>You

00:21:30.075 --> 00:21:30.875
<v Speaker 2>god.

00:21:32.955 --> 00:21:34.795
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to match together my hotkeys I

00:21:34.795 --> 00:21:36.715
<v Speaker 2>have on mine versus yours, and it's just.

00:21:41.139 --> 00:21:43.139
<v Speaker 0>And we never seen anything in the container

00:21:43.139 --> 00:21:45.459
<v Speaker 0>d directory to suggest an overlay.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:47.459
<v Speaker 0>So

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.460
<v Speaker 0>there's a command on container d.

00:21:54.095 --> 00:21:55.215
<v Speaker 0>Oh. Done.

00:21:55.535 --> 00:21:56.494
<v Speaker 2>There we go.

00:21:57.054 --> 00:21:59.294
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna have to remember this one. Thank

00:21:59.294 --> 00:21:59.774
<v Speaker 2>you.

00:22:01.135 --> 00:22:02.815
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if it's gonna be helpful,

00:22:02.815 --> 00:22:03.695
<v Speaker 0>but Could

00:22:04.255 --> 00:22:05.855
<v Speaker 2>better than staring at the screen.

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:10.650
<v Speaker 0>I'm

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:12.170
<v Speaker 0>almost at the stage of going to the

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:14.330
<v Speaker 0>root directory and doing a grep minus r

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:16.570
<v Speaker 0>honk. That that's where we're getting to here.

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:21.290
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So we got barlib container d. I'm

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:22.810
<v Speaker 0>gonna I think we should check that out.

00:22:22.995 --> 00:22:24.034
<v Speaker 0>I think

00:22:26.275 --> 00:22:27.795
<v Speaker 0>I mean, do we even know that container

00:22:27.795 --> 00:22:28.995
<v Speaker 0>d is real?

00:22:30.835 --> 00:22:32.355
<v Speaker 2>Let's see. And then you swap out the

00:22:32.355 --> 00:22:33.554
<v Speaker 2>binary. Right?

00:22:33.955 --> 00:22:36.355
<v Speaker 2>That's why I was hoping when we did

00:22:36.355 --> 00:22:36.914
<v Speaker 2>the

00:22:37.795 --> 00:22:39.679
<v Speaker 2>I'm just gonna slowly go up.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.600
<v Speaker 2>So I was hoping something would show here.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.880
<v Speaker 0>Well, let's try doing along on

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:52.720
<v Speaker 0>March 11. Okay. So maybe not.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.160
<v Speaker 0>Let's see. Version.

00:22:56.855 --> 00:23:00.054
<v Speaker 0>Doesn't say honk. That's a good thing. It's

00:23:00.054 --> 00:23:01.494
<v Speaker 2>a delightful. Alright.

00:23:04.535 --> 00:23:06.135
<v Speaker 0>Let's think out the box for two more

00:23:06.135 --> 00:23:07.894
<v Speaker 0>minutes before we maybe get a help.

00:23:08.135 --> 00:23:08.855
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:23:09.335 --> 00:23:10.615
<v Speaker 2>Just

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:11.130
<v Speaker 2>cube.

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:13.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Resources.

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:18.810
<v Speaker 2>Did we already do this? I think we

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:19.290
<v Speaker 2>did.

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:23.130
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I scanned it, but I didn't look

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:24.250
<v Speaker 0>in anger, to be fair.

00:23:29.054 --> 00:23:31.855
<v Speaker 2>It's really turning into Jake Pisteck cloud kinda

00:23:31.855 --> 00:23:33.295
<v Speaker 2>kinda scenario. I like it.

00:23:40.179 --> 00:23:41.539
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.019
<v Speaker 0>let's but we're we're not covering the basics

00:23:44.019 --> 00:23:45.860
<v Speaker 0>here. We're we're getting caught up at the

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:47.940
<v Speaker 0>moment. Let's look at the logs on container

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:49.860
<v Speaker 0>d. Let's look at the Kubernetes event log.

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:50.820
<v Speaker 0>There has to be

00:23:51.145 --> 00:23:52.424
<v Speaker 0>a there's gotta be a thread to fill

00:23:52.424 --> 00:23:54.904
<v Speaker 0>on here. There has to be. Yeah.

00:23:57.065 --> 00:23:59.065
<v Speaker 2>CTL dash l?

00:24:00.184 --> 00:24:02.745
<v Speaker 0>Dash l dash u or dash l u

00:24:02.745 --> 00:24:04.265
<v Speaker 0>and container d. Oh, yeah.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.320
<v Speaker 0>And if we don't want the pager at

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.159
<v Speaker 0>a dash f as well.

00:24:23.054 --> 00:24:24.335
<v Speaker 0>Oh, the u has to be in the

00:24:24.335 --> 00:24:25.855
<v Speaker 0>end because it's the unit name.

00:24:26.095 --> 00:24:27.534
<v Speaker 2>Alright.

00:24:29.375 --> 00:24:30.174
<v Speaker 0>What have we got?

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:35.790
<v Speaker 2>Image.

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:40.110
<v Speaker 2>Create container. Create container.

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:42.030
<v Speaker 0>Looks normal ish.

00:24:46.535 --> 00:24:47.575
<v Speaker 2>Nothing is

00:24:48.215 --> 00:24:49.255
<v Speaker 2>popping up.

00:24:49.815 --> 00:24:51.175
<v Speaker 2>So I'll take a look at these logs

00:24:51.175 --> 00:24:52.775
<v Speaker 2>again of that postgrads.

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:11.970
<v Speaker 0>So KB has asked, is there a proxy

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:12.769
<v Speaker 0>somewhere?

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:15.330
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna go on 11 and say no.

00:25:15.934 --> 00:25:17.934
<v Speaker 0>It has to be in cluster.

00:25:18.174 --> 00:25:19.294
<v Speaker 0>At least I feel it has to be

00:25:19.294 --> 00:25:21.215
<v Speaker 0>in cluster because the stateful set has the

00:25:21.215 --> 00:25:22.014
<v Speaker 0>right image.

00:25:23.695 --> 00:25:24.414
<v Speaker 2>Mhmm.

00:25:25.135 --> 00:25:27.135
<v Speaker 0>So I I I don't think it's a

00:25:27.135 --> 00:25:27.535
<v Speaker 0>proxy.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:32.669
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's try the events. Get events.

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:41.389
<v Speaker 2>Present.

00:25:46.645 --> 00:25:48.325
<v Speaker 0>We're not friends anymore,

00:25:48.325 --> 00:25:49.765
<v Speaker 0>Jeffrey. I'm sorry.

00:25:51.125 --> 00:25:53.285
<v Speaker 1>I'm not I'm not sorry, but I do

00:25:53.285 --> 00:25:54.165
<v Speaker 1>feel bad.

00:25:54.405 --> 00:25:56.485
<v Speaker 2>You've

00:25:56.485 --> 00:25:58.005
<v Speaker 2>you've done your job very well.

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:02.750
<v Speaker 0>So what I'm thinking

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:08.190
<v Speaker 0>is we could nuke

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:11.310
<v Speaker 0>the stateful set and try to reapply it

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:12.990
<v Speaker 0>to see if this weirdness persists.

00:26:14.555 --> 00:26:15.515
<v Speaker 0>But then we don't really

00:26:16.315 --> 00:26:18.635
<v Speaker 0>I suspect it may not. I'm not sure.

00:26:18.635 --> 00:26:19.835
<v Speaker 0>And then I don't know

00:26:20.715 --> 00:26:22.315
<v Speaker 0>if we'd ever find out what it is.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.600
<v Speaker 2>Could do a rollout restart.

00:26:31.159 --> 00:26:32.039
<v Speaker 0>Let's

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:33.640
<v Speaker 0>would you mind if I take for a

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.320
<v Speaker 0>moment? Because I don't really know what I

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.039
<v Speaker 0>wanna do.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.279
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. And I'm my

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.095
<v Speaker 2>brain's a lot like, maybe he replaced something

00:26:42.095 --> 00:26:43.775
<v Speaker 2>in Postgres there that's

00:26:45.295 --> 00:26:47.295
<v Speaker 2>calling the API server or

00:26:49.455 --> 00:26:51.455
<v Speaker 0>I think one thing he's done something.

00:26:52.575 --> 00:26:54.815
<v Speaker 1>I have I've absolutely done something.

00:26:55.615 --> 00:26:57.055
<v Speaker 2>Oh, can I try?

00:26:57.529 --> 00:26:59.049
<v Speaker 2>Oh, yeah. I'll let you.

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:02.890
<v Speaker 0>I just wanted to see if we had

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:05.450
<v Speaker 0>a kubelet fail here. We do not. I

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:06.889
<v Speaker 0>wanna see if

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:09.450
<v Speaker 0>our lib

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:12.090
<v Speaker 0>kubelet config has anything suspicious.

00:27:12.465 --> 00:27:14.065
<v Speaker 0>You can feel free to try whatever you

00:27:14.065 --> 00:27:14.465
<v Speaker 0>want. I

00:27:15.424 --> 00:27:18.065
<v Speaker 0>k. I'm I'm running out of ideas.

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:30.060
<v Speaker 0>API server one word, and you'll need dash

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.500
<v Speaker 0>u per unit.

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.780
<v Speaker 2>And dash l k v p I. Thanks,

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:37.820
<v Speaker 0>They're saying it's always DNS.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.740
<v Speaker 0>Maybe not. Thanks, Yeah.

00:27:41.635 --> 00:27:43.794
<v Speaker 2>There's no logs in the API server. That's

00:27:43.794 --> 00:27:44.515
<v Speaker 2>terrifying.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.360
<v Speaker 0>Oh, because the API server is a static

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.039
<v Speaker 0>pod. So we'll need to get the logs

00:27:59.039 --> 00:27:59.759
<v Speaker 0>from

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.559
<v Speaker 2>Oh, right. Yeah. It's

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.320
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.240
<v Speaker 2>It's been a while since I used it

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.605
<v Speaker 2>since they switched over to that. Yeah. This

00:28:08.605 --> 00:28:09.885
<v Speaker 0>this is if you don't if you don't

00:28:09.885 --> 00:28:12.525
<v Speaker 0>use kubidm on on a daily basis, you'll

00:28:12.525 --> 00:28:13.965
<v Speaker 0>lose track of where stuff is.

00:28:14.605 --> 00:28:17.005
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Alright. I'm I'm I think I'm gonna

00:28:17.005 --> 00:28:18.285
<v Speaker 0>ask for a hint. What do you think,

00:28:18.285 --> 00:28:19.725
<v Speaker 0>Chris? Will we get a hint? Yeah.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.400
<v Speaker 2>Unless he wants to watch us flail for

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.360
<v Speaker 2>a little bit longer.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:25.480
<v Speaker 1>No. No.

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.760
<v Speaker 1>However, you get one of two hints. You

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.520
<v Speaker 1>can either get a hint, which is the

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.840
<v Speaker 1>backstory of what happened to the cluster, or

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.840
<v Speaker 1>you can get a hint about something you've

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:35.320
<v Speaker 1>already done.

00:28:37.135 --> 00:28:39.135
<v Speaker 0>Cool. So did we get close at some

00:28:39.135 --> 00:28:39.695
<v Speaker 0>point?

00:28:41.375 --> 00:28:42.095
<v Speaker 1>Pick pick your

00:28:44.735 --> 00:28:45.855
<v Speaker 2>do you wanna do, dude?

00:28:46.575 --> 00:28:48.815
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna leave this decision entirely up to

00:28:48.815 --> 00:28:49.855
<v Speaker 0>you. What do you want?

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:55.530
<v Speaker 2>I'll take the hint of for something we

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:57.450
<v Speaker 2>got close to. The story is appealing, but

00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:58.890
<v Speaker 2>I think we can we might be able

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:00.890
<v Speaker 2>to ink the thread a little.

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:04.410
<v Speaker 1>Right idea, wrong folder earlier.

00:29:05.875 --> 00:29:08.274
<v Speaker 0>It has to be the container d overlay.

00:29:09.794 --> 00:29:10.595
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

00:29:10.835 --> 00:29:11.554
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:29:11.715 --> 00:29:13.315
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you one other hint.

00:29:13.794 --> 00:29:15.075
<v Speaker 1>Not container d.

00:29:17.395 --> 00:29:19.794
<v Speaker 2>Always move to config somewhere?

00:29:19.875 --> 00:29:20.115
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:22.830
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So the static

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:26.110
<v Speaker 0>pod directory could have been reconfigured.

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:28.110
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So we wanna take a look at

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:28.669
<v Speaker 0>the

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:31.789
<v Speaker 0>Kiplit config after all maybe.

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:36.185
<v Speaker 1>See, See, part of my problem is I

00:29:36.185 --> 00:29:38.424
<v Speaker 1>don't know whether to say warmer or colder.

00:29:39.465 --> 00:29:40.825
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know how much you want

00:29:40.825 --> 00:29:42.425
<v Speaker 1>to flail. I don't know how much fun

00:29:42.425 --> 00:29:44.905
<v Speaker 1>other people are having watching you.

00:29:45.145 --> 00:29:47.145
<v Speaker 0>People seem to enjoy watching me suffer on

00:29:47.145 --> 00:29:48.185
<v Speaker 0>the show. I've gotta say.

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:52.809
<v Speaker 2>It seems to be the fun part, at

00:29:52.809 --> 00:29:54.490
<v Speaker 2>least the the learning part. I watched the

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:57.210
<v Speaker 2>session yesterday and a couple others, and it's

00:29:57.210 --> 00:29:59.850
<v Speaker 2>entertaining just seeing the how people try to

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:02.090
<v Speaker 2>approach debugging the clusters. And

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:06.170
<v Speaker 1>I I love seeing people work real time

00:30:05.625 --> 00:30:08.024
<v Speaker 1>because everyone works and troubleshoot differently.

00:30:08.505 --> 00:30:09.225
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:30:11.065 --> 00:30:13.945
<v Speaker 2>Like, yesterday, there were some awesome awesome hints.

00:30:14.585 --> 00:30:16.505
<v Speaker 1>I will I will also say

00:30:16.825 --> 00:30:17.705
<v Speaker 1>that

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:20.590
<v Speaker 1>I was going to do something different

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:23.710
<v Speaker 1>because I thought this idea was way too

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:24.350
<v Speaker 1>mean.

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:26.510
<v Speaker 2>And when I saw some of your previous

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:27.950
<v Speaker 1>episodes and went, nope.

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:30.605
<v Speaker 1>Nope. I'm gonna do it.

00:30:33.965 --> 00:30:34.525
<v Speaker 1>I

00:30:35.805 --> 00:30:38.285
<v Speaker 1>did I did get opinions from both Christophe

00:30:38.285 --> 00:30:39.325
<v Speaker 1>and Bob

00:30:39.485 --> 00:30:41.325
<v Speaker 1>about whether this was too mean or not.

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:45.870
<v Speaker 1>Here we are. Okay.

00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:51.950
<v Speaker 2>Alright. I'm just gonna cut this.

00:31:04.024 --> 00:31:05.784
<v Speaker 1>And I will I will leave it up

00:31:05.784 --> 00:31:07.705
<v Speaker 1>to both of you whether you want another

00:31:07.705 --> 00:31:08.424
<v Speaker 1>hint or not.

00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:12.110
<v Speaker 0>Can we just let that fail again?

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:14.750
<v Speaker 0>So the static pod path had not changed,

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:15.630
<v Speaker 0>which I

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:17.710
<v Speaker 0>am happy to see.

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:19.549
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:21.390
<v Speaker 2>I was gonna move over to the cube

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:23.955
<v Speaker 2>API one again, see if there's anything kinda

00:31:24.275 --> 00:31:26.914
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. Red herring there. Yeah. That's it.

00:31:28.035 --> 00:31:30.355
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I guess, yeah, the the next hint

00:31:30.355 --> 00:31:31.955
<v Speaker 2>would probably depend on how much time we

00:31:31.955 --> 00:31:32.435
<v Speaker 2>have left.

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:42.420
<v Speaker 2>I cannot remember.

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:47.780
<v Speaker 0>So

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:50.020
<v Speaker 0>the hand was wrong directory.

00:31:52.135 --> 00:31:55.174
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. You you were you were talking about

00:31:55.495 --> 00:31:59.015
<v Speaker 1>something something, but it was the wrong directory

00:31:59.015 --> 00:32:00.375
<v Speaker 1>just to think about it.

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:08.509
<v Speaker 2>Oh.

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:10.669
<v Speaker 0>What directory is it looking to?

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:13.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I'm trying to we've been in Let

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:15.790
<v Speaker 1>let me let me also say, not just

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:17.310
<v Speaker 1>wrong directory, wrong project.

00:32:22.755 --> 00:32:24.515
<v Speaker 2>Do you put Cryo in here?

00:32:27.715 --> 00:32:29.635
<v Speaker 0>No. There's no there's no Cryo.

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:37.049
<v Speaker 0>I'm pretty sure. I

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:43.210
<v Speaker 1>will I will tell you the story of

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:44.090
<v Speaker 1>the cluster.

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:45.529
<v Speaker 1>This cluster

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:47.370
<v Speaker 1>was a cluster

00:32:47.465 --> 00:32:49.144
<v Speaker 1>run by an intern

00:32:49.385 --> 00:32:50.585
<v Speaker 1>at a school.

00:32:51.385 --> 00:32:53.865
<v Speaker 1>Nothing really important was running on the cluster,

00:32:54.265 --> 00:32:55.784
<v Speaker 1>but we got a

00:32:56.905 --> 00:32:59.145
<v Speaker 1>notice that we needed to upgrade the cluster.

00:32:59.145 --> 00:33:00.905
<v Speaker 1>So the intern upgraded the cluster.

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:02.250
<v Speaker 1>I

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:04.330
<v Speaker 1>don't know how they upgraded the cluster, but

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:04.970
<v Speaker 1>they did.

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:08.090
<v Speaker 1>And then six months later, all of a

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:10.330
<v Speaker 1>sudden, we have this we have this issue

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:12.090
<v Speaker 1>where we can't schedule any workloads.

00:33:17.885 --> 00:33:19.164
<v Speaker 0>That that's our hint?

00:33:19.565 --> 00:33:20.205
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:33:21.725 --> 00:33:22.765
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like certs.

00:33:29.299 --> 00:33:32.019
<v Speaker 2>Oversell to the it it can

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:34.260
<v Speaker 2>what? I wanna see what happens if you

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:37.059
<v Speaker 2>deploy a pod. Can we just do, like,

00:33:37.059 --> 00:33:37.539
<v Speaker 2>a

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:40.325
<v Speaker 2>NGINX deploy just to see if that goes

00:33:40.325 --> 00:33:40.885
<v Speaker 2>up. Or

00:33:42.565 --> 00:33:43.205
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:33:48.405 --> 00:33:49.284
<v Speaker 1>Oops. Please.

00:33:51.605 --> 00:33:53.765
<v Speaker 2>I'm really excited. I can I know this

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:54.880
<v Speaker 0>You you can type?

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.680
<v Speaker 0>It worked. Okay. We're put a load on

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.360
<v Speaker 0>it, make sure it actually is NGINX.

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:02.560
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:34:09.125 --> 00:34:10.324
<v Speaker 2>You,

00:34:16.244 --> 00:34:17.284
<v Speaker 2>my friend

00:34:19.764 --> 00:34:21.710
<v Speaker 2>Ugh. Having a good time. I

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:25.310
<v Speaker 0>I'm glad to chat or join it.

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:31.389
<v Speaker 0>You are creative.

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:33.869
<v Speaker 0>And you're saying it's not container d. So

00:34:33.869 --> 00:34:35.469
<v Speaker 0>it must be the kubelet. Right? Something

00:34:37.715 --> 00:34:38.675
<v Speaker 0>I'm committed

00:34:39.635 --> 00:34:41.395
<v Speaker 0>to working on what he's done to our

00:34:41.395 --> 00:34:44.435
<v Speaker 0>kubelet now. So let's

00:34:44.435 --> 00:34:46.035
<v Speaker 0>go take a look at

00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:54.870
<v Speaker 0>No. Okay. Next.

00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:58.630
<v Speaker 2>Okay. So using standard here. Barrelib.

00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:59.590
<v Speaker 0>Kiplit.

00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:01.030
<v Speaker 0>We already looked at this.

00:35:05.365 --> 00:35:07.525
<v Speaker 1>I also do have one more hint when

00:35:07.525 --> 00:35:08.325
<v Speaker 1>you're ready.

00:35:09.765 --> 00:35:11.605
<v Speaker 0>Don't talk to me. What's he doing?

00:35:14.405 --> 00:35:15.685
<v Speaker 0>What's he doing?

00:35:17.525 --> 00:35:18.165
<v Speaker 0>Let's do.

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:23.630
<v Speaker 0>Nope.

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:26.990
<v Speaker 0>Let's do k.

00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:30.990
<v Speaker 2>I

00:35:32.109 --> 00:35:33.870
<v Speaker 0>mean, that is all of

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:37.615
<v Speaker 2>the Can we list the pods that are

00:35:37.615 --> 00:35:40.575
<v Speaker 2>running again? Oh oh, what? No. Never mind.

00:35:41.135 --> 00:35:42.255
<v Speaker 2>I thought I saw something.

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:53.620
<v Speaker 2>Can we see what Hunker NetEase is running?

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:54.340
<v Speaker 2>Or

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:56.740
<v Speaker 2>can we check the logs on Hunker NetEase?

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:58.740
<v Speaker 0>I'm being silly. Right? He he he won't

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:00.900
<v Speaker 0>have affected the Kubeflow on this machine.

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:03.995
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm. So we're I just wanna see what

00:36:03.995 --> 00:36:06.395
<v Speaker 2>that We need to be on this machine.

00:36:08.635 --> 00:36:11.435
<v Speaker 0>Which one? S x six.

00:36:13.355 --> 00:36:15.675
<v Speaker 0>Because workloads won't be scheduled to the control

00:36:15.675 --> 00:36:17.515
<v Speaker 0>plane, and we're bouncing around the control plane,

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:21.060
<v Speaker 0>which I think is very naive of me.

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:22.020
<v Speaker 0>So

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.420
<v Speaker 0>I've opened a session on s x six

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:25.780
<v Speaker 0>if you wanna join.

00:36:25.859 --> 00:36:27.300
<v Speaker 2>Yes, yes I do.

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:31.540
<v Speaker 0>And let's look for irregularities on this kubelet.

00:36:35.984 --> 00:36:38.145
<v Speaker 0>Let me just reload since you've joined.

00:36:39.345 --> 00:36:39.985
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:36:41.984 --> 00:36:42.545
<v Speaker 0>So

00:36:44.625 --> 00:36:45.665
<v Speaker 0>barlib.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:36:59.800
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.160
<v Speaker 0>That looks okay.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:02.520
<v Speaker 0>Next

00:37:05.945 --> 00:37:07.465
<v Speaker 0>Our flags here.

00:37:11.705 --> 00:37:13.465
<v Speaker 0>Let's take a look at the parameters.

00:37:32.905 --> 00:37:33.625
<v Speaker 2>What?

00:37:40.985 --> 00:37:42.105
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.

00:37:43.225 --> 00:37:44.025
<v Speaker 2>It was good.

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:48.000
<v Speaker 2>What I didn't bother.

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:51.200
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We're gonna give it five more minutes

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:51.760
<v Speaker 0>and then

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.120
<v Speaker 1>Are you gonna wanna know the answer or

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:56.720
<v Speaker 1>you're wanna put this in the pocket?

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:01.015
<v Speaker 0>No. No. We'll get the answer. Alright. Yeah.

00:38:01.015 --> 00:38:02.695
<v Speaker 0>The audience will demand it.

00:38:04.215 --> 00:38:07.175
<v Speaker 2>We need clarity for what what your nefarious

00:38:07.175 --> 00:38:08.375
<v Speaker 2>honking you did.

00:38:09.895 --> 00:38:11.655
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Can I ask a couple of questions

00:38:11.655 --> 00:38:12.455
<v Speaker 0>right before you

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.560
<v Speaker 1>I let me let me also give you

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.160
<v Speaker 1>one hint, the last hint I was gonna

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:19.000
<v Speaker 1>give? We talked about

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.640
<v Speaker 1>our backgrounds when we first joined the call

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:23.720
<v Speaker 1>before we went live, and I said what

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:24.600
<v Speaker 1>my background was.

00:38:28.365 --> 00:38:30.605
<v Speaker 1>I'm a developer. I'm not an ops person.

00:38:34.685 --> 00:38:36.205
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead and ask your questions.

00:38:37.005 --> 00:38:38.525
<v Speaker 0>Should we be in a control plane node

00:38:38.525 --> 00:38:39.645
<v Speaker 0>or the worker node?

00:38:39.885 --> 00:38:40.285
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:49.800
<v Speaker 2>Did you build your own container to do

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:50.360
<v Speaker 2>something?

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:53.400
<v Speaker 1>I did not. Well, technically, I built honker

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.320
<v Speaker 1>Netty's Jiffy, but I didn't build Fair.

00:38:56.445 --> 00:38:57.725
<v Speaker 1>I didn't build postgres.

00:38:57.725 --> 00:38:59.405
<v Speaker 1>I didn't build a new clustered.

00:38:59.885 --> 00:39:00.605
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:39:05.565 --> 00:39:07.645
<v Speaker 2>Just does the binary, wasn't it?

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:11.000
<v Speaker 0>How did you get the strings or something

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:11.640
<v Speaker 0>again?

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.040
<v Speaker 0>I don't remember. I thought it was just

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:15.080
<v Speaker 0>string. I

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.200
<v Speaker 1>will I will also save you time. I

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.280
<v Speaker 1>did not put any honk bread crumbs in

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:21.320
<v Speaker 1>outside of the log.

00:39:25.255 --> 00:39:26.935
<v Speaker 0>Did you build your own criplet?

00:39:29.974 --> 00:39:31.255
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Alright.

00:39:33.734 --> 00:39:34.535
<v Speaker 0>I've got an idea.

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:38.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like, how do we

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:39.900
<v Speaker 2>why

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:44.780
<v Speaker 0>is that not working?

00:39:48.075 --> 00:39:49.835
<v Speaker 0>I'll keep it Oh, yeah. And it really

00:39:49.835 --> 00:39:51.115
<v Speaker 0>needs to remove everything.

00:39:51.115 --> 00:39:54.235
<v Speaker 0>No. I have bar, the cache.

00:39:55.515 --> 00:39:57.035
<v Speaker 0>I have bar cache

00:39:58.955 --> 00:39:59.675
<v Speaker 0>as after.

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:10.450
<v Speaker 0>I was hoping for a nice debian package

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:11.090
<v Speaker 0>here.

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:13.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. How do we do a reinstall? Aft

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:14.210
<v Speaker 0>install.

00:40:22.994 --> 00:40:24.675
<v Speaker 0>Well, it's good. I've just upgraded to Kiplit

00:40:24.675 --> 00:40:26.035
<v Speaker 0>too, so there we go.

00:40:26.755 --> 00:40:28.355
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully, that doesn't make new breaks.

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:44.090
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I think we have the normal back

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:46.250
<v Speaker 0>on this machine, but that doesn't mean

00:40:46.865 --> 00:40:48.464
<v Speaker 0>that he hasn't done that on every other

00:40:48.464 --> 00:40:51.265
<v Speaker 0>node, assuming he has Yeah. Has his own

00:40:51.265 --> 00:40:51.985
<v Speaker 0>kuplet.

00:40:54.785 --> 00:40:56.785
<v Speaker 2>I can go back to the other one,

00:40:56.785 --> 00:40:58.225
<v Speaker 2>and I can restart.

00:40:58.944 --> 00:40:59.665
<v Speaker 0>And, hopefully, that

00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:02.170
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Feel free just to And your next

00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:03.370
<v Speaker 0>is back up and running.

00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:05.370
<v Speaker 2>Or it's wait. No. We need to check

00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:06.170
<v Speaker 2>vlogs.

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:08.490
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's not been restarted yet.

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:10.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I got I got excited. I saw

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:13.050
<v Speaker 2>the one. It's like, yes. I'm gonna go

00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:15.610
<v Speaker 0>check the other two machines just in case

00:41:14.895 --> 00:41:17.215
<v Speaker 0>the is different on them all.

00:41:17.535 --> 00:41:19.775
<v Speaker 0>If you wanna change the workload.

00:41:20.975 --> 00:41:21.855
<v Speaker 1>I will

00:41:22.095 --> 00:41:23.215
<v Speaker 1>I will say,

00:41:23.455 --> 00:41:24.735
<v Speaker 1>you are correct.

00:41:26.015 --> 00:41:27.775
<v Speaker 1>You have you have solved it.

00:41:28.415 --> 00:41:30.735
<v Speaker 1>However, there was a second part of this,

00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:32.630
<v Speaker 1>which is you have to assume that all

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:35.030
<v Speaker 1>of the nodes and the cluster itself are

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.750
<v Speaker 1>owned.

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:38.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh. There

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:43.670
<v Speaker 1>are no root there

00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:46.635
<v Speaker 1>are no kernel changes. We did not host

00:41:46.635 --> 00:41:48.075
<v Speaker 1>the operating system.

00:41:49.115 --> 00:41:51.835
<v Speaker 2>You just repointed us to the an outside

00:41:51.835 --> 00:41:52.635
<v Speaker 2>cluster?

00:41:53.115 --> 00:41:55.515
<v Speaker 1>No. No. I think didn't Seconk do that

00:41:55.515 --> 00:41:58.155
<v Speaker 1>or, like, roll into a cluster inside of

00:41:58.155 --> 00:42:00.420
<v Speaker 1>a cluster? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:06.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm giving it to you because

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:09.540
<v Speaker 1>you you have absolutely figured it out. I

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:11.619
<v Speaker 1>compiled my own cubelet and placed it on

00:42:11.619 --> 00:42:12.260
<v Speaker 1>all of the notes.

00:42:14.435 --> 00:42:15.635
<v Speaker 1>What you what

00:42:16.755 --> 00:42:17.795
<v Speaker 1>you don't see

00:42:18.115 --> 00:42:20.515
<v Speaker 1>is in my terminal window every sixty seconds,

00:42:20.515 --> 00:42:22.435
<v Speaker 1>I'm SSH ing to those nodes and overwriting

00:42:22.435 --> 00:42:24.595
<v Speaker 1>cubelet if it's been changed. Because I wasn't

00:42:24.595 --> 00:42:25.875
<v Speaker 1>sure how long this was gonna take and

00:42:25.875 --> 00:42:26.595
<v Speaker 1>now I feel bad.

00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:31.530
<v Speaker 1>So I've already seen

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:34.090
<v Speaker 1>I've already updated Qubelet twice so far.

00:42:36.810 --> 00:42:39.690
<v Speaker 2>You're very quiet, Tanya. That that last bit

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:40.090
<v Speaker 0>is

00:42:41.055 --> 00:42:42.575
<v Speaker 0>I mean, we'd we'd never

00:42:42.815 --> 00:42:44.575
<v Speaker 0>be able to work that out. That's harsh.

00:42:44.575 --> 00:42:46.255
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. But Yeah. It's a nice one. Well

00:42:46.255 --> 00:42:48.415
<v Speaker 0>played. The the idea was

00:42:48.815 --> 00:42:51.055
<v Speaker 1>if someone has a cluster that they didn't

00:42:51.055 --> 00:42:52.974
<v Speaker 1>know, like, how it was installed or how

00:42:52.974 --> 00:42:55.135
<v Speaker 1>it was managed, they can't actually validate the

00:42:55.135 --> 00:42:58.360
<v Speaker 1>supply chain. So they can't validate that Cubelet

00:42:58.360 --> 00:42:59.960
<v Speaker 1>is actually what it should be.

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:04.280
<v Speaker 1>And if a cluster has been taken hostage,

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:07.560
<v Speaker 1>just fixing the cluster isn't necessarily gonna fix

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:08.040
<v Speaker 1>the cluster.

00:43:08.645 --> 00:43:10.085
<v Speaker 1>That was that was my idea. That was

00:43:10.085 --> 00:43:12.484
<v Speaker 1>my little Disney story arc of being really,

00:43:12.484 --> 00:43:14.165
<v Speaker 1>really mean. I'm sorry. So from now on

00:43:14.405 --> 00:43:16.964
<v Speaker 0>Good. I'm disabling SSH access on all of

00:43:16.964 --> 00:43:18.405
<v Speaker 0>these machines. That's crazy.

00:43:19.285 --> 00:43:21.525
<v Speaker 2>Hey. Well done, sir. I I stopped you

00:43:21.525 --> 00:43:22.805
<v Speaker 1>before that came into play.

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:27.619
<v Speaker 1>But it's probably a good idea. Yeah. See,

00:43:27.619 --> 00:43:28.820
<v Speaker 0>this is one of the thing. This has

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:31.460
<v Speaker 0>happened before, right, with the binaries on the

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:32.660
<v Speaker 0>machines is that

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:35.940
<v Speaker 0>if someone does swap out the binary that

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:37.380
<v Speaker 0>is 99%

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:39.155
<v Speaker 0>functional, it's really hard.

00:43:39.875 --> 00:43:41.875
<v Speaker 0>Like we need better at and through Falco

00:43:41.875 --> 00:43:43.315
<v Speaker 0>and there's other tools that we can work

00:43:43.315 --> 00:43:44.675
<v Speaker 0>in the space that would tell us this.

00:43:44.675 --> 00:43:46.515
<v Speaker 0>But you know, by default, we have no

00:43:46.515 --> 00:43:48.595
<v Speaker 0>idea that those binaries have been swapped underneath

00:43:48.595 --> 00:43:49.715
<v Speaker 0>us. And that's

00:43:50.369 --> 00:43:51.410
<v Speaker 0>a common

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:53.250
<v Speaker 0>theme there that I'm seeing people abusing on

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:55.089
<v Speaker 0>this show. So nice nicely done.

00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:57.329
<v Speaker 1>I I feel like it is a really

00:43:57.329 --> 00:43:59.490
<v Speaker 1>good lesson because that's also something like, that's

00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:01.250
<v Speaker 1>a problem if you're running your own cluster.

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:04.049
<v Speaker 1>Like, that's a benefit of managed offerings is

00:44:04.365 --> 00:44:06.045
<v Speaker 1>they're they are going to be the ones

00:44:06.045 --> 00:44:08.605
<v Speaker 1>managing the whole supply chain start to finish.

00:44:08.685 --> 00:44:10.365
<v Speaker 1>When you're managing your own, there are just

00:44:10.365 --> 00:44:11.725
<v Speaker 1>so many different things you need to think

00:44:11.725 --> 00:44:13.965
<v Speaker 1>about. Yeah. I'm gonna write a script to

00:44:13.965 --> 00:44:17.485
<v Speaker 0>start doing checksums and all the binaries. I've

00:44:17.645 --> 00:44:18.925
<v Speaker 1>I've seriously considered,

00:44:18.925 --> 00:44:21.370
<v Speaker 1>like, starting that as a project just because

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:23.610
<v Speaker 1>of this idea. Like, there is no real

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:26.010
<v Speaker 1>good way to do that across the whole

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:26.650
<v Speaker 1>stack.

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:30.330
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Alright. Well played. Now,

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:31.450
<v Speaker 0>we switch roles.

00:44:32.205 --> 00:44:34.445
<v Speaker 1>Yep. Now I'm gonna feel the pain.

00:44:34.925 --> 00:44:35.485
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully.

00:44:37.005 --> 00:44:38.605
<v Speaker 2>Like, this is this is my first time

00:44:38.605 --> 00:44:40.925
<v Speaker 2>purposely breaking a cluster. So this is either

00:44:40.925 --> 00:44:42.845
<v Speaker 2>gonna be really easy or it's gonna be

00:44:42.845 --> 00:44:43.165
<v Speaker 2>interesting.

00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:48.050
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, I have opened a session on

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:50.610
<v Speaker 0>Chrissy's control plane. If you could please join

00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:52.450
<v Speaker 0>and just give me an echo or something

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:54.210
<v Speaker 0>so that we know. I'll set up the

00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:55.410
<v Speaker 0>KubeConfig.

00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:56.850
<v Speaker 1>Session.

00:44:57.705 --> 00:45:00.505
<v Speaker 1>I I already see typing. Yeah. I get

00:45:00.505 --> 00:45:02.265
<v Speaker 0>a weird screen refresh when that happens and

00:45:02.265 --> 00:45:04.505
<v Speaker 0>my scroll breaks. I'm just gonna reload. It's

00:45:04.505 --> 00:45:06.505
<v Speaker 0>a teleport. It's such a cool project, but

00:45:06.505 --> 00:45:07.865
<v Speaker 0>they need to fix this bug.

00:45:08.905 --> 00:45:11.369
<v Speaker 0>Alright. No more hump, please. Come on. Right.

00:45:11.369 --> 00:45:12.090
<v Speaker 0>I

00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:14.170
<v Speaker 0>will give you the pleasure of seeing if

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:15.290
<v Speaker 0>we have a control plan.

00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:20.490
<v Speaker 1>So far we do.

00:45:23.305 --> 00:45:25.225
<v Speaker 1>So far, we are only missing

00:45:25.785 --> 00:45:27.305
<v Speaker 1>the the website.

00:45:30.985 --> 00:45:32.185
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna try, George.

00:45:33.305 --> 00:45:34.345
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna try.

00:45:34.745 --> 00:45:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Make. Please make me try.

00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:40.450
<v Speaker 1>Interesting. So we have zero of one deployments

00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:41.170
<v Speaker 1>ready.

00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Nothing up to date.

00:45:52.305 --> 00:45:54.625
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So I I just realized that it's

00:45:54.625 --> 00:45:56.705
<v Speaker 1>not gonna show. So I'm scrolling through here

00:45:57.025 --> 00:45:58.865
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah. Just to see yeah.

00:45:59.025 --> 00:46:00.785
<v Speaker 1>So there's one desired,

00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:03.030
<v Speaker 1>zero updated,

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:04.550
<v Speaker 1>two unavailable.

00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:09.590
<v Speaker 1>Also, rolling update strategy, 25%

00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:12.230
<v Speaker 1>max unavailable, 25% max surge.

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:14.230
<v Speaker 0>Well, it looks like we got an old

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:16.070
<v Speaker 0>replica set and a new replica set.

00:46:16.485 --> 00:46:17.765
<v Speaker 0>Maybe something

00:46:19.605 --> 00:46:21.285
<v Speaker 0>is there no scheduler,

00:46:21.605 --> 00:46:22.165
<v Speaker 0>maybe?

00:46:23.605 --> 00:46:25.685
<v Speaker 1>You you go hard already.

00:46:27.125 --> 00:46:28.965
<v Speaker 2>I think he's had a rough rough couple

00:46:28.965 --> 00:46:29.365
<v Speaker 2>sessions.

00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:37.069
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna be checking the checksums on every

00:46:37.069 --> 00:46:38.190
<v Speaker 2>binary.

00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:42.910
<v Speaker 0>Oh, we have admission. Oh, gatekeeper. Nice.

00:46:45.195 --> 00:46:45.995
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:46:46.635 --> 00:46:47.275
<v Speaker 1>So

00:46:47.995 --> 00:46:51.115
<v Speaker 1>error creating admission webhook validation gatekeeper S h

00:46:51.115 --> 00:46:53.995
<v Speaker 1>a s h. Yep. Denied the request. So

00:46:53.995 --> 00:46:55.435
<v Speaker 1>gatekeeper's been installed

00:46:56.235 --> 00:46:58.235
<v Speaker 1>and apparently is denying

00:46:59.099 --> 00:47:01.660
<v Speaker 1>all pods must have a clustered label for

00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:03.020
<v Speaker 1>branding and association.

00:47:03.339 --> 00:47:04.460
<v Speaker 1>So, Chris,

00:47:05.099 --> 00:47:06.140
<v Speaker 1>if I

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:08.220
<v Speaker 1>add that label, what's gonna happen?

00:47:08.619 --> 00:47:09.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh, you're just gonna find out.

00:47:13.185 --> 00:47:14.625
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna try to drag this out as

00:47:14.625 --> 00:47:16.225
<v Speaker 2>long as humanly possible.

00:47:20.545 --> 00:47:22.305
<v Speaker 1>So let's edit this.

00:47:23.585 --> 00:47:25.505
<v Speaker 1>I'm bad at the Kubernetes.

00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:28.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh, okay.

00:47:28.589 --> 00:47:30.350
<v Speaker 0>You can just add labels.

00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:32.910
<v Speaker 0>You want me to do it? Yeah, please.

00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:34.750
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:35.630
<v Speaker 0>So

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:38.190
<v Speaker 0>what was the warning on? Was it on

00:47:37.755 --> 00:47:39.914
<v Speaker 0>the pod? Was it on the it won't

00:47:39.914 --> 00:47:41.115
<v Speaker 0>be the pod. It was the pod. Right?

00:47:41.115 --> 00:47:42.474
<v Speaker 0>So we need to It was the pod.

00:47:42.474 --> 00:47:43.914
<v Speaker 1>So, yeah, we need to add the label.

00:47:43.914 --> 00:47:46.155
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I'm dumb. Yep.

00:47:48.154 --> 00:47:48.555
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:57.220
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So we've added our label. Do we

00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:58.100
<v Speaker 0>have pods?

00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:00.420
<v Speaker 0>Of course not. Alright.

00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:02.820
<v Speaker 1>So whoop.

00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Control w does not work in terminal browser.

00:48:07.925 --> 00:48:10.005
<v Speaker 0>I've done that so many things.

00:48:11.125 --> 00:48:12.885
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

00:48:13.845 --> 00:48:15.845
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no. We got No. Alright. So the

00:48:15.845 --> 00:48:16.725
<v Speaker 0>replica set

00:48:17.765 --> 00:48:19.685
<v Speaker 0>Oh, we got an invalid. Alright. Okay. So

00:48:19.685 --> 00:48:22.200
<v Speaker 0>we've also got something blocking us from deploying

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:24.760
<v Speaker 0>anything that isn't an ancient database to IO

00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:26.040
<v Speaker 0>repository.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.600
<v Speaker 0>So we need to take a look at

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:29.320
<v Speaker 0>the

00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:31.400
<v Speaker 0>what does gatekeeper call policies again?

00:48:36.625 --> 00:48:38.625
<v Speaker 2>So I've tried to pepper some Stargate references

00:48:38.625 --> 00:48:39.825
<v Speaker 2>throughout this. Just

00:48:40.785 --> 00:48:43.185
<v Speaker 0>Appreciate it. I always appreciate that.

00:48:43.265 --> 00:48:44.305
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.

00:48:45.745 --> 00:48:48.385
<v Speaker 0>So we got required labels.

00:48:48.705 --> 00:48:51.185
<v Speaker 0>That's the there we go. Allowed repositories.

00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:55.030
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Load.

00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:59.350
<v Speaker 1>Ancient archive of knowledge.

00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.710
<v Speaker 1>Mhmm.

00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:02.390
<v Speaker 1>Gotta watch out for this.

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:03.750
<v Speaker 2>I love it.

00:49:08.225 --> 00:49:10.705
<v Speaker 1>So you allowed all the control point nodes?

00:49:11.585 --> 00:49:12.545
<v Speaker 2>I'm not

00:49:13.105 --> 00:49:15.505
<v Speaker 2>super mean. That's first time. So I just

00:49:15.505 --> 00:49:17.105
<v Speaker 2>wanna start start simple.

00:49:17.425 --> 00:49:18.385
<v Speaker 1>I I will

00:49:18.625 --> 00:49:20.945
<v Speaker 1>will just bounce back to my cubelet patch.

00:49:20.945 --> 00:49:23.700
<v Speaker 1>My cubelet patch allowed anything in cube system,

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:25.620
<v Speaker 1>Cilium, metal l b system.

00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:27.620
<v Speaker 1>Something else.

00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:29.780
<v Speaker 2>Didn't wanna throw too many flags.

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:32.580
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna suggest we just delete.

00:49:36.765 --> 00:49:37.565
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:49:38.045 --> 00:49:39.805
<v Speaker 0>Allowed repose

00:49:40.685 --> 00:49:42.525
<v Speaker 0>ancient archive of knowledge.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.080
<v Speaker 1>Scaled it up. On a way. Yeah. That

00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:54.840
<v Speaker 0>was the last message. I thought we'll need

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:56.280
<v Speaker 0>to Yeah. Maybe do a rollout.

00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:57.560
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:50:07.065 --> 00:50:09.145
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We got another denied.

00:50:09.305 --> 00:50:11.065
<v Speaker 0>All parts must have a clustered label for

00:50:11.065 --> 00:50:12.265
<v Speaker 0>branding and associated.

00:50:13.704 --> 00:50:15.785
<v Speaker 1>Branded and associated Stargate unit?

00:50:17.130 --> 00:50:18.090
<v Speaker 1>Is

00:50:18.809 --> 00:50:20.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean, I don't know gatekeeper. Is s

00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:23.049
<v Speaker 1>g star like, Stargate, or is it gatekeeper

00:50:23.049 --> 00:50:23.770
<v Speaker 1>specific?

00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:25.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. All the the teams that go to

00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:27.930
<v Speaker 2>the port the Stargate would be s g

00:50:27.930 --> 00:50:29.930
<v Speaker 2>one, s g two. Oh.

00:50:30.395 --> 00:50:31.035
<v Speaker 2>Oh.

00:50:33.515 --> 00:50:37.035
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So let's look at our API resources

00:50:37.035 --> 00:50:39.194
<v Speaker 0>again. So one of and I'm assuming if

00:50:39.194 --> 00:50:40.395
<v Speaker 0>we do that

00:50:41.515 --> 00:50:42.155
<v Speaker 0>okay.

00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:44.940
<v Speaker 1>No. No. No. No. I think we need

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:48.060
<v Speaker 1>to update the label to not say Rawkode

00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:49.020
<v Speaker 1>and Gfi,

00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:51.340
<v Speaker 1>but to say s g 1. Well, I

00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:52.780
<v Speaker 0>was gonna just take a look at the

00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:54.460
<v Speaker 0>policy so that we don't

00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:55.580
<v Speaker 0>guess. Oh,

00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:57.580
<v Speaker 1>that's that's much better.

00:50:58.255 --> 00:50:59.455
<v Speaker 0>Maybe. Just an idea.

00:51:00.095 --> 00:51:02.095
<v Speaker 0>If you want to, probably smarter.

00:51:02.335 --> 00:51:04.095
<v Speaker 2>I'm enjoying this, but if you wanna do

00:51:04.095 --> 00:51:05.295
<v Speaker 2>that, by all means.

00:51:06.015 --> 00:51:06.815
<v Speaker 0>So

00:51:06.815 --> 00:51:08.015
<v Speaker 0>required

00:51:08.335 --> 00:51:09.455
<v Speaker 0>labeled

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.740
<v Speaker 0>Dash o y m o must be

00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:13.860
<v Speaker 0>clustered.

00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:15.940
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:16.900
<v Speaker 0>So

00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:19.620
<v Speaker 0>does that actually see

00:51:22.715 --> 00:51:24.475
<v Speaker 1>Alright. I have to scroll up on mine.

00:51:24.475 --> 00:51:25.115
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:51:25.355 --> 00:51:26.715
<v Speaker 0>That would be a cool feature that I'm

00:51:26.715 --> 00:51:28.235
<v Speaker 0>gonna have to ask the the teleport team

00:51:28.235 --> 00:51:29.275
<v Speaker 0>to work on that.

00:51:29.755 --> 00:51:31.755
<v Speaker 1>I love teleport by the way.

00:51:32.075 --> 00:51:34.395
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's awesome. And you were also right.

00:51:34.395 --> 00:51:37.115
<v Speaker 0>Custard cannot be David and Jiffy. It has

00:51:37.115 --> 00:51:38.395
<v Speaker 0>to be s g dash

00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:39.490
<v Speaker 0>number.

00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:40.770
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:51:40.850 --> 00:51:42.290
<v Speaker 0>I'll give you the owners.

00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:44.450
<v Speaker 1>No.

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:45.010
<v Speaker 1>No.

00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:47.170
<v Speaker 1>If I no. No. If I'm reading this

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:48.610
<v Speaker 1>right, we can just have a key of

00:51:48.610 --> 00:51:49.410
<v Speaker 1>clustered,

00:51:49.570 --> 00:51:51.090
<v Speaker 1>but we also need another

00:51:51.924 --> 00:51:54.404
<v Speaker 1>key called key. Oh, you're right. You're right.

00:51:54.404 --> 00:51:56.164
<v Speaker 2>I was hoping you were gonna it looked

00:51:56.164 --> 00:51:57.365
<v Speaker 2>like you're gonna miss it.

00:51:58.085 --> 00:51:59.684
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you hey. Off you go. You you

00:51:59.684 --> 00:52:01.045
<v Speaker 0>take it away. I'm just

00:52:02.085 --> 00:52:03.045
<v Speaker 2>I'm just over here.

00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:06.440
<v Speaker 2>I've already exceeded my expectations, so this is

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:07.000
<v Speaker 2>great.

00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Match labels.

00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Template. There we go.

00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:17.480
<v Speaker 0>Boom. Boom. Let's see what SG we are.

00:52:18.225 --> 00:52:19.985
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying we're SG one.

00:52:20.225 --> 00:52:21.665
<v Speaker 2>It's the best SG.

00:52:22.545 --> 00:52:22.945
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:31.730
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

00:52:32.130 --> 00:52:33.650
<v Speaker 0>You may have to do a

00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:37.810
<v Speaker 0>well, in fact, the labels would have done

00:52:37.810 --> 00:52:39.970
<v Speaker 0>a rollout, so it's just not working yet.

00:52:40.930 --> 00:52:41.569
<v Speaker 0>That's true.

00:52:46.585 --> 00:52:48.105
<v Speaker 0>I guess we're going back to the event

00:52:48.105 --> 00:52:48.744
<v Speaker 0>log.

00:52:49.545 --> 00:52:50.265
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

00:52:50.585 --> 00:52:52.025
<v Speaker 1>Well, okay. So it

00:52:53.625 --> 00:52:54.825
<v Speaker 1>set it scaled,

00:52:54.825 --> 00:52:57.145
<v Speaker 1>wrap was set to zero, and then scaled

00:52:57.224 --> 00:52:58.505
<v Speaker 1>it up to one.

00:53:00.105 --> 00:53:02.240
<v Speaker 0>You wanna try the rollout just in case?

00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:04.960
<v Speaker 0>I thought labels would've

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.080
<v Speaker 0>What did we roll out command.

00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:13.200
<v Speaker 1>Was it rollout deployment?

00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:15.200
<v Speaker 0>Roll out restart deployment clustered.

00:53:15.855 --> 00:53:16.575
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:53:18.335 --> 00:53:19.935
<v Speaker 1>Hit control w again.

00:53:21.455 --> 00:53:23.695
<v Speaker 2>That happens to the best of us. Yep.

00:53:26.494 --> 00:53:27.215
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:53:29.215 --> 00:53:31.215
<v Speaker 0>Let's describe our deployment.

00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:32.390
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:36.710
<v Speaker 0>Well, it's yeah. We need two keys. One

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:38.070
<v Speaker 0>of them had to be clustered with any

00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:40.470
<v Speaker 0>value, and one had to be team with

00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:41.590
<v Speaker 0>s g one

00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:43.190
<v Speaker 0>according to the policy.

00:53:44.435 --> 00:53:47.155
<v Speaker 1>Oh, wait. Really? Yeah. No. No. You're you're

00:53:47.155 --> 00:53:49.635
<v Speaker 0>right. I think, well, it misinterpreted

00:53:49.635 --> 00:53:51.234
<v Speaker 0>the policy the way I did it first.

00:53:51.234 --> 00:53:52.994
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. You you did it right, at least.

00:53:52.994 --> 00:53:55.315
<v Speaker 2>That's how it was intended unless I Unless

00:53:55.555 --> 00:53:56.275
<v Speaker 0>I typed up.

00:53:57.555 --> 00:53:58.355
<v Speaker 2>Just possible.

00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:03.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So minimum replicas unavailable,

00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:05.490
<v Speaker 1>progressing through new replica set created.

00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:11.730
<v Speaker 0>So it's not scaling it up at all.

00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:12.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:54:15.464 --> 00:54:17.865
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Now can we check for a scheduler?

00:54:22.585 --> 00:54:23.945
<v Speaker 0>Damn it. Alright. Okay.

00:54:25.704 --> 00:54:27.545
<v Speaker 0>Because we're not getting any errors. Right?

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:31.260
<v Speaker 1>No. We're not getting any errors at this

00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:33.740
<v Speaker 1>point. Deployment controller is saying it's scaling it

00:54:33.740 --> 00:54:34.940
<v Speaker 1>up and down correctly.

00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:39.420
<v Speaker 0>I'm

00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:41.500
<v Speaker 0>just gonna type randomly and you've got

00:54:43.455 --> 00:54:45.375
<v Speaker 1>keep keep going because you're following what I'm

00:54:45.375 --> 00:54:47.935
<v Speaker 1>following. I see two different replica sets that

00:54:47.935 --> 00:54:49.375
<v Speaker 1>have a desired of one and I think

00:54:49.375 --> 00:54:50.975
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the problem. Okay. So we're

00:54:50.975 --> 00:54:52.495
<v Speaker 0>still getting hit by a Oh, there's a

00:54:52.495 --> 00:54:53.215
<v Speaker 0>validation

00:54:53.535 --> 00:54:54.655
<v Speaker 0>policy too.

00:54:54.895 --> 00:54:56.770
<v Speaker 1>And it has to do with the image.

00:54:56.770 --> 00:54:57.890
<v Speaker 0>The image. Yeah.

00:54:59.410 --> 00:55:00.530
<v Speaker 1>So we probably

00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:04.050
<v Speaker 1>there's probably a different yeah. A different

00:55:04.370 --> 00:55:06.210
<v Speaker 1>gatekeeper CRD that we need to look at.

00:55:13.155 --> 00:55:14.035
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:55:14.355 --> 00:55:15.715
<v Speaker 0>Key. That

00:55:20.595 --> 00:55:21.234
<v Speaker 0>came back.

00:55:24.590 --> 00:55:26.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm really fast with SSH.

00:55:28.830 --> 00:55:29.550
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:55:36.350 --> 00:55:36.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:55:40.785 --> 00:55:42.944
<v Speaker 0>So there's either a rope process on this

00:55:42.944 --> 00:55:43.665
<v Speaker 0>machine.

00:55:45.505 --> 00:55:47.665
<v Speaker 0>Chris has another terminal open just to mock

00:55:47.665 --> 00:55:48.705
<v Speaker 0>us like you did.

00:55:49.025 --> 00:55:50.145
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sorry.

00:55:50.385 --> 00:55:50.944
<v Speaker 1>Give me.

00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:57.630
<v Speaker 0>Nothing in the cron tab. That's the next

00:55:57.630 --> 00:55:59.390
<v Speaker 1>thing I was gonna say.

00:55:59.390 --> 00:56:01.070
<v Speaker 0>We have a rule system

00:56:01.070 --> 00:56:01.630
<v Speaker 0>fail.

00:56:12.805 --> 00:56:14.165
<v Speaker 0>It was lit normal.

00:56:15.125 --> 00:56:16.565
<v Speaker 1>Can I take over for a sec? Please

00:56:16.565 --> 00:56:16.805
<v Speaker 0>stay.

00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:24.180
<v Speaker 0>So real quick quick.

00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:31.380
<v Speaker 0>Sorry. Just for the record, the scheduler had

00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:33.220
<v Speaker 0>a restart, which I always find suspicious.

00:56:34.565 --> 00:56:35.525
<v Speaker 1>That's fair.

00:56:38.405 --> 00:56:40.885
<v Speaker 0>Oh, look. It's running flux c d.

00:56:42.965 --> 00:56:43.605
<v Speaker 1>Oh.

00:56:44.485 --> 00:56:44.885
<v Speaker 1>No.

00:56:47.799 --> 00:56:50.200
<v Speaker 0>I I say we delete that entire namespace.

00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:53.960
<v Speaker 1>After

00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:54.280
<v Speaker 1>you.

00:57:02.865 --> 00:57:03.905
<v Speaker 0>Of course.

00:57:04.145 --> 00:57:04.865
<v Speaker 0>Right.

00:57:10.305 --> 00:57:11.105
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:57:11.105 --> 00:57:13.505
<v Speaker 0>So we got a policy. We've got a

00:57:13.585 --> 00:57:15.345
<v Speaker 0>at a mission controller, it's talking about deleting

00:57:15.345 --> 00:57:16.305
<v Speaker 0>the namespace.

00:57:16.305 --> 00:57:17.025
<v Speaker 0>So

00:57:17.250 --> 00:57:19.970
<v Speaker 0>let's take a look at validating

00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:23.090
<v Speaker 0>webhook configurations and then mutating webhook configuration.

00:57:24.610 --> 00:57:26.530
<v Speaker 0>Or it could be RBAC. Maybe it's just

00:57:26.530 --> 00:57:26.850
<v Speaker 0>simpler.

00:57:29.934 --> 00:57:31.775
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. If I say too much, I'll give

00:57:31.775 --> 00:57:33.775
<v Speaker 2>too much away. So I'm just gonna a

00:57:33.775 --> 00:57:34.734
<v Speaker 2>silent

00:57:34.734 --> 00:57:35.615
<v Speaker 2>observer.

00:57:36.575 --> 00:57:38.974
<v Speaker 0>We've not had anyone take a approach to

00:57:38.974 --> 00:57:40.815
<v Speaker 0>sabotage. That's a nice touch.

00:57:41.454 --> 00:57:42.494
<v Speaker 1>I

00:57:43.029 --> 00:57:44.789
<v Speaker 1>want to point out no. No. No. I

00:57:44.789 --> 00:57:46.710
<v Speaker 1>wanna point out something, Chris. And this this

00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:48.150
<v Speaker 1>is a little bit of a tangent, but

00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:50.150
<v Speaker 1>it's worth it. When we did the first

00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:51.910
<v Speaker 1>honk CTL session

00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:54.565
<v Speaker 1>with Bob and I are sitting there, Everyone

00:57:54.565 --> 00:57:56.565
<v Speaker 1>else is trying to break the cluster as

00:57:56.565 --> 00:57:58.325
<v Speaker 1>hard as they can. And here you come

00:57:58.325 --> 00:58:00.805
<v Speaker 1>in, try install OPA, try and lock down

00:58:00.805 --> 00:58:03.125
<v Speaker 1>the cluster, try and preserve the cluster's health

00:58:03.125 --> 00:58:05.205
<v Speaker 1>while everyone else is trying to destroy it.

00:58:07.210 --> 00:58:08.890
<v Speaker 2>Just a reverse hog. That's all.

00:58:09.930 --> 00:58:10.570
<v Speaker 1>You

00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:13.690
<v Speaker 1>you are a lawful good, Kubernetes.

00:58:14.250 --> 00:58:15.210
<v Speaker 1>You

00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:17.130
<v Speaker 1>are a lawful good, goo.

00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:18.250
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.

00:58:21.035 --> 00:58:22.795
<v Speaker 1>Oh, sure. I'll break the cluster.

00:58:23.674 --> 00:58:24.955
<v Speaker 1>Policies on it.

00:58:25.434 --> 00:58:27.115
<v Speaker 2>Just just not how you expect.

00:58:27.914 --> 00:58:29.035
<v Speaker 1>I love it.

00:58:30.234 --> 00:58:32.234
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. There we go. We gotta validate and

00:58:32.234 --> 00:58:34.635
<v Speaker 0>webhook to block the deletion of

00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:36.620
<v Speaker 0>namespaces.

00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:37.740
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:41.500
<v Speaker 0>I'm gonna try this again.

00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:43.500
<v Speaker 0>I'm warning you, Chris. This better work.

00:58:52.945 --> 00:58:54.865
<v Speaker 2>I will say this on a policy I

00:58:54.865 --> 00:58:56.065
<v Speaker 2>put in there. So

00:58:56.385 --> 00:58:57.905
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where that one came from,

00:58:57.905 --> 00:59:00.625
<v Speaker 2>but I'm enjoying that one

00:59:00.865 --> 00:59:01.905
<v Speaker 2>very much right now.

00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:05.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean, we could just delete the pods

00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:07.500
<v Speaker 1>in that namespace and that would get what

00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:08.460
<v Speaker 1>we need done.

00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:11.260
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:13.580
<v Speaker 0>You're right. There's no R back here. We

00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:16.220
<v Speaker 0>got root. So it's definitely at a mission

00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:17.339
<v Speaker 0>controller of some kind.

00:59:18.245 --> 00:59:20.645
<v Speaker 0>So you're suggesting we could do a

00:59:26.565 --> 00:59:28.165
<v Speaker 0>customized controller.

00:59:31.125 --> 00:59:31.445
<v Speaker 0>Done.

00:59:34.299 --> 00:59:36.540
<v Speaker 1>And so now we can probably

00:59:36.619 --> 00:59:38.700
<v Speaker 1>go back. Okay.

00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:40.140
<v Speaker 1>It is terminating. Yeah.

00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:42.299
<v Speaker 1>So now we can probably go back and

00:59:42.299 --> 00:59:44.460
<v Speaker 1>delete the ancient archive of knowledge. It shouldn't

00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:46.460
<v Speaker 1>come back. We might be good.

00:59:56.315 --> 00:59:56.955
<v Speaker 2>Yeah?

00:59:57.515 --> 00:59:58.315
<v Speaker 2>Yeah?

00:59:58.795 --> 00:59:59.195
<v Speaker 2>Yeah?

01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:03.570
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:00:03.970 --> 01:00:06.290
<v Speaker 0>Our custard pod is coming up.

01:00:07.650 --> 01:00:09.090
<v Speaker 0>Is that it? Did we do it?

01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:12.290
<v Speaker 2>It might be a little bit more. Alright.

01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:12.530
<v Speaker 0>Of course.

01:00:15.295 --> 01:00:16.575
<v Speaker 1>Container creating.

01:00:17.295 --> 01:00:19.855
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Like, hopefully, it's just building the image,

01:00:19.855 --> 01:00:20.255
<v Speaker 0>but

01:00:25.215 --> 01:00:25.935
<v Speaker 0>CNI.

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Failed to find plug in.

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:34.520
<v Speaker 0>Oh, there's no Cilium.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
<v Speaker 0>Oh, wait. No. No. Wrong namespace. Sorry. I

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.040
<v Speaker 0>do that all the time.

01:00:39.775 --> 01:00:41.295
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no. There's no ceiling.

01:00:47.855 --> 01:00:49.055
<v Speaker 1>That's sneaky.

01:00:50.255 --> 01:00:52.175
<v Speaker 0>We still have the namespace by the looks

01:00:52.175 --> 01:00:52.575
<v Speaker 0>of it.

01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:56.230
<v Speaker 0>Oh, wait. What?

01:01:03.590 --> 01:01:04.870
<v Speaker 0>Hold up. So

01:01:05.830 --> 01:01:06.630
<v Speaker 1>three are ready.

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:28.820
<v Speaker 1>I am going to, like, mentally delete control

01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:31.700
<v Speaker 1>w from my memory.

01:01:36.675 --> 01:01:38.755
<v Speaker 2>Yes. Just don't please don't hurt me after

01:01:38.755 --> 01:01:39.715
<v Speaker 2>this. It's all.

01:01:44.835 --> 01:01:47.075
<v Speaker 0>Oh, we're gonna have to roll out everything.

01:01:50.349 --> 01:01:51.070
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:01:52.030 --> 01:01:54.430
<v Speaker 0>What is the rule out demons restart demon

01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:55.550
<v Speaker 0>sets. So the

01:01:56.349 --> 01:01:57.550
<v Speaker 1>Oops. Sorry. Here we go.

01:02:03.974 --> 01:02:05.335
<v Speaker 0>It's the same note.

01:02:06.694 --> 01:02:07.974
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no. Wrong new space.

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:25.190
<v Speaker 0>Is gatekeeper back?

01:02:28.164 --> 01:02:28.724
<v Speaker 0>Is it?

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:44.180
<v Speaker 0>Other oh, that's the wrong one.

01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:49.140
<v Speaker 0>That one's not back.

01:02:53.685 --> 01:02:55.925
<v Speaker 1>What other CRDs are there?

01:02:56.485 --> 01:02:57.525
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Thank you.

01:03:03.205 --> 01:03:04.485
<v Speaker 1>What about disallowed

01:03:04.485 --> 01:03:05.045
<v Speaker 1>tags?

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.300
<v Speaker 0>I see how we're playing the game there.

01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:14.980
<v Speaker 0>I'm not even looking at him, Chris.

01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:17.300
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely a thousand cuts on this one.

01:03:30.555 --> 01:03:33.194
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. So this break does have a story.

01:03:33.194 --> 01:03:36.474
<v Speaker 2>It's I, a Kubernetes administrator, misconfigured a few

01:03:36.474 --> 01:03:39.194
<v Speaker 2>things, and this is the ensuing chaos that

01:03:39.194 --> 01:03:39.595
<v Speaker 2>you get.

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:44.440
<v Speaker 1>It's mean.

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:47.960
<v Speaker 2>I didn't mean for it to be that

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:48.520
<v Speaker 1>mean.

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.280
<v Speaker 1>I love it.

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:54.680
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Okay. No. So so what's happening Yeah.

01:03:55.559 --> 01:03:57.085
<v Speaker 0>Go for it. Go ahead. No. I was

01:03:57.085 --> 01:03:59.005
<v Speaker 1>gonna say what's happening here is we never

01:03:59.005 --> 01:03:59.805
<v Speaker 1>deleted

01:04:00.365 --> 01:04:01.965
<v Speaker 1>the policy

01:04:02.205 --> 01:04:04.845
<v Speaker 1>for the clustered pod. We just added the

01:04:04.845 --> 01:04:07.805
<v Speaker 1>labels and got the clustered pod working. Cilium

01:04:07.805 --> 01:04:10.285
<v Speaker 1>isn't scheduling because we haven't added the labels

01:04:10.285 --> 01:04:12.045
<v Speaker 1>to the Cilium

01:04:12.010 --> 01:04:13.290
<v Speaker 1>staple set either.

01:04:13.690 --> 01:04:15.690
<v Speaker 0>But I just removed the policy.

01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:19.530
<v Speaker 1>You removed disallowed tags.

01:04:19.610 --> 01:04:21.770
<v Speaker 1>Did you actually delete the the other policy

01:04:21.770 --> 01:04:23.450
<v Speaker 1>as well? Alright.

01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:23.690
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

01:04:26.065 --> 01:04:27.825
<v Speaker 0>I just have to delete an entire CRD

01:04:27.825 --> 01:04:29.345
<v Speaker 0>namespace. Is that a thing?

01:04:34.545 --> 01:04:35.265
<v Speaker 1>There we go.

01:04:45.030 --> 01:04:45.750
<v Speaker 1>Hey.

01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:52.710
<v Speaker 0>Alright. My host of cards is slowly crumbling.

01:04:55.655 --> 01:04:57.575
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So we need to do a rollout

01:04:57.575 --> 01:04:58.375
<v Speaker 0>of

01:05:00.855 --> 01:05:02.695
<v Speaker 0>same operator too.

01:05:07.335 --> 01:05:09.750
<v Speaker 1>And technically, the Hubble stuff if we care

01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:11.750
<v Speaker 1>about the state of that right now. Yeah.

01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:13.750
<v Speaker 0>We can probably get away with oh, there

01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:15.110
<v Speaker 0>we go. We have a clustered.

01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:19.510
<v Speaker 2>Chris?

01:05:19.830 --> 01:05:20.230
<v Speaker 2>Yes?

01:05:23.035 --> 01:05:23.835
<v Speaker 1>Hold

01:05:23.835 --> 01:05:26.075
<v Speaker 1>on. Actually, I shouldn't clap. Is it working?

01:05:26.395 --> 01:05:27.515
<v Speaker 0>Let's go find out.

01:05:27.835 --> 01:05:29.595
<v Speaker 2>Go to the website and find out.

01:05:30.555 --> 01:05:31.755
<v Speaker 0>I knew it.

01:05:35.355 --> 01:05:36.475
<v Speaker 2>We'll see if it works.

01:05:59.714 --> 01:06:00.994
<v Speaker 0>My man is not looking good.

01:06:05.570 --> 01:06:07.730
<v Speaker 2>Insert evil laugh GIF. Right?

01:06:15.570 --> 01:06:17.890
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. To be very unhelpful, my application doesn't

01:06:17.890 --> 01:06:19.170
<v Speaker 0>actually log anything. So

01:06:20.885 --> 01:06:21.925
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

01:06:22.565 --> 01:06:24.245
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you a couple

01:06:24.565 --> 01:06:27.045
<v Speaker 2>more minutes of this, and then I'll and

01:06:27.045 --> 01:06:28.725
<v Speaker 2>then sake of time, I can give a

01:06:28.725 --> 01:06:29.365
<v Speaker 2>hint

01:06:29.605 --> 01:06:30.325
<v Speaker 2>if

01:06:31.125 --> 01:06:32.325
<v Speaker 2>if you need it.

01:06:33.365 --> 01:06:34.405
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.160
<v Speaker 0>the pod is running.

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:40.080
<v Speaker 0>Now we can't we never really get the

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:41.680
<v Speaker 0>port forward long enough to load the page.

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:42.480
<v Speaker 0>It could be

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:44.560
<v Speaker 0>that it's timing out. We didn't speak to

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:47.120
<v Speaker 0>the database. So let's describe the postcard service,

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:48.640
<v Speaker 0>see if we have any endpoints.

01:06:51.115 --> 01:06:52.875
<v Speaker 1>Good point.

01:06:53.194 --> 01:06:54.954
<v Speaker 1>Describe

01:06:55.755 --> 01:06:56.714
<v Speaker 0>SVC

01:06:56.714 --> 01:06:57.355
<v Speaker 0>Postgres.

01:07:02.330 --> 01:07:04.250
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So we got one endpoint.

01:07:05.770 --> 01:07:08.810
<v Speaker 0>No. Counter application actually speak to it as

01:07:08.810 --> 01:07:09.850
<v Speaker 0>the other thing.

01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:12.970
<v Speaker 0>Do you wanna check for network policies?

01:07:13.690 --> 01:07:16.010
<v Speaker 0>Chris is stuck mostly to the Kubernetes API,

01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:17.210
<v Speaker 0>so I'm assuming

01:07:17.805 --> 01:07:19.165
<v Speaker 0>we have a net poll.

01:07:21.645 --> 01:07:23.325
<v Speaker 1>I don't know them all.

01:07:24.285 --> 01:07:25.325
<v Speaker 0>It's

01:07:25.484 --> 01:07:28.045
<v Speaker 0>tell you I'm cluster wide network policies and

01:07:28.045 --> 01:07:29.244
<v Speaker 0>sell you network policies.

01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:36.300
<v Speaker 0>I think I think you can just do

01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:37.740
<v Speaker 0>net pull. Get net pull.

01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:41.740
<v Speaker 0>There we go. An iris.

01:07:44.859 --> 01:07:45.900
<v Speaker 2>Do I got it?

01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:47.099
<v Speaker 1>That's good.

01:07:48.474 --> 01:07:49.595
<v Speaker 1>That's good.

01:07:50.635 --> 01:07:52.315
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Let's get that in the bed.

01:07:56.635 --> 01:07:57.275
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

01:07:57.595 --> 01:08:00.234
<v Speaker 2>If you'd looked at the allowed tags policy,

01:08:00.234 --> 01:08:03.020
<v Speaker 2>it was all, had a list of, the

01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:04.940
<v Speaker 2>various planets in the s g the planet

01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:05.580
<v Speaker 2>codes.

01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:11.420
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Put forward looks health fair.

01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:13.340
<v Speaker 0>There we go. There you go.

01:08:16.795 --> 01:08:18.234
<v Speaker 2>Was Nice. That was good.

01:08:18.875 --> 01:08:20.154
<v Speaker 1>Chris, I love that.

01:08:20.474 --> 01:08:21.994
<v Speaker 0>Yep. Thank you, Chris.

01:08:22.395 --> 01:08:24.234
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for going on that that little

01:08:24.234 --> 01:08:27.034
<v Speaker 2>adventure. That was a it's fun watching.

01:08:27.594 --> 01:08:29.754
<v Speaker 0>Alright. You two have a decision to make.

01:08:30.314 --> 01:08:32.979
<v Speaker 1>Yep. You have twenty minutes in my cluster

01:08:32.979 --> 01:08:34.579
<v Speaker 0>if you wish to take it on.

01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:37.219
<v Speaker 0>If you wanna look around for twenty minutes,

01:08:37.219 --> 01:08:38.659
<v Speaker 0>you're more than welcome. If you wanna call

01:08:38.659 --> 01:08:40.020
<v Speaker 0>it quits and move on with your day,

01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:40.979
<v Speaker 0>that is alright.

01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:42.500
<v Speaker 0>I know twenty minutes is not a lot

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:43.779
<v Speaker 0>of time, so that's why I'm gonna make

01:08:43.779 --> 01:08:44.659
<v Speaker 0>it completely optional.

01:08:46.695 --> 01:08:49.094
<v Speaker 1>I would feel awful if,

01:08:49.735 --> 01:08:51.895
<v Speaker 1>like, the two of us have made you

01:08:51.895 --> 01:08:52.614
<v Speaker 1>suffer.

01:08:53.495 --> 01:08:55.575
<v Speaker 1>You don't make us suffer. But you know

01:08:55.575 --> 01:08:57.175
<v Speaker 0>how bad my weekend will be if you

01:08:57.175 --> 01:08:58.375
<v Speaker 0>solve this in nineteen minutes?

01:09:00.739 --> 01:09:01.139
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:03.380
<v Speaker 0>Feel free to take a look around.

01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:04.659
<v Speaker 0>Take a look around.

01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:05.699
<v Speaker 2>Alright.

01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:08.099
<v Speaker 2>Alright.

01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:11.859
<v Speaker 1>So let's do the obligatory k get pods.

01:09:11.859 --> 01:09:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh.

01:09:12.804 --> 01:09:13.604
<v Speaker 2>Oh,

01:09:14.005 --> 01:09:15.284
<v Speaker 2>I wanna make sure I'm in the right

01:09:15.284 --> 01:09:16.004
<v Speaker 2>cluster.

01:09:16.645 --> 01:09:18.564
<v Speaker 0>P4X639

01:09:18.564 --> 01:09:22.164
<v Speaker 0>is the the worst world charge. Just FYI.

01:09:22.645 --> 01:09:24.804
<v Speaker 0>And I pop I am not crying. Thank

01:09:24.804 --> 01:09:26.804
<v Speaker 0>you very much. I am holding that in

01:09:26.804 --> 01:09:27.844
<v Speaker 0>holding that in well.

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Are you on the Which one is

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:33.319
<v Speaker 1>Replicator planet or

01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:35.319
<v Speaker 2>black hole? A window of opportunity.

01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:38.360
<v Speaker 2>Window of opportunity. That's the infinite loop one,

01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:41.080
<v Speaker 0>Groundhog Day. Oh, the best episode. Yeah. That

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:43.240
<v Speaker 0>one. Awesome. Alright. I've set you up. That's

01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:43.640
<v Speaker 0>all I'm doing.

01:09:45.125 --> 01:09:46.405
<v Speaker 2>Appreciate it.

01:09:47.205 --> 01:09:48.405
<v Speaker 2>Are

01:09:49.845 --> 01:09:51.125
<v Speaker 1>you in the same

01:09:51.445 --> 01:09:52.965
<v Speaker 1>back discussion, Chris?

01:09:53.365 --> 01:09:54.085
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

01:09:55.205 --> 01:09:56.245
<v Speaker 2>We got rejected.

01:09:57.619 --> 01:09:58.419
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:01.619
<v Speaker 1>So we're back at our request for an

01:10:01.619 --> 01:10:02.579
<v Speaker 1>unknown reason.

01:10:03.699 --> 01:10:05.860
<v Speaker 2>Is it actually up and running? It's my

01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:06.899
<v Speaker 1>That is.

01:10:08.179 --> 01:10:08.900
<v Speaker 1>Feeling.

01:10:12.304 --> 01:10:13.585
<v Speaker 0>Such a good episode.

01:10:13.824 --> 01:10:16.065
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. It's not on Netflix up here in

01:10:16.065 --> 01:10:17.585
<v Speaker 2>Canada yet. I'm waiting.

01:10:18.065 --> 01:10:20.065
<v Speaker 0>It comes on in The UK every now

01:10:20.065 --> 01:10:21.665
<v Speaker 0>and again, and then I start watching it.

01:10:21.665 --> 01:10:22.945
<v Speaker 0>But then I can't get through all 11

01:10:22.945 --> 01:10:24.705
<v Speaker 0>series before they take it back off again.

01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:29.160
<v Speaker 2>You're stuck in your own little loop then.

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:29.719
<v Speaker 2>Yep.

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:35.639
<v Speaker 2>What

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:39.000
<v Speaker 2>did he do?

01:10:40.455 --> 01:10:41.175
<v Speaker 1>Well,

01:10:42.135 --> 01:10:44.614
<v Speaker 1>server rejected a request for an unknown reason.

01:10:45.015 --> 01:10:45.655
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm.

01:10:46.615 --> 01:10:48.455
<v Speaker 1>API server is up and running.

01:10:48.855 --> 01:10:50.375
<v Speaker 2>Do we have any logs from the server?

01:10:57.389 --> 01:10:58.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh,

01:10:59.790 --> 01:11:02.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh, they have a chaos kubectl on there.

01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:03.469
<v Speaker 2>That's

01:11:04.285 --> 01:11:05.324
<v Speaker 2>nefarious.

01:11:09.005 --> 01:11:09.885
<v Speaker 0>Mhmm.

01:11:13.005 --> 01:11:14.925
<v Speaker 2>Are you also typing really fast right now?

01:11:17.619 --> 01:11:19.139
<v Speaker 1>Oh, wait. Are we in the are we

01:11:19.139 --> 01:11:20.260
<v Speaker 1>in the same terminal?

01:11:21.139 --> 01:11:22.579
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. So I can

01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:24.979
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Okay. Cool. Yeah.

01:11:27.539 --> 01:11:29.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm still coming down off the watching. Little

01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:31.874
<v Speaker 2>little shaky right now. So You

01:11:32.835 --> 01:11:35.074
<v Speaker 1>know, that's like I let me also shout

01:11:35.074 --> 01:11:36.834
<v Speaker 1>that out. It's it was actually

01:11:37.074 --> 01:11:39.875
<v Speaker 1>scarier for me to be the breaker than

01:11:39.875 --> 01:11:41.874
<v Speaker 1>it was for me to be the debugger.

01:11:42.594 --> 01:11:43.875
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's weird.

01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:46.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh, a

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:49.000
<v Speaker 2>lot of pressure. Like, can you break a

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:49.639
<v Speaker 2>cluster?

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:51.400
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh,

01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:57.560
<v Speaker 2>there we go.

01:11:59.625 --> 01:12:00.905
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I think that's the part I was

01:12:00.905 --> 01:12:03.785
<v Speaker 2>worried most about. Debugging is fun, yeah, properly

01:12:03.785 --> 01:12:05.545
<v Speaker 2>breaking something, it's

01:12:05.785 --> 01:12:07.145
<v Speaker 2>doesn't come natural.

01:12:07.545 --> 01:12:09.545
<v Speaker 2>Bucks of tears. Bucks of tears.

01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:16.699
<v Speaker 1>Client con switching balancer to pick first.

01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:19.179
<v Speaker 1>So

01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:24.380
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen this

01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:26.824
<v Speaker 1>go ahead. I was just like, did he

01:12:26.824 --> 01:12:28.344
<v Speaker 2>swap out the binary too?

01:12:30.905 --> 01:12:32.744
<v Speaker 1>I have never seen

01:12:33.465 --> 01:12:34.905
<v Speaker 1>this chaos thing.

01:12:46.530 --> 01:12:48.850
<v Speaker 2>Did he maybe change some of the config

01:12:49.090 --> 01:12:50.130
<v Speaker 2>the cube config?

01:12:51.335 --> 01:12:52.775
<v Speaker 2>It's deleting some stuff.

01:12:53.095 --> 01:12:55.495
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's deleting clustered and then

01:12:56.775 --> 01:12:59.094
<v Speaker 1>no idea what else. Okay.

01:13:01.175 --> 01:13:01.895
<v Speaker 1>So

01:13:02.935 --> 01:13:05.890
<v Speaker 1>cube config or yeah. The KubeConfig might be

01:13:05.890 --> 01:13:07.890
<v Speaker 1>a good example. Let's let's see what that

01:13:07.890 --> 01:13:08.449
<v Speaker 1>is.

01:13:09.010 --> 01:13:11.010
<v Speaker 1>We're we're good to show the KubeConfig on

01:13:11.010 --> 01:13:13.890
<v Speaker 1>screen. Right? Yeah. It's all good. Alright.

01:13:20.875 --> 01:13:22.875
<v Speaker 0>I would answer that question pop, but I'm

01:13:22.875 --> 01:13:24.395
<v Speaker 0>keeping my language clean this evening.

01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:37.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't see anything

01:13:38.470 --> 01:13:40.470
<v Speaker 1>out of the ordinary here. So maybe it's

01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:43.190
<v Speaker 1>not this. Yeah. It's the endpoint. Right?

01:13:47.415 --> 01:13:49.014
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I think so.

01:13:51.575 --> 01:13:52.855
<v Speaker 2>What do we have here?

01:13:54.775 --> 01:13:59.014
<v Speaker 2>One four what is it? 145.

01:14:00.295 --> 01:14:03.975
<v Speaker 2>It's not any of

01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:04.540
<v Speaker 2>the addresses here.

01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:05.580
<v Speaker 2>I

01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:11.340
<v Speaker 2>think it's going to the wrong spot, but

01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:12.780
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't that would no. Would it have timed

01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:13.980
<v Speaker 2>out if this was going to the wrong

01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:14.380
<v Speaker 2>server?

01:14:14.925 --> 01:14:16.844
<v Speaker 0>So I'll I'll spare you going down a

01:14:16.844 --> 01:14:18.764
<v Speaker 0>rabbit hole. That is the EIP and the

01:14:18.764 --> 01:14:21.084
<v Speaker 0>correct IP address for the API server.

01:14:21.324 --> 01:14:23.244
<v Speaker 0>It is not any of the node IPs,

01:14:23.244 --> 01:14:24.844
<v Speaker 0>but you don't know the setup, so I'm

01:14:24.844 --> 01:14:25.565
<v Speaker 0>just gonna give you that.

01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:28.220
<v Speaker 2>Much appreciated.

01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:30.700
<v Speaker 1>I my my initial thought was he swapped

01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:32.940
<v Speaker 1>IPs with one of our servers. Yeah.

01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:35.420
<v Speaker 1>But didn't change the certs, so it would

01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:36.700
<v Speaker 1>throw an error like this.

01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:39.420
<v Speaker 2>Yep. And and, like, I'm looking at I'm

01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:41.180
<v Speaker 1>looking at the teleport IP, like, is that

01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:41.900
<v Speaker 1>the same IP?

01:14:44.625 --> 01:14:46.864
<v Speaker 2>Ditto on my end. Alright.

01:14:48.304 --> 01:14:49.264
<v Speaker 1>So we still

01:14:50.784 --> 01:14:52.704
<v Speaker 1>Midna has decided to wake up. We still

01:14:52.704 --> 01:14:55.264
<v Speaker 1>have no idea why we don't have access

01:14:55.264 --> 01:14:56.145
<v Speaker 1>to the API server.

01:14:58.340 --> 01:14:59.379
<v Speaker 1>I do know

01:15:02.179 --> 01:15:02.899
<v Speaker 1>that

01:15:03.059 --> 01:15:06.340
<v Speaker 1>this chaos pod or chaos container is definitely

01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:07.939
<v Speaker 1>going to stop us from

01:15:08.579 --> 01:15:10.980
<v Speaker 1>it's it's gonna kill the cluster pod What

01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:13.165
<v Speaker 1>if we get access to it. What if

01:15:13.165 --> 01:15:15.325
<v Speaker 2>we delete that chaos pod?

01:15:15.725 --> 01:15:16.925
<v Speaker 0>That's a nice idea.

01:15:17.325 --> 01:15:19.405
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it. Let's see if it's outside

01:15:19.405 --> 01:15:20.525
<v Speaker 1>of Let's come back.

01:15:23.325 --> 01:15:24.045
<v Speaker 1>Oh,

01:15:24.285 --> 01:15:24.845
<v Speaker 1>wrong thing.

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:29.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna have to start practicing my Christ

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:32.239
<v Speaker 2>ETL, I think. Oh, no. It's gone.

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:33.600
<v Speaker 0>No.

01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:37.200
<v Speaker 1>And it's back. Okay. It's being managed by.

01:15:41.685 --> 01:15:44.405
<v Speaker 1>I'm leaning towards something with certificates.

01:15:46.805 --> 01:15:48.805
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. But, like, if it's the wrong cert,

01:15:48.805 --> 01:15:50.405
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't it just stall and then give us

01:15:50.405 --> 01:15:50.965
<v Speaker 2>the

01:15:52.005 --> 01:15:54.565
<v Speaker 2>old cert error or x five zero nine?

01:15:57.190 --> 01:15:59.429
<v Speaker 2>Or am I behind on my error warnings?

01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:03.429
<v Speaker 1>Remember in the beginning when I said I'm

01:16:03.429 --> 01:16:05.590
<v Speaker 1>more dev and less ops? You probably know

01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:06.629
<v Speaker 1>better than me.

01:16:06.949 --> 01:16:07.749
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.789
<v Speaker 2>I'm

01:16:08.949 --> 01:16:10.229
<v Speaker 2>footing both doors

01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:12.425
<v Speaker 2>a little bit. I'm trying to remember I'm

01:16:12.425 --> 01:16:13.785
<v Speaker 2>trying to remember the curl command so we

01:16:13.785 --> 01:16:15.705
<v Speaker 2>can just hit the API server and see

01:16:15.705 --> 01:16:17.385
<v Speaker 2>if the cert works that way.

01:16:17.705 --> 01:16:19.465
<v Speaker 0>I'm happy to take the curl command for

01:16:19.465 --> 01:16:20.425
<v Speaker 0>you if you want.

01:16:21.225 --> 01:16:22.745
<v Speaker 1>I was just gonna Google it if you

01:16:22.745 --> 01:16:24.905
<v Speaker 1>have it up. Yeah. If you got it.

01:16:25.864 --> 01:16:28.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean, that's that's the next path that

01:16:28.090 --> 01:16:29.050
<v Speaker 1>we're going down.

01:16:29.690 --> 01:16:30.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

01:16:31.450 --> 01:16:33.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. You could start our DNS.

01:16:35.450 --> 01:16:37.450
<v Speaker 0>See where was that IP address. Would it

01:16:37.450 --> 01:16:38.570
<v Speaker 1>would it be DNS, though?

01:16:40.105 --> 01:16:41.945
<v Speaker 2>I don't like, I would assume if it

01:16:41.945 --> 01:16:43.625
<v Speaker 2>was DNS again, it would stall for a

01:16:43.625 --> 01:16:46.025
<v Speaker 2>bit because that response was way too fast

01:16:46.185 --> 01:16:47.784
<v Speaker 2>in my Do you want me to

01:16:48.425 --> 01:16:49.624
<v Speaker 2>Run it again?

01:16:50.185 --> 01:16:52.824
<v Speaker 2>Right. Because it should hang if it's just

01:16:53.705 --> 01:16:54.505
<v Speaker 2>it's trying.

01:16:56.610 --> 01:16:59.090
<v Speaker 1>Did you need the the URL,

01:16:59.090 --> 01:17:00.610
<v Speaker 1>David? That's alright.

01:17:00.930 --> 01:17:01.330
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:17:09.135 --> 01:17:11.535
<v Speaker 0>Oh. Uh-oh. You

01:17:11.535 --> 01:17:12.735
<v Speaker 2>got a cat over there. Cat.

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:14.655
<v Speaker 1>Cat. Cat.

01:17:16.815 --> 01:17:17.695
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no.

01:17:21.055 --> 01:17:21.375
<v Speaker 0>It is.

01:17:23.670 --> 01:17:25.350
<v Speaker 2>I just have my desk up high enough

01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:27.030
<v Speaker 2>mine can't jump. It's great.

01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:31.590
<v Speaker 1>If you saw my desk setup, you'd laugh.

01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:34.470
<v Speaker 1>Cat tree over here. Cat bed over here.

01:17:34.470 --> 01:17:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Cat wall behind me.

01:17:37.755 --> 01:17:39.435
<v Speaker 2>I have a cat chair in front of

01:17:39.435 --> 01:17:40.395
<v Speaker 2>me. He

01:17:41.275 --> 01:17:43.035
<v Speaker 2>spent the mornings snoring.

01:17:43.035 --> 01:17:43.995
<v Speaker 2>It was great.

01:17:44.715 --> 01:17:46.715
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So so here we are.

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:52.560
<v Speaker 1>Certificate problem, unable to get the local issuer

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:54.480
<v Speaker 1>cert. It is still safe.

01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:57.840
<v Speaker 0>Sir? So the certificate is fine.

01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:00.720
<v Speaker 2>The cert is fine.

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:03.645
<v Speaker 2>The cert is fine. You've already seen the

01:18:03.645 --> 01:18:06.204
<v Speaker 0>problem twice now. That's all I'm saying. Oh,

01:18:07.005 --> 01:18:07.885
<v Speaker 2>right. What

01:18:11.005 --> 01:18:12.364
<v Speaker 0>if we wanna go back to twice? We

01:18:12.364 --> 01:18:15.485
<v Speaker 1>have catered the cube config twice.

01:18:15.804 --> 01:18:16.205
<v Speaker 2>Mhmm.

01:18:17.150 --> 01:18:19.790
<v Speaker 2>And we've looked at the cry output couple

01:18:19.790 --> 01:18:20.429
<v Speaker 2>times.

01:18:21.310 --> 01:18:23.869
<v Speaker 0>This is in my breaker notes as a

01:18:23.869 --> 01:18:25.070
<v Speaker 0>superficial problem.

01:18:27.150 --> 01:18:29.389
<v Speaker 1>Breaker notes is superficial problem

01:18:29.835 --> 01:18:31.195
<v Speaker 1>because it

01:18:31.835 --> 01:18:34.235
<v Speaker 1>probably has to do with this.

01:18:35.915 --> 01:18:38.075
<v Speaker 2>What where's our KubeConfig pointing to?

01:18:40.795 --> 01:18:44.235
<v Speaker 1>Etcetera, Kubernetes, admin Com, unless you mean there's.

01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:48.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. This okay. So it's pointing to the

01:18:48.270 --> 01:18:50.670
<v Speaker 2>file that we're looking at then. Yeah.

01:18:51.070 --> 01:18:51.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:57.950
<v Speaker 0>Would you just like a hint Well, I

01:18:57.950 --> 01:18:58.350
<v Speaker 2>think the the

01:18:59.230 --> 01:18:59.630
<v Speaker 2>yeah.

01:19:00.195 --> 01:19:01.155
<v Speaker 2>There we go.

01:19:03.315 --> 01:19:04.914
<v Speaker 2>It's only one context.

01:19:09.315 --> 01:19:10.435
<v Speaker 1>No. No. Like

01:19:11.235 --> 01:19:12.994
<v Speaker 2>Does the context match the name?

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes hyphen admin at cluster o two five

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:20.679
<v Speaker 1>KubeCon EU twenty twenty one cluster o two

01:19:20.679 --> 01:19:22.519
<v Speaker 1>five KubeCon EU yeah.

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:24.679
<v Speaker 1>I'll type in it.

01:19:30.175 --> 01:19:32.574
<v Speaker 1>Client key data. Client shaver data. I'm surprised

01:19:32.574 --> 01:19:35.054
<v Speaker 0>no one in the chat has noticed it

01:19:35.054 --> 01:19:35.695
<v Speaker 0>either.

01:19:37.215 --> 01:19:38.574
<v Speaker 2>Is it an indent error?

01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:44.820
<v Speaker 0>It's worse than that. Like, the Oh. Subtly

01:19:44.820 --> 01:19:46.099
<v Speaker 0>worse than that.

01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:48.739
<v Speaker 2>Oh, it's the little ones that are the

01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:51.540
<v Speaker 2>where

01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:51.940
<v Speaker 2>is it?

01:19:57.275 --> 01:19:59.354
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. One second. Comes.

01:20:02.554 --> 01:20:05.195
<v Speaker 1>And Midna is now laying on my arm,

01:20:05.594 --> 01:20:07.034
<v Speaker 1>so this is gonna be a little bit

01:20:07.034 --> 01:20:07.915
<v Speaker 1>hard mode.

01:20:11.850 --> 01:20:13.210
<v Speaker 1>Did you just I can take over if

01:20:13.210 --> 01:20:15.450
<v Speaker 1>you want. I did. Did I do something

01:20:15.450 --> 01:20:16.969
<v Speaker 1>bad? Probably.

01:20:17.610 --> 01:20:19.930
<v Speaker 1>There's

01:20:19.930 --> 01:20:21.690
<v Speaker 1>a type of config and I don't know

01:20:21.690 --> 01:20:24.250
<v Speaker 1>if you configs well enough to know whether

01:20:23.775 --> 01:20:25.375
<v Speaker 1>that was I mean, you messed like a

01:20:25.375 --> 01:20:27.855
<v Speaker 0>huge hint because when you open them, I

01:20:27.855 --> 01:20:29.934
<v Speaker 0>actually remembered where my card goes.

01:20:30.495 --> 01:20:31.135
<v Speaker 2>Oh.

01:20:33.935 --> 01:20:36.014
<v Speaker 0>So you can watch that one back later.

01:20:36.655 --> 01:20:38.175
<v Speaker 1>Oh, that'll be that'll be good.

01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:41.500
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Just to make sure I didn't

01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:44.940
<v Speaker 1>break it worse or better. Okay. Alright. See

01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:48.219
<v Speaker 0>how, Chris, you were saying, like, you think

01:20:48.219 --> 01:20:49.980
<v Speaker 0>your break was gonna be too simple. Like,

01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:52.535
<v Speaker 0>user literally gonna kick yourself when you get

01:20:52.695 --> 01:20:55.335
<v Speaker 0>this is just the slow you down problem.

01:20:58.535 --> 01:20:59.335
<v Speaker 2>It's a little

01:20:59.895 --> 01:21:00.295
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

01:21:03.015 --> 01:21:04.935
<v Speaker 0>So you confirmed the IP address, which I

01:21:04.935 --> 01:21:05.735
<v Speaker 0>thought was nice.

01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:11.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm confused.

01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:13.820
<v Speaker 1>Again, like

01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:18.700
<v Speaker 2>bringing up a config file on my Thank

01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:19.500
<v Speaker 2>you. Machine

01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:20.940
<v Speaker 2>so I can see.

01:21:21.505 --> 01:21:24.625
<v Speaker 1>I'm I'm stuck on this. Why don't you

01:21:24.625 --> 01:21:26.065
<v Speaker 0>def it with one of the other ones

01:21:26.065 --> 01:21:27.665
<v Speaker 0>and see if something's different?

01:21:29.025 --> 01:21:31.025
<v Speaker 1>What other ones? Like my own? They they

01:21:31.105 --> 01:21:33.265
<v Speaker 0>you can def it with the Kubelet one.

01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:40.700
<v Speaker 0>Papa's saying, can he call a friend and

01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:42.780
<v Speaker 0>can that friend be Thomas Stromberg?

01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:44.460
<v Speaker 0>As

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:47.260
<v Speaker 0>much as I enjoyed having Thomas on, he's

01:21:47.260 --> 01:21:47.900
<v Speaker 0>barred.

01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:51.580
<v Speaker 0>Oh, Christophe sees it.

01:21:52.185 --> 01:21:53.385
<v Speaker 0>Thanks, Christophe.

01:21:53.625 --> 01:21:54.344
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

01:21:55.385 --> 01:21:57.704
<v Speaker 1>If chat sees it, don't type it. Or

01:21:57.704 --> 01:21:59.465
<v Speaker 1>rather, you can control what pops up. Right?

01:21:59.465 --> 01:22:00.985
<v Speaker 1>So, like, we won't see it. Yeah. Yeah.

01:22:00.985 --> 01:22:02.584
<v Speaker 0>I will show you. Okay.

01:22:04.264 --> 01:22:06.185
<v Speaker 2>When I don't sneakily have the YouTube channel

01:22:06.185 --> 01:22:07.760
<v Speaker 2>opened anywhere else. So

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:11.360
<v Speaker 2>could you could you vim or cat the

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:12.400
<v Speaker 2>the file again?

01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Yes. Just keep in mind have this config

01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:18.960
<v Speaker 2>file over here. Cool. Look what's here. This

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:20.880
<v Speaker 1>is the diff between Qubelet

01:22:21.815 --> 01:22:23.014
<v Speaker 1>and cubes

01:22:23.815 --> 01:22:24.775
<v Speaker 0>Oh. Calling.

01:22:25.415 --> 01:22:27.255
<v Speaker 0>So you can probably ignore the sercs because

01:22:27.255 --> 01:22:29.655
<v Speaker 0>they use different sercs. It's a kind kind

01:22:29.735 --> 01:22:31.255
<v Speaker 2>or type bit

01:22:31.415 --> 01:22:32.695
<v Speaker 2>at the top. Yep.

01:22:32.935 --> 01:22:33.335
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:36.790
<v Speaker 1>So

01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:39.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh, crumbs. I gotta get to get to

01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:41.190
<v Speaker 2>something in five minutes. So

01:22:47.185 --> 01:22:48.065
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.

01:22:48.705 --> 01:22:49.664
<v Speaker 1>Is that

01:22:51.105 --> 01:22:51.664
<v Speaker 1>there.

01:22:56.705 --> 01:22:57.105
<v Speaker 2>No?

01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:01.780
<v Speaker 1>Do you do you have your own KubeConfig?

01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:02.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:04.900
<v Speaker 2>Do. Get rid of preferences.

01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:09.700
<v Speaker 0>These are swinging swinging and missing there.

01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:11.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. And I'm just looking over here. I

01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:13.380
<v Speaker 2>don't have it. It's just delete everything.

01:23:15.015 --> 01:23:17.015
<v Speaker 1>That's that's how it's going. Right? Yeah.

01:23:17.415 --> 01:23:18.935
<v Speaker 2>Nuke it from orbit. It's the only way

01:23:18.935 --> 01:23:19.815
<v Speaker 2>to be sure.

01:23:25.095 --> 01:23:26.695
<v Speaker 1>Alright. I'm gonna put my own.

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:30.080
<v Speaker 1>Because, like, I have a good idea.

01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:33.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh, it's because I have, like, a zillion

01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:35.040
<v Speaker 2>con things in here.

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Client data, client key data.

01:23:43.765 --> 01:23:45.765
<v Speaker 2>There we go. I mean The person is

01:23:45.765 --> 01:23:46.245
<v Speaker 2>there.

01:23:48.085 --> 01:23:49.445
<v Speaker 0>It was in the diff.

01:23:50.405 --> 01:23:52.645
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was. That's that's what I'm

01:23:52.645 --> 01:23:53.365
<v Speaker 1>looking at. But

01:23:57.680 --> 01:23:59.840
<v Speaker 0>So just go through less. Take it slowly.

01:24:11.125 --> 01:24:11.925
<v Speaker 1>Really?

01:24:12.885 --> 01:24:13.285
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:25.139
<v Speaker 0>Cheap.

01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:27.940
<v Speaker 0>It's so subtle.

01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:33.699
<v Speaker 2>I think I had a dream last night

01:24:33.699 --> 01:24:34.980
<v Speaker 2>where that was the problem.

01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:38.020
<v Speaker 2>Just in a random config file. Nicely done.

01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:39.060
<v Speaker 1>Is so good.

01:24:42.625 --> 01:24:44.625
<v Speaker 1>So was that chaos thing a red herring

01:24:44.625 --> 01:24:47.665
<v Speaker 1>then? No. The chaos is that'll infect in

01:24:47.665 --> 01:24:48.385
<v Speaker 0>chaos.

01:24:49.665 --> 01:24:51.745
<v Speaker 0>At least it should be unless I broke

01:24:51.745 --> 01:24:51.985
<v Speaker 0>it.

01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:56.229
<v Speaker 2>Everything's

01:24:56.230 --> 01:24:57.030
<v Speaker 2>here.

01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:01.989
<v Speaker 2>Is

01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:04.389
<v Speaker 2>it still deleting the

01:25:05.429 --> 01:25:07.190
<v Speaker 2>cluster pod? It's running. It's been up for

01:25:07.190 --> 01:25:08.869
<v Speaker 2>ten minutes. Yeah.

01:25:09.190 --> 01:25:10.935
<v Speaker 2>Because that's what it was doing, right, when

01:25:10.935 --> 01:25:12.854
<v Speaker 2>we saw the output? Yep.

01:25:14.135 --> 01:25:15.895
<v Speaker 1>And then let's see what the output is

01:25:15.895 --> 01:25:18.534
<v Speaker 1>for that now because that is certainly come

01:25:18.534 --> 01:25:19.574
<v Speaker 1>on. Copy.

01:25:19.815 --> 01:25:22.375
<v Speaker 0>So the funny thing I can't tell you.

01:25:25.230 --> 01:25:26.110
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

01:25:28.830 --> 01:25:30.030
<v Speaker 2>he's sweet. Nice.

01:25:31.950 --> 01:25:35.230
<v Speaker 0>So by fixing your Kubernetes config, you actually

01:25:35.230 --> 01:25:37.790
<v Speaker 0>bring the chaos pod into effect.

01:25:42.045 --> 01:25:42.764
<v Speaker 0>Wait.

01:25:43.325 --> 01:25:45.244
<v Speaker 0>Because the chaos part was broken

01:25:45.325 --> 01:25:47.245
<v Speaker 0>because of the cube config. You've now fixed

01:25:47.245 --> 01:25:49.885
<v Speaker 0>the cube config. The chaos part potentially is

01:25:49.885 --> 01:25:50.925
<v Speaker 0>now chaotic.

01:25:51.805 --> 01:25:54.364
<v Speaker 1>The chaos part is actually throwing errors.

01:25:54.605 --> 01:25:56.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Because it can't get to the because

01:25:56.790 --> 01:25:58.150
<v Speaker 1>it can't get to it anymore.

01:25:58.870 --> 01:26:00.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. It was working, like, a few minutes

01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:02.710
<v Speaker 2>ago, but now it's unless we scroll all

01:26:02.710 --> 01:26:04.150
<v Speaker 2>way down to the bottom of output. Yeah.

01:26:04.150 --> 01:26:05.910
<v Speaker 2>It's it's giving the same error we got

01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:06.470
<v Speaker 2>initially.

01:26:08.895 --> 01:26:10.334
<v Speaker 1>You played yourself.

01:26:15.454 --> 01:26:17.534
<v Speaker 2>Alright. Can we port can we port forward

01:26:17.534 --> 01:26:18.254
<v Speaker 2>the

01:26:19.215 --> 01:26:20.335
<v Speaker 2>damn it. Yeah. Do you

01:26:21.375 --> 01:26:22.570
<v Speaker 2>Or I can Do have

01:26:23.290 --> 01:26:24.090
<v Speaker 1>the thing?

01:26:24.410 --> 01:26:24.730
<v Speaker 1>I

01:26:26.970 --> 01:26:28.730
<v Speaker 1>David looks like he's thinking.

01:26:29.610 --> 01:26:31.210
<v Speaker 0>Do me a favor and delete the chaos

01:26:31.210 --> 01:26:31.610
<v Speaker 0>pod.

01:26:33.685 --> 01:26:34.244
<v Speaker 2>Sure.

01:26:35.925 --> 01:26:38.085
<v Speaker 2>Oh, it's going on 80 k.

01:26:42.804 --> 01:26:44.245
<v Speaker 1>Do you just want do you just wanna

01:26:44.245 --> 01:26:45.765
<v Speaker 1>open that on stream for us?

01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh, wait. How do we It's how do

01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:50.179
<v Speaker 0>you do? It gave me an NGINX.

01:26:50.179 --> 01:26:50.820
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.

01:26:51.139 --> 01:26:51.939
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:54.820
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So Crysi CTL PS.

01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:56.099
<v Speaker 1>Crysi CTL

01:26:56.739 --> 01:26:59.619
<v Speaker 1>RM. Okay. I gotta jump to a a

01:26:59.619 --> 01:27:02.135
<v Speaker 2>meeting in a minute. This has been an

01:27:02.135 --> 01:27:03.095
<v Speaker 2>absolute

01:27:03.095 --> 01:27:03.975
<v Speaker 2>delight.

01:27:04.215 --> 01:27:06.455
<v Speaker 2>I cannot thank you enough, David, for,

01:27:06.935 --> 01:27:09.895
<v Speaker 2>inviting me to participate in this session.

01:27:09.895 --> 01:27:11.655
<v Speaker 2>Truly

01:27:11.895 --> 01:27:12.855
<v Speaker 2>divine.

01:27:12.935 --> 01:27:14.295
<v Speaker 0>Oh, thank you for joining us. It was

01:27:14.295 --> 01:27:14.535
<v Speaker 0>a treat.

01:27:16.260 --> 01:27:16.900
<v Speaker 2>Yes.

01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:20.340
<v Speaker 2>And with that, I bid you adieu.

01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:22.420
<v Speaker 2>Farewell and take care.

01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:24.500
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. No worries. Thanks.

01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:27.860
<v Speaker 1>I want to finish this off. Yeah. You

01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:28.660
<v Speaker 0>can poke around.

01:27:29.565 --> 01:27:31.645
<v Speaker 0>So you've now fixed it. So I didn't

01:27:31.805 --> 01:27:33.405
<v Speaker 0>that that's a bug in my I didn't

01:27:33.405 --> 01:27:34.445
<v Speaker 0>know that that

01:27:35.405 --> 01:27:37.165
<v Speaker 0>I can't say too much, but yeah.

01:27:37.485 --> 01:27:38.925
<v Speaker 0>There's no chaos.

01:27:39.725 --> 01:27:41.405
<v Speaker 1>There is no chaos and then the cluster

01:27:41.405 --> 01:27:44.770
<v Speaker 1>pod will not run anymore. Correct. Because it'll

01:27:44.770 --> 01:27:45.809
<v Speaker 1>just get deleted

01:27:47.410 --> 01:27:48.449
<v Speaker 1>repeatedly.

01:27:48.450 --> 01:27:49.650
<v Speaker 0>Yes. And repeatedly.

01:27:50.450 --> 01:27:51.809
<v Speaker 0>And there's a really

01:27:52.290 --> 01:27:53.890
<v Speaker 0>once we get to the end, I'll explain

01:27:53.890 --> 01:27:55.730
<v Speaker 0>it. But this is a really interesting one,

01:27:55.730 --> 01:27:56.050
<v Speaker 0>I think.

01:27:59.764 --> 01:28:00.485
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:28:00.885 --> 01:28:02.644
<v Speaker 0>Very similar to yours, actually.

01:28:07.125 --> 01:28:07.925
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

01:28:08.485 --> 01:28:09.844
<v Speaker 1>Rawkode chaos.

01:28:10.165 --> 01:28:10.485
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:14.679
<v Speaker 1>Wait. If it's similar to mine, that means

01:28:14.679 --> 01:28:15.880
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna be some sort of a matter

01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:16.280
<v Speaker 1>or

01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:20.440
<v Speaker 1>is it though? It's not nothing's remote. You

01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:21.960
<v Speaker 0>you can you can see the container d

01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:23.640
<v Speaker 0>pod running. You just can't see it in

01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:25.080
<v Speaker 0>cube control, which I think is interesting.

01:28:26.575 --> 01:28:28.255
<v Speaker 1>To me, that means it's running outside of

01:28:28.255 --> 01:28:28.975
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes.

01:28:35.615 --> 01:28:37.935
<v Speaker 0>I'll answer questions if you want, depending on

01:28:37.935 --> 01:28:39.695
<v Speaker 0>how long you have. But I won't say

01:28:39.695 --> 01:28:40.575
<v Speaker 0>anything more just now.

01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:48.710
<v Speaker 0>So how familiar are you with container d?

01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:50.150
<v Speaker 0>Not.

01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:51.990
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So you can do a container at

01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:54.310
<v Speaker 0>cry control pods to see Kubernetes pods.

01:29:00.284 --> 01:29:01.324
<v Speaker 1>That's neat.

01:29:02.684 --> 01:29:04.764
<v Speaker 0>But you will see chaos is there.

01:29:06.684 --> 01:29:08.364
<v Speaker 1>Well, also a bunch of things are not

01:29:08.364 --> 01:29:08.684
<v Speaker 1>ready.

01:29:10.700 --> 01:29:12.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if that matters. Where's cast?

01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:13.820
<v Speaker 1>Cube

01:29:13.820 --> 01:29:15.180
<v Speaker 1>control, etcetera d.

01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:20.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh, it's right at the top. It's

01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Cube name is oh, wait. What?

01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So there's only one cube API server

01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:53.700
<v Speaker 1>running.

01:29:54.100 --> 01:29:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Has eight restarts.

01:29:59.875 --> 01:30:00.994
<v Speaker 1>Bad typo.

01:30:01.955 --> 01:30:02.915
<v Speaker 1>Pods

01:30:03.075 --> 01:30:03.875
<v Speaker 1>shows

01:30:06.035 --> 01:30:08.995
<v Speaker 1>cube API server that's part of chaos namespace.

01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:17.000
<v Speaker 1>This is mean.

01:30:24.605 --> 01:30:26.765
<v Speaker 1>So chaos isn't available either.

01:30:29.725 --> 01:30:31.645
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna have to give me hints. Yeah.

01:30:31.645 --> 01:30:32.845
<v Speaker 0>There's no chaos namespace.

01:30:39.630 --> 01:30:40.989
<v Speaker 0>You wanna talk it through?

01:30:41.550 --> 01:30:42.510
<v Speaker 0>So

01:30:48.030 --> 01:30:48.829
<v Speaker 1>either

01:30:50.110 --> 01:30:53.415
<v Speaker 1>there is something horribly, easily wrong.

01:30:53.735 --> 01:30:55.575
<v Speaker 1>I'm, like, I'm trying to decide whether it's

01:30:55.575 --> 01:30:57.815
<v Speaker 1>at the Kubernetes level or at the cryo

01:30:57.815 --> 01:30:59.335
<v Speaker 1>level or container d level.

01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Or are they intrinsically linked? It's in the

01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:08.280
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes

01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:08.840
<v Speaker 0>level.

01:31:23.685 --> 01:31:25.525
<v Speaker 0>You could always check the timestamps in those

01:31:25.525 --> 01:31:26.164
<v Speaker 0>files.

01:31:26.645 --> 01:31:28.085
<v Speaker 1>That's probably a good idea.

01:31:30.965 --> 01:31:31.364
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.

01:31:35.290 --> 01:31:37.929
<v Speaker 0>This cluster has been running since 1969.

01:31:38.090 --> 01:31:39.130
<v Speaker 0>That's tricky.

01:31:40.650 --> 01:31:41.849
<v Speaker 0>Yes. I am.

01:31:42.489 --> 01:31:44.730
<v Speaker 1>Where we're going, we don't need I

01:31:46.810 --> 01:31:47.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah.

01:31:48.635 --> 01:31:50.315
<v Speaker 1>I will be honest. We are already out

01:31:50.315 --> 01:31:51.195
<v Speaker 1>of my depth.

01:31:52.315 --> 01:31:54.475
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So you're really close.

01:31:54.875 --> 01:31:55.755
<v Speaker 0>You're close.

01:31:55.995 --> 01:31:58.235
<v Speaker 0>So I'll tell you one thing and then

01:31:58.235 --> 01:32:00.075
<v Speaker 0>this this challenge that doesn't really matter. So

01:32:00.075 --> 01:32:02.090
<v Speaker 0>this is the bug with Docker

01:32:02.570 --> 01:32:04.650
<v Speaker 0>as a CRI. I actually upgraded the cluster

01:32:04.650 --> 01:32:06.650
<v Speaker 0>to upgrade it to cluster wherever we look

01:32:06.650 --> 01:32:08.250
<v Speaker 0>at it. You use Docker instead of container

01:32:08.250 --> 01:32:09.849
<v Speaker 0>d because this does not work with container

01:32:09.849 --> 01:32:10.489
<v Speaker 0>d.

01:32:11.210 --> 01:32:12.810
<v Speaker 0>The bug is you can have a static

01:32:12.810 --> 01:32:13.849
<v Speaker 0>manifest

01:32:14.415 --> 01:32:16.574
<v Speaker 0>with a pod that runs and if the

01:32:16.574 --> 01:32:18.494
<v Speaker 0>namespace doesn't exist, it will still run it.

01:32:18.494 --> 01:32:20.255
<v Speaker 0>So there is a chaos namespace running a

01:32:20.255 --> 01:32:23.215
<v Speaker 0>pod and a static manifest in this directory,

01:32:24.014 --> 01:32:25.135
<v Speaker 0>but you've not found it yet.

01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:28.400
<v Speaker 1>That's

01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:29.120
<v Speaker 1>mean.

01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:32.240
<v Speaker 1>I love it.

01:32:38.655 --> 01:32:58.655
<v Speaker 0>And

01:32:50.930 --> 01:32:52.770
<v Speaker 0>you've already said you're not an ops person,

01:32:52.770 --> 01:32:54.530
<v Speaker 0>so you might find this a little tricky.

01:32:55.570 --> 01:32:56.370
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

01:32:56.610 --> 01:32:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't see but it's in this

01:32:58.930 --> 01:32:59.650
<v Speaker 1>directory?

01:33:00.210 --> 01:33:02.210
<v Speaker 0>It is in that directory. Do you know

01:33:02.210 --> 01:33:03.730
<v Speaker 0>how to hide files on Linux?

01:33:04.850 --> 01:33:05.330
<v Speaker 0>Nope.

01:33:09.085 --> 01:33:11.725
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Chat, let's help you feel. Help

01:33:12.125 --> 01:33:12.525
<v Speaker 1>me out.

01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:19.179
<v Speaker 1>This is the point where I would be

01:33:19.179 --> 01:33:22.219
<v Speaker 1>googling. So I'm phoning a friend. And by

01:33:22.219 --> 01:33:23.820
<v Speaker 1>phoning a friend, I mean, I expect someone

01:33:23.820 --> 01:33:25.420
<v Speaker 1>to tell me the answer in YouTube chat

01:33:25.420 --> 01:33:26.139
<v Speaker 1>and then

01:33:27.020 --> 01:33:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. David just pop it up.

01:33:29.685 --> 01:33:31.525
<v Speaker 0>If Waleed, I know you're watching, Noel, you're

01:33:31.525 --> 01:33:33.125
<v Speaker 0>watching. If you just wanna jump on, I'll

01:33:33.125 --> 01:33:35.045
<v Speaker 0>send you the link. Feel free. Otherwise, start

01:33:35.045 --> 01:33:35.605
<v Speaker 0>typing some

01:33:36.565 --> 01:33:38.085
<v Speaker 0>think about how we try to fail on

01:33:38.085 --> 01:33:38.485
<v Speaker 0>that.

01:33:41.365 --> 01:33:43.205
<v Speaker 0>And if no big guesses any answers in

01:33:43.205 --> 01:33:44.885
<v Speaker 0>the next minute or two, I'll I'll walk

01:33:44.885 --> 01:33:45.365
<v Speaker 0>you through it.

01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:47.900
<v Speaker 0>I enjoyed putting this one together.

01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:49.820
<v Speaker 1>This is this is

01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:51.820
<v Speaker 1>evil.

01:33:56.060 --> 01:33:59.020
<v Speaker 0>That's a really it's a terrible bug. It

01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:00.300
<v Speaker 0>was actually my colleague,

01:34:01.375 --> 01:34:03.855
<v Speaker 0>Dan Federan, BSD box who worked it out.

01:34:03.855 --> 01:34:05.614
<v Speaker 0>I think he typos on the namespace with

01:34:05.614 --> 01:34:07.135
<v Speaker 0>the static pod and worked out that it

01:34:07.135 --> 01:34:08.014
<v Speaker 0>still worked,

01:34:08.494 --> 01:34:10.094
<v Speaker 0>but it doesn't work with container d. I

01:34:10.094 --> 01:34:11.054
<v Speaker 0>noticed. I

01:34:11.455 --> 01:34:12.494
<v Speaker 0>had to change it on time.

01:34:13.790 --> 01:34:15.310
<v Speaker 0>The Docker doesn't

01:34:15.310 --> 01:34:18.030
<v Speaker 0>validate it. Although we still get weird header.

01:34:18.510 --> 01:34:19.150
<v Speaker 0>Interesting.

01:34:20.030 --> 01:34:21.870
<v Speaker 0>Well, we're not gonna use FLS

01:34:22.670 --> 01:34:23.070
<v Speaker 0>cheating.

01:34:37.375 --> 01:34:39.935
<v Speaker 0>Noel is suggesting, is it a main boat,

01:34:39.935 --> 01:34:41.295
<v Speaker 0>a bind mount,

01:34:41.535 --> 01:34:43.614
<v Speaker 0>which l s dash al would not show?

01:34:46.610 --> 01:34:48.369
<v Speaker 0>It is not, actually.

01:34:54.050 --> 01:34:54.929
<v Speaker 0>Nice idea, though.

01:34:59.625 --> 01:35:00.585
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So

01:35:02.825 --> 01:35:04.505
<v Speaker 1>You need you need that voodoo. Give me

01:35:04.505 --> 01:35:05.385
<v Speaker 1>that voodoo.

01:35:07.625 --> 01:35:09.785
<v Speaker 0>So it is actually

01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:13.480
<v Speaker 0>relatively easy to hide things from LS.

01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:16.200
<v Speaker 0>And normally what you would encourage people to

01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:17.800
<v Speaker 0>do is an echo star, but I've also

01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:19.240
<v Speaker 0>hidden it from there too.

01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:20.520
<v Speaker 0>So,

01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:25.575
<v Speaker 0>we'll just walk through it. Let's wrap this

01:35:25.575 --> 01:35:26.615
<v Speaker 0>up. Please do. Like

01:35:27.175 --> 01:35:29.015
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So if you can't see it with

01:35:29.015 --> 01:35:29.735
<v Speaker 0>LS

01:35:30.295 --> 01:35:32.135
<v Speaker 0>and you can't see it with echo star,

01:35:32.455 --> 01:35:34.695
<v Speaker 0>you got to start wondering if it could

01:35:34.695 --> 01:35:37.095
<v Speaker 0>have been really cruel and mounted something in

01:35:37.095 --> 01:35:38.775
<v Speaker 0>with eBPF. I have not done that.

01:35:39.739 --> 01:35:41.340
<v Speaker 0>You could check to see

01:35:41.660 --> 01:35:43.500
<v Speaker 0>if the command has been modified,

01:35:43.739 --> 01:35:44.619
<v Speaker 0>which it has

01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:45.579
<v Speaker 0>not.

01:35:46.060 --> 01:35:48.139
<v Speaker 0>The one thing you could do

01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:51.500
<v Speaker 0>would be to take ENV and look for

01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:52.380
<v Speaker 0>certain flags.

01:35:53.065 --> 01:35:54.664
<v Speaker 0>That's a that's a really strong hand for

01:35:54.664 --> 01:35:57.145
<v Speaker 0>anyone who's familiar with Linux, but there is

01:35:57.145 --> 01:35:59.864
<v Speaker 0>also ways using the environment variables to subsequently

01:35:59.864 --> 01:36:02.504
<v Speaker 0>hide more things from the shell,

01:36:03.864 --> 01:36:06.425
<v Speaker 0>which I've also sophisticated just for the the

01:36:06.425 --> 01:36:07.769
<v Speaker 0>laughs. So

01:36:11.530 --> 01:36:14.010
<v Speaker 0>is a particularly harsh one.

01:36:14.329 --> 01:36:15.050
<v Speaker 0>So

01:36:16.329 --> 01:36:18.409
<v Speaker 0>there is an environment variable

01:36:18.809 --> 01:36:20.250
<v Speaker 0>called glob ignore,

01:36:21.775 --> 01:36:24.414
<v Speaker 0>which will obfuscate the file from the echo

01:36:24.414 --> 01:36:25.135
<v Speaker 0>star

01:36:25.534 --> 01:36:27.295
<v Speaker 0>by saying that we don't wanna see any

01:36:27.295 --> 01:36:28.974
<v Speaker 0>files that have a backup,

01:36:29.375 --> 01:36:31.934
<v Speaker 0>the end and the backup tilde symbol.

01:36:32.574 --> 01:36:34.014
<v Speaker 0>So we could unset

01:36:34.094 --> 01:36:35.135
<v Speaker 0>the glob ignore.

01:36:37.450 --> 01:36:39.370
<v Speaker 0>We still don't have LS, but the echo

01:36:39.370 --> 01:36:41.370
<v Speaker 0>star now would work and you'd see there's

01:36:41.370 --> 01:36:44.489
<v Speaker 0>a Rawkode. YAML here with the bad thing.

01:36:44.890 --> 01:36:46.409
<v Speaker 1>That is beautiful.

01:36:46.490 --> 01:36:48.409
<v Speaker 0>Now why does the LS not work?

01:36:48.890 --> 01:36:50.970
<v Speaker 0>Because I'm an asshole mostly.

01:36:52.865 --> 01:36:55.105
<v Speaker 0>If we go to profile.d,

01:36:57.425 --> 01:36:58.385
<v Speaker 0>there's my

01:36:59.025 --> 01:37:01.425
<v Speaker 0>bad command. So LS was modified to always

01:37:01.425 --> 01:37:03.025
<v Speaker 0>pass a dash b, which means don't show

01:37:03.025 --> 01:37:04.065
<v Speaker 0>backup files.

01:37:04.305 --> 01:37:06.545
<v Speaker 0>I then replaced an alias for ENV to

01:37:06.545 --> 01:37:09.239
<v Speaker 0>also omit and hide the glove environment variable.

01:37:09.239 --> 01:37:12.039
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god. I love it. So, yeah,

01:37:12.039 --> 01:37:13.639
<v Speaker 0>it was particularly harsh.

01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:14.760
<v Speaker 0>But now

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.920
<v Speaker 0>you and all the people that are watching

01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:19.480
<v Speaker 0>are familiar with the Docker runtime and its

01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:22.655
<v Speaker 0>ability to launch static pods into an namespace

01:37:22.655 --> 01:37:26.175
<v Speaker 0>that doesn't exist, making it completely invisible almost

01:37:26.335 --> 01:37:28.975
<v Speaker 0>to operators except for cry control PS.

01:37:29.375 --> 01:37:30.255
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

01:37:33.695 --> 01:37:36.410
<v Speaker 1>You're you're evil and I deserved every minute

01:37:36.410 --> 01:37:37.050
<v Speaker 1>of this.

01:37:38.250 --> 01:37:39.930
<v Speaker 0>Well, I I'd say yours was a lot

01:37:39.930 --> 01:37:42.970
<v Speaker 0>more evil than mine was, but I

01:37:43.610 --> 01:37:45.370
<v Speaker 0>think that was cool.

01:37:45.610 --> 01:37:47.370
<v Speaker 0>This is this is the first time well,

01:37:47.370 --> 01:37:48.810
<v Speaker 0>this is now the second time I've broken

01:37:48.810 --> 01:37:50.554
<v Speaker 0>a cluster for the show. I really enjoyed

01:37:50.554 --> 01:37:51.114
<v Speaker 0>it.

01:37:51.435 --> 01:37:53.435
<v Speaker 0>Thank you for joining me for breaking your

01:37:53.435 --> 01:37:54.074
<v Speaker 0>cluster.

01:37:55.435 --> 01:37:57.355
<v Speaker 0>Some nice little things there. I like the

01:37:57.355 --> 01:37:59.514
<v Speaker 0>story around it too. I felt helpless for

01:37:59.514 --> 01:38:01.675
<v Speaker 0>the entire first thirty minutes of the episode,

01:38:01.755 --> 01:38:03.355
<v Speaker 0>which is the best way to feel during

01:38:03.355 --> 01:38:03.915
<v Speaker 0>this I feel.

01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:07.439
<v Speaker 1>I felt just as helpless now.

01:38:08.159 --> 01:38:11.039
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, thank you everyone for watching. Thank

01:38:11.039 --> 01:38:12.639
<v Speaker 0>you for joining me. Thanks to Chris who's

01:38:12.639 --> 01:38:14.079
<v Speaker 0>already left. He had a meeting to go

01:38:14.079 --> 01:38:14.559
<v Speaker 0>to.

01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:17.360
<v Speaker 0>There will be no cluster next week, but

01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:19.360
<v Speaker 0>I will be bringing it back the following

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:19.679
<v Speaker 0>week.

01:38:20.455 --> 01:38:22.295
<v Speaker 0>Gfi, have an awesome day. That was really

01:38:22.295 --> 01:38:24.215
<v Speaker 0>fun, and I'll speak to you again soon.

01:38:24.455 --> 01:38:25.335
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.

01:38:25.335 --> 01:38:27.255
<v Speaker 1>You very much. Was so much fun. Bye

01:38:27.255 --> 01:38:28.054
<v Speaker 1>bye. Cheers. Bye, man.
