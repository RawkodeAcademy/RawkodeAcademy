00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.720
<v Speaker 0>Hi, and welcome to another Rawkode Bite here

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.480
<v Speaker 0>at the Rawkode Academy.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.360
<v Speaker 0>Today, I wanna share with you my top

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.759
<v Speaker 0>five tips and tricks for shell proficiency.

00:00:15.035 --> 00:00:17.914
<v Speaker 0>Number one, switching to the previous directory.

00:00:18.475 --> 00:00:20.154
<v Speaker 0>If you spend a lot of your time

00:00:20.154 --> 00:00:22.715
<v Speaker 0>in a terminal, you probably jump around directories

00:00:22.715 --> 00:00:23.595
<v Speaker 0>a fair bit.

00:00:24.154 --> 00:00:25.595
<v Speaker 0>Did you know you can use a c

00:00:25.595 --> 00:00:26.474
<v Speaker 0>d dash

00:00:26.634 --> 00:00:28.395
<v Speaker 0>to jump to the previous directory?

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.090
<v Speaker 0>That's tip number one.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.250
<v Speaker 0>Tip number two, reverse history search.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.370
<v Speaker 0>You probably also type a fair number of

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.730
<v Speaker 0>commands on your terminal.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.450
<v Speaker 0>Firstly, you can just use the up and

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.850
<v Speaker 0>down arrow keys to navigate your command history.

00:00:45.965 --> 00:00:47.805
<v Speaker 0>This is great for commands that you know

00:00:47.805 --> 00:00:49.325
<v Speaker 0>you executed recently.

00:00:49.645 --> 00:00:50.365
<v Speaker 0>However,

00:00:50.525 --> 00:00:53.165
<v Speaker 0>if your command is too far back,

00:00:53.485 --> 00:00:55.005
<v Speaker 0>this gets rather cumbersome.

00:00:56.045 --> 00:00:57.885
<v Speaker 0>For this, you can use control r.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.100
<v Speaker 0>Pressing control r push you into a history

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.900
<v Speaker 0>search. Type something from your previous command and

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.900
<v Speaker 0>watch it come front and center.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.420
<v Speaker 0>Tip number three, special variables.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.075
<v Speaker 0>Most shells provide some special variables. For instance,

00:01:13.075 --> 00:01:14.915
<v Speaker 0>did you know that the exit code of

00:01:14.915 --> 00:01:16.115
<v Speaker 0>the last command

00:01:16.595 --> 00:01:19.635
<v Speaker 0>is available via dollar sign question mark?

00:01:20.675 --> 00:01:23.235
<v Speaker 0>Dollar sign exclamation mark has a process ID

00:01:23.235 --> 00:01:25.315
<v Speaker 0>of the last executed command

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.580
<v Speaker 0>and dollar dollar is the process ID of

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.620
<v Speaker 0>the current command,

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.540
<v Speaker 0>which is probably your shell.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.060
<v Speaker 0>These are pretty useful when you start automating

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.580
<v Speaker 0>tasks with scripts.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.380
<v Speaker 0>Tip number four,

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.060
<v Speaker 0>find files

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.620
<v Speaker 0>fast.

00:01:41.895 --> 00:01:44.215
<v Speaker 0>The find command is fantastic when you don't

00:01:44.215 --> 00:01:45.735
<v Speaker 0>really know where the file you're looking for

00:01:45.735 --> 00:01:48.375
<v Speaker 0>lives or even which file you're looking for.

00:01:49.095 --> 00:01:51.655
<v Speaker 0>First, you can find files based on types.

00:01:52.135 --> 00:01:54.695
<v Speaker 0>You can look for files, directories,

00:01:54.695 --> 00:01:55.495
<v Speaker 0>links,

00:01:55.495 --> 00:01:56.295
<v Speaker 0>or even socket.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.970
<v Speaker 0>Next, you can filter files based on the

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:00.689
<v Speaker 0>owner

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.770
<v Speaker 0>or the group.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.290
<v Speaker 0>And how about finding empty files

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.250
<v Speaker 0>or files modified within the last two days?

00:02:13.035 --> 00:02:14.635
<v Speaker 0>And what if you even want to delete

00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:15.435
<v Speaker 0>them all,

00:02:16.635 --> 00:02:17.835
<v Speaker 0>or execute

00:02:17.915 --> 00:02:19.275
<v Speaker 0>a random command?

00:02:20.235 --> 00:02:22.875
<v Speaker 0>I could go on and on, but really,

00:02:22.875 --> 00:02:24.395
<v Speaker 0>you should just go check out Veinte.

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.900
<v Speaker 0>Tip number five, control codes.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.819
<v Speaker 0>There are a whole bunch of control codes

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.060
<v Speaker 0>that you can use on the command line.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.540
<v Speaker 0>Control a will take you all the way

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.220
<v Speaker 0>back to the start of the line.

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.299
<v Speaker 0>Control e will take you to the end.

00:02:40.445 --> 00:02:42.365
<v Speaker 0>If you want to delete the entire line,

00:02:42.365 --> 00:02:43.885
<v Speaker 0>you can use control u.

00:02:44.685 --> 00:02:48.285
<v Speaker 0>My favorite, control l. This clears your screen.

00:02:49.245 --> 00:02:50.365
<v Speaker 0>No more typing clear.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.720
<v Speaker 0>And lastly, the one that everybody hates because

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.239
<v Speaker 0>they press it accidentally,

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.440
<v Speaker 0>control s.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.360
<v Speaker 0>This will stop your terminal showing any output.

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Speaker 0>You will think your terminal has frozen.

00:03:04.885 --> 00:03:06.725
<v Speaker 0>You'll then go and Google for the shortcut

00:03:06.725 --> 00:03:08.325
<v Speaker 0>and see that it's control q.

00:03:08.565 --> 00:03:09.925
<v Speaker 0>And it doesn't matter that I've told you

00:03:09.925 --> 00:03:11.845
<v Speaker 0>it's control q, you're gonna forget.

00:03:12.005 --> 00:03:12.965
<v Speaker 0>I promise.

00:03:13.205 --> 00:03:15.125
<v Speaker 0>That's my top five tips

00:03:15.205 --> 00:03:16.565
<v Speaker 0>for shell proficiency.

00:03:16.725 --> 00:03:18.405
<v Speaker 0>If you like this video, let me know

00:03:18.405 --> 00:03:19.525
<v Speaker 0>and I'll drop five more.

00:03:20.197 --> 00:03:21.077
<v Speaker 0>Have a great day.
