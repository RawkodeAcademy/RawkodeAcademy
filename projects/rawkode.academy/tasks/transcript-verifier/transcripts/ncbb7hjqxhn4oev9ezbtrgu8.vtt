<v Speaker 0>This is Clustered.

00:02:06.465 --> 00:02:09.185
<v Speaker 0>Today, we have something special. We have

00:02:09.425 --> 00:02:11.025
<v Speaker 0>ChainGuard versus

<v Speaker 0>ChainGuard.

00:02:12.144 --> 00:02:14.465
<v Speaker 0>We have two teams from the same organization.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.349
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully you're all familiar with ChainGuard. They've been

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:18.790
<v Speaker 0>hiring up all the best talent in the

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.989
<v Speaker 0>cloud native ecosystem,

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.510
<v Speaker 0>but I'm sure we're in for one hell

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.030

<v Speaker 0>Clustard two. So thank you to Equinix Metal.

00:02:58.205 --> 00:03:00.364
<v Speaker 0>Now I could run Clustard on some small

<v Speaker 0>VMs with a few cores and a wee

00:03:02.685 --> 00:03:04.204
<v Speaker 0>tiny bit of RAM, but I don't. I

00:03:04.204 --> 00:03:06.045
<v Speaker 0>run it on big chunky boxes with lots

00:03:06.045 --> 00:03:07.644
<v Speaker 0>of cores and lots of RAM because it

00:03:07.644 --> 00:03:09.805
<v Speaker 0>makes it more fun. So thank you Equinix

<v Speaker 3>exactly the same tactics,

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:39.879
<v Speaker 3>which were to allow only as a teammate

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:40.919
<v Speaker 3>to do all the work.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.240

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:01.890
<v Speaker 3>West side, the best side.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.770
<v Speaker 0>Don't know. That can be a real control

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.370
<v Speaker 0>plan. Right? That could be a real API

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:08.770
<v Speaker 0>server.

00:07:09.675 --> 00:07:11.915
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It could be real.

00:07:13.195 --> 00:07:14.075
<v Speaker 1>Let's

00:07:14.795 --> 00:07:16.795
<v Speaker 1>just for fun, let's go look at the

<v Speaker 1>See if they've changed anything here.

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:27.940
<v Speaker 1>That looks like is it 8021?

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.860
<v Speaker 1>Is that the right one?

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.340

<v Speaker 3>I think you need yeah. Let's let's go

00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:38.075
<v Speaker 3>with it until Trevor knew otherwise. Changing IP

00:07:38.075 --> 00:07:40.715
<v Speaker 0>address would be particularly mean, but feel free

00:07:40.715 --> 00:07:42.315
<v Speaker 0>to run IP adder if you really wanna

00:07:42.315 --> 00:07:42.875
<v Speaker 0>check.

00:07:43.275 --> 00:07:44.155

00:09:13.165 --> 00:09:15.404
<v Speaker 3>thing to change the image, isn't it?

00:09:16.204 --> 00:09:16.605
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.779
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't look right, though. Six four four

00:09:20.779 --> 00:09:21.339
<v Speaker 1>three.

00:09:22.779 --> 00:09:26.380
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't it? Oh, they're clustered. Yes. Okay. Yep.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.620
<v Speaker 3>But you do servers. Dash run on port

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:29.579
<v Speaker 0>eighty eighty.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:30.699
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

00:09:32.215 --> 00:09:34.535
<v Speaker 3>But that's, like, con this I'm sure that's

00:09:34.535 --> 00:09:35.335
<v Speaker 3>Kubernetes

00:09:35.895 --> 00:09:37.655
<v Speaker 3>session 6443, isn't it?

00:09:41.335 --> 00:09:42.855
<v Speaker 0>The API server does. Yes.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.320
<v Speaker 1>Was I looking at the wrong one? Clustered.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.600
<v Speaker 1>That endpoint doesn't seem right.

00:09:53.279 --> 00:09:54.000
<v Speaker 4>Nope.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.

00:09:59.245 --> 00:10:01.565
<v Speaker 3>Are we just gonna leave till well, yeah,

00:10:01.565 --> 00:10:03.325
<v Speaker 3>that's one thing at a time. I was

00:10:03.325 --> 00:10:04.765
<v Speaker 3>gonna say we're leave those pods. They're probably

00:10:04.765 --> 00:10:07.325
<v Speaker 3>doing nothing. They're probably just decoration all those

00:10:07.325 --> 00:10:07.964
<v Speaker 3>pods.

00:10:08.524 --> 00:10:09.805
<v Speaker 4>Well They're gonna be a painfully.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Let's go see

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.420
<v Speaker 1>who this guy is.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.740
<v Speaker 3>What did you do? Get pods.

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.620
<v Speaker 1>Dasha.0y.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.535
<v Speaker 1>Looking at the IP address, trying to figure

00:10:25.535 --> 00:10:26.894
<v Speaker 1>out who that endpoint is.

00:10:29.535 --> 00:10:30.255
<v Speaker 1>Could

00:10:35.214 --> 00:10:36.175
<v Speaker 2>be VIP.

00:10:36.654 --> 00:10:37.694
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. What's that?

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.560
<v Speaker 0>So that is the control plane private I

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.600
<v Speaker 0>p v four.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:44.720
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Uh-huh.

00:10:50.855 --> 00:10:52.855
<v Speaker 0>Why is your service pointing to that?

00:10:53.415 --> 00:10:53.895
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:10:54.535 --> 00:10:55.255
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:10:57.975 --> 00:11:01.415
<v Speaker 1>Wonder if we just go ahead and reexpose

00:11:01.415 --> 00:11:02.775
<v Speaker 1>reexpose

00:11:02.775 --> 00:11:03.015
<v Speaker 1>it.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.120
<v Speaker 3>Okay. Yeah. Can we just I mean, you

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.279
<v Speaker 3>can probably describe the service and I don't

00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:08.240
<v Speaker 3>know that gives you.

00:11:11.279 --> 00:11:12.959
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah. The edit looked right.

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:23.125
<v Speaker 3>Yes. So endpoints is just wrong. Yeah. So

00:11:23.125 --> 00:11:24.725
<v Speaker 3>just update the endpoint.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:33.930
<v Speaker 4>Type node port.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.610
<v Speaker 1>What is the what's the labels on pods?

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:41.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. Describe. Yeah.

00:11:46.435 --> 00:11:49.155
<v Speaker 1>When I keep typing, like, clustered in Kubernetes,

00:11:49.555 --> 00:11:51.155
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna keep getting that wrong.

00:11:52.515 --> 00:11:55.475
<v Speaker 1>Default app is clustered, k l u s

00:11:55.475 --> 00:11:57.475
<v Speaker 1>d e r d. Yeah.

00:11:58.035 --> 00:11:59.955
<v Speaker 1>So what's the selector on that service?

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:02.370
<v Speaker 1>Clustered.

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Selector. Oh, it doesn't have a selector.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:07.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:13.650
<v Speaker 1>Told you they were gonna start with the

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:14.130
<v Speaker 1>networking.

00:12:20.705 --> 00:12:23.345
<v Speaker 1>But you can't change a selector on it,

00:12:23.345 --> 00:12:25.185
<v Speaker 1>can you, after you've created it?

00:12:25.665 --> 00:12:27.825
<v Speaker 1>Because this looks right. You you can add

00:12:27.825 --> 00:12:30.480
<v Speaker 0>the selector. You can add the selector. Yeah.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:31.920
<v Speaker 4>Change.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.880
<v Speaker 1>Session finding. Where is the selector in the

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:37.200
<v Speaker 1>spec?

00:12:41.425 --> 00:12:43.345
<v Speaker 0>Well, after spec, you would just have to

00:12:43.345 --> 00:12:50.065
<v Speaker 0>do selector and then Yeah. Match labels. I'm

00:12:50.065 --> 00:12:52.545
<v Speaker 2>not touching the keyboard to put the but

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.120
<v Speaker 3>Carlos, just just

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.040
<v Speaker 3>give Carlos a keyboard.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I don't I don't like I don't

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.440
<v Speaker 2>like to use VM as well.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Let's quit some.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.480
<v Speaker 1>It's all fine. VMAX is not installed on

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.040
<v Speaker 0>these servers.

00:13:07.605 --> 00:13:09.285
<v Speaker 2>Oh, that's even worse.

00:13:12.005 --> 00:13:14.645
<v Speaker 0>So your hypothesis here is that they removed

00:13:14.645 --> 00:13:16.645
<v Speaker 0>the selector and added a manual endpoint for

00:13:16.645 --> 00:13:18.405
<v Speaker 0>the service. Is that what you're thinking?

00:13:18.885 --> 00:13:19.285
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.220
<v Speaker 1>What is the select what's the selector on

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.140
<v Speaker 1>it again, guys? I don't know. It's a

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:27.740
<v Speaker 2>app App clustered. App app app clustered.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.780
<v Speaker 1>It's a good first guess, I would say.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:35.105
<v Speaker 0>You'll need to fix that end in patient.

00:13:35.825 --> 00:13:36.545
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:13:37.665 --> 00:13:39.904
<v Speaker 0>I'm actually surprised that it accepted that. It

00:13:39.904 --> 00:13:41.985
<v Speaker 0>did. There you It did.

00:13:46.945 --> 00:13:47.425
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:00.010
<v Speaker 0>Thomas, it's true. We shouldn't have left any

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:00.970
<v Speaker 0>editors installed.

00:14:02.625 --> 00:14:05.024
<v Speaker 3>Was Well, that's

00:14:05.024 --> 00:14:05.985
<v Speaker 3>a good point.

00:14:06.385 --> 00:14:08.625
<v Speaker 3>Open Vim and type colon old files.

00:14:15.209 --> 00:14:16.890
<v Speaker 1>That should be fine. Right?

00:14:19.449 --> 00:14:20.889
<v Speaker 1>I'm just checking to make sure they're not

00:14:20.889 --> 00:14:22.810
<v Speaker 1>messing with those binary output. It can mess

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:23.930
<v Speaker 1>up your terminal.

00:14:25.769 --> 00:14:27.130
<v Speaker 3>I just put it to a file you

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:27.290
<v Speaker 3>want.

00:14:29.005 --> 00:14:30.045
<v Speaker 1>One sec.

00:14:30.524 --> 00:14:31.005
<v Speaker 1>Checks

00:14:32.845 --> 00:14:33.485
<v Speaker 1>checking

00:14:35.084 --> 00:14:37.725
<v Speaker 1>that. Okay. They they didn't mess it up

00:14:37.725 --> 00:14:38.445
<v Speaker 1>there.

00:14:40.524 --> 00:14:42.765
<v Speaker 1>We're not do we still have this old

00:14:42.765 --> 00:14:43.245
<v Speaker 1>endpoint?

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.950
<v Speaker 1>No? Nope. Didn't change the endpoint.

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:53.150
<v Speaker 1>Just make sure it's going to the right

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.790
<v Speaker 1>one.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:56.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't need dash. Just need the clustered

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:57.150
<v Speaker 3>port.

00:14:58.365 --> 00:15:00.365
<v Speaker 3>But one thing you could do I'm sorry.

00:15:00.365 --> 00:15:01.885
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So it is it's pointing to the

00:15:01.885 --> 00:15:02.765
<v Speaker 1>right pod.

00:15:03.084 --> 00:15:04.685
<v Speaker 3>Right. So go into the pod and crawl

00:15:04.685 --> 00:15:05.645
<v Speaker 3>from the pod and see if you get

00:15:05.645 --> 00:15:06.445
<v Speaker 3>the same thing.

00:15:07.165 --> 00:15:08.125
<v Speaker 1>Good point.

00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:11.325
<v Speaker 0>I tried to load it, and it doesn't

00:15:11.325 --> 00:15:11.645
<v Speaker 0>work.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh, need dash dash.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.400
<v Speaker 0>Sorry. Uh-oh.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:23.680
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:25.760
<v Speaker 1>I can't.

00:15:27.365 --> 00:15:29.205
<v Speaker 1>Oh, no. I'm oh, I just yelled at.

00:15:30.645 --> 00:15:32.565
<v Speaker 1>This is on 8080 in here.

00:15:35.125 --> 00:15:35.845
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:15:36.085 --> 00:15:37.925
<v Speaker 0>Act just blow me the terminal. We can

00:15:37.925 --> 00:15:39.045
<v Speaker 0>always sign a new one.

00:15:39.605 --> 00:15:40.245
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah.

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:44.460
<v Speaker 1>It's looking like

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.180
<v Speaker 3>To change the what's wrong? Do a PSEUX

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:49.980
<v Speaker 3>for it. Is

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:51.260
<v Speaker 3>NGINX running? That.

00:15:56.005 --> 00:15:58.405
<v Speaker 3>So that's that's what you were using it

00:15:58.405 --> 00:15:59.605
<v Speaker 3>in genetics, weren't you?

00:16:00.245 --> 00:16:02.245
<v Speaker 3>Or were you using Apache,

00:16:02.485 --> 00:16:03.205
<v Speaker 3>David?

00:16:03.525 --> 00:16:05.205
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. David,

00:16:05.685 --> 00:16:07.925
<v Speaker 1>is is it running Apache inside your image?

00:16:07.925 --> 00:16:08.725
<v Speaker 0>It is not.

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:11.710
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It is not. Okay.

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.670
<v Speaker 3>So

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:15.230
<v Speaker 3>Like, it just faked it. This is not

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:17.310
<v Speaker 3>David's image, I believe.

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:19.630
<v Speaker 1>No. No. It is not.

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:22.350
<v Speaker 1>Let's go ahead and go look at the

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:22.910
<v Speaker 1>deployments.

00:16:23.235 --> 00:16:25.075
<v Speaker 0>Matt says he can have it. I don't

00:16:25.075 --> 00:16:25.795
<v Speaker 0>know why

00:16:27.154 --> 00:16:30.355
<v Speaker 0>my browser isn't letting me have it.

00:16:31.394 --> 00:16:33.475
<v Speaker 2>Okay. Let's have this.

00:16:33.875 --> 00:16:37.075
<v Speaker 1>That's quite does that look does that spelling

00:16:37.075 --> 00:16:39.500
<v Speaker 1>look great? I could I could imagine them

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.660
<v Speaker 1>putting something up in GitHub.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.860
<v Speaker 1>Rawkode Academy,

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.420
<v Speaker 1>k l s u t e r d

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:48.540
<v Speaker 1>b one.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:16:51.865 --> 00:16:52.345
<v Speaker 3>I would

00:16:53.625 --> 00:16:54.745
<v Speaker 3>next thing I would do is get the

00:16:54.745 --> 00:16:56.665
<v Speaker 3>digest so we can see when that changes.

00:16:56.665 --> 00:16:59.704
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I'm checking more clearly here with this

00:16:59.704 --> 00:17:00.425
<v Speaker 2>image.

00:17:03.464 --> 00:17:03.865
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.

00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:06.029
<v Speaker 4>And he could have done what I did

00:17:06.029 --> 00:17:07.549
<v Speaker 3>in the previous thing, which was to play

00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:08.429
<v Speaker 3>with the

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:10.109
<v Speaker 3>container d config

00:17:10.109 --> 00:17:11.229
<v Speaker 3>dot toml.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:14.190
<v Speaker 1>Where is that located? Is

00:17:15.549 --> 00:17:18.510
<v Speaker 3>it it's a container d

00:17:23.475 --> 00:17:26.194
<v Speaker 3>I thought it's container d. Let me check.

00:17:27.555 --> 00:17:29.475
<v Speaker 4>What's that? It's a containerdconfig.com,

00:17:29.475 --> 00:17:31.555
<v Speaker 3>but possibly I I

00:17:31.715 --> 00:17:34.100
<v Speaker 3>don't maybe that doesn't exist unless you've,

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:36.180
<v Speaker 3>like, made a change to it. So that

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.300
<v Speaker 3>means you made no change. What's your head

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.740
<v Speaker 0>what's your head cough to this right now?

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.260
<v Speaker 0>What what are we worried about? What what

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:41.540
<v Speaker 0>symptom do we have and what are you

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.420
<v Speaker 0>trying to fix?

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.580
<v Speaker 3>Well, I see that's the right image.

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's not the right image.

00:17:50.765 --> 00:17:53.805
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I just grabbed the the digest

00:17:53.805 --> 00:17:54.445
<v Speaker 2>from

00:17:55.005 --> 00:17:57.965
<v Speaker 2>the Rawkode Academy cluster d v one.

00:17:58.525 --> 00:17:59.245
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:17:59.645 --> 00:18:02.765
<v Speaker 2>And it starts with F0D9.

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:05.549
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Give me one sec.

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:08.510
<v Speaker 1>Get pod

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:11.710
<v Speaker 4>get pods.

00:18:20.515 --> 00:18:23.315
<v Speaker 1>Let's

00:18:23.315 --> 00:18:24.835
<v Speaker 1>just do YAML,

00:18:24.835 --> 00:18:26.675
<v Speaker 1>and I'll be lazy and just grunt for

00:18:26.675 --> 00:18:27.394
<v Speaker 1>image.

00:18:28.115 --> 00:18:30.995
<v Speaker 1>What what was it? Yeah. That's correct.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:33.049
<v Speaker 1>That's right? Oh.

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:37.130
<v Speaker 2>E b yeah. That's correct.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:38.970
<v Speaker 3>What happens if we just kill

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:41.370
<v Speaker 3>well, what happens if we just pull

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:44.170
<v Speaker 3>a new version of the I mean,

00:18:44.835 --> 00:18:46.275
<v Speaker 0>So you're you're

00:18:46.275 --> 00:18:48.355
<v Speaker 0>looking at the container deconfig because you think

00:18:48.355 --> 00:18:49.475
<v Speaker 0>they've somehow

00:18:49.715 --> 00:18:52.034
<v Speaker 0>configured container d to pull something out?

00:18:52.355 --> 00:18:54.115
<v Speaker 3>That's what I did remember. So I wonder

00:18:54.115 --> 00:18:55.155
<v Speaker 3>if they're trying get revenge.

00:18:57.049 --> 00:18:59.370
<v Speaker 3>But it's possible they just uploaded a new

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:02.729
<v Speaker 3>image onto the the nodes. With a feature?

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:07.450
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Yeah.

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.250
<v Speaker 3>Or edited the running one.

00:19:12.914 --> 00:19:15.875
<v Speaker 2>Did we check this crazy part with the

00:19:15.875 --> 00:19:16.914
<v Speaker 2>stuff

00:19:16.914 --> 00:19:19.394
<v Speaker 2>to see what's inside those?

00:19:20.034 --> 00:19:22.115
<v Speaker 1>No. We haven't. So we can go ahead

00:19:22.115 --> 00:19:22.995
<v Speaker 1>and just look at one,

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:27.509
<v Speaker 1>see what they're actually doing.

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:32.710
<v Speaker 0>Thomas does suggest that you can cat minus

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:34.950
<v Speaker 0>v for that bainery stream if you want.

00:19:42.625 --> 00:19:45.665
<v Speaker 1>Just running the box and busy box.

00:19:47.105 --> 00:19:48.304
<v Speaker 2>I'll sleep

00:19:48.465 --> 00:19:49.345
<v Speaker 2>forever.

00:19:49.425 --> 00:19:50.145
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:19:50.225 --> 00:19:50.625
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.010
<v Speaker 1>It's just a

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:56.169
<v Speaker 1>misdirection.

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:01.610
<v Speaker 2>Oh. Do we

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:05.210
<v Speaker 2>Let's go to the root. Let's check that

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:06.330
<v Speaker 2>read me stuff.

00:20:07.605 --> 00:20:09.685
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Let's try to know no spoilers here.

00:20:09.685 --> 00:20:10.884
<v Speaker 0>Right? No

00:20:12.165 --> 00:20:13.445
<v Speaker 1>spoilers here.

00:20:14.165 --> 00:20:14.645
<v Speaker 1>Let's

00:20:15.045 --> 00:20:16.085
<v Speaker 1>yeah. Okay.

00:20:16.405 --> 00:20:18.405
<v Speaker 3>This four. Mean, how much have I done?

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Well, that's that's not ominous at all.

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:30.260
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.980
<v Speaker 1>The list of most places unexpected.

00:20:34.345 --> 00:20:35.224
<v Speaker 1>Can

00:20:36.345 --> 00:20:36.984
<v Speaker 3>we

00:20:39.304 --> 00:20:41.065
<v Speaker 3>So I'm wiping out the clustered image and

00:20:41.065 --> 00:20:41.624
<v Speaker 3>just

00:20:42.345 --> 00:20:44.664
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I think I'm gonna So

00:20:44.664 --> 00:20:47.225
<v Speaker 0>where is this pod scheduled? And then maybe

00:20:47.225 --> 00:20:49.384
<v Speaker 0>just manually remove the image and force it

00:20:49.384 --> 00:20:49.865
<v Speaker 0>to

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.280
<v Speaker 0>pull again. Yeah. That sounds

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.000
<v Speaker 0>Because I'm curious and I don't know the

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.600
<v Speaker 0>answer to this. Right? But the image pull

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.080
<v Speaker 0>policy was always. But if it reaches out

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.000
<v Speaker 0>the container registry and the digest is the

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
<v Speaker 0>same, I'm assuming it doesn't pull the same

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:04.320
<v Speaker 0>image.

00:21:05.065 --> 00:21:06.505
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. So you might can you get in

00:21:06.505 --> 00:21:08.105
<v Speaker 3>like So if they were if they were

00:21:08.105 --> 00:21:11.385
<v Speaker 0>able to fake the digest and being a

00:21:11.465 --> 00:21:12.265
<v Speaker 0>security

00:21:13.225 --> 00:21:13.945
<v Speaker 0>company,

00:21:14.185 --> 00:21:15.865
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming that is where we send people

00:21:15.865 --> 00:21:16.825
<v Speaker 0>skill set,

00:21:17.225 --> 00:21:17.865
<v Speaker 0>then

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.179
<v Speaker 0>that would be an interesting break.

00:21:20.419 --> 00:21:21.700
<v Speaker 3>Well, I guess you can just go into

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:23.940
<v Speaker 3>you used to be able to just go

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.299
<v Speaker 3>into, like, the file system.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:33.059
<v Speaker 3>But do it you can use CTR as

00:21:33.059 --> 00:21:33.220
<v Speaker 3>well.

00:21:34.755 --> 00:21:35.715
<v Speaker 3>You're in the 12

00:21:36.115 --> 00:21:38.435
<v Speaker 0>I mean, it's the 12. The ACLs, but

00:21:38.435 --> 00:21:40.675
<v Speaker 0>otherwise, it wouldn't pull. So

00:21:41.155 --> 00:21:42.915
<v Speaker 0>where's the pod schedule? So let's go delete

00:21:42.915 --> 00:21:43.635
<v Speaker 0>an image.

00:21:44.595 --> 00:21:46.435
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get that. Sorry. The wrong one.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.160
<v Speaker 1>Clustered.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.920
<v Speaker 2>Well, this well, this got their full partner.

00:22:00.605 --> 00:22:02.205
<v Speaker 1>Oh, that's right. Yeah.

00:22:04.845 --> 00:22:07.325
<v Speaker 1>Need the full one. It's not a deployment.

00:22:12.365 --> 00:22:13.165
<v Speaker 1>Being lazy.

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:15.250
<v Speaker 1>Not YAML.

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:16.690
<v Speaker 1>Typing

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:17.970
<v Speaker 1>okay.

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:20.130
<v Speaker 1>That still looks right, and it's probably still

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:20.850
<v Speaker 1>wrong.

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:24.930
<v Speaker 0>So do I get pods or wait and

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:26.210
<v Speaker 0>see where it's scheduled?

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:26.930
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:22:29.625 --> 00:22:30.424
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:22:32.425 --> 00:22:35.065
<v Speaker 2>The previous one was in the worker.

00:22:35.545 --> 00:22:37.305
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So I suggest we jump on to

00:22:37.305 --> 00:22:38.424
<v Speaker 0>worker one.

00:22:38.505 --> 00:22:41.225
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Yeah. You're start another session for us?

00:22:41.225 --> 00:22:43.465
<v Speaker 0>I am indeed. So West

00:22:43.465 --> 00:22:44.185
<v Speaker 0>worker one.

00:22:56.755 --> 00:22:58.995
<v Speaker 0>Oh, it got a nice MOTD as I

00:22:58.995 --> 00:23:00.274
<v Speaker 0>logged in. No.

00:23:01.315 --> 00:23:02.674
<v Speaker 1>Of course, it does.

00:23:06.515 --> 00:23:07.154
<v Speaker 1>Lovely.

00:23:08.355 --> 00:23:09.394
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:23:10.275 --> 00:23:11.794
<v Speaker 3>I might wanna do a PS first.

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:13.849
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:16.570
<v Speaker 0>Well, at least, like, you're not in a

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:17.289
<v Speaker 0>container.

00:23:23.289 --> 00:23:25.049
<v Speaker 1>There seems to be a lot of fun

00:23:25.049 --> 00:23:25.850
<v Speaker 1>going on here.

00:23:30.155 --> 00:23:31.434
<v Speaker 3>Container d.

00:23:32.235 --> 00:23:32.875
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

00:23:33.115 --> 00:23:34.715
<v Speaker 0>So are you just going to try and

00:23:34.715 --> 00:23:37.595
<v Speaker 0>inject this image with cry control or CTR?

00:23:38.475 --> 00:23:39.675
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Let's

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:44.030
<v Speaker 3>Oh, I don't know what Craig can tell

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:46.190
<v Speaker 3>you. Got the money. Not pleased with.

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:53.390
<v Speaker 1>Just kill every one of them with honks.

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:55.790
<v Speaker 2>Why we have, like,

00:23:56.565 --> 00:23:59.524
<v Speaker 2>there is some invoice here in the Busy

00:23:59.524 --> 00:24:00.404
<v Speaker 2>ambassador?

00:24:00.804 --> 00:24:03.125
<v Speaker 0>I think I wanna check and see I

00:24:03.125 --> 00:24:04.804
<v Speaker 1>just wanna check and see if there's anything

00:24:04.804 --> 00:24:05.524
<v Speaker 1>in here.

00:24:06.804 --> 00:24:08.565
<v Speaker 1>No. It doesn't look like there's anything in

00:24:08.565 --> 00:24:08.725
<v Speaker 1>there.

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. CRI, CTLs, they just stop like I

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:14.630
<v Speaker 1>would expect.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:21.830
<v Speaker 3>There's CTR as well. You can use dash

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:24.070
<v Speaker 0>dash runtime dash endpoint and point it to

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:26.104
<v Speaker 0>the computer, the socket to

00:24:26.265 --> 00:24:28.104
<v Speaker 0>cut out all those error messages.

00:24:28.905 --> 00:24:30.825
<v Speaker 0>Runtime dash To the container? Point.

00:24:32.105 --> 00:24:33.384
<v Speaker 1>Dash endpoint.

00:24:33.465 --> 00:24:34.984
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Equals ties.

00:24:35.465 --> 00:24:37.945
<v Speaker 0>Slash run slash container d slash container d

00:24:37.945 --> 00:24:38.905
<v Speaker 0>dot stock, I believe.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:40.639
<v Speaker 1>This guy?

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.080
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.080
<v Speaker 0>Although you might need it before the stock

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.200
<v Speaker 0>ID thing.

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:50.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.120
<v Speaker 1>Okay. You can tell I use this one

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:53.520
<v Speaker 1>a lot.

00:24:57.065 --> 00:24:59.225
<v Speaker 0>Just try p s dot yeah. Or that.

00:24:59.225 --> 00:25:01.304
<v Speaker 3>You're missing an x. Okay. X.

00:25:02.105 --> 00:25:03.544
<v Speaker 3>I think you're missing the

00:25:03.785 --> 00:25:04.745
<v Speaker 3>at the end of SOC.

00:25:07.279 --> 00:25:08.960
<v Speaker 1>S o c k, right then?

00:25:10.159 --> 00:25:12.159
<v Speaker 3>Oh, maybe it's my I'm just watching on

00:25:12.159 --> 00:25:13.679
<v Speaker 3>the the videos, I guess.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:17.919
<v Speaker 0>Do you mind if I type for a

00:25:17.919 --> 00:25:18.479
<v Speaker 0>second?

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:19.600
<v Speaker 0>Sure.

00:25:23.255 --> 00:25:24.535
<v Speaker 0>Run.

00:25:26.375 --> 00:25:26.855
<v Speaker 0>Enter the

00:25:31.415 --> 00:25:32.615
<v Speaker 0>yeah. There it is.

00:25:33.575 --> 00:25:33.975
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:39.169
<v Speaker 3>The CTR as well. It's not not easier.

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:42.450
<v Speaker 0>There you go.

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:43.809
<v Speaker 0>She's done.

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:47.970
<v Speaker 0>You should you should be able to list

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:48.690
<v Speaker 0>images as well.

00:25:50.654 --> 00:25:51.374
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:25:52.174 --> 00:25:54.494
<v Speaker 1>It's been up, but it's also restarted.

00:26:00.735 --> 00:26:02.815
<v Speaker 1>Thanks, Thomas, for the reminder.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.220
<v Speaker 3>Yes. Let's delete those images. Yep. So if

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:06.940
<v Speaker 0>we run

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:09.260
<v Speaker 0>KaiControl images, we can see what's on the

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:09.820
<v Speaker 0>host.

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:13.900
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:16.540
<v Speaker 1>Probably don't need NGINX or BusyBox.

00:26:17.445 --> 00:26:19.684
<v Speaker 0>What was well, I would focus on clustered.

00:26:19.684 --> 00:26:22.005
<v Speaker 0>We've got twenty minutes left. Yep. Yeah. Exactly.

00:26:22.005 --> 00:26:22.804
<v Speaker 1>Wow.

00:26:22.884 --> 00:26:24.804
<v Speaker 1>Time time flies when you're in the hot

00:26:24.804 --> 00:26:25.364
<v Speaker 1>seat.

00:26:27.125 --> 00:26:28.085
<v Speaker 1>Does it just delete?

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:32.580
<v Speaker 1>Or is it d Dell?

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:34.980
<v Speaker 0>RMI

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:36.340
<v Speaker 0>is the command that you want to delete

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:38.020
<v Speaker 0>RMI. And then the image ID.

00:26:45.045 --> 00:26:46.645
<v Speaker 1>Just as I thought, being in the hot

00:26:46.645 --> 00:26:48.485
<v Speaker 1>seat is much different than just watching.

00:26:51.445 --> 00:26:53.845
<v Speaker 0>I think your RMA use a space after

00:26:53.845 --> 00:26:54.804
<v Speaker 0>the socket.

00:26:54.805 --> 00:26:55.685
<v Speaker 3>This is deleted.

00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:59.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. I deleted it. Doesn't yeah. It doesn't

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:00.889
<v Speaker 1>exist. It's not there.

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Let's

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:06.250
<v Speaker 1>should we try to re should should we

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:09.050
<v Speaker 1>try to delete the one that's provisioned on

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:11.345
<v Speaker 1>the control plan and restart it? And I'm

00:27:11.345 --> 00:27:13.505
<v Speaker 1>back onto the control plan.

00:27:14.785 --> 00:27:16.465
<v Speaker 3>Oh, I'm hoping it just restart.

00:27:17.425 --> 00:27:19.825
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Looks like it did.

00:27:20.785 --> 00:27:23.185
<v Speaker 0>I would just restart. Yeah. Yeah.

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:38.550
<v Speaker 1>It's creating. It's creating.

00:27:41.395 --> 00:27:43.955
<v Speaker 1>Okay. It's running. Do we wanna try to

00:27:43.955 --> 00:27:45.315
<v Speaker 1>curl inside the pod again and see if

00:27:45.315 --> 00:27:46.915
<v Speaker 1>it's the right one this time? You should

00:27:46.915 --> 00:27:48.995
<v Speaker 0>be able to curl localhost 30,000.

00:27:49.635 --> 00:27:51.395
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. That's right. There.

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:55.609
<v Speaker 1>Baylor.

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:01.929
<v Speaker 0>I didn't expect that.

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:04.489
<v Speaker 1>I yeah.

00:28:05.049 --> 00:28:06.409
<v Speaker 1>I didn't either.

00:28:06.809 --> 00:28:08.649
<v Speaker 1>But the image

00:28:08.105 --> 00:28:08.585
<v Speaker 1>yeah.

00:28:09.385 --> 00:28:11.625
<v Speaker 1>Should we look at it anymore of the

00:28:11.625 --> 00:28:12.265
<v Speaker 1>hints?

00:28:12.505 --> 00:28:13.225
<v Speaker 0>Apparently,

00:28:13.305 --> 00:28:15.465
<v Speaker 0>there is a hint for this issue. So

00:28:15.865 --> 00:28:17.785
<v Speaker 3>Did did we actually check the config the

00:28:17.785 --> 00:28:20.185
<v Speaker 3>container of the TOML on that the worker

00:28:20.185 --> 00:28:22.585
<v Speaker 3>node or just on the No. We did

00:28:22.585 --> 00:28:23.145
<v Speaker 1>not

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:26.049
<v Speaker 1>check it. Okay. So that's gonna be in

00:28:26.049 --> 00:28:27.330
<v Speaker 1>cat etcd

00:28:27.809 --> 00:28:28.929
<v Speaker 1>or etcd.

00:28:28.929 --> 00:28:30.049
<v Speaker 1>Container d.

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:31.889
<v Speaker 1>Tomo.

00:28:35.169 --> 00:28:35.730
<v Speaker 1>Nothing

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:38.929
<v Speaker 1>nefarious in there

00:28:39.285 --> 00:28:41.285
<v Speaker 3>on the one side. Can we come up?

00:28:42.165 --> 00:28:43.845
<v Speaker 0>So I can tell you that container d

00:28:43.845 --> 00:28:45.765
<v Speaker 0>doesn't ship with a config by default. So

00:28:45.765 --> 00:28:47.765
<v Speaker 0>this was Exactly. Put there by them. And

00:28:47.765 --> 00:28:49.845
<v Speaker 0>that snapshot to me seems suspicious.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.159
<v Speaker 3>You know, I would delete the file.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:56.919
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.799
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Yeah. I'll run with it. We ought

00:28:59.799 --> 00:29:01.559
<v Speaker 0>to restart something.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.400
<v Speaker 3>What we could look. What would yeah. I'm

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.155
<v Speaker 3>not sure what you're a start. Yeah. You

00:29:05.155 --> 00:29:07.715
<v Speaker 0>would restart container d and then delete the

00:29:07.715 --> 00:29:08.434
<v Speaker 0>pod.

00:29:11.395 --> 00:29:12.195
<v Speaker 0>They're

00:29:12.195 --> 00:29:12.914
<v Speaker 0>rumbled. We

00:29:13.635 --> 00:29:16.515
<v Speaker 0>have all nose and crying cat faces or

00:29:16.515 --> 00:29:17.315
<v Speaker 4>shot cat faces.

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:23.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. That just means it's like onto like

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:25.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. We've been to the next one. Yeah.

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:28.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. This is actually we stumbled into the

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:30.030
<v Speaker 1>The first this is the first line. Yeah.

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:30.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:29:30.909 --> 00:29:33.950
<v Speaker 0>Thomas is saying, deleting random files from slash

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:36.185
<v Speaker 0>e t c to fix production issues. What

00:29:36.185 --> 00:29:37.145
<v Speaker 0>could go wrong?

00:29:37.465 --> 00:29:39.945
<v Speaker 3>We're not deleting random files. We're resetting them

00:29:39.945 --> 00:29:40.905
<v Speaker 3>to the default.

00:29:41.625 --> 00:29:43.865
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I would suggest that

00:29:44.105 --> 00:29:46.105
<v Speaker 0>container d doesn't seem to be restarting, which

00:29:46.105 --> 00:29:48.425
<v Speaker 0>is not Yeah. It doesn't seem to that's

00:29:48.425 --> 00:29:49.065
<v Speaker 1>not okay.

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:51.890
<v Speaker 0>You may wanna look at that unit file.

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:54.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah. I would say, like, maybe we can

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:56.690
<v Speaker 2>get the default config

00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:58.850
<v Speaker 2>TOML and put that back.

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:02.370
<v Speaker 3>You can container deal, put the default TOML

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:02.850
<v Speaker 3>if you want.

00:30:06.025 --> 00:30:07.625
<v Speaker 0>But you could just edit the unit file.

00:30:07.625 --> 00:30:09.145
<v Speaker 0>Assume it I'm assuming they must have modified

00:30:09.145 --> 00:30:10.024
<v Speaker 0>something

00:30:10.105 --> 00:30:12.985
<v Speaker 0>to look explicitly for a config.

00:30:13.705 --> 00:30:14.424
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:30:16.025 --> 00:30:17.945
<v Speaker 1>Carlos, do you know that? I I don't

00:30:17.945 --> 00:30:18.345
<v Speaker 1>know that.

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:21.050
<v Speaker 2>What?

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:23.770
<v Speaker 2>I was waiting How help is that? So

00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:25.690
<v Speaker 0>system d system.

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:28.410
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna be okay. Where

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:31.530
<v Speaker 0>is it? Alright. Well, let's try system control

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:32.810
<v Speaker 0>cat container d.

00:30:34.705 --> 00:30:36.065
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.

00:30:38.784 --> 00:30:40.304
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. You I don't see

00:30:41.424 --> 00:30:43.184
<v Speaker 3>Well, it's just about snapshot in there that

00:30:43.184 --> 00:30:44.384
<v Speaker 3>didn't make a look of.

00:30:44.705 --> 00:30:46.784
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I think that was above my last

00:30:46.784 --> 00:30:47.105
<v Speaker 0>prompt.

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:49.299
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:30:49.379 --> 00:30:51.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't see it It looks clean. Looking

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:53.139
<v Speaker 1>for a config. Yeah. It does it looks

00:30:53.139 --> 00:30:54.979
<v Speaker 1>like it's not looking for a config file.

00:30:57.139 --> 00:30:59.139
<v Speaker 0>Does it did you control c the restart,

00:30:59.139 --> 00:31:00.755
<v Speaker 0>or did it just finish? Like, is container

00:31:00.755 --> 00:31:02.355
<v Speaker 0>d now running? I did I did a

00:31:02.355 --> 00:31:03.794
<v Speaker 1>control c. I mean, we can do

00:31:04.515 --> 00:31:06.034
<v Speaker 3>We'll do a system c l c t

00:31:06.034 --> 00:31:07.475
<v Speaker 3>l status and see what comes up. Let's

00:31:07.475 --> 00:31:08.674
<v Speaker 0>test data. Yeah.

00:31:11.794 --> 00:31:13.610
<v Speaker 3>It's just the whole thing. I would do

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:15.610
<v Speaker 3>everything. No. Come on.

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay. It's running.

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:20.650
<v Speaker 0>So you might have said it took a

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:21.930
<v Speaker 0>long time because

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:24.410
<v Speaker 0>there are quite a lot of pods

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:25.850
<v Speaker 0>and containers. Yeah.

00:31:26.615 --> 00:31:28.535
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So you might be alright. Let's let's

00:31:28.535 --> 00:31:30.375
<v Speaker 0>go back to control then. Let's play that

00:31:30.375 --> 00:31:31.175
<v Speaker 0>pod. Yeah.

00:31:32.215 --> 00:31:35.175
<v Speaker 1>Okay. You just have fifteen minutes left.

00:31:35.415 --> 00:31:37.495
<v Speaker 2>Well, that's Okay. You definitely But you are

00:31:37.495 --> 00:31:39.175
<v Speaker 0>doing great. Really, really good.

00:31:47.779 --> 00:31:50.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that post SQL controller zero.

00:31:51.139 --> 00:31:53.059
<v Speaker 1>So even if we get it get clustered

00:31:53.059 --> 00:31:53.700
<v Speaker 1>running,

00:31:54.179 --> 00:31:56.980
<v Speaker 1>something some something's going on with the database.

00:31:57.365 --> 00:32:00.245
<v Speaker 1>I can She's gonna ask me what databases

00:32:01.685 --> 00:32:04.245
<v Speaker 0>alright. We have a clustered pod.

00:32:09.125 --> 00:32:09.845
<v Speaker 1>Hey.

00:32:10.085 --> 00:32:11.925
<v Speaker 1>Hey. Hey. There we go.

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.080
<v Speaker 1>Alright. Elements by tags. This this is v

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:15.720
<v Speaker 1>one.

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:17.559
<v Speaker 0>You make This looks right.

00:32:30.185 --> 00:32:32.665
<v Speaker 1>That's pro that's gotta be the database.

00:32:33.865 --> 00:32:34.665
<v Speaker 1>So

00:32:37.305 --> 00:32:40.025
<v Speaker 1>nicely done. I thought we made progress, but,

00:32:40.105 --> 00:32:40.585
<v Speaker 0>apparently,

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.720
<v Speaker 0>maybe not. Alright.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:44.880
<v Speaker 0>What next?

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna delete that controller pod, but I

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.360
<v Speaker 1>didn't see if there was a staple set

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.200
<v Speaker 1>for it. There is.

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:53.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna remove that guy.

00:33:00.905 --> 00:33:01.784
<v Speaker 3>Is there

00:33:02.585 --> 00:33:03.705
<v Speaker 1>So what How is it

00:33:05.305 --> 00:33:06.745
<v Speaker 1>I think you were gonna go with the

00:33:06.745 --> 00:33:09.145
<v Speaker 1>same thing. How does how does cluster d

00:33:09.145 --> 00:33:11.330
<v Speaker 1>know to talk to it? It's hard coded

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:14.130
<v Speaker 0>as a service endpoint called Postgres.

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:15.970
<v Speaker 0>Uh-huh.

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:19.890
<v Speaker 2>Take a look on the services.

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:23.330
<v Speaker 1>Postgres.

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:23.810
<v Speaker 1>Postgres.

00:33:24.165 --> 00:33:25.765
<v Speaker 2>And that's 10108.

00:33:25.765 --> 00:33:26.165
<v Speaker 1>Well,

00:33:27.205 --> 00:33:29.285
<v Speaker 1>let's let's go see.

00:33:34.725 --> 00:33:36.245
<v Speaker 1>Well, it came back up.

00:33:36.565 --> 00:33:39.285
<v Speaker 1>That's fun. Well, it But that has a

00:33:39.285 --> 00:33:41.230
<v Speaker 0>stateful set name,

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:43.149
<v Speaker 0>and you deleted a pod.

00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:44.110
<v Speaker 0>Well,

00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:46.750
<v Speaker 1>I deleted the stateful set. Alright. Thought I

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:48.190
<v Speaker 1>did. Oh,

00:33:48.429 --> 00:33:49.549
<v Speaker 0>then that's different.

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:53.070
<v Speaker 1>I did delete it. Okay.

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:55.549
<v Speaker 2>Maybe maybe this is in a manifest, like,

00:33:55.665 --> 00:33:58.785
<v Speaker 2>hardcore manifest in there. Let's see. That's what

00:33:58.785 --> 00:34:01.185
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna yeah. Let's If it was a

00:34:01.185 --> 00:34:03.585
<v Speaker 0>manifest, we would see the control plane

00:34:03.665 --> 00:34:05.745
<v Speaker 0>node name as part of the

00:34:06.305 --> 00:34:09.505
<v Speaker 0>Ah. Part. Okay. I'm I'm getting serious now.

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Install now you are. Sorry about the sudden

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.240
<v Speaker 0>Adrian is showing up. There we go.

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:19.600
<v Speaker 3>Do app install rip grip, and then change

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:22.239
<v Speaker 3>directly slash Etsy rip grip honk.

00:34:24.054 --> 00:34:25.815
<v Speaker 0>You think we left some honks in the

00:34:25.815 --> 00:34:27.015
<v Speaker 0>script? You

00:34:27.895 --> 00:34:29.415
<v Speaker 3>have to change the Is it slash that

00:34:29.415 --> 00:34:31.495
<v Speaker 1>way? No. You you gotta change the directory

00:34:31.495 --> 00:34:32.215
<v Speaker 3>you want to start in.

00:34:36.699 --> 00:34:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Is Etsy. Yeah. Honk.

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:40.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. I see. Sorry.

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:42.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:43.980
<v Speaker 3>My plan failed.

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:45.660
<v Speaker 3>The other thing you can do is look

00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:47.500
<v Speaker 3>in Vim and put call in old files.

00:34:48.594 --> 00:34:50.995
<v Speaker 1>Matt is also saying check the hints. And

00:34:50.995 --> 00:34:53.235
<v Speaker 0>Thomas is saying that whatever situation we're in

00:34:53.235 --> 00:34:55.635
<v Speaker 0>is my fault. So sorry.

00:34:57.155 --> 00:34:58.675
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure what I did.

00:34:59.715 --> 00:35:01.635
<v Speaker 1>We already fixed that, I believe.

00:35:02.349 --> 00:35:04.829
<v Speaker 0>I hope so. Yep. That's fixed. Yeah. Yeah.

00:35:04.829 --> 00:35:05.870
<v Speaker 2>This is fixed.

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Sail. Where are we setting sail for? For

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:12.110
<v Speaker 1>land.

00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:13.310
<v Speaker 1>Be

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:15.070
<v Speaker 1>on the realms of control plane. Go beyond

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:17.325
<v Speaker 1>the IP address. The IPCs of the land

00:35:17.325 --> 00:35:19.645
<v Speaker 1>and the workers were more fun awaits.

00:35:20.205 --> 00:35:22.445
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we've encountered that yet. Well,

00:35:22.445 --> 00:35:23.725
<v Speaker 3>we did go on to work and change

00:35:23.725 --> 00:35:25.325
<v Speaker 3>the the config. So we might have got

00:35:25.325 --> 00:35:26.445
<v Speaker 3>part of it, but it might be more

00:35:26.445 --> 00:35:27.405
<v Speaker 3>there. I don't know.

00:35:27.725 --> 00:35:28.125
<v Speaker 3>Mhmm.

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:29.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:32.260
<v Speaker 1>And then I think we already did the

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.060
<v Speaker 1>CTR.

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:35.780
<v Speaker 3>Okay. So maybe there's something still broken on

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:37.300
<v Speaker 3>that. Oh, there you go. It doesn't have

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.780
<v Speaker 3>to know. The controller the controller controls more

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:40.340
<v Speaker 1>than you think.

00:35:41.234 --> 00:35:42.835
<v Speaker 3>We've not done that. So, like, look at

00:35:42.835 --> 00:35:43.714
<v Speaker 3>the controller,

00:35:43.714 --> 00:35:45.714
<v Speaker 3>like, Etsy manifest thing.

00:35:46.035 --> 00:35:46.755
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:35:47.234 --> 00:35:49.714
<v Speaker 0>If you look under there Apparently, the worker

00:35:49.714 --> 00:35:51.635
<v Speaker 0>part is completed.

00:35:52.035 --> 00:35:53.075
<v Speaker 0>Okay. We have a node.

00:35:54.099 --> 00:35:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:35:57.619 --> 00:36:00.099
<v Speaker 0>So the controller one is a Postgres hint

00:36:00.099 --> 00:36:01.540
<v Speaker 0>according to Thomas.

00:36:01.859 --> 00:36:05.220
<v Speaker 3>Oh, okay. Is a Postgres hint. I don't

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:05.940
<v Speaker 3>know this bit.

00:36:07.494 --> 00:36:09.415
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. So you go Let's talk about what's

00:36:09.415 --> 00:36:11.335
<v Speaker 0>happening. You delete the stateful set and it

00:36:11.335 --> 00:36:13.255
<v Speaker 0>came back. How are they doing that? Yeah.

00:36:13.255 --> 00:36:14.615
<v Speaker 0>Right? There's a few ways to do that.

00:36:14.615 --> 00:36:16.055
<v Speaker 0>So let's try and work through them.

00:36:16.535 --> 00:36:17.735
<v Speaker 3>The logged in to the thing.

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.760
<v Speaker 1>They're logged in to let's I want

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:25.840
<v Speaker 1>could be a service that's wouldn't be. Yeah.

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.000
<v Speaker 1>That wouldn't be very nice,

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.280
<v Speaker 1>sporting.

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.400
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if there's anything we already looked

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.920
<v Speaker 1>in the manifest. There's no manifest in the

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:36.155
<v Speaker 1>worker node. Wonder if there's just a there's

00:36:36.155 --> 00:36:38.075
<v Speaker 1>gotta be a script or something that's starting

00:36:38.715 --> 00:36:40.075
<v Speaker 1>the pods back up.

00:36:40.555 --> 00:36:41.515
<v Speaker 3>Could be.

00:36:43.515 --> 00:36:45.915
<v Speaker 1>A cron maybe? Yeah. Something you create the

00:36:45.915 --> 00:36:47.595
<v Speaker 3>stateful set when you called it. Right?

00:36:47.915 --> 00:36:48.795
<v Speaker 3>And he's talking.

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Let's go with three.

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:56.660
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look like it is. That is

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.500
<v Speaker 0>not Does Kubernetes have Chrome?

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:00.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:04.820
<v Speaker 6>Gotta love jobs. Chrome jobs. Oh, yeah. Dash

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:06.105
<v Speaker 3>figure. Yeah.

00:37:07.225 --> 00:37:09.625
<v Speaker 2>Not jobs. They're chrome jobs. Yep. Chrome jobs

00:37:09.625 --> 00:37:10.185
<v Speaker 0>too.

00:37:11.945 --> 00:37:13.385
<v Speaker 1>Is it just chrome jobs?

00:37:14.825 --> 00:37:15.625
<v Speaker 2>No.

00:37:16.025 --> 00:37:18.345
<v Speaker 2>May No? And what if if you want

00:37:18.345 --> 00:37:18.985
<v Speaker 2>those

00:37:19.385 --> 00:37:19.945
<v Speaker 2>bots,

00:37:21.789 --> 00:37:24.349
<v Speaker 2>that crazy pods? Like, it's not a busy

00:37:24.349 --> 00:37:25.950
<v Speaker 2>box and doing stuff,

00:37:26.109 --> 00:37:28.510
<v Speaker 2>actually. Yeah. One of them might be doing

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:30.430
<v Speaker 1>something, you think? Yeah.

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:33.069
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. I could do.

00:37:34.155 --> 00:37:37.675
<v Speaker 2>One of these, like Check the image names.

00:37:37.995 --> 00:37:38.635
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:37:39.275 --> 00:37:41.755
<v Speaker 1>Grip. On all of on on all of

00:37:41.755 --> 00:37:42.235
<v Speaker 1>them?

00:37:43.115 --> 00:37:44.475
<v Speaker 3>Well, no. Can we not just, like, get

00:37:44.475 --> 00:37:44.795
<v Speaker 3>all the?

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:47.210
<v Speaker 0>Get pods. Yeah.

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:49.369
<v Speaker 0>So you can run

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:51.609
<v Speaker 3>Get pods and then get all of them

00:37:51.609 --> 00:37:53.369
<v Speaker 3>and then just grip for the image name,

00:37:53.369 --> 00:37:55.210
<v Speaker 3>I guess. Yeah. You can run cube control

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:57.609
<v Speaker 0>cluster info and grip that for all the

00:37:57.609 --> 00:37:59.130
<v Speaker 0>images across the entire cluster.

00:38:00.204 --> 00:38:02.845
<v Speaker 1>Say that again. Sorry. Cluster dash info.

00:38:03.885 --> 00:38:04.765
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah.

00:38:11.645 --> 00:38:13.085
<v Speaker 1>And just grab images?

00:38:13.325 --> 00:38:14.685
<v Speaker 0>Maybe image.

00:38:15.565 --> 00:38:17.540
<v Speaker 0>And maybe cluster info dump. I can't really

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.060
<v Speaker 0>remember the exact one. Yeah.

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:20.820
<v Speaker 1>It's probably dump. Yeah. It's got that's the

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:22.740
<v Speaker 1>one that's got all of the information. That's

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:23.380
<v Speaker 0>the one.

00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:27.140
<v Speaker 1>Busy bugs. Busy bugs. And Thomas is saying,

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:29.140
<v Speaker 0>it's a worker process, and it's still my

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:29.380
<v Speaker 0>fault.

00:38:31.405 --> 00:38:34.045
<v Speaker 1>Okay. Let's go back to the worker then.

00:38:34.605 --> 00:38:35.725
<v Speaker 3>Oh, jeez.

00:38:37.005 --> 00:38:39.085
<v Speaker 3>Let's just call it let right. Put the

00:38:39.085 --> 00:38:41.405
<v Speaker 3>control plane schedulable and call in the damn

00:38:41.405 --> 00:38:42.285
<v Speaker 3>worker. Yeah.

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.359
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't matter how you fix it. Right?

00:38:45.359 --> 00:38:46.480
<v Speaker 0>Good day to you, Adrian.

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:48.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Okay.

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Not pods, nodes.

00:38:56.445 --> 00:38:59.245
<v Speaker 1>Am I spelling right? Quite far off.

00:39:01.245 --> 00:39:02.605
<v Speaker 3>That's like a chef.

00:39:04.365 --> 00:39:06.925
<v Speaker 0>Cardone. Yeah. Oh. Oh. Oh.

00:39:08.559 --> 00:39:10.880
<v Speaker 0>Cartoon would be to make it religious, I

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:11.119
<v Speaker 0>think.

00:39:21.925 --> 00:39:24.565
<v Speaker 1>And then we probably wanna kill wanna kill

00:39:24.565 --> 00:39:27.045
<v Speaker 1>cluster kill all the bugs. The rubber cable

00:39:27.045 --> 00:39:29.525
<v Speaker 0>is asking, wouldn't cardinal worker be a problem

00:39:29.525 --> 00:39:30.965
<v Speaker 0>because it's the only one?

00:39:31.125 --> 00:39:32.964
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. We need to, like, make the master

00:39:32.964 --> 00:39:33.765
<v Speaker 3>schedulable.

00:39:33.765 --> 00:39:36.190
<v Speaker 0>Yes. We can remove the tent from the

00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:37.150
<v Speaker 0>control plane.

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:40.190
<v Speaker 3>Which is yeah. That's weird sent to We

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:42.510
<v Speaker 1>wanna edit the way Oh, there's a good

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:44.830
<v Speaker 0>hint from Thomas. I should be assistant to

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:48.430
<v Speaker 0>the worker. Clearly, I've started some horrible process.

00:39:52.675 --> 00:39:54.435
<v Speaker 0>But we've cordoned it anyway. Right? So it

00:39:54.435 --> 00:39:55.155
<v Speaker 0>doesn't matter. Yeah.

00:39:55.955 --> 00:40:00.115
<v Speaker 3>SSHD

00:40:00.115 --> 00:40:00.915
<v Speaker 3>isn't.

00:40:01.075 --> 00:40:02.035
<v Speaker 0>Isn't SSHD.

00:40:02.859 --> 00:40:04.540
<v Speaker 0>We go through Teleport. We don't go through

00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:05.500
<v Speaker 0>SSHD.

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:09.260
<v Speaker 3>Oh, jeez.

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:11.500
<v Speaker 0>What have you stunted my cluster? My poor

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:12.140
<v Speaker 0>little cluster.

00:40:18.175 --> 00:40:19.695
<v Speaker 3>It better not be just logged in and

00:40:19.695 --> 00:40:21.295
<v Speaker 3>doing things. That's gonna annoy me.

00:40:21.695 --> 00:40:23.455
<v Speaker 0>No. I don't think so. I I'm assuming

00:40:23.455 --> 00:40:26.335
<v Speaker 0>SSHD is a custom binary for that. Yeah.

00:40:26.655 --> 00:40:26.815
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.040
<v Speaker 1>So I killed that.

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.280
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We've got So try calling

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:34.800
<v Speaker 3>seven minutes.

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:37.120
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to remove a tint of

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:39.760
<v Speaker 3>a somewhat schedulable? It's like kubectl

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:42.480
<v Speaker 3>tint Edit. It would all help us. Well,

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.840
<v Speaker 0>you called in the node, but you also

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:45.200
<v Speaker 0>didn't drain the worker.

00:40:47.485 --> 00:40:49.165
<v Speaker 0>Although, I can't remember if a cordon does

00:40:49.165 --> 00:40:51.005
<v Speaker 0>a drain, but I still see I can't

00:40:51.005 --> 00:40:53.965
<v Speaker 1>remember. No. No. The the drain does a

00:40:53.965 --> 00:40:54.685
<v Speaker 2>cordon.

00:40:54.845 --> 00:40:56.365
<v Speaker 0>The drain does a cordon. Yes. So let's

00:40:56.365 --> 00:40:58.125
<v Speaker 0>drain that node. Which is it gonna drain?

00:40:58.125 --> 00:40:58.605
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

00:40:59.965 --> 00:41:00.765
<v Speaker 1>Drain.

00:41:00.765 --> 00:41:01.005
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:41:02.339 --> 00:41:04.099
<v Speaker 1>What's the node's name?

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:11.940
<v Speaker 2>Uh-oh. Do, like, you know, our dev sets

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:14.900
<v Speaker 2>and dash dash delete dash dash

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:17.415
<v Speaker 2>data. Yep. That's the one. You wanna type

00:41:17.415 --> 00:41:20.535
<v Speaker 1>you wanna type the One second. One second.

00:41:27.255 --> 00:41:28.135
<v Speaker 1>I was looking.

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Dash dash ignore daemon sets.

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:36.650
<v Speaker 3>Oh, what's this weird stuff?

00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:43.290
<v Speaker 0>Well, did we do the drain? I don't

00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:44.090
<v Speaker 0>think we did the drain.

00:41:44.934 --> 00:41:46.455
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it did either.

00:41:46.855 --> 00:41:48.295
<v Speaker 2>No. That is on the

00:41:50.855 --> 00:41:53.815
<v Speaker 2>cannot delete parts that not managed by replication

00:41:53.815 --> 00:41:56.535
<v Speaker 2>control or replica set. The most set or

00:41:56.535 --> 00:41:57.414
<v Speaker 2>stateful set.

00:42:17.375 --> 00:42:18.655
<v Speaker 1>Five minutes.

00:42:19.375 --> 00:42:21.295
<v Speaker 3>East I think we still need to make

00:42:21.295 --> 00:42:24.175
<v Speaker 0>the control plane schedule, though. Right? Indeed.

00:42:25.375 --> 00:42:27.615
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Somebody wanna get the syntax from that.

00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:30.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. It's gonna be like kubectl

00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:31.849
<v Speaker 3>taint nodes,

00:42:31.849 --> 00:42:33.930
<v Speaker 3>the control plane node, and then You can

00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:36.090
<v Speaker 0>just edit the nodes and remove the taint.

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:37.930
<v Speaker 3>Oh, cool. Yeah. Let let's let's make this

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:39.770
<v Speaker 0>quick. We've got four and a half minutes.

00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:42.250
<v Speaker 3>Cool. Kubectl edit. Yeah.

00:42:44.165 --> 00:42:45.925
<v Speaker 1>Oh, let me get the name.

00:42:46.725 --> 00:42:48.805
<v Speaker 1>God. That time

00:42:48.965 --> 00:42:50.325
<v Speaker 1>is of the essence.

00:42:52.885 --> 00:42:54.965
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So such a tense. That's the one.

00:42:54.965 --> 00:42:55.605
<v Speaker 0>Bye bye bye.

00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:58.830
<v Speaker 0>Alright. You now have

00:42:59.390 --> 00:43:01.070
<v Speaker 0>a note that we'll schedule.

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:02.430
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:05.549
<v Speaker 3>We ought to restart anything for that. The

00:43:05.549 --> 00:43:08.109
<v Speaker 0>pods should be scheduled there now.

00:43:08.829 --> 00:43:09.630
<v Speaker 0>Yep. There you go.

00:43:11.154 --> 00:43:12.194
<v Speaker 1>Okay. And the

00:43:12.755 --> 00:43:15.075
<v Speaker 1>I've got the fun ones still coming up.

00:43:21.954 --> 00:43:24.035
<v Speaker 1>To remove a little frustration, SSH is working

00:43:24.035 --> 00:43:27.130
<v Speaker 1>on and kill all of Rawkode's processes.

00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:30.730
<v Speaker 0>Well, we we've removed that note from the

00:43:30.730 --> 00:43:31.370
<v Speaker 0>equation.

00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:33.050
<v Speaker 0>I'm hoping Yeah.

00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:34.570
<v Speaker 0>Hoping.

00:43:38.085 --> 00:43:39.605
<v Speaker 1>I wanna get rid of the staple set

00:43:39.605 --> 00:43:40.245
<v Speaker 1>too.

00:43:41.285 --> 00:43:43.525
<v Speaker 2>Are you? I bet it's gonna come back

00:43:43.525 --> 00:43:45.125
<v Speaker 1>up. Is it? No?

00:43:45.445 --> 00:43:46.565
<v Speaker 1>No. No?

00:43:47.445 --> 00:43:48.325
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:43:51.285 --> 00:43:52.965
<v Speaker 0>So you have the v one image at

00:43:52.965 --> 00:43:53.125
<v Speaker 0>least.

00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:56.090
<v Speaker 0>So let's get it upgraded. Oh,

00:43:56.410 --> 00:43:58.170
<v Speaker 4>the image the image is there?

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:00.570
<v Speaker 3>Yes. So edit it and change it to

00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:01.850
<v Speaker 3>v two and see what happens.

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:04.890
<v Speaker 1>Edit.

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:06.810
<v Speaker 1>Employed spelling

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:08.330
<v Speaker 1>spelling

00:44:10.155 --> 00:44:11.115
<v Speaker 1>clustered.

00:44:13.195 --> 00:44:14.475
<v Speaker 3>I think yeah.

00:44:15.115 --> 00:44:16.315
<v Speaker 1>Oh, next one.

00:44:16.875 --> 00:44:17.595
<v Speaker 1>Where'd it go?

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:33.550
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:36.910
<v Speaker 1>Well, I oh, I'm not looking at the

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:37.230
<v Speaker 1>stream.

00:44:37.795 --> 00:44:40.195
<v Speaker 0>We got the image with the hair again.

00:44:40.915 --> 00:44:41.795
<v Speaker 1>Again.

00:44:46.435 --> 00:44:48.755
<v Speaker 0>So we we need to kill those processes.

00:44:51.715 --> 00:44:52.915
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:00.490
<v Speaker 3>But that's interesting. Is it

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:03.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean, that's running on this pod, which

00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:04.650
<v Speaker 3>presumably doesn't have the

00:45:08.025 --> 00:45:09.865
<v Speaker 3>and you got pull always. Right?

00:45:10.265 --> 00:45:13.065
<v Speaker 1>I just killed the the session for it.

00:45:14.345 --> 00:45:16.345
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I have logged off of that bot

00:45:16.345 --> 00:45:18.825
<v Speaker 0>killing the two processes that appeared to be

00:45:18.825 --> 00:45:20.265
<v Speaker 0>under my user ID.

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:23.300
<v Speaker 3>You might have to delete that image on

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:25.060
<v Speaker 3>on this part again,

00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:28.420
<v Speaker 3>on the control plane, like, the CR,

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:30.100
<v Speaker 3>price detail, whatever you want to use.

00:45:35.035 --> 00:45:36.235
<v Speaker 1>Is it images?

00:45:37.915 --> 00:45:39.355
<v Speaker 1>Let it yell at us.

00:45:39.675 --> 00:45:41.595
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about the

00:45:41.755 --> 00:45:42.955
<v Speaker 1>post presser.

00:45:43.835 --> 00:45:45.275
<v Speaker 1>Oh, v two clustered.

00:45:45.755 --> 00:45:46.715
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm thinking.

00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:49.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Deleted. And then

00:46:00.975 --> 00:46:03.775
<v Speaker 0>I've removed or removing all their crap from

00:46:03.775 --> 00:46:04.655
<v Speaker 0>the bash RC.

00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:16.510
<v Speaker 0>Does that code command work?

00:46:25.605 --> 00:46:27.365
<v Speaker 1>Nope. Still getting it here.

00:46:28.725 --> 00:46:30.805
<v Speaker 0>Sorry? Well, we still have those road processes

00:46:30.805 --> 00:46:33.605
<v Speaker 0>again, but I I need to remove Yeah.

00:46:34.005 --> 00:46:35.365
<v Speaker 0>Okay. I have removed it.

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:38.480
<v Speaker 1>What?

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:41.119
<v Speaker 3>You said that control. I thought we got

00:46:41.119 --> 00:46:43.280
<v Speaker 0>rid of that. Yeah. But I think Yeah.

00:46:43.359 --> 00:46:45.359
<v Speaker 0>Me logging into this machine keeps bringing it

00:46:45.359 --> 00:46:45.920
<v Speaker 0>back.

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:47.840
<v Speaker 3>What?

00:46:48.319 --> 00:46:50.160
<v Speaker 3>This is gonna have to be explained.

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:51.359
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

00:46:54.255 --> 00:46:56.015
<v Speaker 3>So there's a process on that thing that

00:46:56.015 --> 00:46:57.775
<v Speaker 3>SSH is into the control plane.

00:47:00.255 --> 00:47:00.895
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

00:47:07.295 --> 00:47:08.255
<v Speaker 1>That's gonna be good.

00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:13.990
<v Speaker 3>Where are we in a minute? What's what's

00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:15.030
<v Speaker 3>currently wrong?

00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:19.590
<v Speaker 1>It's still directing to the wrong database.

00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:21.270
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

00:47:22.105 --> 00:47:24.265
<v Speaker 1>We didn't look at some of the other

00:47:24.265 --> 00:47:25.865
<v Speaker 1>license. We've only got

00:47:26.185 --> 00:47:27.625
<v Speaker 1>less than a minute, anyhow.

00:47:28.585 --> 00:47:29.625
<v Speaker 0>Time is up.

00:47:30.025 --> 00:47:32.105
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Thomas, do you wanna jump on and

00:47:32.105 --> 00:47:33.625
<v Speaker 0>walk us through how to fix this before

00:47:33.625 --> 00:47:34.425
<v Speaker 0>we switch teams?

00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:35.740
<v Speaker 0>Come on.

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:38.700
<v Speaker 2>Looks like very active in the chat and

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:40.300
<v Speaker 0>you seem to know what's going on here.

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:46.220
<v Speaker 0>But apparently, there's an SSHD process.

00:47:51.105 --> 00:47:53.744
<v Speaker 0>Which is running at Rawkode, not Rawkode.

00:47:55.424 --> 00:47:57.025
<v Speaker 1>I killed it on the I thought I

00:47:57.025 --> 00:47:58.464
<v Speaker 1>killed it on the worker, not on the

00:47:58.464 --> 00:47:59.184
<v Speaker 1>control plane.

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:01.440
<v Speaker 0>Alright. So I've killed it again. So if

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:03.680
<v Speaker 0>we bounce the postgres pod, we should be

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:04.720
<v Speaker 0>working again?

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I I closed out of my session.

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:08.800
<v Speaker 1>Somebody's still in.

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:11.200
<v Speaker 3>Oh, do do you need to come out?

00:48:12.234 --> 00:48:13.275
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing.

00:48:18.234 --> 00:48:21.115
<v Speaker 1>He said it's it is running as Rawkode.

00:48:22.395 --> 00:48:24.075
<v Speaker 0>It didn't look like it to me.

00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:28.339
<v Speaker 0>You probably wanna kill that postgres controller zero

00:48:28.339 --> 00:48:29.619
<v Speaker 0>stateful set as well.

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:32.339
<v Speaker 0>That seems to be doing some bad things.

00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:34.579
<v Speaker 1>Thomas

00:48:35.619 --> 00:48:37.059
<v Speaker 1>says it's running as Rawkode.

00:48:43.235 --> 00:48:44.835
<v Speaker 0>I'll look at it quickly. I mean, I

00:48:44.835 --> 00:48:45.795
<v Speaker 0>don't see it.

00:48:48.195 --> 00:48:49.315
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Here he is.

00:48:52.269 --> 00:48:53.070
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:54.109
<v Speaker 0>Oops.

00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:55.310
<v Speaker 0>Hello.

00:48:57.630 --> 00:48:59.150
<v Speaker 2>You hold off the page?

00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:02.430
<v Speaker 2>Hi, Thomas. Did you get it did you

00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:03.230
<v Speaker 1>get it fixed here?

00:49:05.025 --> 00:49:06.625
<v Speaker 4>You did. We did.

00:49:08.224 --> 00:49:08.705
<v Speaker 3>So

00:49:09.984 --> 00:49:12.545
<v Speaker 0>what was going on with that? SSHD

00:49:12.545 --> 00:49:13.585
<v Speaker 0>Postgres controller?

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:19.200
<v Speaker 6>So the the Postgres controller was overriding

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:21.200
<v Speaker 6>adding a SQL injection attack

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:22.400
<v Speaker 6>to Yeah.

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:24.880
<v Speaker 6>But

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:30.185
<v Speaker 6>on the worker, there was a a

00:49:30.585 --> 00:49:32.825
<v Speaker 6>program purporting to be SSHD

00:49:32.985 --> 00:49:35.545
<v Speaker 6>running as Rawkode that would keep reapplying the

00:49:35.545 --> 00:49:38.345
<v Speaker 6>manifests when you for people who thought to

00:49:38.345 --> 00:49:41.065
<v Speaker 6>delete the stateful set. So I'm sorry.

00:49:42.105 --> 00:49:44.460
<v Speaker 1>No. No. It we were so close. But

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:46.620
<v Speaker 1>No. It was good. You got it. Yeah.

00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:48.380
<v Speaker 0>Well done. Yes. But there was a lot

00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:50.140
<v Speaker 0>to a lot to fix there.

00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:51.900
<v Speaker 0>Very well done indeed.

00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:55.500
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Lairs. I'm

00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:58.885
<v Speaker 0>gonna invite on Tengard West and say goodbye

00:49:58.885 --> 00:50:01.605
<v Speaker 0>to Tengard East. Thank you for joining us.

00:50:01.605 --> 00:50:03.125
<v Speaker 0>I really was on. That was great. And

00:50:03.125 --> 00:50:05.205
<v Speaker 0>then I'll speak to in second. Just

00:50:05.285 --> 00:50:08.165
<v Speaker 2>remember, tomorrow is the April fool's day.

00:50:08.645 --> 00:50:08.964
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.

00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:12.930
<v Speaker 3>We tried violence everywhere. Alright.

00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:17.090
<v Speaker 0>Let's see. Where is West?

00:50:24.805 --> 00:50:26.485
<v Speaker 0>Is it fun watching someone try and fix

00:50:26.485 --> 00:50:27.605
<v Speaker 0>your cluster, Thomas?

00:50:28.245 --> 00:50:30.885
<v Speaker 6>That was a doozy. I'm I'm actually really

00:50:30.885 --> 00:50:33.605
<v Speaker 6>impressed with how much progress they made. I

00:50:33.605 --> 00:50:35.125
<v Speaker 6>could not have made

00:50:35.205 --> 00:50:37.845
<v Speaker 6>that much progress in forty five minutes. That

00:50:37.845 --> 00:50:38.325
<v Speaker 6>was incredible.

00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:42.589
<v Speaker 0>Someone still has the stream open. Might be

00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:44.830
<v Speaker 0>a good time to mute or close that.

00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:47.470
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:50:47.869 --> 00:50:49.869
<v Speaker 0>So Can you hear me? Yeah. We can.

00:50:49.869 --> 00:50:50.670
<v Speaker 0>Welcome.

00:50:50.829 --> 00:50:52.955
<v Speaker 3>Yeah. We can. Awesome. Someone has a stream

00:50:52.955 --> 00:50:53.755
<v Speaker 0>open,

00:50:53.835 --> 00:50:55.275
<v Speaker 0>can you find the tab and close it,

00:50:55.275 --> 00:50:56.715
<v Speaker 0>please? I have it.

00:50:58.395 --> 00:50:59.755
<v Speaker 0>Is someone still watching?

00:51:00.715 --> 00:51:02.155
<v Speaker 0>Someone's still watching.

00:51:04.155 --> 00:51:04.475
<v Speaker 5>I'm I'm not.

00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:09.410
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I can mute these one by one,

00:51:09.410 --> 00:51:10.609
<v Speaker 0>and we'll work out who it is. Alright.

00:51:10.609 --> 00:51:12.130
<v Speaker 4>I could do. I

00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:15.570
<v Speaker 0>believe it's Matt.

00:51:16.770 --> 00:51:18.770
<v Speaker 0>Matt. Maybe my AirPods.

00:51:22.565 --> 00:51:23.365
<v Speaker 0>Hello?

00:51:24.485 --> 00:51:25.765
<v Speaker 4>Is that better?

00:51:26.405 --> 00:51:28.244
<v Speaker 0>It is. Is that better? We're good. I

00:51:28.244 --> 00:51:30.085
<v Speaker 0>don't hear myself. It is. Oh, no. I

00:51:30.085 --> 00:51:31.925
<v Speaker 0>still hear myself. I hear myself. Okay. I'm

00:51:31.925 --> 00:51:34.485
<v Speaker 0>still gonna keep talking. I've muted everyone else

00:51:34.485 --> 00:51:35.045
<v Speaker 0>but Matt.

00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:38.540
<v Speaker 0>I don't hear myself. Alright. Let's swap around.

00:51:50.215 --> 00:51:50.935
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:51:51.095 --> 00:51:52.375
<v Speaker 0>Is

00:51:52.375 --> 00:51:54.295
<v Speaker 0>you. Do you have the stream open?

00:51:57.895 --> 00:51:59.815
<v Speaker 0>I've never said that handle out loud before.

00:51:59.815 --> 00:52:00.775
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if I said it right

00:52:00.775 --> 00:52:01.015
<v Speaker 0>either.

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:09.200
<v Speaker 5>Audio is breaking down at what was that?

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:11.600
<v Speaker 0>You have the YouTube video open, I think,

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:12.400
<v Speaker 0>somewhere.

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:14.640
<v Speaker 0>Like You have video sync somewhere.

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:15.280
<v Speaker 0>Right?

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:17.760
<v Speaker 5>The YouTube video? Nope.

00:52:21.535 --> 00:52:23.775
<v Speaker 5>I have the the chat, but that's it.

00:52:29.455 --> 00:52:30.255
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:52:30.495 --> 00:52:32.415
<v Speaker 0>I I can't hear myself right now. Oh,

00:52:32.415 --> 00:52:32.975
<v Speaker 0>no. I can't.

00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:36.320
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. It's definitely coming from you. So that

00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:38.080
<v Speaker 0>you have a tab somewhere with the stream

00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:38.720
<v Speaker 0>open.

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:47.435
<v Speaker 5>I found it and in mute. Awesome. Thank

00:52:47.435 --> 00:52:49.915
<v Speaker 0>you. Alright. Let's get this underway. So you

00:52:49.915 --> 00:52:51.835
<v Speaker 0>guys are all a very, very mean team,

00:52:51.995 --> 00:52:53.835
<v Speaker 0>but that was a great fun to watch.

00:52:53.835 --> 00:52:54.395
<v Speaker 0>So

00:52:54.635 --> 00:52:56.555
<v Speaker 0>let's start with some introductions and then we'll

00:52:56.555 --> 00:52:58.635
<v Speaker 0>see what team have in store from you.

00:52:58.635 --> 00:53:00.700
<v Speaker 0>So let's start with Thomas, work our way

00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:02.940
<v Speaker 0>around clockwise, and we'll get this underway.

00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:12.380
<v Speaker 6>Hey, folks. My name is Thomas Stromberg.

00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:15.340
<v Speaker 6>I am

00:53:14.335 --> 00:53:16.735
<v Speaker 6>a software engineer at Changuard,

00:53:17.215 --> 00:53:19.535
<v Speaker 6>but, I've done, some other,

00:53:20.655 --> 00:53:22.495
<v Speaker 6>random things in the past, including being a

00:53:22.495 --> 00:53:23.215
<v Speaker 6>a minikube,

00:53:23.455 --> 00:53:25.935
<v Speaker 6>maintainer, which helps me understand some of the

00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:28.550
<v Speaker 6>underlying issues here and know some of the

00:53:28.550 --> 00:53:31.190
<v Speaker 6>bad things to introduce into a system since

00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:33.350
<v Speaker 6>people seem to keep introducing it into mine.

00:53:33.350 --> 00:53:33.750
<v Speaker 6>So

00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:35.270
<v Speaker 6>but nonetheless,

00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:37.030
<v Speaker 6>yeah, I'm glad to be here, and it

00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:38.630
<v Speaker 6>was awesome to see the

00:53:39.195 --> 00:53:39.995
<v Speaker 6>how

00:53:39.995 --> 00:53:41.995
<v Speaker 6>Team East fixed our cluster.

00:53:42.475 --> 00:53:45.275
<v Speaker 6>That was just absolutely incredible job, folks. So

00:53:48.795 --> 00:53:49.755
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Thank you.

00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:54.630
<v Speaker 0>Who wants to go next?

00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:58.790
<v Speaker 0>Don't be shy.

00:53:59.110 --> 00:54:00.390
<v Speaker 0>You're both muted.

00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:01.910
<v Speaker 0>Again. There we go.

00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:05.110
<v Speaker 5>So is that all gone? Maybe.

00:54:07.135 --> 00:54:08.415
<v Speaker 5>Yeah. My name is,

00:54:08.974 --> 00:54:12.494
<v Speaker 5>and I am also a super engineer at.

00:54:12.815 --> 00:54:13.855
<v Speaker 5>And I

00:54:15.615 --> 00:54:16.494
<v Speaker 5>also

00:54:16.734 --> 00:54:18.655
<v Speaker 5>work in Kubernetes

00:54:18.655 --> 00:54:20.414
<v Speaker 5>as a in secret list mainly.

00:54:20.850 --> 00:54:21.490
<v Speaker 5>And

00:54:22.450 --> 00:54:23.330
<v Speaker 5>I'm

00:54:23.410 --> 00:54:25.570
<v Speaker 5>kind of scared of to see what our

00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:27.010
<v Speaker 5>friends have led for us.

00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:30.450
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Thank you. Matt?

00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:33.010
<v Speaker 0>Hey. Can you hear me? Yeah. We can.

00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:35.115
<v Speaker 0>I did. Okay. Yeah. The the

00:54:35.675 --> 00:54:36.955
<v Speaker 4>there was a mute

00:54:37.115 --> 00:54:39.115
<v Speaker 4>icon over my picture even though I was

00:54:39.115 --> 00:54:40.315
<v Speaker 4>unmuted. So

00:54:41.195 --> 00:54:42.715
<v Speaker 4>hi. I'm Matt. I'm one of the founders

00:54:42.715 --> 00:54:43.755
<v Speaker 4>of ChainGuard,

00:54:43.995 --> 00:54:45.835
<v Speaker 4>and I am incredibly nervous.

00:54:47.810 --> 00:54:49.250
<v Speaker 1>That was a lot of fun, and and

00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:50.290
<v Speaker 4>congratulations

00:54:50.290 --> 00:54:51.730
<v Speaker 4>to team East.

00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:53.730
<v Speaker 4>That was very

00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:54.610
<v Speaker 4>well done.

00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:57.570
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. They did they did great. They were

00:54:57.570 --> 00:54:59.090
<v Speaker 0>so close. I think we should just give

00:54:59.090 --> 00:55:01.155
<v Speaker 0>it to them as a fix. Like Oh,

00:55:01.155 --> 00:55:02.835
<v Speaker 4>yeah. Totally. I think I was hinder on

00:55:02.835 --> 00:55:05.155
<v Speaker 0>them more at the end than they were

00:55:05.155 --> 00:55:05.875
<v Speaker 0>themselves.

00:55:07.075 --> 00:55:09.555
<v Speaker 0>So let's get my screen share up.

00:55:10.675 --> 00:55:11.795
<v Speaker 0>Here we go.

00:55:12.275 --> 00:55:14.995
<v Speaker 0>I am going to open a session on

00:55:17.010 --> 00:55:18.050
<v Speaker 0>ChainGuard

00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:19.090
<v Speaker 0>East

00:55:19.090 --> 00:55:20.850
<v Speaker 0>control blame one this time.

00:55:22.290 --> 00:55:25.010
<v Speaker 0>Once this opens, please use activity active sessions

00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:25.970
<v Speaker 0>to join.

00:55:26.050 --> 00:55:28.210
<v Speaker 0>Type echo or anything so that I know

00:55:28.210 --> 00:55:30.370
<v Speaker 0>you are there, and then we will get

00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:31.545
<v Speaker 0>this underway.

00:55:31.865 --> 00:55:33.785
<v Speaker 0>So let's see who we have in our

00:55:33.785 --> 00:55:34.185
<v Speaker 0>cluster.

00:55:45.370 --> 00:55:47.210
<v Speaker 5>I got access denied.

00:55:47.530 --> 00:55:49.690
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I haven't given you access yet. Oh,

00:55:49.690 --> 00:55:51.530
<v Speaker 0>there you go. That's a a problem right

00:55:51.530 --> 00:55:52.730
<v Speaker 0>off the bat. So

00:55:53.370 --> 00:55:54.490
<v Speaker 0>apologies.

00:55:54.730 --> 00:55:55.450
<v Speaker 0>Here we go.

00:55:57.645 --> 00:56:00.125
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if this were our friends.

00:56:01.645 --> 00:56:03.245
<v Speaker 0>You have access now. You can join my

00:56:03.245 --> 00:56:03.885
<v Speaker 0>session.

00:56:05.885 --> 00:56:07.645
<v Speaker 0>Promise. There we go. We got our first

00:56:07.645 --> 00:56:09.245
<v Speaker 0>echo. Alright. Matt's in.

00:56:13.790 --> 00:56:14.270
<v Speaker 0>Echo.

00:56:26.655 --> 00:56:27.695
<v Speaker 0>Enjoy, Thomas.

00:56:41.850 --> 00:56:43.610
<v Speaker 4>I can't hear him. It looks like he's

00:56:43.610 --> 00:56:44.570
<v Speaker 4>talking now.

00:56:44.970 --> 00:56:46.090
<v Speaker 0>Thomas, you're on mute.

00:56:50.505 --> 00:56:51.865
<v Speaker 0>Oh, is he frozen?

00:56:58.984 --> 00:56:59.945
<v Speaker 4>There he is.

00:57:01.224 --> 00:57:01.704
<v Speaker 0>Hello?

00:57:03.069 --> 00:57:05.150
<v Speaker 0>No. I think he has frozen. So until

00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:07.150
<v Speaker 0>Thomas oh, he's in at least. So that's

00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:07.710
<v Speaker 0>good.

00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:10.750
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Set up your cube config.

00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:12.910
<v Speaker 0>Check for a control plane and best of

00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:15.150
<v Speaker 0>luck. I'll reset your timer now. Just so

00:57:15.150 --> 00:57:16.109
<v Speaker 0>you got a bit more time.

00:57:18.955 --> 00:57:19.835
<v Speaker 4>Alright.

00:57:27.275 --> 00:57:29.355
<v Speaker 4>So let's see. For the first thing, I

00:57:29.355 --> 00:57:31.435
<v Speaker 4>think we should check

00:57:33.210 --> 00:57:34.250
<v Speaker 4>that history.

00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:39.050
<v Speaker 4>Empty. Covered their tracks. Nice try. Nice try.

00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:41.530
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.

00:57:42.570 --> 00:57:43.770
<v Speaker 4>So

00:57:45.005 --> 00:57:47.245
<v Speaker 4>let's see. So the next bit

00:57:47.645 --> 00:57:48.925
<v Speaker 4>of advice

00:57:48.925 --> 00:57:52.285
<v Speaker 4>was to dump some useful events

00:57:52.285 --> 00:57:53.645
<v Speaker 4>with SleuthKit.

00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:03.830
<v Speaker 0>Welcome back, Tom.

00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:07.910
<v Speaker 4>SDC

00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:08.710
<v Speaker 4>three.

00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:09.350
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

00:58:12.665 --> 00:58:14.505
<v Speaker 4>You want this

00:58:14.505 --> 00:58:15.305
<v Speaker 4>with

00:58:15.305 --> 00:58:16.105
<v Speaker 4>dev

00:58:16.345 --> 00:58:17.945
<v Speaker 4>s e c three.

00:58:19.705 --> 00:58:21.465
<v Speaker 0>And SwiftKit returns.

00:58:23.545 --> 00:58:25.545
<v Speaker 0>Not the first time Thomas brought this on

00:58:25.545 --> 00:58:26.825
<v Speaker 0>many episodes ago.

00:58:32.349 --> 00:58:34.829
<v Speaker 4>Let's see. Alright. So Some of the work

00:58:34.829 --> 00:58:36.430
<v Speaker 5>we did was try to hide that.

00:58:42.985 --> 00:58:44.985
<v Speaker 0>So for the anyone in the audience that's

00:58:44.985 --> 00:58:46.665
<v Speaker 0>not familiar with SwiftKit, who wants to go

00:58:46.665 --> 00:58:49.225
<v Speaker 0>to the TLDR about what FLS is doing?

00:58:51.065 --> 00:58:52.825
<v Speaker 4>I mean I mean, Tom, it's good.

00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:55.760
<v Speaker 6>Yeah. Basically,

00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:58.400
<v Speaker 6>yeah, it's it's generating

00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:00.880
<v Speaker 6>a file system timeline is is what this

00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:02.160
<v Speaker 6>is doing of

00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:05.280
<v Speaker 6>all the most recent changes to the the

00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:05.920
<v Speaker 6>control plane.

00:59:06.805 --> 00:59:09.685
<v Speaker 6>It may not be as useful since people

00:59:09.685 --> 00:59:12.405
<v Speaker 6>know about this trick, but it definitely was

00:59:12.405 --> 00:59:14.405
<v Speaker 6>effective the first time I presented it.

00:59:14.645 --> 00:59:16.805
<v Speaker 6>So, yeah, Sleuth Kit, old school

00:59:17.205 --> 00:59:18.005
<v Speaker 6>forensics tool.

00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:21.190
<v Speaker 0>Right. Even shows deleted files.

00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:25.990
<v Speaker 0>Did it recover the batch history?

00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:31.190
<v Speaker 6>I'm afraid not easily, but kind of.

00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:32.230
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

00:59:33.944 --> 00:59:35.145
<v Speaker 4>I don't see

00:59:36.984 --> 00:59:38.505
<v Speaker 4>I mean, this a lot of this stuff

00:59:38.505 --> 00:59:40.665
<v Speaker 4>just looks like system libraries

00:59:41.065 --> 00:59:42.025
<v Speaker 4>probably

00:59:42.025 --> 00:59:43.385
<v Speaker 4>pulled in through

00:59:45.545 --> 00:59:46.825
<v Speaker 4>the app get install.

00:59:48.839 --> 00:59:51.400
<v Speaker 0>So I'm assuming SwiftKit is handy if there's

00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:53.640
<v Speaker 0>rogue things still on the file system. But

00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:55.880
<v Speaker 0>if people broke the cluster explicitly

00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:58.119
<v Speaker 0>through a cube control, it's probably not as

00:59:58.119 --> 01:00:00.839
<v Speaker 0>useful. Right? Because there's only entity that's really

01:00:00.839 --> 01:00:01.319
<v Speaker 0>gonna change.

01:00:02.195 --> 01:00:04.115
<v Speaker 4>So let's see if we can

01:00:10.515 --> 01:00:11.395
<v Speaker 0>alright.

01:00:11.475 --> 01:00:13.795
<v Speaker 0>No control plan. Maybe see what it looks

01:00:13.795 --> 01:00:14.115
<v Speaker 5>like.

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:18.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. Let's

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:21.760
<v Speaker 4>see. Is it still on my clipboard?

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:22.560
<v Speaker 4>No.

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:24.400
<v Speaker 4>Let me grab the

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:25.920
<v Speaker 4>app.

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:29.120
<v Speaker 1>Oops.

01:00:30.705 --> 01:00:32.625
<v Speaker 4>If we check this out

01:00:37.505 --> 01:00:38.945
<v Speaker 4>does this look right?

01:00:41.505 --> 01:00:45.105
<v Speaker 4>I guess we can

01:00:48.790 --> 01:00:49.990
<v Speaker 4>I don't know? Is it

01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:53.430
<v Speaker 4>should it be going or let's see. I

01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:54.950
<v Speaker 0>mean, I can only see the key data.

01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:56.630
<v Speaker 0>I I can't see anything.

01:00:56.790 --> 01:00:58.390
<v Speaker 0>I have to to debug right now.

01:01:00.015 --> 01:01:00.815
<v Speaker 5>Oh,

01:01:03.935 --> 01:01:06.095
<v Speaker 4>I can resize the window.

01:01:11.375 --> 01:01:12.415
<v Speaker 4>Is that more readable?

01:01:13.590 --> 01:01:14.790
<v Speaker 0>It is. Yep.

01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:21.590
<v Speaker 4>At the very top

01:01:26.045 --> 01:01:27.085
<v Speaker 4>There we go.

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:30.285
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. At the very top,

01:01:30.685 --> 01:01:32.045
<v Speaker 4>it's basically

01:01:32.765 --> 01:01:33.805
<v Speaker 4>an IP

01:01:34.045 --> 01:01:35.485
<v Speaker 4>443,

01:01:37.885 --> 01:01:40.765
<v Speaker 4>and I assume that's right, but, I guess,

01:01:40.765 --> 01:01:43.580
<v Speaker 4>we should take a look at the running

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:44.620
<v Speaker 4>containers.

01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:47.820
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.

01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:48.940
<v Speaker 4>So

01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:52.140
<v Speaker 4>we need an API server running.

01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:55.180
<v Speaker 4>So I guess we should take a look

01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:56.620
<v Speaker 4>at

01:01:57.525 --> 01:01:58.325
<v Speaker 4>the

01:01:59.045 --> 01:02:02.565
<v Speaker 4>container d stuff to see what containers we

01:02:02.565 --> 01:02:03.205
<v Speaker 4>have.

01:02:03.444 --> 01:02:04.885
<v Speaker 4>So let's

01:02:06.724 --> 01:02:07.045
<v Speaker 4>so

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:13.060
<v Speaker 4>you see a control point. We so we're

01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:16.020
<v Speaker 4>on the control point node. I don't I

01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:17.780
<v Speaker 4>see the API server here,

01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:19.140
<v Speaker 4>right,

01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:20.180
<v Speaker 4>in the middle.

01:02:24.835 --> 01:02:25.635
<v Speaker 4>So

01:02:25.795 --> 01:02:27.715
<v Speaker 4>should we check out the logs on that?

01:02:30.515 --> 01:02:31.395
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.

01:02:32.675 --> 01:02:35.234
<v Speaker 0>Think you're overlooking something subtle. The right one.

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:37.720
<v Speaker 4>Right? Oh, it should

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:39.240
<v Speaker 4>be 6443.

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.200
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:45.000
<v Speaker 4>On the cube config. I didn't wanna tell

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.280
<v Speaker 0>you. I didn't wanna just burst out with

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:47.800
<v Speaker 0>that since you were so cruel to the

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:48.600
<v Speaker 0>the other team.

01:02:51.505 --> 01:02:54.705
<v Speaker 4>Let's

01:02:54.705 --> 01:02:55.345
<v Speaker 4>see.

01:02:59.665 --> 01:03:00.465
<v Speaker 4>You

01:03:00.465 --> 01:03:01.265
<v Speaker 4>got it all.

01:03:03.119 --> 01:03:05.440
<v Speaker 4>Alright. So looks like that

01:03:05.599 --> 01:03:07.440
<v Speaker 4>may have restored some stuff.

01:03:09.279 --> 01:03:10.160
<v Speaker 4>But

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.880
<v Speaker 4>it looks like some pods are failing to

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:15.759
<v Speaker 4>schedule. So I'm guessing our node is a

01:03:15.759 --> 01:03:18.185
<v Speaker 4>wall. It may have the same problem on

01:03:18.185 --> 01:03:19.305
<v Speaker 4>the node.

01:03:19.465 --> 01:03:22.665
<v Speaker 4>Let's see. Cute cuddle. Get nodes.

01:03:24.745 --> 01:03:27.945
<v Speaker 4>Bro. But, you know, they're not ready, including

01:03:29.305 --> 01:03:32.185
<v Speaker 4>the control plans. So if we let's see.

01:03:32.185 --> 01:03:33.305
<v Speaker 4>Get pods

01:03:35.250 --> 01:03:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Pending.

01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:38.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.

01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:42.290
<v Speaker 4>Okay. So we've got one terminating one

01:03:42.690 --> 01:03:44.610
<v Speaker 4>let's

01:03:44.610 --> 01:03:44.770
<v Speaker 4>see.

01:03:48.715 --> 01:03:51.995
<v Speaker 4>Someone talking. I I hear something very faint.

01:03:51.995 --> 01:03:53.595
<v Speaker 4>It may just be an echo, though.

01:03:55.275 --> 01:03:56.955
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I think there's still a

01:03:57.435 --> 01:03:58.955
<v Speaker 0>YouTube tab somewhere

01:03:59.115 --> 01:04:01.340
<v Speaker 0>in the background. Alright.

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:04.540
<v Speaker 4>We're gonna check for old tricks.

01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:11.580
<v Speaker 4>Alright.

01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:13.420
<v Speaker 4>No webhooks registered.

01:04:15.255 --> 01:04:16.055
<v Speaker 4>So

01:04:16.775 --> 01:04:18.935
<v Speaker 4>let's describe the nodes, I guess.

01:04:19.654 --> 01:04:22.135
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming this is is all James. What

01:04:22.135 --> 01:04:24.055
<v Speaker 0>what does it mean when a control when

01:04:24.055 --> 01:04:25.255
<v Speaker 0>a node is not ready?

01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:32.380
<v Speaker 4>Well, it should show up in describing the

01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:33.900
<v Speaker 4>notes. Right? On schedule.

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:38.220
<v Speaker 4>Schedule.

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:40.940
<v Speaker 4>Let's see. That's,

01:04:42.185 --> 01:04:43.465
<v Speaker 4>I think, normal

01:04:43.785 --> 01:04:45.065
<v Speaker 4>for the master.

01:04:45.225 --> 01:04:45.945
<v Speaker 4>Right?

01:04:47.305 --> 01:04:48.185
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.

01:04:49.225 --> 01:04:50.585
<v Speaker 4>Where's

01:04:50.585 --> 01:04:52.745
<v Speaker 4>the where's the resource settings?

01:04:52.905 --> 01:04:54.665
<v Speaker 4>So allocatable,

01:04:54.825 --> 01:04:56.265
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of CPU

01:04:58.530 --> 01:04:59.970
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of memory.

01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:04.050
<v Speaker 4>K.

01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:05.650
<v Speaker 4>Ready.

01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:09.250
<v Speaker 4>Oh, it says let's see. Complete posting ready

01:05:09.250 --> 01:05:10.770
<v Speaker 4>since said former enabled.

01:05:12.825 --> 01:05:14.025
<v Speaker 4>Not ready. True.

01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:30.540
<v Speaker 4>Reason Kubelet ready. So not ready. True. Kubelet

01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:33.740
<v Speaker 4>ready. This I don't know. Maybe that's normal,

01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:35.340
<v Speaker 4>but that looks strange.

01:05:39.035 --> 01:05:40.155
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.

01:05:40.475 --> 01:05:43.835
<v Speaker 4>And then the other node is ready,

01:05:44.235 --> 01:05:44.795
<v Speaker 4>unknown.

01:05:45.515 --> 01:05:48.875
<v Speaker 4>Node status unknown. Kubelet stopped posting node status.

01:05:48.875 --> 01:05:51.755
<v Speaker 4>So there's something clearly broken broken with the

01:05:54.530 --> 01:05:55.490
<v Speaker 4>with the

01:05:55.890 --> 01:05:56.690
<v Speaker 4>worker.

01:05:56.690 --> 01:05:57.570
<v Speaker 4>Let's

01:05:58.290 --> 01:05:59.490
<v Speaker 4>describe them one at a time.

01:06:10.505 --> 01:06:12.345
<v Speaker 4>Should we try and get the control plane

01:06:12.345 --> 01:06:13.545
<v Speaker 4>working first?

01:06:15.704 --> 01:06:16.505
<v Speaker 4>Have

01:06:20.984 --> 01:06:22.265
<v Speaker 0>you checked the application yet?

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.960
<v Speaker 4>It's not the pods aren't scheduling.

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:26.680
<v Speaker 4>K.

01:06:28.119 --> 01:06:28.840
<v Speaker 4>Right.

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:33.160
<v Speaker 4>Think it'll get pods. Right? So, I mean,

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:35.559
<v Speaker 4>the pods are a mix of terminating and

01:06:36.465 --> 01:06:37.265
<v Speaker 4>pending.

01:06:37.265 --> 01:06:37.905
<v Speaker 4>Right?

01:06:39.345 --> 01:06:41.105
<v Speaker 4>I mean, we can take a look at

01:06:41.185 --> 01:06:42.305
<v Speaker 4>the application,

01:06:47.025 --> 01:06:49.025
<v Speaker 4>which is running on a node port here

01:06:49.025 --> 01:06:50.465
<v Speaker 4>with its IP adder.

01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:53.390
<v Speaker 0>Space adder.

01:06:54.190 --> 01:06:56.750
<v Speaker 0>Sorry? IP space adder.

01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:57.630
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

01:07:02.350 --> 01:07:04.750
<v Speaker 4>where are we looking? That's a modified piece.

01:07:06.815 --> 01:07:09.295
<v Speaker 0>So when you described the notes, something's stood

01:07:09.295 --> 01:07:10.255
<v Speaker 0>out to me.

01:07:11.615 --> 01:07:13.055
<v Speaker 0>A lot of the checks,

01:07:13.055 --> 01:07:15.295
<v Speaker 0>the timestamps were quite old.

01:07:16.495 --> 01:07:18.815
<v Speaker 4>Sorry. When we what? When you described the

01:07:18.815 --> 01:07:19.135
<v Speaker 0>notes.

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.720
<v Speaker 4>We described the nodes. Yeah. And when you

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:30.720
<v Speaker 0>were looking at the status check,

01:07:31.359 --> 01:07:33.279
<v Speaker 0>like, these timestamps are quite old.

01:07:38.494 --> 01:07:40.415
<v Speaker 4>These timestamps.

01:07:40.575 --> 01:07:42.815
<v Speaker 4>Well, the last transition time.

01:07:43.615 --> 01:07:45.214
<v Speaker 0>The network one specifically.

01:07:47.079 --> 01:07:48.520
<v Speaker 0>You're the last heartbeat?

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:51.400
<v Speaker 4>The last heartbeat. Yeah.

01:07:53.079 --> 01:07:54.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. So let's

01:07:54.839 --> 01:07:56.280
<v Speaker 4>let me take a look at

01:07:59.585 --> 01:08:01.665
<v Speaker 4>so Cilium is running,

01:08:03.904 --> 01:08:04.385
<v Speaker 4>but

01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:14.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. So when it's running, but it was

01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:17.020
<v Speaker 4>updated two days ago.

01:08:18.939 --> 01:08:20.380
<v Speaker 4>I guess we can take a look at

01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:21.020
<v Speaker 4>those.

01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:23.819
<v Speaker 4>Now that we have the control plane back,

01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:26.385
<v Speaker 4>we should take a look at the images

01:08:26.385 --> 01:08:27.585
<v Speaker 4>we are running.

01:08:28.705 --> 01:08:29.984
<v Speaker 4>So let's

01:08:29.984 --> 01:08:31.665
<v Speaker 4>take a look at these.

01:08:33.665 --> 01:08:35.824
<v Speaker 4>Let's see. So we've got

01:08:36.145 --> 01:08:36.945
<v Speaker 4>emissary.

01:08:36.945 --> 01:08:39.185
<v Speaker 4>We've got Kuvip. We've got a bunch of

01:08:39.185 --> 01:08:40.785
<v Speaker 4>Kubernetes

01:08:40.050 --> 01:08:41.010
<v Speaker 4>images.

01:08:42.449 --> 01:08:44.689
<v Speaker 4>And then we've got the Quay

01:08:45.090 --> 01:08:45.969
<v Speaker 4>Cilium

01:08:45.969 --> 01:08:46.769
<v Speaker 4>images,

01:08:46.770 --> 01:08:47.969
<v Speaker 4>which is Cilium

01:08:47.969 --> 01:08:50.129
<v Speaker 4>and operator generic.

01:08:50.849 --> 01:08:53.569
<v Speaker 4>Those look like the right versions and the

01:08:53.569 --> 01:08:54.929
<v Speaker 4>right hashes.

01:08:58.185 --> 01:09:00.344
<v Speaker 4>So it doesn't look like they

01:09:00.505 --> 01:09:02.264
<v Speaker 4>tampered with the actual

01:09:02.585 --> 01:09:03.385
<v Speaker 4>specs.

01:09:06.505 --> 01:09:07.304
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:15.330
<v Speaker 5>Maybe check the

01:09:15.569 --> 01:09:17.569
<v Speaker 5>how long how the some of those have

01:09:17.569 --> 01:09:18.849
<v Speaker 5>been running to see if

01:09:19.569 --> 01:09:21.569
<v Speaker 5>we can maybe get an idea if they

01:09:21.569 --> 01:09:22.290
<v Speaker 5>were redeployed.

01:09:24.265 --> 01:09:26.345
<v Speaker 4>I mean, they've been running for

01:09:26.905 --> 01:09:30.024
<v Speaker 4>two days, two hours, it looks like, but

01:09:31.465 --> 01:09:32.425
<v Speaker 4>it says

01:09:32.745 --> 01:09:34.345
<v Speaker 4>so I guess we can

01:09:36.265 --> 01:09:38.505
<v Speaker 4>Cillium's probably running as a human set here.

01:09:38.505 --> 01:09:39.305
<v Speaker 4>Come here and get

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:41.279
<v Speaker 4>that.

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:45.599
<v Speaker 4>So

01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:48.639
<v Speaker 4>let's see. So the actual thing itself is

01:09:48.639 --> 01:09:51.279
<v Speaker 4>two days, two hours, and that's how old

01:09:51.279 --> 01:09:52.639
<v Speaker 4>the pods are.

01:09:55.175 --> 01:09:57.495
<v Speaker 4>They may have messed with the pods.

01:09:59.655 --> 01:10:02.054
<v Speaker 4>Mean, we could try bouncing the pods.

01:10:03.735 --> 01:10:04.614
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.

01:10:05.815 --> 01:10:05.975
<v Speaker 4>See.

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:09.540
<v Speaker 4>Pod

01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:11.219
<v Speaker 4>session.

01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:13.699
<v Speaker 4>What's it? Cilium system.

01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:15.219
<v Speaker 4>That

01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:21.060
<v Speaker 4>namespace.

01:10:23.065 --> 01:10:24.105
<v Speaker 4>No.

01:10:24.105 --> 01:10:25.624
<v Speaker 4>They are static pods.

01:10:27.704 --> 01:10:30.025
<v Speaker 4>Or they're running somewhere else. Let's see. At

01:10:30.025 --> 01:10:30.905
<v Speaker 4>pods.

01:10:34.744 --> 01:10:36.585
<v Speaker 0>So they are running cube system.

01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:41.580
<v Speaker 4>Oh, that's fine. Okay. So let's see.

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:50.060
<v Speaker 4>Next part. We can describe this part.

01:10:52.085 --> 01:10:54.965
<v Speaker 4>No events on our project volume. Let's see.

01:10:57.925 --> 01:11:00.165
<v Speaker 4>But, yeah, the the

01:11:00.485 --> 01:11:02.965
<v Speaker 6>config map, I wonder, for for Cilium.

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:07.960
<v Speaker 6>I wonder if anything has changed there. I

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:10.200
<v Speaker 6>saw because I saw that Cilium did restart.

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:15.640
<v Speaker 4>So where are they mounting it from?

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:18.280
<v Speaker 4>I mean, it's gotta be m cube system.

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:19.560
<v Speaker 4>Mounts.

01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:20.360
<v Speaker 4>M

01:11:20.805 --> 01:11:22.485
<v Speaker 4>Solium. Figment.

01:11:23.765 --> 01:11:24.485
<v Speaker 4>Let's

01:11:26.485 --> 01:11:26.645
<v Speaker 0>volume.

01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:34.860
<v Speaker 4>So

01:11:36.219 --> 01:11:37.659
<v Speaker 4>that's the mount.

01:11:41.739 --> 01:11:44.060
<v Speaker 4>Let's see. We sync map names. These

01:11:46.699 --> 01:11:48.060
<v Speaker 4>which are post pads.

01:11:50.405 --> 01:11:51.445
<v Speaker 4>Third

01:11:51.445 --> 01:11:52.805
<v Speaker 4>API access.

01:11:52.965 --> 01:11:54.965
<v Speaker 4>So there should be config map.

01:11:56.645 --> 01:11:57.925
<v Speaker 4>Map. Yes.

01:11:58.645 --> 01:12:01.365
<v Speaker 4>Here we go. So it's only in config.

01:12:01.765 --> 01:12:02.245
<v Speaker 4>Alright.

01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:04.499
<v Speaker 4>So I got

01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:06.179
<v Speaker 4>see, I'm

01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:11.780
<v Speaker 4>three.

01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:13.939
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't mean anything.

01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:14.980
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:15.699
<v Speaker 4>So

01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:16.579
<v Speaker 4>let's see.

01:12:23.505 --> 01:12:25.505
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea what this is supposed

01:12:25.505 --> 01:12:26.465
<v Speaker 4>to look like.

01:12:28.385 --> 01:12:31.185
<v Speaker 4>Let's see. So we missed you proxy

01:12:31.185 --> 01:12:33.929
<v Speaker 4>since is some sort of mesh setting.

01:12:34.969 --> 01:12:39.129
<v Speaker 4>Node port bind protection through monitor aggregation.

01:12:41.929 --> 01:12:42.730
<v Speaker 4>I guess

01:12:45.925 --> 01:12:48.005
<v Speaker 4>it should be in the clustered repo. Right?

01:12:48.005 --> 01:12:49.685
<v Speaker 4>So we should be able to compare with

01:12:49.685 --> 01:12:51.125
<v Speaker 4>what it should be.

01:12:52.005 --> 01:12:52.724
<v Speaker 4>Right?

01:12:53.285 --> 01:12:54.645
<v Speaker 4>Slim endpoint,

01:12:54.885 --> 01:12:56.085
<v Speaker 4>secrets feed two,

01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:02.940
<v Speaker 4>Port ranges. C b o.

01:13:03.739 --> 01:13:04.460
<v Speaker 4>Nothing

01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:09.739
<v Speaker 0>is jumping out at me. This feels like

01:13:10.075 --> 01:13:13.035
<v Speaker 0>the standard Cilium config that I deploy with

01:13:13.035 --> 01:13:13.755
<v Speaker 0>Helm.

01:13:14.315 --> 01:13:14.955
<v Speaker 0>It

01:13:15.435 --> 01:13:16.875
<v Speaker 0>Doesn't mean I've not missed anything, but it

01:13:16.875 --> 01:13:17.755
<v Speaker 0>looks alright.

01:13:19.515 --> 01:13:21.435
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. So, I mean, we could try bouncing

01:13:21.435 --> 01:13:22.554
<v Speaker 4>the pods.

01:13:23.115 --> 01:13:23.755
<v Speaker 4>What do you think?

01:13:25.170 --> 01:13:26.850
<v Speaker 0>I would encourage it. I'm curious to see

01:13:26.850 --> 01:13:28.210
<v Speaker 0>if it works. I reckon

01:13:28.610 --> 01:13:29.810
<v Speaker 0>at one,

01:13:29.970 --> 01:13:30.850
<v Speaker 0>I think.

01:13:33.250 --> 01:13:35.330
<v Speaker 4>Let's see. Let's not delete

01:13:35.570 --> 01:13:37.010
<v Speaker 4>everything. Let's delete.

01:13:38.365 --> 01:13:40.685
<v Speaker 6>May maybe just bounce the clustered pod and

01:13:40.685 --> 01:13:42.605
<v Speaker 0>see the the error messages and

01:13:43.325 --> 01:13:44.845
<v Speaker 0>Because the fact that we have a clustered

01:13:44.845 --> 01:13:46.845
<v Speaker 0>pod and a terminate and pending status. I

01:13:46.845 --> 01:13:48.925
<v Speaker 0>think we have a I think there's a

01:13:48.925 --> 01:13:50.685
<v Speaker 0>issue with the kubelet on that node.

01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:55.480
<v Speaker 4>Alright. So kubel pods.

01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:56.680
<v Speaker 4>So

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:02.920
<v Speaker 4>we wanna try, like, deleting the the terminating

01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:03.160
<v Speaker 4>one?

01:14:05.495 --> 01:14:07.015
<v Speaker 4>Do cuddle. Delete.

01:14:09.895 --> 01:14:10.535
<v Speaker 4>Pod.

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean, it's

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:20.719
<v Speaker 4>it's hanging.

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.720
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I think what's happening is the API

01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:24.720
<v Speaker 0>server is trying to delete that, but the

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:27.280
<v Speaker 0>kubel is unresponsive on the worker node.

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:29.360
<v Speaker 0>Right. And it's not been able to update

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:31.040
<v Speaker 0>the statuses of things.

01:14:32.364 --> 01:14:33.165
<v Speaker 0>You might wanna

01:14:33.804 --> 01:14:34.925
<v Speaker 0>I I I don't know. I mean, I

01:14:34.925 --> 01:14:36.685
<v Speaker 0>give the worst replaced ever, but you might

01:14:36.685 --> 01:14:38.525
<v Speaker 0>wanna jump onto the worker node.

01:14:40.925 --> 01:14:42.364
<v Speaker 0>Let me open up the session. Yeah.

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:46.540
<v Speaker 4>I wanna look at the logs from the

01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:48.300
<v Speaker 4>API server now that we can.

01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:50.540
<v Speaker 4>Yep.

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:52.380
<v Speaker 0>And

01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:54.780
<v Speaker 6>I would be curious on the worker node

01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:56.380
<v Speaker 6>to

01:14:55.915 --> 01:14:56.955
<v Speaker 6>check for any

01:14:57.595 --> 01:14:59.435
<v Speaker 6>modifications to Etsy

01:14:59.515 --> 01:15:02.315
<v Speaker 6>for, like, CNI files or cubelet files.

01:15:03.595 --> 01:15:04.475
<v Speaker 4>There you go.

01:15:04.955 --> 01:15:06.555
<v Speaker 4>Unable to authenticate.

01:15:06.635 --> 01:15:08.875
<v Speaker 4>Invalid bear token. So I'm guessing they fuzz

01:15:08.875 --> 01:15:11.370
<v Speaker 4>with the off of Google it on the

01:15:11.370 --> 01:15:12.010
<v Speaker 4>worker.

01:15:12.810 --> 01:15:14.970
<v Speaker 0>There's a session open. Feel free to join

01:15:14.970 --> 01:15:16.410
<v Speaker 0>the worker node. Alright.

01:15:20.090 --> 01:15:20.570
<v Speaker 4>And

01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:22.810
<v Speaker 0>you have twenty four minutes.

01:15:25.635 --> 01:15:29.155
<v Speaker 0>Alright. No pressure. See. Session in progress.

01:15:30.994 --> 01:15:31.715
<v Speaker 4>This

01:15:32.835 --> 01:15:34.675
<v Speaker 4>is let me make sure I'm connected to

01:15:34.675 --> 01:15:35.875
<v Speaker 4>the right one. Alright.

01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:37.670
<v Speaker 4>Join session.

01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:42.789
<v Speaker 0>A question from Robert Cable, better token.

01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:45.830
<v Speaker 0>This is the API token sent to the

01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:48.310
<v Speaker 0>API server to authenticate request from other nodes

01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:49.110
<v Speaker 0>in the cluster.

01:15:52.045 --> 01:15:54.684
<v Speaker 4>Good question. Let's see. So

01:15:55.965 --> 01:15:58.764
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure where the Kubelet pulls that

01:15:58.764 --> 01:15:59.485
<v Speaker 4>from.

01:16:00.605 --> 01:16:02.364
<v Speaker 4>Okay. Are you on the market node? The

01:16:02.364 --> 01:16:03.885
<v Speaker 0>same one as me? Yes. You are. Awesome.

01:16:04.670 --> 01:16:06.909
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. You can see me diving. Okay.

01:16:07.469 --> 01:16:08.429
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.

01:16:09.790 --> 01:16:12.270
<v Speaker 4>Take a peek at the Kubelet flags. That's

01:16:12.270 --> 01:16:14.429
<v Speaker 4>a I guess we can look at SleuthKit

01:16:14.429 --> 01:16:14.989
<v Speaker 4>here.

01:16:16.590 --> 01:16:19.550
<v Speaker 4>Let's see. So no Kubelet config.

01:16:19.630 --> 01:16:21.324
<v Speaker 4>That's exciting.

01:16:21.565 --> 01:16:22.205
<v Speaker 4>Can

01:16:24.605 --> 01:16:26.605
<v Speaker 6>we just take a look at at CCNA?

01:16:28.845 --> 01:16:30.445
<v Speaker 6>I'm just curious.

01:16:30.445 --> 01:16:33.750
<v Speaker 6>I feel like there's something with subnet somewhere,

01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:34.869
<v Speaker 6>and that would be a

01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:36.469
<v Speaker 6>curious place to look.

01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:39.829
<v Speaker 4>Is that enabled debug?

01:16:39.989 --> 01:16:41.110
<v Speaker 4>I

01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.989
<v Speaker 4>mean

01:16:42.469 --> 01:16:44.309
<v Speaker 6>I don't see any subnets there. So

01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:46.389
<v Speaker 6>but you'd click config maybe.

01:16:48.265 --> 01:16:50.105
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. We can look at the coupon. So

01:16:50.105 --> 01:16:51.865
<v Speaker 4>we didn't set up to config here, did

01:16:51.865 --> 01:16:54.745
<v Speaker 4>we? There is no Kubernetes access from the

01:16:54.745 --> 01:16:57.145
<v Speaker 0>working node unless they have left it somewhere.

01:16:57.385 --> 01:16:58.905
<v Speaker 0>There is a kubelet.conf

01:16:58.905 --> 01:16:59.945
<v Speaker 0>inside Etsy Kubernetes.

01:17:07.130 --> 01:17:08.650
<v Speaker 0>Oh, and a honk.

01:17:13.290 --> 01:17:15.530
<v Speaker 4>We'll get back to that. Oh, yeah. Port's

01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:16.650
<v Speaker 4>not in here.

01:17:20.114 --> 01:17:21.715
<v Speaker 4>Current .pem.

01:17:22.675 --> 01:17:23.314
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

01:17:25.554 --> 01:17:28.034
<v Speaker 4>Well, we saw off problems. Right?

01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:32.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm wondering whether there's something funny going on

01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:33.140
<v Speaker 4>here.

01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:36.100
<v Speaker 6>What's in the honk?

01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:40.340
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Well Yeah. That seems a bit weird.

01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:40.500
<v Speaker 0>This

01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:42.180
<v Speaker 0>is that right?

01:17:43.185 --> 01:17:45.664
<v Speaker 4>This looks funny.

01:17:46.625 --> 01:17:48.864
<v Speaker 4>We'll come back to that. Let's see. So

01:17:48.864 --> 01:17:50.945
<v Speaker 4>kubla con you said honk.

01:17:51.585 --> 01:17:53.105
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. So let's

01:17:54.945 --> 01:17:55.905
<v Speaker 4>nothing.

01:17:55.985 --> 01:17:57.744
<v Speaker 4>Let's I don't believe you.

01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:01.480
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:04.360
<v Speaker 4>Well, I think that directory is probably just

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:07.639
<v Speaker 4>broken to signal that something's going on here.

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:08.679
<v Speaker 4>So

01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:11.480
<v Speaker 4>I think that

01:18:12.475 --> 01:18:14.315
<v Speaker 4>this is clearly

01:18:14.315 --> 01:18:16.235
<v Speaker 4>our problem.

01:18:17.675 --> 01:18:20.235
<v Speaker 4>We need to replace this with

01:18:20.955 --> 01:18:23.115
<v Speaker 4>probably one of these other twos, the c

01:18:23.115 --> 01:18:24.315
<v Speaker 4>r t or the key.

01:18:24.635 --> 01:18:25.755
<v Speaker 4>Let's look at

01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:31.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm just looking on the server side what

01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:34.620
<v Speaker 4>that's set to for the config.

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:40.220
<v Speaker 0>Maybe check the Kiplet logs?

01:18:42.895 --> 01:18:44.015
<v Speaker 4>We can do that.

01:18:44.815 --> 01:18:45.775
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.

01:18:48.255 --> 01:18:49.695
<v Speaker 0>You have twenty minutes.

01:18:51.535 --> 01:18:53.375
<v Speaker 0>Time flies when you're having fun. Right?

01:18:58.290 --> 01:19:00.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. So let's see. So we want

01:19:04.450 --> 01:19:07.010
<v Speaker 4>service. Here we go. So we want this.

01:19:12.005 --> 01:19:14.965
<v Speaker 4>Failed to start container for Cilium operator crash

01:19:14.965 --> 01:19:16.405
<v Speaker 4>loop back off.

01:19:17.925 --> 01:19:19.844
<v Speaker 4>So do we think it's a static pod?

01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:25.420
<v Speaker 0>No. Cilium runs as a daemon set.

01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:27.820
<v Speaker 4>Alright. Well, I'm wondering whether

01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:30.220
<v Speaker 4>so syncing pod.

01:19:38.205 --> 01:19:39.085
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.

01:19:42.365 --> 01:19:46.125
<v Speaker 4>Actually, back off, though. It's interesting. Your Chengard

01:19:46.125 --> 01:19:49.165
<v Speaker 0>friends from Team East are encouraging you to

01:19:49.165 --> 01:19:50.365
<v Speaker 0>read the certificate.

01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:53.590
<v Speaker 4>Read read the certificates.

01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:55.030
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

01:19:56.230 --> 01:19:57.590
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.

01:19:57.910 --> 01:20:00.710
<v Speaker 4>So that was in, what, PKI?

01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:05.990
<v Speaker 0>It was in FireLib Kubelet PKI.

01:20:08.575 --> 01:20:10.975
<v Speaker 4>Firelib

01:20:11.935 --> 01:20:12.895
<v Speaker 4>Kubelet

01:20:12.895 --> 01:20:13.855
<v Speaker 4>PKI.

01:20:14.655 --> 01:20:16.895
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I haven't seen this set up before

01:20:16.895 --> 01:20:18.895
<v Speaker 0>with client current and timestamps.

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:21.160
<v Speaker 0>I don't know specifically if this is how

01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:23.800
<v Speaker 0>the certificate rotation happens with Kubernetes. Maybe someone

01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:25.560
<v Speaker 0>can fill us in if they know.

01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:28.840
<v Speaker 0>I haven't seen it before.

01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:30.120
<v Speaker 0>Interesting.

01:20:32.715 --> 01:20:34.235
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I think you may wanna use open

01:20:34.235 --> 01:20:35.355
<v Speaker 0>SSL here.

01:20:36.475 --> 01:20:37.595
<v Speaker 4>I'm wondering whether they

01:20:39.275 --> 01:20:41.035
<v Speaker 4>who knows open SSL.

01:20:42.475 --> 01:20:43.114
<v Speaker 5>X

01:20:43.355 --> 01:20:44.395
<v Speaker 5>five zero nine.

01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:48.590
<v Speaker 5>Just without the dash x

01:20:49.949 --> 01:20:51.150
<v Speaker 5>or and

01:20:51.550 --> 01:20:52.350
<v Speaker 5>into

01:20:52.350 --> 01:20:52.909
<v Speaker 5>the

01:20:53.389 --> 01:20:54.510
<v Speaker 5>to the file

01:20:54.670 --> 01:20:55.789
<v Speaker 5>dash text.

01:20:56.670 --> 01:20:58.670
<v Speaker 5>Minus in in minus

01:20:58.670 --> 01:21:00.030
<v Speaker 5>infile. Yeah. Dash in.

01:21:01.515 --> 01:21:02.235
<v Speaker 4>K.

01:21:03.435 --> 01:21:04.795
<v Speaker 4>Mhmm. Alright.

01:21:04.875 --> 01:21:06.394
<v Speaker 5>Then in file.

01:21:06.795 --> 01:21:07.514
<v Speaker 5>Then

01:21:08.715 --> 01:21:09.835
<v Speaker 5>dash text.

01:21:11.195 --> 01:21:12.074
<v Speaker 5>Okay.

01:21:13.675 --> 01:21:14.315
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.

01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:19.900
<v Speaker 4>Alright. Issuer, ChainGuard East.

01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:25.740
<v Speaker 4>Is that just because of the cluster name,

01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:27.020
<v Speaker 4>or are they messing with us?

01:21:30.205 --> 01:21:31.485
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure.

01:21:34.205 --> 01:21:35.405
<v Speaker 5>I'm being I

01:21:36.605 --> 01:21:39.485
<v Speaker 4>I'm having problems. Oh, there you go. Yeah.

01:21:39.885 --> 01:21:40.845
<v Speaker 0>Look at the validity.

01:21:46.969 --> 01:21:48.810
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no. Wait. They're okay. Yeah. I thought

01:21:48.810 --> 01:21:49.850
<v Speaker 0>it was 2222.

01:21:49.850 --> 01:21:51.050
<v Speaker 0>It's 2223.

01:21:52.330 --> 01:21:53.690
<v Speaker 4>Are you doing that? Yeah. Am.

01:21:54.995 --> 01:21:57.235
<v Speaker 6>I wonder if we can rejoin the cluster

01:21:57.235 --> 01:21:58.594
<v Speaker 6>with Cube ATM.

01:22:03.155 --> 01:22:04.835
<v Speaker 4>Don't know what's the Cube. Some doubts off

01:22:04.835 --> 01:22:06.035
<v Speaker 6>my head. But

01:22:06.435 --> 01:22:08.435
<v Speaker 0>The chat is saying those are expired. But

01:22:08.435 --> 01:22:09.635
<v Speaker 0>they don't look expired. Right?

01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:13.600
<v Speaker 0>No. They what's They're okay. This is the

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:15.600
<v Speaker 4>thirty first. Not not after

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:19.199
<v Speaker 4>after March 29. Yes. This is invalid.

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:21.040
<v Speaker 4>Right?

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:23.344
<v Speaker 4>Because it's the thirty first. But it's also

01:22:23.344 --> 01:22:24.304
<v Speaker 0>2023,

01:22:24.304 --> 01:22:25.824
<v Speaker 0>not after 2023.

01:22:25.824 --> 01:22:28.465
<v Speaker 4>Oh, okay. Yeah. I made that mistake too.

01:22:29.185 --> 01:22:30.144
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. Okay.

01:22:33.025 --> 01:22:35.025
<v Speaker 5>Alright. So this is around when the cluster

01:22:35.025 --> 01:22:36.864
<v Speaker 5>was set up, I think. Yeah. I think

01:22:36.864 --> 01:22:37.105
<v Speaker 0>so.

01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:40.590
<v Speaker 4>Let's see. I'm I'm looking at the same

01:22:40.590 --> 01:22:41.470
<v Speaker 4>files on the

01:22:42.430 --> 01:22:44.030
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We got sixteen

01:22:44.030 --> 01:22:44.829
<v Speaker 0>minutes.

01:22:45.390 --> 01:22:47.630
<v Speaker 6>Yeah. What about the hints? Yeah.

01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:49.310
<v Speaker 4>Are there hints?

01:22:49.875 --> 01:22:51.795
<v Speaker 4>For the hints? I think. So Carlos is

01:22:51.795 --> 01:22:53.954
<v Speaker 0>suggesting who owns the search, and James is

01:22:53.954 --> 01:22:55.714
<v Speaker 0>saying maybe look at a different search.

01:22:57.394 --> 01:22:59.235
<v Speaker 4>Okay. So I'm I'm getting the vibe that

01:22:59.235 --> 01:23:00.434
<v Speaker 0>definitely fucked with the search.

01:23:02.739 --> 01:23:03.780
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.

01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:07.619
<v Speaker 4>What are the other files? Oh, we look

01:23:07.619 --> 01:23:09.380
<v Speaker 4>at the intent in this directory.

01:23:13.699 --> 01:23:15.585
<v Speaker 4>Well, they may have covered their tracks. So

01:23:15.665 --> 01:23:17.745
<v Speaker 0>We know by now on cluster never to

01:23:17.745 --> 01:23:19.825
<v Speaker 0>trust the timestamps on a fail. Right?

01:23:21.025 --> 01:23:24.385
<v Speaker 4>Alright. So we've got this. We've got let's

01:23:24.385 --> 01:23:24.865
<v Speaker 4>see.

01:23:26.545 --> 01:23:28.465
<v Speaker 4>They at least look like certs.

01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:31.699
<v Speaker 4>We want what?

01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:42.020
<v Speaker 4>You're at East Worker 1 CA.

01:23:46.755 --> 01:23:47.474
<v Speaker 4>That

01:23:49.155 --> 01:23:50.355
<v Speaker 4>where's the validity?

01:23:50.915 --> 01:23:52.275
<v Speaker 4>Yep. 2023.

01:23:52.275 --> 01:23:52.915
<v Speaker 4>That looks.

01:23:56.350 --> 01:23:57.469
<v Speaker 4>There we go.

01:23:58.110 --> 01:24:00.670
<v Speaker 4>New bullet, get name, no start line.

01:24:03.710 --> 01:24:06.430
<v Speaker 4>Well, I don't know. That's not a sort

01:24:06.430 --> 01:24:07.390
<v Speaker 4>of a key. So

01:24:10.065 --> 01:24:11.345
<v Speaker 4>I don't know. I don't

01:24:12.225 --> 01:24:13.985
<v Speaker 4>let's see. Shall we shall we get a

01:24:13.985 --> 01:24:14.545
<v Speaker 0>hint?

01:24:15.665 --> 01:24:16.385
<v Speaker 4>Sure.

01:24:17.425 --> 01:24:20.385
<v Speaker 4>I'm I'm poking at the same files on

01:24:20.385 --> 01:24:21.665
<v Speaker 4>the

01:24:24.590 --> 01:24:29.150
<v Speaker 4>control plane. Let's see. Let's

01:24:29.150 --> 01:24:31.630
<v Speaker 4>look at the file. Says it's 2359.

01:24:32.110 --> 01:24:35.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. So the the size of Kubelet that

01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:36.350
<v Speaker 4>CRT is different

01:24:36.845 --> 01:24:38.525
<v Speaker 4>on the two things

01:24:38.845 --> 01:24:39.645
<v Speaker 4>and

01:24:40.925 --> 01:24:42.045
<v Speaker 5>Yeah. They're

01:24:42.845 --> 01:24:44.605
<v Speaker 4>pretty close to the same size on the

01:24:44.605 --> 01:24:45.325
<v Speaker 4>key.

01:24:45.885 --> 01:24:46.445
<v Speaker 4>I don't

01:24:48.285 --> 01:24:52.605
<v Speaker 4>but I guess the CRT file is

01:24:57.090 --> 01:24:59.969
<v Speaker 4>it's in the same open SSL.

01:25:01.170 --> 01:25:01.489
<v Speaker 4>Me

01:25:03.090 --> 01:25:03.889
<v Speaker 4>restriction.

01:25:14.284 --> 01:25:17.485
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. I I don't know how to fix

01:25:17.485 --> 01:25:19.885
<v Speaker 4>these certs. So I guess we can try

01:25:19.885 --> 01:25:20.685
<v Speaker 4>KubeADM.

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:23.919
<v Speaker 0>So if

01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:27.599
<v Speaker 0>we let me see if my thingy

01:25:27.679 --> 01:25:30.559
<v Speaker 0>is still here. Yep. That custom data,

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:32.960
<v Speaker 0>that's how we provision the cluster. And inside

01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:35.039
<v Speaker 0>of this is the join token.

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:36.960
<v Speaker 0>I'll just leave that there. You can use

01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:37.520
<v Speaker 0>it if you want.

01:25:40.445 --> 01:25:41.085
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

01:25:41.805 --> 01:25:44.045
<v Speaker 6>So, yeah, there's a k d m join,

01:25:44.045 --> 01:25:45.565
<v Speaker 6>and one of the flags is, like, to

01:25:45.565 --> 01:25:46.685
<v Speaker 6>provide that token.

01:25:48.445 --> 01:25:50.445
<v Speaker 6>But I don't know if it'll reset the

01:25:50.445 --> 01:25:50.845
<v Speaker 6>certs.

01:25:52.489 --> 01:25:55.610
<v Speaker 4>Main API server endpoint. So this is

01:26:00.810 --> 01:26:04.250
<v Speaker 4>looking for A QPDM reset would probably wipe

01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:05.370
<v Speaker 0>all those certs away. Right?

01:26:08.165 --> 01:26:09.285
<v Speaker 4>The endpoint

01:26:09.285 --> 01:26:10.885
<v Speaker 4>is this. So

01:26:12.005 --> 01:26:14.405
<v Speaker 4>we want, what, API server

01:26:17.205 --> 01:26:21.310
<v Speaker 4>join API server endpoint. So that's this. Yeah.

01:26:21.310 --> 01:26:23.150
<v Speaker 5>There there's there's

01:26:23.150 --> 01:26:25.070
<v Speaker 0>also the exact command and the cloud in

01:26:25.070 --> 01:26:26.510
<v Speaker 0>a config, which I can point you out

01:26:26.510 --> 01:26:28.510
<v Speaker 0>as well if that helps. Like,

01:26:28.990 --> 01:26:30.989
<v Speaker 0>rather than working through that.

01:26:31.870 --> 01:26:33.070
<v Speaker 0>Varlib

01:26:36.645 --> 01:26:37.764
<v Speaker 0>instance.

01:26:38.324 --> 01:26:40.565
<v Speaker 0>It's just directory called script.

01:26:40.645 --> 01:26:42.324
<v Speaker 0>Living. Grip.

01:26:42.565 --> 01:26:43.284
<v Speaker 0>Join.

01:26:44.324 --> 01:26:45.364
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Part seven.

01:26:47.010 --> 01:26:48.609
<v Speaker 4>Kube join token

01:26:48.849 --> 01:26:51.090
<v Speaker 4>discovery endpoint. Yeah. What's the name? We may

01:26:51.090 --> 01:26:52.929
<v Speaker 6>want to do the the Kube ADM reset,

01:26:52.929 --> 01:26:55.010
<v Speaker 6>though, first just to make sure that the

01:26:55.170 --> 01:26:55.969
<v Speaker 6>old

01:26:56.050 --> 01:26:57.489
<v Speaker 6>configs get blown away.

01:26:58.769 --> 01:26:59.570
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

01:26:59.570 --> 01:26:59.969
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.

01:27:00.375 --> 01:27:02.695
<v Speaker 4>Two ADM. I lost focus for a second

01:27:02.695 --> 01:27:03.335
<v Speaker 4>there.

01:27:04.535 --> 01:27:07.335
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna copy this line just to have

01:27:07.335 --> 01:27:07.895
<v Speaker 4>it.

01:27:08.215 --> 01:27:10.375
<v Speaker 4>So reset. What flags does this state?

01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:14.790
<v Speaker 4>We flag remove its number. Yeah. I don't

01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:16.390
<v Speaker 6>think you need any any flags. I I

01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:17.750
<v Speaker 6>think you can just run it.

01:27:19.670 --> 01:27:21.190
<v Speaker 4>Any changes made.

01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:22.950
<v Speaker 4>It'll be reverted.

01:27:23.110 --> 01:27:24.230
<v Speaker 4>Yes. Okay.

01:27:27.795 --> 01:27:30.035
<v Speaker 4>Alright. Do we think that oh, do we

01:27:30.035 --> 01:27:31.475
<v Speaker 4>think that was Now we need to join

01:27:31.475 --> 01:27:33.315
<v Speaker 6>it. Yeah. Man,

01:27:33.475 --> 01:27:34.835
<v Speaker 6>yeah, I don't know if it removed the

01:27:34.835 --> 01:27:36.355
<v Speaker 6>certs, but hopefully it did. So let's try

01:27:36.355 --> 01:27:38.515
<v Speaker 6>that join again, the Cubadian join

01:27:39.310 --> 01:27:40.670
<v Speaker 6>that was in that file.

01:27:41.550 --> 01:27:42.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.

01:27:42.350 --> 01:27:43.550
<v Speaker 4>That's here.

01:27:44.190 --> 01:27:46.510
<v Speaker 4>The join so we need the join token.

01:27:47.469 --> 01:27:50.030
<v Speaker 4>So let's see. That was

01:27:50.510 --> 01:27:51.949
<v Speaker 0>Search for custom data.

01:27:54.995 --> 01:27:57.715
<v Speaker 0>This is yeah. That custom data. So the

01:27:57.715 --> 01:28:00.595
<v Speaker 4>join token, what's this? And the DS name

01:28:00.595 --> 01:28:01.635
<v Speaker 0>is also there.

01:28:05.715 --> 01:28:09.489
<v Speaker 4>And for free, blah blah blah. Okay. DNS

01:28:09.489 --> 01:28:11.489
<v Speaker 4>name is

01:28:16.530 --> 01:28:17.489
<v Speaker 4>East.

01:28:21.365 --> 01:28:23.285
<v Speaker 4>Let's see. Oh, I have an echo in

01:28:23.285 --> 01:28:23.845
<v Speaker 4>there.

01:28:28.645 --> 01:28:29.525
<v Speaker 4>Kubernetes

01:28:29.525 --> 01:28:31.205
<v Speaker 4>can proxy forbidden.

01:28:31.205 --> 01:28:36.005
<v Speaker 4>Cannot access config maps in

01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:36.579
<v Speaker 4>group system. There's been a value for resolve

01:28:36.579 --> 01:28:37.619
<v Speaker 4>conf in

01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:43.219
<v Speaker 4>this is interesting. Of course. Because when you

01:28:43.219 --> 01:28:44.499
<v Speaker 0>upload this

01:28:45.059 --> 01:28:47.539
<v Speaker 0>information to the config map, it only lives

01:28:47.539 --> 01:28:48.340
<v Speaker 0>for two hours.

01:28:49.105 --> 01:28:50.865
<v Speaker 0>Alright. We're just gonna have to call it

01:28:50.865 --> 01:28:52.785
<v Speaker 0>on the worker, work on the control plane,

01:28:52.785 --> 01:28:53.344
<v Speaker 0>I think.

01:28:54.225 --> 01:28:56.305
<v Speaker 0>I don't think we can recover from that

01:28:56.305 --> 01:28:57.345
<v Speaker 0>QPDM reset.

01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:04.599
<v Speaker 0>Oh, the work is ready, apparently. They would

01:29:04.599 --> 01:29:05.639
<v Speaker 0>look at that for

01:29:06.199 --> 01:29:08.119
<v Speaker 0>some time. So let's see.

01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:09.479
<v Speaker 4>Shit.

01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:12.440
<v Speaker 4>Let's let's

01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:13.879
<v Speaker 4>check our pods.

01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:15.159
<v Speaker 4>So the pods are all running now.

01:29:18.435 --> 01:29:19.635
<v Speaker 4>Should we try hitting it? You can try

01:29:19.635 --> 01:29:20.434
<v Speaker 5>the admin.

01:29:21.315 --> 01:29:21.954
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

01:29:22.995 --> 01:29:26.434
<v Speaker 4>I guess we can oops. Curl local

01:29:27.795 --> 01:29:28.915
<v Speaker 4>local host.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.280
<v Speaker 4>Action refused.

01:29:35.639 --> 01:29:37.159
<v Speaker 4>That's not surprising.

01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:40.199
<v Speaker 4>Alright.

01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:43.000
<v Speaker 4>So there's a bunch of stuff still not

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.320
<v Speaker 4>running here. This app's not running.

01:29:47.335 --> 01:29:47.895
<v Speaker 4>So

01:29:48.775 --> 01:29:51.175
<v Speaker 4>the things that we're terminating seem to have

01:29:51.415 --> 01:29:52.535
<v Speaker 4>okay. And there's

01:29:52.935 --> 01:29:55.095
<v Speaker 4>there's a new replica set on the clustered

01:29:55.095 --> 01:29:57.575
<v Speaker 4>deployment. So There's a good comment in the

01:29:57.575 --> 01:29:59.735
<v Speaker 0>chat as you wanted to rejoin the worker,

01:29:59.735 --> 01:30:01.670
<v Speaker 0>but I don't think you you need to.

01:30:01.670 --> 01:30:03.829
<v Speaker 0>We could have used QEDM

01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:06.949
<v Speaker 0>token create to get a a new working

01:30:06.949 --> 01:30:08.389
<v Speaker 0>token. But I I think we can just

01:30:08.389 --> 01:30:09.670
<v Speaker 0>work with a control plan.

01:30:10.630 --> 01:30:11.110
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.

01:30:14.885 --> 01:30:16.885
<v Speaker 4>Let's take a look at the YAML for

01:30:16.885 --> 01:30:18.325
<v Speaker 4>this because there's a new

01:30:20.005 --> 01:30:22.645
<v Speaker 4>app. Rolling

01:30:22.645 --> 01:30:23.525
<v Speaker 4>updates.

01:30:24.405 --> 01:30:27.045
<v Speaker 4>Wondering what they changed. Yeah. Okay. The health

01:30:27.045 --> 01:30:28.565
<v Speaker 4>checks are on 9090.

01:30:28.565 --> 01:30:29.365
<v Speaker 4>That looks

01:30:29.630 --> 01:30:30.429
<v Speaker 4>wrong.

01:30:30.830 --> 01:30:33.230
<v Speaker 4>Let's look at the replica sets now. Yeah.

01:30:33.230 --> 01:30:34.989
<v Speaker 0>Everything runs on 8080.

01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:36.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.

01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:40.670
<v Speaker 4>Whoops. Let's see. There should be two replica

01:30:40.670 --> 01:30:42.270
<v Speaker 4>sets. We can look at the old one.

01:30:46.635 --> 01:30:49.355
<v Speaker 4>80 80, and then let's see.

01:30:49.995 --> 01:30:51.355
<v Speaker 4>View before,

01:30:53.275 --> 01:30:55.195
<v Speaker 4>and the other one was

01:30:55.515 --> 01:30:55.995
<v Speaker 4>this.

01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:04.720
<v Speaker 4>And then after and just see what else

01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:05.679
<v Speaker 4>they changed.

01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:08.639
<v Speaker 4>After.

01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:13.200
<v Speaker 4>Alright. So they changed the ports,

01:31:15.185 --> 01:31:17.745
<v Speaker 4>and then the rest looks real. A failure

01:31:17.745 --> 01:31:19.425
<v Speaker 4>threshold changed.

01:31:19.985 --> 01:31:22.385
<v Speaker 4>Bill or replicas for your okay. So that's

01:31:22.385 --> 01:31:23.505
<v Speaker 4>status. So

01:31:24.065 --> 01:31:24.945
<v Speaker 4>let's see. So

01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:27.760
<v Speaker 0>editor,

01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:28.640
<v Speaker 4>Nano,

01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:30.480
<v Speaker 4>kubectl,

01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:32.320
<v Speaker 4>edit, deploy.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:34.240
<v Speaker 4>Weird.

01:31:42.445 --> 01:31:43.565
<v Speaker 4>Well, that's fun.

01:31:46.285 --> 01:31:48.045
<v Speaker 4>I can't even control c this.

01:31:50.470 --> 01:31:52.389
<v Speaker 4>They fuck with me. What have you done?

01:31:55.590 --> 01:31:57.429
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it's still not working. Alright.

01:31:59.750 --> 01:32:00.230
<v Speaker 0>I

01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:02.950
<v Speaker 0>I've opened a new session on control plane

01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:03.270
<v Speaker 0>east.

01:32:07.114 --> 01:32:08.954
<v Speaker 0>Nano does appear to be okay.

01:32:12.235 --> 01:32:13.355
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.

01:32:13.915 --> 01:32:15.355
<v Speaker 4>Move tab to the other group.

01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:20.600
<v Speaker 4>Alright.

01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:21.960
<v Speaker 4>Well, that's fun.

01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:26.920
<v Speaker 0>I don't I it's it's Nano Breaks on

01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:29.400
<v Speaker 0>these shared XTAR JS things.

01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:30.040
<v Speaker 0>Oh,

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.120
<v Speaker 4>well, okay.

01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:34.685
<v Speaker 4>I'm installing Emacs. I can't I don't speak

01:32:34.685 --> 01:32:35.405
<v Speaker 4>with them.

01:32:46.605 --> 01:32:48.605
<v Speaker 0>Eight minutes left. No. I need Emacs.

01:32:55.700 --> 01:32:58.100
<v Speaker 4>Maybe maybe a bio break. I don't know.

01:32:58.180 --> 01:32:59.460
<v Speaker 1>This is taking a while.

01:33:03.934 --> 01:33:05.534
<v Speaker 0>Shouldn't back out as next minutes to see

01:33:05.534 --> 01:33:07.294
<v Speaker 0>if it finishes installing the time.

01:33:08.335 --> 01:33:09.135
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. This is

01:33:10.494 --> 01:33:11.295
<v Speaker 4>There we let's

01:33:16.510 --> 01:33:19.070
<v Speaker 4>so let's see. Kubectl edit.

01:33:19.630 --> 01:33:21.550
<v Speaker 4>Let's try this one more time.

01:33:23.469 --> 01:33:25.870
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you need to reexport your config as

01:33:25.870 --> 01:33:26.030
<v Speaker 0>well.

01:33:26.925 --> 01:33:27.885
<v Speaker 4>Export.

01:33:29.405 --> 01:33:32.445
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. Okay. Let me grab the thing from

01:33:32.445 --> 01:33:33.645
<v Speaker 4>my cheat sheet.

01:33:33.805 --> 01:33:37.645
<v Speaker 4>KubeConfigadmin.com.

01:33:38.765 --> 01:33:39.645
<v Speaker 4>Alright.

01:33:39.805 --> 01:33:40.364
<v Speaker 0>Five

01:33:40.685 --> 01:33:41.485
<v Speaker 0>and a half minutes.

01:33:43.489 --> 01:33:45.170
<v Speaker 0>I have confidence in you.

01:33:47.170 --> 01:33:47.969
<v Speaker 4>Alright.

01:33:48.930 --> 01:33:51.330
<v Speaker 4>I have here. We've never seen an Emacs

01:33:51.330 --> 01:33:53.170
<v Speaker 0>on cluster before. That's a first, by the

01:33:53.170 --> 01:33:56.224
<v Speaker 0>way. Just Well, that's because and we when

01:33:56.224 --> 01:33:57.824
<v Speaker 4>we broke your cluster

01:33:58.224 --> 01:33:59.344
<v Speaker 4>a year ago,

01:33:59.505 --> 01:34:02.945
<v Speaker 4>whatever we did to rename v I to

01:34:02.945 --> 01:34:04.864
<v Speaker 4>emacs didn't work.

01:34:07.744 --> 01:34:09.344
<v Speaker 4>Let's see. Eighty eighty.

01:34:10.429 --> 01:34:12.590
<v Speaker 4>This should be eighty eighty.

01:34:17.310 --> 01:34:18.670
<v Speaker 5>There it is. Yeah.

01:34:21.710 --> 01:34:23.070
<v Speaker 0>It should be 80.

01:34:23.765 --> 01:34:26.085
<v Speaker 0>Does the max have search and replace?

01:34:28.245 --> 01:34:30.005
<v Speaker 4>It does. Because v I does. It's really

01:34:30.005 --> 01:34:30.565
<v Speaker 0>good.

01:34:33.045 --> 01:34:33.844
<v Speaker 4>It

01:34:33.925 --> 01:34:36.005
<v Speaker 4>does. I've been using Versus code. I'm a

01:34:36.005 --> 01:34:36.565
<v Speaker 4>little rusty.

01:34:38.930 --> 01:34:39.810
<v Speaker 4>That's

01:34:39.810 --> 01:34:41.330
<v Speaker 4>It's the shit. I mean, it's not installing

01:34:41.330 --> 01:34:43.250
<v Speaker 0>Versus Code web on these servers. I think,

01:34:43.250 --> 01:34:45.010
<v Speaker 0>actually, a lot of people would really appreciate

01:34:45.010 --> 01:34:45.489
<v Speaker 0>that.

01:34:47.410 --> 01:34:50.290
<v Speaker 4>Let's

01:34:50.290 --> 01:34:50.690
<v Speaker 4>see.

01:34:51.170 --> 01:34:52.210
<v Speaker 4>HP

01:34:52.610 --> 01:34:54.930
<v Speaker 4>local host

01:34:55.225 --> 01:34:56.105
<v Speaker 4>at

01:34:56.185 --> 01:34:57.385
<v Speaker 4>30,000.

01:34:59.145 --> 01:35:01.865
<v Speaker 4>Still a connection refused. So let's see. Let's

01:35:01.865 --> 01:35:04.105
<v Speaker 4>check that service ads. Let's see which

01:35:06.745 --> 01:35:07.385
<v Speaker 4>service

01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:12.270
<v Speaker 4>also changed to Huddl edit cluster.

01:35:13.150 --> 01:35:17.950
<v Speaker 4>That would service cluster 9090.

01:35:18.910 --> 01:35:24.974
<v Speaker 4>Okay. So we want 80808080.

01:35:26.255 --> 01:35:27.054
<v Speaker 4>I

01:35:27.455 --> 01:35:29.215
<v Speaker 4>keep I keep using

01:35:29.455 --> 01:35:30.414
<v Speaker 4>Nano.

01:35:31.535 --> 01:35:32.255
<v Speaker 4>Alright.

01:35:34.895 --> 01:35:36.574
<v Speaker 4>It did not oh,

01:35:37.775 --> 01:35:40.140
<v Speaker 4>for some reason, it's sticking garbage at the

01:35:40.140 --> 01:35:42.380
<v Speaker 4>beginning of the file. Let me save.

01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:44.300
<v Speaker 4>And here,

01:35:50.700 --> 01:35:51.740
<v Speaker 4>this garbage.

01:35:56.055 --> 01:35:59.735
<v Speaker 4>Eighty eighty. Okay. That'll be fuck up. No.

01:35:59.735 --> 01:36:01.175
<v Speaker 4>It's not okay.

01:36:02.215 --> 01:36:04.135
<v Speaker 4>Hey, also mess with this.

01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:07.780
<v Speaker 5>No.

01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:16.820
<v Speaker 4>Here we go. Failed to connect the database.

01:36:17.219 --> 01:36:17.860
<v Speaker 0>Three minutes.

01:36:18.515 --> 01:36:20.515
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. So they probably changed the ports on

01:36:20.515 --> 01:36:21.715
<v Speaker 4>that too. Yeah.

01:36:22.195 --> 01:36:23.635
<v Speaker 5>And it's there. It's maybe.

01:36:24.435 --> 01:36:26.355
<v Speaker 4>So let's see. Postgres.

01:36:26.355 --> 01:36:28.195
<v Speaker 4>What port is it supposed to run on?

01:36:28.195 --> 01:36:29.955
<v Speaker 0>Five four three two.

01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:33.580
<v Speaker 5>That's the MySQL port. Right?

01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:36.140
<v Speaker 0>It's the MySQL

01:36:36.140 --> 01:36:37.500
<v Speaker 0>MySQL port. Yeah.

01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:39.659
<v Speaker 6>Nice.

01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:43.260
<v Speaker 4>Let's see. So I'm

01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:45.740
<v Speaker 4>guessing that there's some similar changes on the

01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:47.925
<v Speaker 4>Postgres side. So that's running as a staple

01:36:47.925 --> 01:36:48.645
<v Speaker 4>set.

01:36:53.285 --> 01:36:54.565
<v Speaker 0>Postgres Uh-huh.

01:36:54.885 --> 01:36:55.765
<v Speaker 0>QL.

01:36:56.565 --> 01:36:58.645
<v Speaker 0>The service is Postgres. The they will set

01:36:58.645 --> 01:37:01.045
<v Speaker 0>as Postgres QL mostly because I hate people.

01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:03.470
<v Speaker 0>I really need to fix that. It should

01:37:03.470 --> 01:37:05.870
<v Speaker 0>be the same. So this is named 5432.

01:37:05.870 --> 01:37:06.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. Okay.

01:37:09.630 --> 01:37:11.389
<v Speaker 4>Port five four three two.

01:37:12.989 --> 01:37:14.829
<v Speaker 4>Is that what port is supposed to be?

01:37:14.830 --> 01:37:15.710
<v Speaker 0>It is. Yeah.

01:37:16.355 --> 01:37:19.235
<v Speaker 6>But somewhere there's a 330 6 in one

01:37:19.235 --> 01:37:20.594
<v Speaker 6>of the configs at least.

01:37:20.915 --> 01:37:22.915
<v Speaker 0>And the service was it not? No? And

01:37:22.915 --> 01:37:25.395
<v Speaker 5>there's garbage. Yeah. I think there's garbage at

01:37:25.395 --> 01:37:26.594
<v Speaker 5>the beginning of file too.

01:37:28.630 --> 01:37:30.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. Yeah. I'm not saving it.

01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:32.790
<v Speaker 4>So they may have just messed with the

01:37:32.790 --> 01:37:34.310
<v Speaker 4>service on this. So 5432?

01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:36.630
<v Speaker 0>Yes. Just put Postgres. Yeah. There we go.

01:37:37.590 --> 01:37:39.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. It's for some reason, it's inserting garbage.

01:37:39.750 --> 01:37:41.430
<v Speaker 4>Every time it's open. So

01:37:42.870 --> 01:37:44.390
<v Speaker 4>let's see. Yeah. There it Yeah.

01:37:45.935 --> 01:37:46.815
<v Speaker 4>432.

01:37:46.815 --> 01:37:48.175
<v Speaker 4>5 4 3 2.

01:37:50.975 --> 01:37:52.895
<v Speaker 4>Great. Right? Yep.

01:37:53.615 --> 01:37:54.815
<v Speaker 4>Alright. Let's

01:37:55.455 --> 01:37:55.855
<v Speaker 4>scroll.

01:37:59.900 --> 01:38:02.620
<v Speaker 4>Close to fail to connect. Let's give it

01:38:02.620 --> 01:38:03.660
<v Speaker 4>a second.

01:38:03.980 --> 01:38:05.260
<v Speaker 4>Failed to connect.

01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:09.820
<v Speaker 0>Not quite.

01:38:11.020 --> 01:38:13.180
<v Speaker 0>Let's see. You were pretty quick on the

01:38:13.180 --> 01:38:14.140
<v Speaker 4>end points changes.

01:38:17.635 --> 01:38:19.715
<v Speaker 4>Let's grasp end points. None.

01:38:23.075 --> 01:38:25.235
<v Speaker 0>Do you think by fixing the typo and

01:38:25.235 --> 01:38:27.075
<v Speaker 0>the service, you broke the Oh.

01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:34.920
<v Speaker 4>You mean, type on the service. So you

01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:36.200
<v Speaker 4>think that maybe it's

01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:38.680
<v Speaker 4>yeah. Get deploy.

01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:41.000
<v Speaker 4>You've got all. Get deployment.

01:38:42.865 --> 01:38:44.145
<v Speaker 0>Stateful set.

01:38:45.985 --> 01:38:48.225
<v Speaker 4>Well, I only changed the selector in the

01:38:48.225 --> 01:38:49.585
<v Speaker 4>deployment. Right?

01:38:49.985 --> 01:38:51.825
<v Speaker 0>Well, maybe they've done the same with this

01:38:51.825 --> 01:38:52.785
<v Speaker 0>service.

01:38:53.185 --> 01:38:55.425
<v Speaker 0>That was first one. Clustered.

01:38:55.425 --> 01:38:58.400
<v Speaker 4>Oh, yeah. So this looks right. App plus

01:38:58.320 --> 01:38:58.719
<v Speaker 4>We

01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:02.080
<v Speaker 4>can look at the same thing on

01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:07.760
<v Speaker 4>CS PostgresQL.

01:39:11.665 --> 01:39:13.425
<v Speaker 4>So PostgresQL,

01:39:13.505 --> 01:39:15.985
<v Speaker 4>and if we look at the service,

01:39:16.304 --> 01:39:17.105
<v Speaker 4>which is

01:39:18.625 --> 01:39:19.505
<v Speaker 4>Postgres.

01:39:20.625 --> 01:39:23.560
<v Speaker 0>Promise to fix that for next time. Postgres.

01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:24.600
<v Speaker 4>Postgres.

01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:25.720
<v Speaker 4>Oh my god.

01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:29.800
<v Speaker 4>Let's see. Postgres.

01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:31.640
<v Speaker 0>Time is up. Nice to see if we

01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:33.000
<v Speaker 0>can finish it in the next few minutes.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.120
<v Speaker 0>I I feel like we're close.

01:39:35.605 --> 01:39:36.244
<v Speaker 4>I blame

01:39:37.445 --> 01:39:38.564
<v Speaker 0>I blame Emacs.

01:39:40.244 --> 01:39:41.525
<v Speaker 4>Installing Emacs.

01:39:41.525 --> 01:39:45.045
<v Speaker 4>Let's

01:39:45.045 --> 01:39:45.604
<v Speaker 4>see.

01:39:46.085 --> 01:39:47.124
<v Speaker 4>So that,

01:39:47.605 --> 01:39:49.570
<v Speaker 4>curling it. Hey.

01:39:50.449 --> 01:39:52.610
<v Speaker 4>It's back if we edit the deployment.

01:39:55.330 --> 01:39:55.969
<v Speaker 4>V one.

01:40:01.265 --> 01:40:03.185
<v Speaker 4>Keep hitting control o.

01:40:04.225 --> 01:40:06.225
<v Speaker 4>Alright. And now we have grab it. Some

01:40:12.545 --> 01:40:13.585
<v Speaker 4>sort of

01:40:14.340 --> 01:40:16.579
<v Speaker 4>end with the control l. Alright.

01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:18.019
<v Speaker 4>So

01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:20.739
<v Speaker 4>v one

01:40:21.139 --> 01:40:22.260
<v Speaker 4>v two.

01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:24.499
<v Speaker 4>I think we may be done.

01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:26.659
<v Speaker 0>Yay. Did you curl it?

01:40:27.645 --> 01:40:29.885
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. It should v two web m. Oh,

01:40:29.885 --> 01:40:30.685
<v Speaker 0>there we go.

01:40:31.485 --> 01:40:32.284
<v Speaker 0>Perfect.

01:40:34.525 --> 01:40:36.605
<v Speaker 4>If you wanna try it, we can we

01:40:36.605 --> 01:40:38.045
<v Speaker 4>can confirm, but I

01:40:39.005 --> 01:40:40.765
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I think you got it. Let's let's

01:40:40.765 --> 01:40:42.365
<v Speaker 0>have a look anyway. Right? So

01:40:44.270 --> 01:40:44.990
<v Speaker 0>east.

01:40:53.230 --> 01:40:54.190
<v Speaker 0>Sometimes it's

01:40:55.715 --> 01:40:57.635
<v Speaker 4>You may need HTTP.

01:41:04.755 --> 01:41:05.795
<v Speaker 5>So as

01:41:06.355 --> 01:41:06.515
<v Speaker 5>well.

01:41:08.140 --> 01:41:09.020
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.

01:41:10.220 --> 01:41:10.940
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

01:41:13.740 --> 01:41:15.820
<v Speaker 0>Oh, there we go. Sometimes it just doesn't

01:41:15.820 --> 01:41:18.220
<v Speaker 0>work, and I could role play an IP.

01:41:18.380 --> 01:41:19.340
<v Speaker 0>But you do have to dance.

01:41:20.025 --> 01:41:22.265
<v Speaker 0>But I'm really confused right now because

01:41:22.665 --> 01:41:24.265
<v Speaker 0>there is no worker node.

01:41:25.705 --> 01:41:27.785
<v Speaker 6>I I think it's there.

01:41:28.905 --> 01:41:30.105
<v Speaker 6>Think it's connected. I think

01:41:30.825 --> 01:41:31.465
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.

01:41:31.945 --> 01:41:33.785
<v Speaker 5>Yeah. Yeah. I I think it it got

01:41:33.785 --> 01:41:34.665
<v Speaker 5>joined successfully.

01:41:35.700 --> 01:41:37.300
<v Speaker 0>But we could be the end reset it,

01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:38.820
<v Speaker 0>and the join didn't work. Right?

01:41:39.060 --> 01:41:41.460
<v Speaker 6>The join did work, but it did error

01:41:41.460 --> 01:41:42.179
<v Speaker 6>a bunch.

01:41:43.140 --> 01:41:44.420
<v Speaker 6>But it did say in the end that

01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:46.099
<v Speaker 6>it did join. Oh,

01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:48.260
<v Speaker 0>alright. Alright. Alright. Oh, good. There we go.

01:41:49.545 --> 01:41:52.185
<v Speaker 0>Phew. That was tough. Yeah. After the hours,

01:41:52.025 --> 01:41:52.505
<v Speaker 5>got

01:41:53.065 --> 01:41:54.025
<v Speaker 5>showed up in there.

01:41:54.585 --> 01:41:56.185
<v Speaker 0>Wow. Must be fun to work at chain

01:41:56.185 --> 01:41:57.545
<v Speaker 0>guards because they're all pure evil.

01:42:01.700 --> 01:42:04.900
<v Speaker 4>We use our power for good. Uh-huh. Alright.

01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:06.340
<v Speaker 0>Well, it was good of you to use

01:42:06.340 --> 01:42:08.580
<v Speaker 0>your power for evil for custard at least.

01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:10.820
<v Speaker 0>Those are two great breaks and two great

01:42:10.820 --> 01:42:12.820
<v Speaker 0>axes as well. That was a really good

01:42:12.820 --> 01:42:13.460
<v Speaker 0>fun.

01:42:13.860 --> 01:42:15.620
<v Speaker 4>It's much more fun breaking them.

01:42:18.475 --> 01:42:19.755
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:42:19.755 --> 01:42:20.875
<v Speaker 0>I guess it is.

01:42:23.195 --> 01:42:24.875
<v Speaker 0>I mean, when you do show up to

01:42:24.875 --> 01:42:27.355
<v Speaker 0>FX episode with VMAX though, I mean, things

01:42:27.355 --> 01:42:28.395
<v Speaker 0>are always gonna go wrong.

01:42:29.170 --> 01:42:31.809
<v Speaker 0>I actually really like VMAX, but I I've

01:42:31.809 --> 01:42:33.090
<v Speaker 0>never got the hang of all the different

01:42:33.090 --> 01:42:35.409
<v Speaker 0>key combinations to really be effective with it.

01:42:35.409 --> 01:42:38.530
<v Speaker 4>The funny the funny control characters and my

01:42:38.530 --> 01:42:39.409
<v Speaker 4>completely

01:42:40.289 --> 01:42:43.809
<v Speaker 4>broken muscle memory from using Versus code and

01:42:43.809 --> 01:42:44.210
<v Speaker 4>nano

01:42:44.985 --> 01:42:46.344
<v Speaker 4>on my MacBook,

01:42:48.105 --> 01:42:51.144
<v Speaker 4>I think, have ruined me for Emacs, but

01:42:51.145 --> 01:42:53.064
<v Speaker 4>it's still faster than

01:42:54.344 --> 01:42:56.425
<v Speaker 4>me me trying to use VI.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.480
<v Speaker 0>So Yeah. I might actually experiment with running

01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:01.160
<v Speaker 0>the web version of Versus Code on the

01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:02.920
<v Speaker 0>server and just giving it access to the

01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:04.920
<v Speaker 0>entire disk. I think that could be funny.

01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:06.040
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:09.320
<v Speaker 0>Well, thank you all for joining me. I

01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:11.000
<v Speaker 0>hope you enjoyed that.

01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:13.705
<v Speaker 0>I'll let you get back to your day.

01:43:13.785 --> 01:43:15.705
<v Speaker 0>To everyone who watched, thank you for all

01:43:15.705 --> 01:43:17.305
<v Speaker 0>your comments and the chat. It was a

01:43:17.305 --> 01:43:19.465
<v Speaker 0>pleasure watching you help out.

01:43:19.785 --> 01:43:21.305
<v Speaker 0>And it's always fun for me to try

01:43:21.305 --> 01:43:23.145
<v Speaker 0>and ponder the teams as much as possible.

01:43:23.385 --> 01:43:25.545
<v Speaker 0>I really felt guilty after that Kubeadm reset

01:43:25.545 --> 01:43:26.905
<v Speaker 0>when I don't think we'd get that back.

01:43:26.905 --> 01:43:29.040
<v Speaker 0>So I was really relieved that that worked.

01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:31.600
<v Speaker 0>And thank you to our sponsors, Equinix Medal

01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:34.480
<v Speaker 0>and Teleport. Mhmm. Custard will be back next

01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:36.960
<v Speaker 0>week. Until then, have a great day. Thank

01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:37.200
<v Speaker 0>you,

01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:39.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah. Thank you.
