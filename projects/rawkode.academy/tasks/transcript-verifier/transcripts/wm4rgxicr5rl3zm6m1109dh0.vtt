<v Speaker 0>Hello, and welcome to today's episode of Rawkode

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.500
<v Speaker 0>Live. I am your host, David Flanagan.

00:01:26.285 --> 00:01:28.205
<v Speaker 0>Today, are taking a look at Waypoint from

00:01:28.205 --> 00:01:29.085
<v Speaker 0>HashiCorp,

00:01:29.085 --> 00:01:32.685
<v Speaker 0>a tool to build, deploy and release software.

00:01:32.765 --> 00:01:34.845
<v Speaker 0>Now, before we get into that, there's a

00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:36.045
<v Speaker 0>little bit of housekeeping.

00:01:36.525 --> 00:01:39.165

<v Speaker 0>all new episodes of Rawkode Live.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.700
<v Speaker 0>We're gonna be exploring the vast cloud native

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.860
<v Speaker 0>landscape together, learning along the way, and trying

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.300
<v Speaker 0>to make all this mess a little bit

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.380
<v Speaker 0>easier. So subscribe and join us.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.620
<v Speaker 0>We also have a Discord server available at

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.270
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Now to guide us on our

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.230
<v Speaker 0>Waypoint journey today, I am joined by HashiCorp

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.430
<v Speaker 0>developer advocate,

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.630
<v Speaker 0>Taylor Dulzal.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.590
<v Speaker 0>Hey, man. How's it going?

00:02:20.645 --> 00:02:22.565
<v Speaker 1>Good. Happy to happy to be here this

00:02:22.565 --> 00:02:23.365
<v Speaker 1>morning,

00:02:23.365 --> 00:02:26.005
<v Speaker 1>evening, afternoon, just a a dollar sign time

00:02:26.005 --> 00:02:27.525
<v Speaker 1>zone, I think, is is pretty much the

00:02:27.525 --> 00:02:29.525
<v Speaker 1>time it is. Right? There's no there's no

00:02:29.525 --> 00:02:31.045
<v Speaker 0>time zones on the Internet. Right?

00:02:31.605 --> 00:02:33.685
<v Speaker 1>Exactly. It's just we're we're we're just here

00:02:33.685 --> 00:02:34.965
<v Speaker 1>as I think how it is.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.400
<v Speaker 1>Happy to be here today. So for

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.520
<v Speaker 1>happy to e meet all of you. If

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.240
<v Speaker 1>you have any questions during these sessions, please

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.640
<v Speaker 1>feel free to throw comments in the chat.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.800
<v Speaker 1>Be more than happy to to expand upon

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.160
<v Speaker 1>those answers, get things

00:02:52.325 --> 00:02:55.045
<v Speaker 1>just to kinda help illuminate on these concepts

00:02:55.045 --> 00:02:56.085
<v Speaker 1>and these topics.

00:02:56.245 --> 00:02:58.325
<v Speaker 1>Always always fun to have the opportunity to

00:02:58.325 --> 00:02:59.045
<v Speaker 1>do so.

00:02:59.685 --> 00:03:01.845
<v Speaker 1>My name is Taylor Dolozolt. Like David said,

00:03:01.845 --> 00:03:04.245
<v Speaker 1>I am a developer advocate at HashiCorp,

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.730
<v Speaker 1>and I work mostly with infrastructure workflows,

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:10.530
<v Speaker 1>application delivery, developer experience.

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.450
<v Speaker 1>Basically, if there's something that we want to

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.849
<v Speaker 1>do in the cloud and there's not an

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.455
<v Speaker 1>easy or straightforward way to do it, let's

00:03:17.455 --> 00:03:19.775
<v Speaker 1>solve it. Let's do that together. Let's, if

00:03:19.775 --> 00:03:21.295
<v Speaker 1>if you want to see more examples on

00:03:21.295 --> 00:03:23.215
<v Speaker 1>that front, that's something I love taking the

00:03:23.215 --> 00:03:25.215
<v Speaker 1>time to do, meeting with people on calls,

00:03:25.215 --> 00:03:27.295
<v Speaker 1>and and just kind of really digging into

00:03:27.295 --> 00:03:29.215
<v Speaker 1>what the problem is. What's the problem that

00:03:29.215 --> 00:03:31.055
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to solve here is, is typically

00:03:31.055 --> 00:03:32.575
<v Speaker 1>how I like to try to frame things.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.250
<v Speaker 1>So,

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.170
<v Speaker 1>have a lot of fun working at HashiCorp.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.490
<v Speaker 1>Really always excited to work in the cloud

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.010
<v Speaker 1>and and see what everybody else is working

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.490
<v Speaker 1>on.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.170
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.170
<v Speaker 0>Thank you for that. And I I think

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.690
<v Speaker 0>we all heard it. You just offered to

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.290
<v Speaker 0>fix everybody's cloud problems.

00:03:47.585 --> 00:03:49.105
<v Speaker 1>Darn it. I did, didn't I?

00:03:49.985 --> 00:03:51.745
<v Speaker 1>Like, oh, my calendar is all filled up.

00:03:51.745 --> 00:03:53.585
<v Speaker 0>Sorry about that. You're gonna have to open

00:03:53.585 --> 00:03:55.185
<v Speaker 0>up some more office hours I think now.

00:03:55.185 --> 00:03:55.425
<v Speaker 0>But

00:03:57.985 --> 00:03:59.905
<v Speaker 0>So thank you for that introduction. That's great.

00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:01.265
<v Speaker 0>It's nice to learn a little bit more

00:04:01.265 --> 00:04:01.665
<v Speaker 0>about you.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.170
<v Speaker 0>Now why don't you, for the people that

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.850
<v Speaker 0>are not aware, share a little bit about

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:07.650
<v Speaker 0>Waypoint?

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:09.410
<v Speaker 0>What is it? Absolutely.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.090
<v Speaker 1>So great question. Great question. It's it's it's

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.450
<v Speaker 1>almost like you've been practicing that

00:04:15.965 --> 00:04:19.085
<v Speaker 1>I'd say so what Waypoint is really when

00:04:19.085 --> 00:04:20.524
<v Speaker 1>when I talk with people about it, people

00:04:20.524 --> 00:04:21.805
<v Speaker 1>that have had the chance to take a

00:04:21.805 --> 00:04:24.525
<v Speaker 1>look at it might have kind of framed

00:04:24.525 --> 00:04:26.045
<v Speaker 1>it as a CICD

00:04:26.045 --> 00:04:26.685
<v Speaker 1>tool.

00:04:26.925 --> 00:04:29.485
<v Speaker 1>And you're right. Though it's so much more,

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.010
<v Speaker 1>Waypoint

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.050
<v Speaker 1>helps build,

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.930
<v Speaker 1>deploy,

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.610
<v Speaker 1>and release your applications,

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.370
<v Speaker 1>your containerized applications.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.850
<v Speaker 1>And so when it comes to each of

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.930
<v Speaker 1>those concerns, you know, you have tools like

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.165
<v Speaker 1>Flex, you have tools like Argo, and those

00:04:43.165 --> 00:04:45.405
<v Speaker 1>are mostly focused on the release the, you

00:04:45.405 --> 00:04:48.445
<v Speaker 1>know, deploying release factors

00:04:48.445 --> 00:04:49.885
<v Speaker 1>of that workflow.

00:04:49.965 --> 00:04:51.485
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to build, I know that

00:04:51.565 --> 00:04:53.325
<v Speaker 1>I I haven't taken a look at Argo.

00:04:53.325 --> 00:04:54.045
<v Speaker 1>I need to.

00:04:54.365 --> 00:04:55.725
<v Speaker 1>I I've taken a look at Flux and

00:04:55.725 --> 00:04:57.005
<v Speaker 1>have seen that they're starting to add in

00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:58.125
<v Speaker 1>that build capability.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.770
<v Speaker 1>And to me, that just that checks all

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.770
<v Speaker 1>the boxes when it comes to actually getting

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:03.730
<v Speaker 1>an application,

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.650
<v Speaker 1>you know, sharing an application with the world

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.890
<v Speaker 1>or or showing people what you're working on.

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.210
<v Speaker 1>So that's what Waypoint seeks to do is

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.050
<v Speaker 1>just to make all of those steps easier.

00:05:12.635 --> 00:05:15.035
<v Speaker 1>If you're trying to deploy to Kubernetes or

00:05:15.035 --> 00:05:18.315
<v Speaker 1>Nomad or Lambda or ECS,

00:05:18.315 --> 00:05:20.155
<v Speaker 1>you have you know, the goal is to

00:05:20.155 --> 00:05:21.755
<v Speaker 1>have one platform to be able to do

00:05:21.755 --> 00:05:24.075
<v Speaker 1>that and to make it easy for operators

00:05:24.075 --> 00:05:26.290
<v Speaker 1>to actually set that up and give teams

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.690
<v Speaker 1>the ability to choose what workflow works best

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.090
<v Speaker 1>for them. Now personally, I really like working

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.090
<v Speaker 1>in the CLI, but it doesn't hurt to

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.770
<v Speaker 1>have a nice UI to be able to

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.850
<v Speaker 1>go and look at things, make sure everything

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.850
<v Speaker 1>is as you expect it to be all

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.035
<v Speaker 1>in one place. You can do that again

00:05:41.035 --> 00:05:43.275
<v Speaker 1>with the CLI, but having that UI, that

00:05:43.275 --> 00:05:44.635
<v Speaker 1>single pane of glass,

00:05:45.035 --> 00:05:47.515
<v Speaker 1>the legendary mythical single pane of glass to

00:05:47.515 --> 00:05:49.835
<v Speaker 1>see everything that is important to you is

00:05:49.835 --> 00:05:52.555
<v Speaker 1>quite helpful. So that's that's what Waypoint is.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.720
<v Speaker 1>Really, the short answer is, you know, TLDR

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.560
<v Speaker 1>is that it's it's a lot of things,

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.880
<v Speaker 1>but mostly focusing on helping people solve problems,

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.840
<v Speaker 1>helping people

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.720
<v Speaker 1>deploy their applications and releasing them to the

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:05.880
<v Speaker 1>world.

00:06:07.115 --> 00:06:09.835
<v Speaker 1>There there are two big workflows that it's,

00:06:10.235 --> 00:06:12.555
<v Speaker 1>that to to kind kind of help better

00:06:12.555 --> 00:06:13.435
<v Speaker 1>illuminate.

00:06:13.515 --> 00:06:16.075
<v Speaker 1>What Waypoint does is say you're a developer

00:06:16.075 --> 00:06:18.475
<v Speaker 1>and you haven't really

00:06:18.555 --> 00:06:20.075
<v Speaker 1>you know, you've heard about this Docker thing,

00:06:20.075 --> 00:06:21.275
<v Speaker 1>you've heard about containerization,

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.520
<v Speaker 1>and you're just like, ugh, this is just

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.920
<v Speaker 1>another thing to learn. That's it's it's not

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.520
<v Speaker 1>something that's really gripping to you. You know,

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.000
<v Speaker 1>some people love to write Docker files, myself

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.720
<v Speaker 1>included, but say say that's not your that's

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.600
<v Speaker 1>that's not your passion.

00:06:34.545 --> 00:06:36.785
<v Speaker 1>That's something that Waypoint really helps with in

00:06:36.785 --> 00:06:38.945
<v Speaker 1>the build step where if you have an

00:06:38.945 --> 00:06:41.185
<v Speaker 1>application that has a package manager, say it's

00:06:41.185 --> 00:06:43.105
<v Speaker 1>a Go app, a Ruby app, a JavaScript

00:06:43.105 --> 00:06:43.905
<v Speaker 1>application,

00:06:44.225 --> 00:06:45.665
<v Speaker 1>and you have a package manager,

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:49.039
<v Speaker 1>what Waypoint uses is cloud native build packs

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:50.479
<v Speaker 1>so you don't even have to have a

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:51.280
<v Speaker 1>Dockerfile

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.840
<v Speaker 1>and you can start building right away. Now

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.439
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to be, you know, it's

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:57.919
<v Speaker 1>not going to be a one kilobyte

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.815
<v Speaker 1>image or or anything like that. It's not

00:07:00.815 --> 00:07:03.055
<v Speaker 1>going to be as reduced in size as

00:07:03.055 --> 00:07:04.815
<v Speaker 1>you might want, but it's going to be

00:07:04.815 --> 00:07:06.895
<v Speaker 1>a starting place, right, and and kind of

00:07:06.895 --> 00:07:09.055
<v Speaker 1>give you that that ability to deploy

00:07:09.695 --> 00:07:11.615
<v Speaker 1>your stuff and and get an example of

00:07:11.615 --> 00:07:13.295
<v Speaker 1>of what it looks like in in the

00:07:13.295 --> 00:07:14.175
<v Speaker 1>wild in the cloud.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.020
<v Speaker 1>If you do have a Dockerfile, you can

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.539
<v Speaker 1>bring that with you. You can build for

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:20.380
<v Speaker 1>that. And then when it comes to releasing

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.539
<v Speaker 1>to each of these platforms, you you no

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:25.020
<v Speaker 1>longer have to rely on that bash script

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.345
<v Speaker 1>or that wild, you know, like, we do

00:07:27.345 --> 00:07:29.104
<v Speaker 1>deploys a little bit differently here as you

00:07:29.104 --> 00:07:30.944
<v Speaker 1>might hear at just about every company that

00:07:30.944 --> 00:07:31.825
<v Speaker 1>you work at.

00:07:32.145 --> 00:07:34.065
<v Speaker 1>So really just kind of hoping to unify

00:07:34.065 --> 00:07:35.985
<v Speaker 1>that workflow and make it easy for people

00:07:36.145 --> 00:07:38.785
<v Speaker 1>to switch out their platforms, to switch out

00:07:38.785 --> 00:07:40.944
<v Speaker 1>their build processes. I think that's really where

00:07:40.944 --> 00:07:43.980
<v Speaker 1>the power of Waypoint shows, frankly.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.500
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Awesome. Lots of great context there. I'm

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.060
<v Speaker 0>gonna try and take everything you just said

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.540
<v Speaker 0>there and surmise it as one line. But

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.780
<v Speaker 0>then there's there's my mission. Right? So is

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.380
<v Speaker 0>would it be would it be fair to

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.885
<v Speaker 0>say that Waypoint as to software, what Terraform

00:07:59.885 --> 00:08:01.165
<v Speaker 0>is to infrastructure?

00:08:02.205 --> 00:08:06.044
<v Speaker 1>Exactly. Wonderful summation. Waypoint has this concept of

00:08:06.044 --> 00:08:07.725
<v Speaker 1>plug ins kind of and then you see

00:08:07.725 --> 00:08:10.365
<v Speaker 1>that with providers in Terraform. So whether you're

00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:14.125
<v Speaker 1>deploying to Kubernetes or to Lambda, you you

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.940
<v Speaker 1>are working with these different contexts in these

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:16.980
<v Speaker 1>different plug ins.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.980
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So one would use tariff oh, sorry.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.220
<v Speaker 0>One would use Terraform to spin up some

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.220
<v Speaker 0>VMs or some bare metal

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.660
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes cluster,

00:08:27.175 --> 00:08:29.575
<v Speaker 0>then they who can Waypoint and it will

00:08:29.575 --> 00:08:31.975
<v Speaker 0>deploy their application to that platform.

00:08:32.934 --> 00:08:35.415
<v Speaker 0>What about the Exactly. Continuous integration stage? Is

00:08:35.415 --> 00:08:37.255
<v Speaker 0>that something that Waypoint handles as well? I

00:08:37.255 --> 00:08:38.775
<v Speaker 0>think you kind of maybe said yes there

00:08:38.775 --> 00:08:40.215
<v Speaker 0>with the Dockerfile a bit. Yeah. Okay.

00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:44.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. That's what's really nice is that it's

00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:47.600
<v Speaker 1>at the current point in time, Waypoint doesn't

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.720
<v Speaker 1>have that capability to to act as an

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.160
<v Speaker 1>Argo as a flux

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.720
<v Speaker 1>type of platform just yet. That's something that

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.535
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about with the team. And so

00:08:56.535 --> 00:08:58.615
<v Speaker 1>I'm I'm really invested in kind of what

00:08:58.615 --> 00:09:00.935
<v Speaker 1>those workflows will look like. Right now, it's

00:09:01.175 --> 00:09:02.855
<v Speaker 1>I do have a demo today. It'll kinda,

00:09:02.855 --> 00:09:05.255
<v Speaker 1>like, showcase what it is to deploy a

00:09:05.255 --> 00:09:07.095
<v Speaker 1>Lambda application when you get that set up

00:09:07.095 --> 00:09:08.454
<v Speaker 1>with GitOps and if you were to make

00:09:08.454 --> 00:09:10.615
<v Speaker 1>a change and and kinda push that forward.

00:09:10.615 --> 00:09:13.390
<v Speaker 1>So that's that's that's quite cool. So I'll

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:14.670
<v Speaker 1>I'll be showing that today and kinda, like,

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.110
<v Speaker 1>what that workflow looks like.

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:18.670
<v Speaker 1>But when it comes to the the the

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:20.590
<v Speaker 1>piece that's missing there is is

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:21.710
<v Speaker 1>authentication

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.030
<v Speaker 1>and and tighter integration with Kubernetes.

00:09:24.455 --> 00:09:26.055
<v Speaker 1>So being able to

00:09:27.175 --> 00:09:29.175
<v Speaker 1>Waypoint has a server and then it has

00:09:29.175 --> 00:09:29.815
<v Speaker 1>a runner,

00:09:30.215 --> 00:09:32.215
<v Speaker 1>in its architecture. I'll also share out a

00:09:32.215 --> 00:09:34.055
<v Speaker 1>a link on that front too as to,

00:09:34.055 --> 00:09:35.895
<v Speaker 1>you know, how you can better understand Waypoint's

00:09:35.895 --> 00:09:36.375
<v Speaker 1>architecture.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.759
<v Speaker 1>But that's that's

00:09:38.759 --> 00:09:41.560
<v Speaker 1>that's really cool to see working and running

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.800
<v Speaker 1>and and yeah. That could talk for a

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.319
<v Speaker 1>very long time about it. So it's it's

00:09:45.319 --> 00:09:46.040
<v Speaker 1>quite nifty.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.040
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Well, you've teased the demo a few

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.399
<v Speaker 0>times now. So why don't we get your

00:09:49.399 --> 00:09:51.480
<v Speaker 0>screen shared? Let's head over and I'll just

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.135
<v Speaker 0>keep throwing questions at you as we move

00:09:53.135 --> 00:09:53.695
<v Speaker 0>through.

00:09:54.495 --> 00:09:55.455
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic.

00:09:55.695 --> 00:09:56.335
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So

00:09:56.815 --> 00:09:58.895
<v Speaker 1>you should see the

00:09:59.135 --> 00:10:01.055
<v Speaker 1>so you should see my browser window.

00:10:01.295 --> 00:10:03.295
<v Speaker 1>It's it's got my my homepage loaded on

00:10:03.295 --> 00:10:03.775
<v Speaker 1>it

00:10:04.815 --> 00:10:06.255
<v Speaker 1>for for for today for today.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.240
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm gonna be doing today is

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.600
<v Speaker 1>quite a few things.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:11.800
<v Speaker 1>I

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.839
<v Speaker 1>don't have two demos for you. I've got

00:10:14.839 --> 00:10:16.600
<v Speaker 1>three demos for you. So we'll do a

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.760
<v Speaker 1>hat trick of demos. Fingers crossed. These are

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.480
<v Speaker 1>all live. So fingers crossed everything goes swimmingly.

00:10:22.345 --> 00:10:24.825
<v Speaker 1>Let's so we'll we'll get right into it.

00:10:25.065 --> 00:10:27.065
<v Speaker 1>The the repository I'm gonna be working from

00:10:27.065 --> 00:10:30.345
<v Speaker 1>today is on on my username. I I

00:10:30.345 --> 00:10:31.945
<v Speaker 1>can share these out a little bit later.

00:10:32.425 --> 00:10:34.425
<v Speaker 1>My Waypoint GitOps repository.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:36.980
<v Speaker 1>In here, I've got some Terraform.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.140
<v Speaker 1>I do have to backport some things, so

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually gonna go ahead and set up

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:41.860
<v Speaker 1>an EKS cluster

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.700
<v Speaker 1>using this repository. I've updated this EKS in

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.140
<v Speaker 1>action repository

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.220
<v Speaker 1>with examples for Terraform1.0

00:10:49.885 --> 00:10:52.125
<v Speaker 1>as well as added KMS keys and just

00:10:52.125 --> 00:10:54.045
<v Speaker 1>kind of made a little bit easier debugging

00:10:54.045 --> 00:10:56.525
<v Speaker 1>experience for, you know, for for people that

00:10:56.525 --> 00:10:58.205
<v Speaker 1>want to kind of have that experience as

00:10:58.205 --> 00:10:59.885
<v Speaker 1>well as add dependable so I can tell

00:10:59.885 --> 00:11:01.645
<v Speaker 1>when things are out of date, which, you

00:11:01.645 --> 00:11:03.805
<v Speaker 1>know, pretty pretty helpful, I'd say. Alright.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:04.860
<v Speaker 1>So

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna jump into this Waypoint

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.460
<v Speaker 1>GitOps repository

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.980
<v Speaker 1>here. But first, let me kick off this

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.820
<v Speaker 1>I'll just run that off to the side.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.060
<v Speaker 1>So I'll go ahead and run a oh,

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.685
<v Speaker 1>wanna know something? Probably would help to see

00:11:20.685 --> 00:11:23.885
<v Speaker 1>this. Right? Okay. Yeah. Was about to add.

00:11:23.885 --> 00:11:26.125
<v Speaker 1>Always always always a plus.

00:11:26.524 --> 00:11:27.245
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:11:27.885 --> 00:11:29.165
<v Speaker 1>Terraform, Annette.

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:33.050
<v Speaker 0>Alright.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:39.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna go ahead and kick this off.

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:40.650
<v Speaker 1>Terraform.

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:42.650
<v Speaker 1>I've already done plans and applies with this,

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:44.090
<v Speaker 1>so I have a high confidence this is

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:45.885
<v Speaker 1>going to work. So I'm gonna go ahead

00:11:45.885 --> 00:11:47.965
<v Speaker 1>and do what I call Terraform YOLO, which

00:11:47.965 --> 00:11:50.525
<v Speaker 1>is going to be this auto approve appended

00:11:50.525 --> 00:11:51.645
<v Speaker 1>here. People,

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:54.285
<v Speaker 1>please don't do this in production. I'm a

00:11:54.285 --> 00:11:56.285
<v Speaker 1>trained professional, so mistakes are okay.

00:11:57.485 --> 00:12:00.620
<v Speaker 1>So I'll I'll I'll drag this shell off

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.180
<v Speaker 1>to the side and kinda let that go,

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.740
<v Speaker 1>and it is off to the races. Awesome.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:08.540
<v Speaker 1>K. I'll bump this up as well. So

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.420
<v Speaker 1>let's get started. Let's get started. So I'm

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.595
<v Speaker 1>going to be starting from scratch today.

00:12:14.235 --> 00:12:17.195
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be installing the Waypoint server

00:12:17.355 --> 00:12:18.875
<v Speaker 1>and showcasing,

00:12:19.195 --> 00:12:23.195
<v Speaker 1>the the entire workflow from zero to Waypoint,

00:12:23.355 --> 00:12:25.595
<v Speaker 1>with with production applications.

00:12:25.595 --> 00:12:27.195
<v Speaker 1>Granted, I I don't think that any of

00:12:27.195 --> 00:12:29.760
<v Speaker 1>these need a fully staffed team to administrate

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.080
<v Speaker 1>or operate, but, you know, who knows? Who

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:32.560
<v Speaker 1>knows?

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.440
<v Speaker 1>let's go ahead and get started. So first,

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.280
<v Speaker 1>what we're gonna want to do is we're

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.600
<v Speaker 1>going to want to install Waypoint.

00:12:42.435 --> 00:12:44.435
<v Speaker 1>So Waypoint I'll actually go back to my

00:12:44.435 --> 00:12:45.075
<v Speaker 1>browser.

00:12:45.395 --> 00:12:46.355
<v Speaker 1>I'm

00:12:46.355 --> 00:12:47.955
<v Speaker 1>on a Mac machine,

00:12:48.115 --> 00:12:49.635
<v Speaker 1>and one of the easiest ways to get

00:12:49.635 --> 00:12:51.955
<v Speaker 1>started with Waypoint is to just use brew.

00:12:51.955 --> 00:12:54.595
<v Speaker 1>You can tap HashiCorp's tap where we maintain

00:12:54.595 --> 00:12:57.570
<v Speaker 1>and release all of our software, and then

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.170
<v Speaker 1>you can just install it using these instructions

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:02.209
<v Speaker 1>here. We do support ARM. We do support

00:13:02.209 --> 00:13:03.810
<v Speaker 1>a whole bunch of other builds.

00:13:04.529 --> 00:13:06.370
<v Speaker 1>Please feel free to refer to the downloads

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:08.290
<v Speaker 1>page, and we've got some guidance for you

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:10.545
<v Speaker 1>there. Also, learn.hashicorp.com

00:13:10.545 --> 00:13:12.065
<v Speaker 1>has some pretty good walk throughs of this

00:13:12.065 --> 00:13:13.985
<v Speaker 1>as well. Or if you're hitting a snag,

00:13:13.985 --> 00:13:16.385
<v Speaker 1>please at me. Let's let's work through that.

00:13:16.385 --> 00:13:16.945
<v Speaker 1>So

00:13:17.585 --> 00:13:20.225
<v Speaker 1>good news is I already did that kinda

00:13:20.225 --> 00:13:21.905
<v Speaker 1>like the pulling out the cake from underneath

00:13:21.905 --> 00:13:24.130
<v Speaker 1>the countertop. I've already done that. I've already

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:26.450
<v Speaker 1>gotten Waypoint installed. So if we do Waypoint

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:29.970
<v Speaker 1>version here, we'll see that Waypoint zero five

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:32.690
<v Speaker 1>is here. We're getting an error when showing

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:34.850
<v Speaker 1>the server as is expected. We don't have

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:35.730
<v Speaker 1>that set up just yet.

00:13:36.985 --> 00:13:39.065
<v Speaker 1>I've I've neglected to say too that Waypoint

00:13:39.065 --> 00:13:41.225
<v Speaker 1>zero five just came out yesterday,

00:13:41.545 --> 00:13:42.825
<v Speaker 1>so you'll see a few of the new

00:13:42.825 --> 00:13:44.905
<v Speaker 1>features in here. All these demos kinda focus

00:13:44.905 --> 00:13:47.865
<v Speaker 1>on zero four functionality, but, don't fret. We've

00:13:47.865 --> 00:13:50.570
<v Speaker 1>got, we've got some zero five niceness in

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:53.130
<v Speaker 1>here, some zero five sparkle, in here that

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.210
<v Speaker 1>we'll be walking through. Cool.

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:55.930
<v Speaker 1>So,

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.370
<v Speaker 1>how do we install Waypoint? So we install

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Waypoint by doing this. So we want to

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:04.925
<v Speaker 1>just Waypoint install. We wanted to find the

00:14:04.925 --> 00:14:07.245
<v Speaker 1>platform that we're going to install Waypoint on.

00:14:07.245 --> 00:14:09.805
<v Speaker 1>Today, we're gonna install on two platforms. So

00:14:09.805 --> 00:14:11.964
<v Speaker 1>while I'm spinning up Kubernetes on the side,

00:14:12.045 --> 00:14:13.245
<v Speaker 1>right now, I'm just gonna run this in

00:14:13.245 --> 00:14:14.925
<v Speaker 1>Docker just to give you an idea of

00:14:14.925 --> 00:14:16.045
<v Speaker 1>how to install it locally.

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:18.990
<v Speaker 1>There are some features that you won't get

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:22.029
<v Speaker 1>when you install Waypoint locally on your machine,

00:14:22.029 --> 00:14:23.470
<v Speaker 1>and I'll get into that here in just

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:24.190
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.

00:14:25.069 --> 00:14:26.509
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So let's go ahead and get this

00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:27.230
<v Speaker 1>installed.

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:29.945
<v Speaker 1>And this won't take too long to to

00:14:29.945 --> 00:14:32.824
<v Speaker 1>get done, but really straightforward. It's nice to

00:14:32.824 --> 00:14:34.264
<v Speaker 1>be able to have have this kind of

00:14:34.264 --> 00:14:36.345
<v Speaker 1>experience and not have to, you know, mess

00:14:36.345 --> 00:14:38.824
<v Speaker 1>around with configuration, things like that. It's it's

00:14:38.824 --> 00:14:40.985
<v Speaker 1>it's nice and simple. So we can see

00:14:40.985 --> 00:14:43.625
<v Speaker 1>that Waypoint's been installed. It's been it's been

00:14:43.625 --> 00:14:44.024
<v Speaker 1>configured.

00:14:44.459 --> 00:14:47.180
<v Speaker 1>Let's load up that UI. So if I

00:14:47.339 --> 00:14:49.100
<v Speaker 1>if I type in our let's let's do

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.699
<v Speaker 1>a version here, and then now we'll see

00:14:50.699 --> 00:14:53.420
<v Speaker 1>both the CLI and that server are the

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.540
<v Speaker 1>versions that we want to see.

00:14:57.125 --> 00:14:58.405
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that we want to take a

00:14:58.405 --> 00:15:00.165
<v Speaker 1>look at the UI. So how do we

00:15:00.165 --> 00:15:02.485
<v Speaker 1>do that? The UI is

00:15:02.645 --> 00:15:04.965
<v Speaker 1>has a is backed by a token system.

00:15:05.365 --> 00:15:08.325
<v Speaker 1>Waypoint zero five released this capability to integrate

00:15:08.325 --> 00:15:09.365
<v Speaker 1>with OpenID

00:15:09.365 --> 00:15:12.010
<v Speaker 1>Connect. So if you want to use GitLab,

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:13.930
<v Speaker 1>if you want to use Google, you have

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:16.330
<v Speaker 1>the option to do that and then invite

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.490
<v Speaker 1>users that way. We're not gonna get into

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:20.890
<v Speaker 1>that today. We're just going to authenticate here

00:15:21.529 --> 00:15:22.970
<v Speaker 1>and use that token system.

00:15:23.574 --> 00:15:26.454
<v Speaker 1>So you'll see this is connecting over HTTPS,

00:15:26.454 --> 00:15:28.774
<v Speaker 1>so we are almost secure, as secure as

00:15:28.774 --> 00:15:30.855
<v Speaker 1>can be on local host. That's why we're

00:15:30.855 --> 00:15:32.774
<v Speaker 1>getting this alert. So we're just gonna go

00:15:32.774 --> 00:15:35.255
<v Speaker 1>ahead and proceed. This is as expected.

00:15:35.495 --> 00:15:38.935
<v Speaker 1>So great. We have installed the Waypoint server.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.360
<v Speaker 1>Now as of, I think it was Waypoint

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.320
<v Speaker 1>zero three, we had this capability of runners,

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:48.279
<v Speaker 1>within Waypoint. So, not only when you install

00:15:48.279 --> 00:15:50.600
<v Speaker 1>your server, you also get one runner.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.640
<v Speaker 1>So what that does is it handles things

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.320
<v Speaker 1>like

00:15:54.955 --> 00:15:57.835
<v Speaker 1>handling runs and configurations and things in the

00:15:57.835 --> 00:16:00.475
<v Speaker 1>back end. That's going to be crucial for

00:16:00.475 --> 00:16:02.795
<v Speaker 1>our GitOps workflow that we're going to work

00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:03.515
<v Speaker 1>with today.

00:16:04.315 --> 00:16:07.435
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So we've installed Waypoint server,

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:10.330
<v Speaker 1>and now we can actually take this for

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.410
<v Speaker 1>a spin and actually get an application deployed.

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:13.690
<v Speaker 1>So let me go ahead and set this

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:15.930
<v Speaker 1>up side by side, and let me also

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:17.850
<v Speaker 1>bump this up just a little bit too.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:19.530
<v Speaker 1>K. So

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:22.330
<v Speaker 1>you'll see we have a few directories here.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.325
<v Speaker 1>So these these are our demos. These are

00:16:25.325 --> 00:16:26.605
<v Speaker 1>in fact our demos.

00:16:26.845 --> 00:16:30.445
<v Speaker 1>Let's let's kick things off with the GitOps

00:16:31.325 --> 00:16:32.525
<v Speaker 1>demo. So

00:16:33.085 --> 00:16:35.725
<v Speaker 1>the way that Waypoint works is that you

00:16:35.725 --> 00:16:38.540
<v Speaker 1>can run different commands in Waypoint, obviously. The

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:39.899
<v Speaker 1>first one that we're gonna want to run

00:16:39.899 --> 00:16:41.019
<v Speaker 1>is init.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:44.540
<v Speaker 1>This is going to initialize our project, and

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.139
<v Speaker 1>then you actually don't have to refresh this.

00:16:46.139 --> 00:16:48.779
<v Speaker 1>In real time, it will appear. It takes

00:16:48.779 --> 00:16:51.675
<v Speaker 1>just a second, and there it is. So

00:16:51.675 --> 00:16:53.195
<v Speaker 1>we have that loaded,

00:16:54.875 --> 00:16:57.115
<v Speaker 1>and and and we're good to go. We

00:16:57.115 --> 00:16:59.595
<v Speaker 1>could run Waypoint up, and then this would

00:16:59.595 --> 00:17:02.235
<v Speaker 1>go ahead and install just about everything that

00:17:02.235 --> 00:17:02.955
<v Speaker 1>we need

00:17:03.195 --> 00:17:05.619
<v Speaker 1>for this demo. So what is this, though?

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Let's let's actually learn about what we're going

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.220
<v Speaker 1>to deploy before we go ahead and do

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.859
<v Speaker 1>that. So let's jump in here into GitOps.

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:13.539
<v Speaker 1>My apologies. I'll bump this up.

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:15.619
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.260
<v Speaker 1>And then let's let's use some.

00:17:19.855 --> 00:17:21.535
<v Speaker 1>My goodness. I never remember my hot keys

00:17:21.535 --> 00:17:22.494
<v Speaker 1>when it matters.

00:17:23.054 --> 00:17:24.254
<v Speaker 1>There it is. Okay.

00:17:24.734 --> 00:17:26.734
<v Speaker 1>And then let's set the language.

00:17:28.975 --> 00:17:31.855
<v Speaker 1>Language mode. Let's just do a terraform because

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:34.450
<v Speaker 1>HCL is HCL is fun. JSON would be

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:37.330
<v Speaker 1>fine, but HCL is better better colors.

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:40.450
<v Speaker 1>So what are we doing here? So we

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:43.730
<v Speaker 1>define the project name GitOps because that's what

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.650
<v Speaker 1>we're going to showcase is the GitOps workflow

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:46.450
<v Speaker 1>in this demo.

00:17:47.555 --> 00:17:50.035
<v Speaker 1>So in this application stanza, we'll see that

00:17:50.035 --> 00:17:52.034
<v Speaker 1>we have a build step. Great.

00:17:52.275 --> 00:17:54.435
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be using Docker to build

00:17:54.435 --> 00:17:55.554
<v Speaker 1>out this image.

00:17:56.195 --> 00:17:58.435
<v Speaker 1>Inside of this build stanza, we have a

00:17:58.435 --> 00:18:01.955
<v Speaker 1>registry, and we're gonna be using AWS's

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.479
<v Speaker 1>ECR, the elastic container registry,

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.880
<v Speaker 1>because when we deploy to Lambda,

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.720
<v Speaker 1>that is all that we are allowed to

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.359
<v Speaker 1>use, from from Amazon's guidelines.

00:18:11.159 --> 00:18:14.120
<v Speaker 1>So, wouldn't recommend this in production, setting the

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.635
<v Speaker 1>tag to latest, but Waypoint does have the

00:18:16.635 --> 00:18:18.315
<v Speaker 1>capability. There are stubs that you can put

00:18:18.315 --> 00:18:19.515
<v Speaker 1>in so you can get like a SHA

00:18:19.515 --> 00:18:21.355
<v Speaker 1>value. You can iterate

00:18:21.915 --> 00:18:22.795
<v Speaker 1>Waypoint

00:18:24.155 --> 00:18:25.435
<v Speaker 1>zero variables,

00:18:25.435 --> 00:18:26.795
<v Speaker 1>and so you can kind of define some

00:18:26.795 --> 00:18:28.235
<v Speaker 1>other things if you kind of want to

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:30.309
<v Speaker 1>decorate this a little bit better or fill

00:18:30.309 --> 00:18:32.869
<v Speaker 1>this in with a little bit more certainty.

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:36.470
<v Speaker 1>Again, definitely definitely don't recommend latest for for

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.110
<v Speaker 1>anything unless you unless you like puzzles, escape

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:41.270
<v Speaker 1>rooms, and the like, or 3AM calls. Those

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.164
<v Speaker 1>are I'm I'm not a fan of of

00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:45.485
<v Speaker 1>many of those things, but, mostly mostly last

00:18:45.485 --> 00:18:46.844
<v Speaker 1>one. Escape rooms are fun.

00:18:47.325 --> 00:18:48.044
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.

00:18:48.605 --> 00:18:50.284
<v Speaker 1>Next is our deploy step. So,

00:18:50.684 --> 00:18:53.085
<v Speaker 1>deploy and release sounds similar, but they are

00:18:53.085 --> 00:18:54.204
<v Speaker 1>in fact different.

00:18:54.524 --> 00:18:57.840
<v Speaker 1>So what what what does that mean? Deploy

00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:58.880
<v Speaker 1>the Stanza,

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.840
<v Speaker 1>we we specify which plug in we want

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.760
<v Speaker 1>to use within Waypoint. So we're gonna be

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.840
<v Speaker 1>using Lambda, and we're deploying to The US

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.160
<v Speaker 1>West 2 region. I live in Los Angeles,

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.925
<v Speaker 1>California, so this is closer to me. Little

00:19:09.925 --> 00:19:12.085
<v Speaker 1>bit better, latency time. We could get really

00:19:12.085 --> 00:19:14.805
<v Speaker 1>crazy and use local, local availability zones, but

00:19:14.805 --> 00:19:16.725
<v Speaker 1>haven't, haven't gotten there just yet.

00:19:18.085 --> 00:19:20.725
<v Speaker 1>Lastly, we specify that for the release. So

00:19:20.725 --> 00:19:23.690
<v Speaker 1>that's deploying. That's actually pushing our image onto

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:26.250
<v Speaker 1>or or application onto the platform of our

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:28.010
<v Speaker 1>choice, in this case, Lambda.

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:30.490
<v Speaker 1>But how do we actually tell Amazon,

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:32.170
<v Speaker 1>let's shift to that new version? You know,

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:33.770
<v Speaker 1>say I have three versions. I wanna go

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:34.809
<v Speaker 1>from two to three.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:38.890
<v Speaker 1>That final piece release is actually going to

00:19:37.425 --> 00:19:38.785
<v Speaker 1>to specify

00:19:38.785 --> 00:19:40.625
<v Speaker 1>that we need to shift traffic

00:19:40.705 --> 00:19:41.265
<v Speaker 1>over.

00:19:41.825 --> 00:19:44.705
<v Speaker 1>And so that is, that is everything today.

00:19:45.105 --> 00:19:46.305
<v Speaker 1>Let's go ahead and take a look at

00:19:46.305 --> 00:19:47.184
<v Speaker 1>our actual,

00:19:48.305 --> 00:19:50.305
<v Speaker 1>application that we're deploying today. This is a

00:19:50.305 --> 00:19:51.825
<v Speaker 1>very simple Ruby application.

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.380
<v Speaker 1>Apologies for all the all the you need

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:55.900
<v Speaker 1>to update your system. That's

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.220
<v Speaker 1>try to do that just about every five

00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.820
<v Speaker 1>minutes, but clearly, failed.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.260
<v Speaker 1>So this is pretty simple application.

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.140
<v Speaker 1>We can see that we this is just

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:09.075
<v Speaker 1>handling a we're gonna be making a call.

00:20:09.075 --> 00:20:11.955
<v Speaker 1>This is gonna return very, very simple, straightforward

00:20:11.955 --> 00:20:12.995
<v Speaker 1>HTML,

00:20:13.315 --> 00:20:15.715
<v Speaker 1>and and we can see it's gonna say

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:18.195
<v Speaker 1>happy day ending in y name.

00:20:18.195 --> 00:20:19.795
<v Speaker 1>So we could probably make that a little

00:20:19.795 --> 00:20:22.030
<v Speaker 1>bit more specific too, but we'll go ahead

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:23.630
<v Speaker 1>and handle that after we get this deployed.

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:25.230
<v Speaker 1>That's maybe that's a feature request we'll get

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:27.309
<v Speaker 1>from our stakeholders. Let's let's find out.

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:29.950
<v Speaker 1>So that's that's the application. We do have

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:31.630
<v Speaker 1>a Dockerfile for this as well, so we're

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:33.310
<v Speaker 1>not gonna be using those cloud native build

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:35.070
<v Speaker 1>packs to craft this image.

00:20:36.015 --> 00:20:38.735
<v Speaker 1>So this is, again, pretty pretty straightforward.

00:20:38.895 --> 00:20:40.815
<v Speaker 1>Feel free to to ask any questions on

00:20:40.815 --> 00:20:42.415
<v Speaker 1>these fronts if you have time.

00:20:43.455 --> 00:20:46.255
<v Speaker 1>Instead of calling Waypoint up and actually running

00:20:46.255 --> 00:20:48.415
<v Speaker 1>this manually, what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:20:48.415 --> 00:20:50.335
<v Speaker 1>just gonna use that GitOps workflow

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:53.310
<v Speaker 1>right out of the gate. So we've initialized

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:55.710
<v Speaker 1>our project, which is necessary. You can't

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:58.830
<v Speaker 1>you could set this project up completely within

00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:59.630
<v Speaker 1>the UI,

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:01.710
<v Speaker 1>but but with I I like having that

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:05.664
<v Speaker 1>Waypoint configuration file because it's it's a it's

00:21:05.664 --> 00:21:06.864
<v Speaker 1>a declarative state.

00:21:07.105 --> 00:21:10.144
<v Speaker 1>When working with any kind of operations or

00:21:10.144 --> 00:21:10.945
<v Speaker 1>deployments,

00:21:10.945 --> 00:21:13.264
<v Speaker 1>declarative state to me is just something that's

00:21:13.264 --> 00:21:15.985
<v Speaker 1>really important to have because then we know

00:21:15.985 --> 00:21:17.664
<v Speaker 1>what we're looking to expect.

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:19.779
<v Speaker 1>So awesome.

00:21:20.419 --> 00:21:22.340
<v Speaker 1>So let's jump in here into GitOps. Let's

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:24.259
<v Speaker 1>actually manage this through the UI just to

00:21:24.259 --> 00:21:25.779
<v Speaker 1>kinda get an idea of all the fields

00:21:25.779 --> 00:21:28.100
<v Speaker 1>available. You can do this through the CLI,

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.100
<v Speaker 1>but for for demo's sake, it's a little

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.460
<v Speaker 1>bit easier to walk through when we've got

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:31.940
<v Speaker 1>a UI.

00:21:32.485 --> 00:21:34.164
<v Speaker 1>So you can see here the input variables

00:21:34.164 --> 00:21:35.524
<v Speaker 1>is is one of the new features of

00:21:35.524 --> 00:21:37.845
<v Speaker 1>zero five. We won't walk through through that

00:21:37.845 --> 00:21:38.484
<v Speaker 1>today.

00:21:39.365 --> 00:21:40.085
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:21:40.325 --> 00:21:40.965
<v Speaker 1>So

00:21:41.284 --> 00:21:42.644
<v Speaker 1>we have our

00:21:43.125 --> 00:21:44.804
<v Speaker 1>repository here. I'm just gonna go ahead and

00:21:44.804 --> 00:21:46.325
<v Speaker 1>grab this HTTP

00:21:46.325 --> 00:21:48.259
<v Speaker 1>endpoint from GitHub,

00:21:48.419 --> 00:21:49.940
<v Speaker 1>and we can put that in here.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:53.059
<v Speaker 1>This GitRef, we could use head, but I'm

00:21:53.059 --> 00:21:54.500
<v Speaker 1>just gonna go ahead and use main. You

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.419
<v Speaker 1>know, let's let's just push to let's just

00:21:56.419 --> 00:21:57.860
<v Speaker 1>push to main. I think that's how people

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.340
<v Speaker 1>do deploys now. Right? Sounds sounds safe.

00:22:02.275 --> 00:22:04.515
<v Speaker 1>And then we're gonna wanna specify which actual

00:22:04.515 --> 00:22:06.035
<v Speaker 1>path that we're going to want to look

00:22:06.035 --> 00:22:06.515
<v Speaker 1>at.

00:22:06.915 --> 00:22:09.315
<v Speaker 1>This this demo is kind of a a

00:22:09.395 --> 00:22:12.195
<v Speaker 1>mono repo, so we have different folders for

00:22:12.195 --> 00:22:13.875
<v Speaker 1>different demos. So I'm gonna go ahead and

00:22:13.875 --> 00:22:15.635
<v Speaker 1>specify that we want to look inside of

00:22:15.635 --> 00:22:16.195
<v Speaker 1>the GitOps

00:22:16.679 --> 00:22:19.080
<v Speaker 1>GitOps folder. And then we're not gonna use

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:22.119
<v Speaker 1>any authentication. I know that sounds risky, but

00:22:22.279 --> 00:22:23.960
<v Speaker 1>this is a public repository,

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.639
<v Speaker 1>so we we should be safe on that

00:22:25.639 --> 00:22:27.320
<v Speaker 1>front. And then I'm gonna go ahead and

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:30.254
<v Speaker 1>turn on automated sync so that as changes

00:22:30.254 --> 00:22:33.855
<v Speaker 1>happen, they actually get pushed to, our our

00:22:33.855 --> 00:22:35.374
<v Speaker 1>deployment platform. So

00:22:35.934 --> 00:22:37.855
<v Speaker 1>I know that was a lot. I know

00:22:37.855 --> 00:22:39.615
<v Speaker 1>that was a lot to listen to, a

00:22:39.615 --> 00:22:40.494
<v Speaker 1>lot to see.

00:22:40.735 --> 00:22:43.534
<v Speaker 1>Let's, let's let's see if everything is working

00:22:43.534 --> 00:22:44.495
<v Speaker 1>as we expect.

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:45.510
<v Speaker 1>So

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:47.830
<v Speaker 1>the nice thing about Waypoint is that we

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.150
<v Speaker 1>can actually jump into this build and and

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:51.429
<v Speaker 1>kinda get some

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:54.390
<v Speaker 1>the telemetry on what's happening and some different

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:56.230
<v Speaker 1>logs. So here in a little bit, this

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:58.710
<v Speaker 1>build is already kicking off. I didn't instruct

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:01.154
<v Speaker 1>this to happen Because we're using that GitOps

00:23:01.154 --> 00:23:01.955
<v Speaker 1>workflow,

00:23:01.955 --> 00:23:04.195
<v Speaker 1>this is something that kicks off initially. So

00:23:04.195 --> 00:23:05.955
<v Speaker 1>this will take a little bit. I'm more

00:23:05.955 --> 00:23:07.475
<v Speaker 1>than happy to answer your questions at this

00:23:07.475 --> 00:23:10.115
<v Speaker 1>time, but this this probably take, a minute

00:23:10.115 --> 00:23:11.635
<v Speaker 1>a minute or two to actually spin everything

00:23:11.635 --> 00:23:14.669
<v Speaker 1>up, build, push the repository, deploy the application,

00:23:14.669 --> 00:23:15.789
<v Speaker 1>and then we can actually go ahead and

00:23:15.789 --> 00:23:17.390
<v Speaker 1>test it and and push some changes to

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:17.789
<v Speaker 1>it.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:19.630
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Could

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:22.909
<v Speaker 0>can we just clarify the difference between deploy

00:23:23.789 --> 00:23:25.710
<v Speaker 0>and release again? Like, I'm not sure I

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:26.429
<v Speaker 0>got that. Absolutely.

00:23:27.195 --> 00:23:27.754
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.

00:23:28.075 --> 00:23:30.475
<v Speaker 1>So if you have an image and you

00:23:30.475 --> 00:23:32.794
<v Speaker 1>want to get it onto your platform of

00:23:32.794 --> 00:23:35.195
<v Speaker 1>choice so so in in this example, we're

00:23:35.195 --> 00:23:37.114
<v Speaker 1>pushing to Amazon Lambda.

00:23:37.115 --> 00:23:39.195
<v Speaker 1>Oh. There was there was actually one thing

00:23:39.195 --> 00:23:40.635
<v Speaker 1>I I forgot to do. I'll I'll go

00:23:40.635 --> 00:23:41.914
<v Speaker 1>ahead and do that in the background. That

00:23:41.914 --> 00:23:42.474
<v Speaker 1>is

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:45.110
<v Speaker 1>we we have that Waypoint runner that I

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.830
<v Speaker 1>talked about,

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:48.710
<v Speaker 1>but it needs authentication to to AWS to

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:51.110
<v Speaker 1>actually carry forth these things. So I'm gonna

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:52.549
<v Speaker 1>go ahead and set that configuration.

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:55.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna go do so in a, in

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:55.190
<v Speaker 1>a

00:23:56.255 --> 00:23:59.295
<v Speaker 1>different terminal just, due to some sensitive credentials

00:23:59.295 --> 00:24:01.215
<v Speaker 1>there. So I'll go ahead and handle that,

00:24:01.535 --> 00:24:03.535
<v Speaker 1>and then we'll we'll get this spun up,

00:24:03.535 --> 00:24:05.135
<v Speaker 1>and then we'll actually kind of start to

00:24:05.135 --> 00:24:07.375
<v Speaker 1>to kick around and get things pushed. So,

00:24:07.695 --> 00:24:10.255
<v Speaker 1>what are the differences between deploy

00:24:10.255 --> 00:24:11.135
<v Speaker 1>and release?

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:15.590
<v Speaker 1>We've our our platform of choice. So say

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:18.310
<v Speaker 1>that we have an image, a container image,

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:19.750
<v Speaker 1>we wanna push to Kubernetes.

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:22.230
<v Speaker 1>The deploy step for that would essentially be

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:25.495
<v Speaker 1>the kubectl apply. It's actually pushing that image

00:24:25.495 --> 00:24:28.054
<v Speaker 1>and that deployment to your platform of choice.

00:24:28.135 --> 00:24:28.934
<v Speaker 1>And then,

00:24:29.255 --> 00:24:30.375
<v Speaker 1>with releases,

00:24:30.375 --> 00:24:32.855
<v Speaker 1>that's deciding where you want to route your

00:24:32.855 --> 00:24:36.134
<v Speaker 1>endpoints to which version of your application. So,

00:24:36.615 --> 00:24:38.375
<v Speaker 1>the deployment is really just kind of a

00:24:38.375 --> 00:24:40.670
<v Speaker 1>push operation or or setting things up, making

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:42.910
<v Speaker 1>sure everything is is staged

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:43.950
<v Speaker 1>appropriately.

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:45.390
<v Speaker 1>And then, you know, you could almost think

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:47.390
<v Speaker 1>of it as GitHub branches. You know? You

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:49.630
<v Speaker 1>pushed up your code and everything like that.

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:52.190
<v Speaker 1>And then the release step is actually pointing,

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:53.630
<v Speaker 1>which is my default one that I'm going

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:55.075
<v Speaker 1>to use for these operations.

00:24:55.955 --> 00:24:57.714
<v Speaker 1>It is it's kinda what's going on there.

00:24:58.115 --> 00:25:00.034
<v Speaker 1>Does that make does that make more sense?

00:25:00.914 --> 00:25:02.674
<v Speaker 0>A little bit. I think so. Yeah. I'm

00:25:02.674 --> 00:25:04.195
<v Speaker 0>just trying to kinda work it in my

00:25:04.195 --> 00:25:05.794
<v Speaker 0>head of of what I was doing. Does

00:25:05.794 --> 00:25:08.034
<v Speaker 0>does that mean that Waypoint and nowhere in

00:25:08.034 --> 00:25:09.970
<v Speaker 0>the future will have the kind of built

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:12.210
<v Speaker 0>in primitives to do canary style deployments? Or

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:13.490
<v Speaker 0>does that come down to the platform of

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:15.169
<v Speaker 0>choice that we're actually deploying to?

00:25:16.529 --> 00:25:17.169
<v Speaker 1>My

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:18.849
<v Speaker 1>favorite answer, it depends.

00:25:19.169 --> 00:25:20.929
<v Speaker 1>So it's it is it is a little

00:25:20.929 --> 00:25:22.225
<v Speaker 1>bit of both, honestly.

00:25:22.544 --> 00:25:24.544
<v Speaker 1>So as long as your platform of choice,

00:25:24.784 --> 00:25:27.024
<v Speaker 1>it it it allows for that to happen,

00:25:27.105 --> 00:25:28.385
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to be able to do

00:25:28.385 --> 00:25:30.544
<v Speaker 1>so. I I think that that's the the

00:25:30.544 --> 00:25:32.784
<v Speaker 1>the niceness of Waypoint is that we can

00:25:32.784 --> 00:25:33.664
<v Speaker 1>kind of try to

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.559
<v Speaker 1>think about different ways that we might be

00:25:36.559 --> 00:25:38.399
<v Speaker 1>able to enable that. So that that might

00:25:38.399 --> 00:25:40.880
<v Speaker 1>be something that, you know, either that we

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.559
<v Speaker 1>handle more of on the Waypoint side, but

00:25:42.559 --> 00:25:43.679
<v Speaker 1>if there is a platform

00:25:44.399 --> 00:25:46.240
<v Speaker 1>if that platform supports that, then that's gonna

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.279
<v Speaker 1>be pretty straightforward

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.880
<v Speaker 1>and and pretty easy to do.

00:25:49.625 --> 00:25:51.945
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So if I wanna update my DNS

00:25:51.945 --> 00:25:54.105
<v Speaker 0>on a deployment, would I ever do that

00:25:54.105 --> 00:25:55.545
<v Speaker 0>in the release step?

00:25:57.385 --> 00:25:58.185
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.

00:25:58.185 --> 00:25:58.905
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.

00:25:59.145 --> 00:26:02.505
<v Speaker 1>So inside of so inside of here, what

00:26:02.505 --> 00:26:03.545
<v Speaker 1>this is with Lambda,

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:05.990
<v Speaker 1>I I'll I'll I think I'll be able

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:07.590
<v Speaker 1>to show you with this example

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:10.470
<v Speaker 1>after I get all the credentials set up.

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:12.790
<v Speaker 1>Lambda is going to kind of keep track

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:14.390
<v Speaker 1>of all the versions that I push, and

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:17.030
<v Speaker 1>so with release, I could actually shift back.

00:26:17.315 --> 00:26:20.274
<v Speaker 1>So if, if I've deployed, you know, a

00:26:20.195 --> 00:26:21.075
<v Speaker 1>a new,

00:26:21.554 --> 00:26:23.475
<v Speaker 1>title for for the web page,

00:26:24.595 --> 00:26:26.355
<v Speaker 1>you know, it's just going to diff default

00:26:26.355 --> 00:26:28.595
<v Speaker 1>to the latest release. But if there's let's

00:26:28.595 --> 00:26:30.035
<v Speaker 1>say, like, oh, no. I can't know, I

00:26:30.035 --> 00:26:32.670
<v Speaker 1>made a huge bug. This is this is

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:34.670
<v Speaker 1>not what I wanted at all. I'm gonna

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:36.670
<v Speaker 1>be able to actually shift back using that

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:38.590
<v Speaker 1>with with Waypoint, which is which is quite

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:39.070
<v Speaker 1>nice.

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:42.750
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Is there any difference between running Waypoint

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:45.070
<v Speaker 0>up and what you've done through the UI?

00:26:46.595 --> 00:26:47.315
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.

00:26:47.395 --> 00:26:49.155
<v Speaker 1>Or or in

00:26:49.475 --> 00:26:51.635
<v Speaker 1>this example with GitOps, it's kind of list

00:26:51.795 --> 00:26:55.795
<v Speaker 1>it's tracking the repository itself and then facilitating

00:26:55.795 --> 00:26:57.875
<v Speaker 1>all of those operations. So I actually didn't

00:26:57.875 --> 00:26:58.835
<v Speaker 1>need to run Waypoint up.

00:26:59.669 --> 00:27:01.110
<v Speaker 1>What what the runner is doing, what the

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:03.749
<v Speaker 1>GitOps workflow is doing is essentially running up.

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:06.870
<v Speaker 1>And and everything in the UI should map

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:09.669
<v Speaker 1>to that same type of CLI workflow for

00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:10.149
<v Speaker 1>sure.

00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:11.350
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So,

00:27:12.805 --> 00:27:14.565
<v Speaker 0>like, I'm trying to build correlations in my

00:27:14.565 --> 00:27:17.125
<v Speaker 0>head now. I wanna understand where Waypoint is.

00:27:17.125 --> 00:27:18.805
<v Speaker 0>Is can I think of it as like

00:27:18.805 --> 00:27:21.605
<v Speaker 0>GitHub actions or Jenkins? Like, is is it

00:27:21.605 --> 00:27:24.085
<v Speaker 0>a traditional build system with some extra stuff

00:27:24.085 --> 00:27:25.605
<v Speaker 0>on top or is it something else that

00:27:25.605 --> 00:27:28.870
<v Speaker 0>has the build that kinda and I know

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:30.470
<v Speaker 0>that's a weird question, but hopefully it makes

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.950
<v Speaker 0>sense.

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:33.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Absolutely.

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:35.510
<v Speaker 1>It's it so it it does encompass quite

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:36.870
<v Speaker 1>a few things, honestly.

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:40.310
<v Speaker 1>It it's it's it's

00:27:40.205 --> 00:27:41.565
<v Speaker 1>it is a little bit more general, and

00:27:41.565 --> 00:27:43.805
<v Speaker 1>I think that's that's one thing that I,

00:27:43.965 --> 00:27:46.125
<v Speaker 1>is a question I typically get asked is

00:27:46.125 --> 00:27:47.645
<v Speaker 1>that, you know, is is this just c

00:27:47.805 --> 00:27:49.965
<v Speaker 1>CICD? Is it just this thing?

00:27:50.365 --> 00:27:52.205
<v Speaker 1>Really, it's trying to tie all of the

00:27:52.205 --> 00:27:54.605
<v Speaker 1>things together when it comes to application,

00:27:54.925 --> 00:27:55.645
<v Speaker 1>deployments

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:58.220
<v Speaker 1>and and releases and versioning and builds and

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.300
<v Speaker 1>kinda, like, make it all a platform. Very

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:03.500
<v Speaker 1>it's like almost like the, the Heroku effect,

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.020
<v Speaker 1>if you will. You know, kind of you

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:07.499
<v Speaker 1>you would start with your Ruby application.

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.260
<v Speaker 1>You would push that up, and then

00:28:09.805 --> 00:28:11.565
<v Speaker 1>Heroku as a platform is able to kind

00:28:11.565 --> 00:28:14.045
<v Speaker 1>of add in all this functionality to build

00:28:14.045 --> 00:28:17.245
<v Speaker 1>your application, deploy it, handle the c CDN

00:28:17.245 --> 00:28:20.205
<v Speaker 1>steps, handle your Ruby and Rails migrations.

00:28:20.525 --> 00:28:23.085
<v Speaker 1>And, so that was very specific to Ruby

00:28:23.085 --> 00:28:25.310
<v Speaker 1>on Rails, though. And then Waypoint kind of

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:28.270
<v Speaker 1>operates that's mentally where I put it. And

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:30.270
<v Speaker 1>then Waypoint operates in this space where it's

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:31.789
<v Speaker 1>handling all of those things

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:33.710
<v Speaker 1>for you

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:35.630
<v Speaker 1>with the ability to have all these plug

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:36.350
<v Speaker 1>ins too. So

00:28:37.035 --> 00:28:39.755
<v Speaker 1>future platforms that haven't been yet released are

00:28:39.755 --> 00:28:42.235
<v Speaker 1>going you know, are are potential place that

00:28:42.235 --> 00:28:44.395
<v Speaker 1>Waypoint could operate and and people could develop

00:28:44.395 --> 00:28:46.635
<v Speaker 1>plug ins for as one example.

00:28:47.115 --> 00:28:49.515
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Thank you. We have one question in

00:28:49.515 --> 00:28:50.075
<v Speaker 0>the chat.

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:53.650
<v Speaker 0>So Raja Salan is asking, does the build

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:55.889
<v Speaker 0>run as a container on the host?

00:28:57.490 --> 00:28:58.129
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

00:28:58.450 --> 00:28:59.009
<v Speaker 1>So

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:01.009
<v Speaker 1>so what that's doing

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:03.490
<v Speaker 1>so the

00:29:04.575 --> 00:29:07.695
<v Speaker 1>right now, this so I've installed Waypoint

00:29:07.695 --> 00:29:10.014
<v Speaker 1>server and actually, let me show you.

00:29:10.654 --> 00:29:12.575
<v Speaker 1>So if I do a docker p s,

00:29:12.815 --> 00:29:14.654
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna see a few things running here.

00:29:14.654 --> 00:29:16.414
<v Speaker 1>Now I've got docker

00:29:16.495 --> 00:29:18.640
<v Speaker 1>docker desktop running, you might see a couple

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.640
<v Speaker 1>other things and and some other things from

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.679
<v Speaker 1>previous demos.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.160
<v Speaker 1>You'll see that I've got this Waypoint server

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:24.799
<v Speaker 1>running,

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.360
<v Speaker 1>which is actually handling all of the API

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.679
<v Speaker 1>requests and, like, you know, scheduling out all

00:29:29.679 --> 00:29:31.520
<v Speaker 1>of the the work that I'm I'm throwing

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.505
<v Speaker 1>at the API. And then this runner is

00:29:33.505 --> 00:29:35.905
<v Speaker 1>actually, you know, is doing all of the

00:29:35.905 --> 00:29:38.145
<v Speaker 1>work for me. So looking at these logs,

00:29:38.145 --> 00:29:40.705
<v Speaker 1>this is what's handling the builds and the

00:29:40.705 --> 00:29:41.825
<v Speaker 1>pushes. So,

00:29:42.465 --> 00:29:44.225
<v Speaker 1>that's that's where all this work is happening

00:29:44.225 --> 00:29:46.465
<v Speaker 1>from a compute standpoint, and then all of

00:29:46.465 --> 00:29:48.145
<v Speaker 1>this is is on my machine right now.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.320
<v Speaker 1>But later, when I install this to Kubernetes

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.999
<v Speaker 1>and and that platform,

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.080
<v Speaker 1>that's where all of those things are going

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:57.559
<v Speaker 1>to be executed with the with some exceptions,

00:29:57.559 --> 00:29:59.080
<v Speaker 1>and I can talk about that once we

00:29:59.080 --> 00:29:59.720
<v Speaker 1>get to that too.

00:30:01.005 --> 00:30:03.645
<v Speaker 0>Okay. And there's a a follow-up there. So

00:30:03.645 --> 00:30:06.925
<v Speaker 0>holy cow. Is this, your personal CICD with

00:30:06.925 --> 00:30:09.645
<v Speaker 0>a DSL for multi cloud app deployment?

00:30:11.005 --> 00:30:14.285
<v Speaker 1>Exactly. Exactly. So if you if you do

00:30:14.285 --> 00:30:16.390
<v Speaker 1>want to kind of fix that, you know,

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:17.910
<v Speaker 1>you you build it. You should only have

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:19.510
<v Speaker 1>to do that once. You know? If there

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:21.750
<v Speaker 1>are different platforms or architectures that you wanna

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:23.590
<v Speaker 1>build for, of course, you you you have

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:26.230
<v Speaker 1>to handle those. But, you know, it's it's

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:28.150
<v Speaker 1>nice to have that ability to swap out,

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:30.575
<v Speaker 1>say, I don't want to deploy to AWS.

00:30:30.575 --> 00:30:32.494
<v Speaker 1>I want to deploy to GCP,

00:30:32.495 --> 00:30:34.174
<v Speaker 1>and I want to use Google Cloud Run

00:30:34.174 --> 00:30:36.815
<v Speaker 1>instead of Lambda or something like that. It's

00:30:36.894 --> 00:30:39.294
<v Speaker 1>it makes for stubbing out that functionality

00:30:39.934 --> 00:30:41.294
<v Speaker 1>quite easier.

00:30:41.934 --> 00:30:42.894
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Thank you.

00:30:44.669 --> 00:30:45.389
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:48.750
<v Speaker 1>So we can see v two. Everything is

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:51.710
<v Speaker 1>better with v two. We that got kicked

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:53.789
<v Speaker 1>off, and this did fail because I didn't

00:30:53.789 --> 00:30:54.989
<v Speaker 1>have the right credentials.

00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:58.545
<v Speaker 1>Something that's nice was added in Waypoint zero

00:30:58.545 --> 00:31:01.425
<v Speaker 1>five were these we we had statuses and

00:31:01.425 --> 00:31:02.865
<v Speaker 1>reports, but they were just kind of like

00:31:02.865 --> 00:31:04.945
<v Speaker 1>a, you know, didn't work, did work kind

00:31:04.945 --> 00:31:07.024
<v Speaker 1>of UI, UX representation.

00:31:07.345 --> 00:31:08.785
<v Speaker 1>And now we can actually start to hover

00:31:08.785 --> 00:31:10.065
<v Speaker 1>over these things and get a little bit

00:31:10.065 --> 00:31:12.065
<v Speaker 1>more context as to what didn't work. So,

00:31:12.679 --> 00:31:15.000
<v Speaker 1>yeah, if something doesn't work, Waypoint's

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.600
<v Speaker 1>going to do everything it can to let

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:17.960
<v Speaker 1>you know why that that

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.520
<v Speaker 1>you know, what happened there as well. So

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:22.440
<v Speaker 1>we can see this failed and and we

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:23.080
<v Speaker 1>know why.

00:31:23.559 --> 00:31:25.240
<v Speaker 1>Of course, you realize the reason why as

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.335
<v Speaker 1>soon as you push the button or initiated

00:31:27.335 --> 00:31:29.255
<v Speaker 1>the operation. I think that's how that magical

00:31:29.255 --> 00:31:31.095
<v Speaker 1>law works, but yeah.

00:31:31.415 --> 00:31:32.775
<v Speaker 1>Let me know if I got something wrong

00:31:32.775 --> 00:31:33.335
<v Speaker 1>there.

00:31:34.695 --> 00:31:37.095
<v Speaker 1>Awesome. So this is going to push up

00:31:37.095 --> 00:31:38.535
<v Speaker 1>to ECR

00:31:38.535 --> 00:31:40.135
<v Speaker 1>and then we're actually gonna start to see

00:31:40.135 --> 00:31:40.775
<v Speaker 1>some things happen.

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Now once

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:45.930
<v Speaker 1>these items have been pushed, what's nice about

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Waypoint is that it has a service called

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Horizon.

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:50.730
<v Speaker 1>And what Horizon is is kind of like

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:53.610
<v Speaker 1>if you've ever used something like ngrok and,

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:56.825
<v Speaker 1>like, a reverse proxy to show your deployments

00:31:56.825 --> 00:31:58.505
<v Speaker 1>and your applications to people.

00:31:58.905 --> 00:32:02.025
<v Speaker 1>That's similar to how Waypoint operates. Now because

00:32:02.025 --> 00:32:04.265
<v Speaker 1>I'm on my local machine, I don't have

00:32:04.265 --> 00:32:05.385
<v Speaker 1>that functionality

00:32:05.705 --> 00:32:06.905
<v Speaker 1>with with

00:32:07.385 --> 00:32:09.240
<v Speaker 1>this kind of deployment. It's not going to

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:12.040
<v Speaker 1>share publicly my my machine or those ports,

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.640
<v Speaker 1>which is like like, thank goodness, you know,

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.240
<v Speaker 1>that that would be quite a bit of

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.320
<v Speaker 1>trouble, especially for people that don't know that

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:18.600
<v Speaker 1>something like that could happen.

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.840
<v Speaker 1>So when you deploy to a public

00:32:21.955 --> 00:32:25.235
<v Speaker 1>platform though, that's when and it's publicly routable,

00:32:25.235 --> 00:32:27.475
<v Speaker 1>then you get that feature add and that

00:32:27.475 --> 00:32:28.275
<v Speaker 1>capability.

00:32:29.635 --> 00:32:32.035
<v Speaker 1>So once this actually gets pushed up and

00:32:32.035 --> 00:32:34.995
<v Speaker 1>deployed onto Lambda, we're gonna see a release

00:32:34.995 --> 00:32:35.875
<v Speaker 1>URL

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:37.700
<v Speaker 1>and we'll actually be able to, see our

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.340
<v Speaker 1>deployment URLs too. Because this is Lambda, there's

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:42.019
<v Speaker 1>no way to wrap to that without having

00:32:42.019 --> 00:32:44.500
<v Speaker 1>that ALB and, like, setting up many ALBs.

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:45.700
<v Speaker 1>So there is just the one,

00:32:46.179 --> 00:32:48.115
<v Speaker 1>which is handled in this release step, but

00:32:48.115 --> 00:32:49.875
<v Speaker 1>we will see all those deployments, but they

00:32:49.875 --> 00:32:51.875
<v Speaker 1>won't have those, like, if we click this

00:32:51.875 --> 00:32:53.635
<v Speaker 1>link, it's not, it it's not gonna go

00:32:53.635 --> 00:32:54.354
<v Speaker 1>anywhere,

00:32:54.515 --> 00:32:55.315
<v Speaker 1>currently.

00:32:56.275 --> 00:32:57.554
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Got it.

00:32:59.475 --> 00:33:01.875
<v Speaker 1>Cool. So we have our deployment. We can

00:33:01.875 --> 00:33:03.554
<v Speaker 1>see our status is unknown because it just

00:33:03.554 --> 00:33:06.009
<v Speaker 1>takes some time to evaluate that status.

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:08.649
<v Speaker 1>And then finally, once that's released,

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:10.489
<v Speaker 1>we can actually click on that.

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:12.570
<v Speaker 1>I I have noticed that there are some

00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:14.570
<v Speaker 1>cold starts with this too, so it might

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:16.570
<v Speaker 1>take just a second to actually get traffic

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:19.514
<v Speaker 1>loaded in there, but no no stranger to

00:33:19.514 --> 00:33:21.995
<v Speaker 1>that kind of of outcome or operation. Available.

00:33:21.995 --> 00:33:22.794
<v Speaker 0>There you go.

00:33:23.355 --> 00:33:25.674
<v Speaker 1>Like, yes. Okay. Here we go. Here we

00:33:26.235 --> 00:33:28.794
<v Speaker 1>drum roll, please. Yes. Okay. So, yeah, it's

00:33:28.794 --> 00:33:29.995
<v Speaker 1>gonna take a second to load up.

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.480
<v Speaker 1>And then let me double check what that

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.520
<v Speaker 1>URL parameter is here. I think it's name,

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.600
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not mistaken. Yeah. Name.

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:43.325
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Cool. So Okay. So just to make

00:33:43.325 --> 00:33:45.165
<v Speaker 0>sure I understand everything that has actually happened

00:33:45.165 --> 00:33:46.925
<v Speaker 0>here, maybe we could look at the HCL

00:33:46.925 --> 00:33:48.284
<v Speaker 0>as we run through this.

00:33:49.325 --> 00:33:51.085
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely. But this

00:33:51.565 --> 00:33:55.005
<v Speaker 0>from this Waypoint HCL file, we've described our

00:33:55.005 --> 00:33:57.485
<v Speaker 0>application which has a build step which uses

00:33:57.485 --> 00:33:59.560
<v Speaker 0>a Docker file and pushes to to ECR

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:00.760
<v Speaker 0>Container Registry.

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.720
<v Speaker 0>Once the build stage is happy and passed,

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.480
<v Speaker 0>it moves on to the next phase, which

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.560
<v Speaker 0>is the deployment stage where it's actually going

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:10.040
<v Speaker 0>to create a Lambda function that uses our

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:10.600
<v Speaker 0>Dockerfile,

00:34:11.364 --> 00:34:13.605
<v Speaker 0>And then there's a final phase of release

00:34:13.605 --> 00:34:15.765
<v Speaker 0>where it's going to connect the application load

00:34:15.765 --> 00:34:18.085
<v Speaker 0>balancer to the Lambda function exposing it to

00:34:18.085 --> 00:34:18.885
<v Speaker 0>the Internet.

00:34:19.844 --> 00:34:21.205
<v Speaker 1>Exactly. Correct.

00:34:21.445 --> 00:34:22.805
<v Speaker 0>Phew. Okay.

00:34:23.045 --> 00:34:23.525
<v Speaker 0>Very cool.

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:27.590
<v Speaker 0>And I guess I mean, I can add

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:29.830
<v Speaker 0>as many use steps to each of those

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:32.310
<v Speaker 0>phases as I need to describe my application.

00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:33.190
<v Speaker 0>Is that correct?

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Exactly. Exactly.

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:38.310
<v Speaker 1>What's nice is the the ability for all

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:39.910
<v Speaker 1>of those plugins. So I'll go over here

00:34:39.910 --> 00:34:42.385
<v Speaker 1>to the the documentation,

00:34:42.464 --> 00:34:43.824
<v Speaker 1>and we can see that there are quite

00:34:43.984 --> 00:34:45.425
<v Speaker 0>Could you zoom in on that? Yes.

00:34:45.824 --> 00:34:46.864
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.

00:34:49.184 --> 00:34:52.464
<v Speaker 1>That should be good. So here in Lambda,

00:34:52.464 --> 00:34:54.385
<v Speaker 1>we can see all of the items that

00:34:54.385 --> 00:34:57.025
<v Speaker 1>are supported, all of those different flags or

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.400
<v Speaker 1>options that we have available to us. So

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.240
<v Speaker 1>if we wanted to, say, change that tag

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.640
<v Speaker 1>from latest to actually getting the git reference,

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.000
<v Speaker 1>we we could go ahead and do that

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:05.480
<v Speaker 1>here.

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.240
<v Speaker 1>And then if you wanted to take a

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:07.720
<v Speaker 1>look at, like,

00:35:09.414 --> 00:35:11.174
<v Speaker 1>the the l b, that's think that's this

00:35:11.174 --> 00:35:12.694
<v Speaker 1>is part of core right now, so so

00:35:12.694 --> 00:35:14.535
<v Speaker 1>we don't have that documented. But

00:35:14.934 --> 00:35:18.055
<v Speaker 1>but Lambda, Kubernetes, other things like that are

00:35:18.055 --> 00:35:18.855
<v Speaker 1>referenced,

00:35:18.855 --> 00:35:21.974
<v Speaker 1>and then all of there's different context too

00:35:21.974 --> 00:35:24.050
<v Speaker 1>if you wanted to say say you wanted

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:26.450
<v Speaker 1>to not for Lambda, but for other examples,

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:28.850
<v Speaker 1>you wanted to just use local support for

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:31.010
<v Speaker 1>your image because, you know, if you're running

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:33.170
<v Speaker 1>your Waypoint server on your machine,

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:35.250
<v Speaker 1>it might not make sense to actually push

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:37.810
<v Speaker 1>your image to, Docker Hub or any kind

00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:40.535
<v Speaker 1>of container registry. Right? You might just wanna

00:35:40.535 --> 00:35:42.775
<v Speaker 1>be you wanna test something or, oh, no.

00:35:42.775 --> 00:35:44.295
<v Speaker 1>I'm operating in stealth mode. I don't want

00:35:44.295 --> 00:35:45.974
<v Speaker 1>I don't want my people to know about

00:35:45.974 --> 00:35:46.775
<v Speaker 1>my secrets.

00:35:47.015 --> 00:35:49.095
<v Speaker 1>You you you do have that capability. Support

00:35:49.095 --> 00:35:49.895
<v Speaker 0>too, I've seen there?

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:53.270
<v Speaker 1>Yes. Yes. Yeah. I'm a big fan of

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:54.710
<v Speaker 0>build kit, so that's awesome.

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:58.950
<v Speaker 1>It's it's it's quite nice. I I'm excited

00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:01.030
<v Speaker 1>to see some more work done around,

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:03.750
<v Speaker 1>like, Docker less builds and and things like

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:04.470
<v Speaker 1>that. There's some

00:36:05.905 --> 00:36:07.585
<v Speaker 1>well, the team, you know, we just put

00:36:07.585 --> 00:36:09.665
<v Speaker 1>out zero dot five, but already talking about

00:36:09.665 --> 00:36:11.985
<v Speaker 1>zero six and some features on that front.

00:36:12.305 --> 00:36:13.424
<v Speaker 1>If you do wanna take a look at

00:36:13.424 --> 00:36:14.305
<v Speaker 1>the milestone,

00:36:14.704 --> 00:36:17.589
<v Speaker 1>as as things get identified for work for

00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:19.990
<v Speaker 1>zero six and some other, you know, minor

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:21.350
<v Speaker 1>releases, things like that.

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:25.190
<v Speaker 1>Definitely worth worth checking out on on GitHub

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:26.950
<v Speaker 1>to see what is what what the team

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:28.470
<v Speaker 1>is starting to plan and think on on

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:29.510
<v Speaker 1>that front. It's

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:31.670
<v Speaker 1>the more that can be done there, the

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:33.665
<v Speaker 1>more that we can kind help enable these

00:36:34.145 --> 00:36:36.785
<v Speaker 1>non root type type containers, I think is

00:36:36.785 --> 00:36:38.545
<v Speaker 1>always React to root all the things. What's

00:36:38.545 --> 00:36:40.145
<v Speaker 0>the what's the problem? What's the worst that

00:36:40.145 --> 00:36:41.185
<v Speaker 0>could happen? Right?

00:36:42.225 --> 00:36:44.065
<v Speaker 0>Is it easy? I mean, I don't want

00:36:44.065 --> 00:36:45.440
<v Speaker 0>to say easy as a terrible choice of

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.039
<v Speaker 0>word, but I mean, can anyone write a

00:36:47.039 --> 00:36:48.400
<v Speaker 0>plug in like if they were to kinda

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.320
<v Speaker 0>sit down and spend a bit of time?

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:52.880
<v Speaker 0>It's not terribly complex, I hope.

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:54.400
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely. It's and more than welcome to. If

00:36:56.865 --> 00:36:58.705
<v Speaker 1>if that's something that you you're you're really

00:36:58.705 --> 00:36:59.745
<v Speaker 1>keen on doing,

00:37:00.065 --> 00:37:01.345
<v Speaker 1>please feel free to reach out on that

00:37:01.345 --> 00:37:03.345
<v Speaker 1>front too. I I haven't built one yet.

00:37:03.345 --> 00:37:05.025
<v Speaker 1>I I I'm looking to do so soon,

00:37:05.265 --> 00:37:07.425
<v Speaker 1>as well as, like, use feature flags and

00:37:07.425 --> 00:37:08.465
<v Speaker 1>there's like,

00:37:09.339 --> 00:37:11.579
<v Speaker 1>it's it's unfortunate. We only have, you know,

00:37:11.579 --> 00:37:13.099
<v Speaker 1>the time that we do today to to

00:37:13.099 --> 00:37:15.339
<v Speaker 1>to chat. You know? But, otherwise, I go

00:37:15.339 --> 00:37:17.660
<v Speaker 1>into so many features, but happy to happy

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:19.099
<v Speaker 1>to do that offline, happy to do that

00:37:19.099 --> 00:37:21.099
<v Speaker 1>on Twitter or email or whatever to jump

00:37:21.099 --> 00:37:21.980
<v Speaker 1>on a Zoom call. But

00:37:22.815 --> 00:37:25.455
<v Speaker 1>there there is things like dynamic configs and

00:37:25.455 --> 00:37:28.575
<v Speaker 1>using configuration maps or secrets in Kubernetes.

00:37:28.575 --> 00:37:31.055
<v Speaker 1>And, you know, if that changes your reload

00:37:31.055 --> 00:37:31.935
<v Speaker 1>your application,

00:37:32.255 --> 00:37:33.295
<v Speaker 1>live reload it.

00:37:33.935 --> 00:37:36.095
<v Speaker 1>There integrate with Vault so that you don't

00:37:36.095 --> 00:37:37.695
<v Speaker 1>have to pull those credentials from

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.280
<v Speaker 1>one source or another, you know, make it

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.880
<v Speaker 1>a one time password. There's

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:45.160
<v Speaker 1>there's even though this project is still relatively,

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:47.240
<v Speaker 1>you know, new, it's there's so many things

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:48.440
<v Speaker 1>that that are

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:50.920
<v Speaker 1>in it's just chock full of features and

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:52.840
<v Speaker 1>enables quite quite a many

00:37:53.994 --> 00:37:55.275
<v Speaker 1>So

00:37:55.275 --> 00:37:57.755
<v Speaker 1>we do see our application is running and

00:37:57.755 --> 00:37:58.475
<v Speaker 1>working.

00:37:58.875 --> 00:38:00.395
<v Speaker 1>In the interest of time, I'll I'll I'll

00:38:00.395 --> 00:38:02.795
<v Speaker 1>spare you, some some changes and things like

00:38:02.795 --> 00:38:04.635
<v Speaker 1>that, but, just because I forgot that first

00:38:04.635 --> 00:38:07.540
<v Speaker 1>step. But, but if I wanted to change

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:08.420
<v Speaker 1>this to,

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:10.740
<v Speaker 1>you know, change this to Friday, I I

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:12.180
<v Speaker 1>could go ahead and do that, push that,

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:14.580
<v Speaker 1>and then Waypoint's gonna go ahead and

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:16.980
<v Speaker 1>if I choose the right browser tab.

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:19.300
<v Speaker 1>Waypoint's gonna go ahead and load that in,

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.685
<v Speaker 1>show that build, show that deployment, and then

00:38:21.685 --> 00:38:23.285
<v Speaker 1>go ahead and release it.

00:38:23.925 --> 00:38:25.685
<v Speaker 1>Really, really fantastic.

00:38:25.685 --> 00:38:27.365
<v Speaker 1>The more that gets added to this, I'm

00:38:27.365 --> 00:38:29.285
<v Speaker 1>I'm I'm really excited to see it start

00:38:29.285 --> 00:38:31.685
<v Speaker 1>to kind of evolve to match some features

00:38:31.685 --> 00:38:34.980
<v Speaker 1>within and Argo and make it easier for

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:37.140
<v Speaker 1>for people to actually load these things up.

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:39.780
<v Speaker 0>Is it possible to have gated releases,

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.180
<v Speaker 0>like, that require manual approval

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:43.060
<v Speaker 0>of some way?

00:38:44.355 --> 00:38:46.035
<v Speaker 1>I I've been asked that question a few

00:38:46.035 --> 00:38:48.355
<v Speaker 1>times. I'd there there is.

00:38:48.755 --> 00:38:50.275
<v Speaker 1>One way to do it is you could

00:38:50.275 --> 00:38:52.835
<v Speaker 1>use GitHub actions, for example, and then use

00:38:52.835 --> 00:38:54.515
<v Speaker 1>those gates on whether it be a quality

00:38:54.515 --> 00:38:56.355
<v Speaker 1>gate, whether it be a manual gate, and

00:38:56.355 --> 00:38:58.994
<v Speaker 1>then you could actually so so Waypoint has

00:38:58.994 --> 00:38:59.795
<v Speaker 1>the

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:01.740
<v Speaker 1>help.

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:04.860
<v Speaker 1>So Waypoint has all of these different actions

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:07.500
<v Speaker 1>that you can run. Build, release, and deploy

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:10.060
<v Speaker 1>can be run separately. So if you wanted

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:11.660
<v Speaker 1>to say build it and then like hold

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:13.625
<v Speaker 1>off, let's let me, you know, I wanna

00:39:13.625 --> 00:39:15.464
<v Speaker 1>make sure this this check sum is okay

00:39:15.464 --> 00:39:17.224
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it might be. You could actually

00:39:17.224 --> 00:39:18.425
<v Speaker 1>run those atomically

00:39:18.425 --> 00:39:20.425
<v Speaker 1>rather than just running up. Up is just

00:39:20.425 --> 00:39:21.225
<v Speaker 1>kind of like

00:39:21.865 --> 00:39:22.984
<v Speaker 1>the the

00:39:23.224 --> 00:39:24.905
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember what it was in Ruby,

00:39:24.905 --> 00:39:26.345
<v Speaker 1>but I'll remember it someday.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.840
<v Speaker 1>The the was it, like, d b seed

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:30.640
<v Speaker 1>migrate,

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:31.840
<v Speaker 1>all of those things? There was a command

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.360
<v Speaker 1>that you could just, like, do everything, and

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:36.000
<v Speaker 1>it it works, like, 5% of the time.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.680
<v Speaker 1>But if it did, that was really nice.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.640
<v Speaker 1>But, yeah, you you do have those options

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.080
<v Speaker 1>available to you. And then that's the way

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.655
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it done so far is whether

00:39:43.655 --> 00:39:44.615
<v Speaker 1>it be whatever

00:39:45.415 --> 00:39:47.974
<v Speaker 1>CI platform that you have, you could separate

00:39:47.974 --> 00:39:50.535
<v Speaker 1>that if you want it. Okay. Thanks.

00:39:51.974 --> 00:39:52.855
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.

00:39:53.734 --> 00:39:54.615
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.

00:39:54.935 --> 00:39:57.494
<v Speaker 1>Well, that is our first demo. That is

00:39:57.494 --> 00:40:00.710
<v Speaker 1>GitOps and quite straightforward to use. I never

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:03.270
<v Speaker 1>use the word easy because easy is is

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:05.110
<v Speaker 1>is never easy. Let's just be fair.

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:06.550
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:08.869
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna go ahead and take a look.

00:40:08.869 --> 00:40:11.535
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I've got some good news. Our EKS

00:40:11.535 --> 00:40:14.335
<v Speaker 1>cluster has been set up successfully,

00:40:14.895 --> 00:40:16.734
<v Speaker 1>and looks like that is ready to go.

00:40:16.734 --> 00:40:19.535
<v Speaker 1>So let's let's get let's

00:40:19.535 --> 00:40:20.975
<v Speaker 1>get dangerous here.

00:40:22.015 --> 00:40:22.735
<v Speaker 1>So

00:40:23.295 --> 00:40:24.655
<v Speaker 1>we unfortunately,

00:40:24.655 --> 00:40:28.289
<v Speaker 1>listing my file system might contain some spoilers,

00:40:28.289 --> 00:40:31.490
<v Speaker 1>but Yep. Let's go ahead and move into

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:33.250
<v Speaker 1>the kube control

00:40:33.569 --> 00:40:34.369
<v Speaker 1>demo,

00:40:34.369 --> 00:40:36.609
<v Speaker 1>and let's let's talk about what that is.

00:40:36.609 --> 00:40:37.089
<v Speaker 1>So

00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:39.250
<v Speaker 1>in zero four,

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:41.410
<v Speaker 1>we got this capability for so

00:40:42.105 --> 00:40:44.345
<v Speaker 1>let me step back for a second. Waypoint

00:40:44.345 --> 00:40:47.225
<v Speaker 1>contains the ability to deploy to Kubernetes.

00:40:47.225 --> 00:40:49.545
<v Speaker 1>But let's say, you know, HCL is nice

00:40:49.545 --> 00:40:51.065
<v Speaker 1>and all. It's pretty straightforward,

00:40:51.145 --> 00:40:51.545
<v Speaker 1>but

00:40:52.105 --> 00:40:53.145
<v Speaker 1>let's let's

00:40:53.465 --> 00:40:55.530
<v Speaker 1>you know, what if we have some

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:58.730
<v Speaker 1>deployment YAML that we have instead. Right?

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:01.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't wanna have to rewrite all my

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:03.690
<v Speaker 1>code. That doesn't make sense. Right? Let's

00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:06.170
<v Speaker 1>the goal is to meet people where they're

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:08.090
<v Speaker 1>at when it comes to making these these

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:11.345
<v Speaker 1>processes easier. Right? That's the hope hopefully, the

00:41:11.345 --> 00:41:11.825
<v Speaker 1>goal.

00:41:12.385 --> 00:41:15.825
<v Speaker 1>So in this example, I've got a pretty

00:41:15.825 --> 00:41:17.825
<v Speaker 1>pretty straightforward, pretty simple

00:41:20.145 --> 00:41:21.905
<v Speaker 1>deployment here, and then I'm gonna go ahead

00:41:21.905 --> 00:41:23.425
<v Speaker 1>and be building

00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:26.620
<v Speaker 1>this this Python application. So you can see

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:28.460
<v Speaker 1>we've got a requirements text here.

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:31.580
<v Speaker 1>Other fun thing about this is that or

00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:32.940
<v Speaker 1>or no. This one's not gonna use,

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:35.740
<v Speaker 1>Cloud Native Buildpacks. I I I don't have

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:37.875
<v Speaker 1>any demos for that today, but we get

00:41:37.875 --> 00:41:38.595
<v Speaker 1>to see

00:41:38.995 --> 00:41:41.155
<v Speaker 1>a Dockerfile with a little bit more to

00:41:41.155 --> 00:41:43.635
<v Speaker 1>it, and and then we can kinda walk

00:41:43.635 --> 00:41:44.915
<v Speaker 1>through that Waypoint

00:41:45.555 --> 00:41:47.315
<v Speaker 1>deploy really quick too.

00:41:48.115 --> 00:41:48.755
<v Speaker 1>Let me go ahead.

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:51.089
<v Speaker 1>At some points in time, I I I

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:52.690
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking with the teams about, like,

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:53.970
<v Speaker 1>HCL colorization,

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:56.609
<v Speaker 1>tokenization, and support. Right now, we do have

00:41:58.049 --> 00:41:58.690
<v Speaker 1>oops.

00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:02.609
<v Speaker 1>Here's my Terraform. We do have Terraform, obviously.

00:42:02.964 --> 00:42:05.605
<v Speaker 1>But when it comes to creating something for

00:42:05.605 --> 00:42:07.045
<v Speaker 1>HCL, I know there are couple of Versus

00:42:07.045 --> 00:42:09.365
<v Speaker 1>Code plug ins for that. But when it

00:42:09.365 --> 00:42:11.845
<v Speaker 1>comes to visualizing things, I think the intent

00:42:11.845 --> 00:42:14.244
<v Speaker 1>is to want to provide a nice Terraform

00:42:14.244 --> 00:42:16.500
<v Speaker 1>experience, a nice Waypoint experience, and kind of,

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.020
<v Speaker 1>like, make that customization,

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:20.980
<v Speaker 1>something that's a little bit better within Versus

00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:22.660
<v Speaker 1>Code. So if you have any ideas on

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:24.260
<v Speaker 1>that front, please please feel free to forward

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:25.220
<v Speaker 1>them, and I'll get them to the right

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:27.380
<v Speaker 1>team members. But, that's something that's one of

00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:29.994
<v Speaker 1>my personal selfish wants is is this ability

00:42:29.994 --> 00:42:32.155
<v Speaker 1>to kind of have this nice, like, tokenization

00:42:32.155 --> 00:42:33.994
<v Speaker 1>of Waypoints and and things like that. Right

00:42:33.994 --> 00:42:36.475
<v Speaker 1>now, I'm just changing my language for Kubernetes,

00:42:36.475 --> 00:42:38.555
<v Speaker 1>but fingers crossed, we can we can make

00:42:38.555 --> 00:42:39.275
<v Speaker 1>this happen.

00:42:40.955 --> 00:42:41.755
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.

00:42:41.835 --> 00:42:42.715
<v Speaker 1>So

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:45.690
<v Speaker 1>this so let's walk through this this this

00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:47.690
<v Speaker 1>demo. So Kubernetes apply.

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Like I said, we have this Kubernetes support,

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:51.610
<v Speaker 1>but what if we want to use YAML?

00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:54.570
<v Speaker 1>Waypoint zero four releases capability so that we

00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:58.385
<v Speaker 1>can actually perform these kube control apply types

00:42:58.385 --> 00:42:59.345
<v Speaker 1>of operations.

00:42:59.585 --> 00:43:01.825
<v Speaker 1>So in this in these examples, we won't

00:43:01.825 --> 00:43:04.625
<v Speaker 1>actually see that release because we won't have

00:43:04.625 --> 00:43:06.785
<v Speaker 1>an artifact to to to look at or

00:43:06.785 --> 00:43:08.545
<v Speaker 1>or to gain, but we will see that

00:43:08.545 --> 00:43:09.265
<v Speaker 1>final deployment.

00:43:10.029 --> 00:43:11.869
<v Speaker 1>So let's go ahead and and do that.

00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Here,

00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:15.069
<v Speaker 1>I've I've specified some labels that I want

00:43:15.069 --> 00:43:17.390
<v Speaker 1>to add to our deployment.

00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:19.710
<v Speaker 0>So that's just an arbitrary assignment. Right? You're

00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:21.470
<v Speaker 0>you're just making up that name labels. That's

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:23.630
<v Speaker 0>nothing special in the ACL. Okay.

00:43:24.645 --> 00:43:26.965
<v Speaker 1>Exactly. Yeah. This this this is a callout

00:43:26.965 --> 00:43:29.125
<v Speaker 1>for the application stanza,

00:43:29.125 --> 00:43:31.285
<v Speaker 1>but but like the service environment, all of

00:43:31.285 --> 00:43:33.685
<v Speaker 1>these are are completely subjective. Yeah. We could

00:43:34.325 --> 00:43:35.765
<v Speaker 1>alright. Shh. Don't tell anyone. We're just gonna

00:43:35.765 --> 00:43:37.205
<v Speaker 1>we're just gonna push this live. Could you

00:43:37.205 --> 00:43:39.765
<v Speaker 0>change labels to just tailor? Could you call

00:43:39.765 --> 00:43:40.325
<v Speaker 0>it tailors?

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:43.940
<v Speaker 1>This this one is within

00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:45.220
<v Speaker 1>the Waypoint's

00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:47.460
<v Speaker 1>name spacing. Alright. Okay. So this this will

00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:49.780
<v Speaker 1>actually track to to the labels object. But

00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:51.620
<v Speaker 1>but, yeah, these these here are are the

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:53.300
<v Speaker 1>ones that are a little bit more subjective

00:43:54.765 --> 00:43:56.205
<v Speaker 1>or nonspecific.

00:43:57.405 --> 00:43:59.724
<v Speaker 1>In this build stanza, we're also gonna use

00:43:59.724 --> 00:44:00.445
<v Speaker 1>Docker,

00:44:00.765 --> 00:44:02.285
<v Speaker 1>and then we're going to be pushing this

00:44:02.285 --> 00:44:03.724
<v Speaker 1>to my repository.

00:44:03.724 --> 00:44:05.484
<v Speaker 1>This is going to use Docker Hub. And,

00:44:05.484 --> 00:44:05.885
<v Speaker 1>again,

00:44:06.525 --> 00:44:07.964
<v Speaker 1>don't use latest if you can help it

00:44:07.964 --> 00:44:09.565
<v Speaker 1>for for this demo. This should this should

00:44:09.565 --> 00:44:09.885
<v Speaker 1>be okay.

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:14.100
<v Speaker 1>And then inside of this deploy stanza, you'll

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:15.460
<v Speaker 1>see I've kind of flushed this out with

00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:17.300
<v Speaker 1>a little bit more information.

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:19.780
<v Speaker 1>What this is doing is it's taking a

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:21.780
<v Speaker 1>look at the path, and and Waypoint does

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:24.260
<v Speaker 1>have its own functions just like Terraform, just

00:44:23.775 --> 00:44:25.454
<v Speaker 1>like other other instantiations

00:44:25.454 --> 00:44:27.375
<v Speaker 1>of HCL across our products.

00:44:27.615 --> 00:44:29.694
<v Speaker 1>So you so we're gonna be taking a

00:44:29.694 --> 00:44:30.815
<v Speaker 1>look at this path,

00:44:31.135 --> 00:44:33.055
<v Speaker 1>looking in the Kubernetes folder,

00:44:33.214 --> 00:44:36.414
<v Speaker 1>and then anything with the Kubernetes apply label

00:44:36.414 --> 00:44:38.850
<v Speaker 1>is what is going to be used. So

00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:40.850
<v Speaker 1>we could have a a whole bunch of

00:44:40.850 --> 00:44:41.570
<v Speaker 1>YAML,

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:44.610
<v Speaker 1>but only specify, you know, the exact pieces

00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:46.130
<v Speaker 1>that we want to pick out.

00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:48.770
<v Speaker 1>Alright. I'll go ahead and save this.

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:52.690
<v Speaker 1>Let's go ahead. So we've worked with Waypoint

00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:55.255
<v Speaker 1>locally. Let's let's to the cloud. Let's let's

00:44:55.255 --> 00:44:56.215
<v Speaker 1>go to the cloud.

00:44:57.095 --> 00:44:58.695
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna go ahead and do

00:44:58.935 --> 00:45:02.135
<v Speaker 1>let's let me update my cube config.

00:45:02.535 --> 00:45:05.735
<v Speaker 1>We're using that EKS in action repository,

00:45:06.055 --> 00:45:07.415
<v Speaker 1>so I should be able to.

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:10.040
<v Speaker 1>I also do use shorthand. So if you

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.880
<v Speaker 1>do say see me just typing the letter

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:14.840
<v Speaker 1>k, that it's completely intentional. I've aliased it

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.120
<v Speaker 1>to kube control.

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.240
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes, if you haven't used it, has shorthand

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:21.720
<v Speaker 1>as well. So I could write this, which

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:23.765
<v Speaker 1>is so much typing. Right? It's like a

00:45:23.765 --> 00:45:25.204
<v Speaker 1>full sentence. So

00:45:26.005 --> 00:45:28.085
<v Speaker 1>I or I could just do this,

00:45:28.404 --> 00:45:31.525
<v Speaker 1>which, you know, looks looks kinda like standoffish.

00:45:31.525 --> 00:45:33.684
<v Speaker 1>No. You know, the word no. But it

00:45:33.684 --> 00:45:35.430
<v Speaker 1>gives us the same results. So

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:37.349
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you I've got nothing up my

00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:39.270
<v Speaker 1>sleeves. I'll get the pods, and we'll see

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:42.310
<v Speaker 1>that we've got nothing in our default namespace.

00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:45.910
<v Speaker 1>How the heck do we get Waypoint installed

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:47.109
<v Speaker 1>on Kubernetes?

00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:48.950
<v Speaker 1>Well, it's pretty simple.

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:51.185
<v Speaker 1>That's straightforward. Let's

00:45:51.185 --> 00:45:52.945
<v Speaker 1>let's go ahead and install that here.

00:45:53.665 --> 00:45:56.545
<v Speaker 1>We just specify that we that's that's that's

00:45:56.545 --> 00:45:58.145
<v Speaker 1>all. We just switch out the platform. It's

00:45:58.145 --> 00:45:58.865
<v Speaker 1>that easy.

00:45:59.745 --> 00:46:02.225
<v Speaker 0>Where's the complicated find the helm chart, rate

00:46:02.225 --> 00:46:05.025
<v Speaker 0>the values, fail, run the template, run the

00:46:05.025 --> 00:46:05.825
<v Speaker 0>apply?

00:46:05.825 --> 00:46:07.640
<v Speaker 0>You're just you're just doing it in a

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:08.680
<v Speaker 0>same way. No

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:12.840
<v Speaker 1>regular expressions. No go template string templates. I'm

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:15.080
<v Speaker 1>really sorry if it's if if that's something

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:17.080
<v Speaker 1>that you're passionate about. That's you you won't

00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:17.800
<v Speaker 1>find it here today.

00:46:21.065 --> 00:46:22.825
<v Speaker 1>Awesome. So Nice. I do I'm starting to

00:46:22.825 --> 00:46:24.904
<v Speaker 0>appreciate these these helpers a lot more that

00:46:24.904 --> 00:46:26.585
<v Speaker 0>we're seeing from commands. I know Stellium does

00:46:26.585 --> 00:46:28.345
<v Speaker 0>this. Waypoint's doing it. We're seeing it more

00:46:28.345 --> 00:46:29.385
<v Speaker 0>and more, and it's

00:46:29.625 --> 00:46:31.944
<v Speaker 0>yeah. I'm all helmed out, I've gotta say.

00:46:31.944 --> 00:46:32.184
<v Speaker 0>So

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:35.530
<v Speaker 1>Exactly. It's it's it's well, you know, well

00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:37.530
<v Speaker 1>well stated, well charted.

00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:38.010
<v Speaker 1>I'd

00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:40.650
<v Speaker 1>it's it's I I I really like Helm.

00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:42.730
<v Speaker 1>I like it in terms of package manager

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:44.410
<v Speaker 1>and being able to have all these options

00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:46.010
<v Speaker 1>and that declarativeness

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:47.930
<v Speaker 1>when setting everything. I'm a huge fan of

00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:50.865
<v Speaker 1>the project though When it's using it is

00:46:50.865 --> 00:46:52.865
<v Speaker 1>fantastic, and I think that's the biggest thing

00:46:52.865 --> 00:46:54.865
<v Speaker 1>that I I hear feedback on too is

00:46:54.865 --> 00:46:56.305
<v Speaker 1>that, you know, when it comes to writing

00:46:56.305 --> 00:46:57.265
<v Speaker 1>a Helm chart,

00:46:57.825 --> 00:46:59.665
<v Speaker 1>writing Helm chart is it it can take

00:46:59.665 --> 00:47:01.185
<v Speaker 1>a lot depending on what you're going to

00:47:01.185 --> 00:47:02.305
<v Speaker 1>do as well as

00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:05.150
<v Speaker 1>the people that want to create operators and

00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:07.150
<v Speaker 1>then wrap their operators with the Helm chart,

00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:09.390
<v Speaker 1>and it's this, you know, gargantuan

00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:10.350
<v Speaker 1>her just

00:47:11.309 --> 00:47:14.430
<v Speaker 1>crazy feat to to put together. But alas.

00:47:15.635 --> 00:47:19.155
<v Speaker 0>Is there a managed Waypoint server by HashiCorp?

00:47:20.115 --> 00:47:22.515
<v Speaker 1>There isn't right now. So Waypoint's a a

00:47:22.515 --> 00:47:24.035
<v Speaker 1>% open source.

00:47:24.355 --> 00:47:26.115
<v Speaker 1>So so if there's something that you want

00:47:26.115 --> 00:47:27.795
<v Speaker 1>to see added, please open up an issue

00:47:27.795 --> 00:47:28.035
<v Speaker 1>for it.

00:47:29.079 --> 00:47:31.160
<v Speaker 1>It's it's it's different in that, you know,

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:33.640
<v Speaker 1>as as projects get to different phases of

00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.440
<v Speaker 1>their life,

00:47:34.839 --> 00:47:37.240
<v Speaker 1>there's more help needed in certain areas. It

00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:39.480
<v Speaker 1>might sound obvious, but so, like, right now,

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:42.280
<v Speaker 1>Terraform core we've hit Terraform1.o.

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:44.645
<v Speaker 1>So if there's a core functionality or feature,

00:47:44.645 --> 00:47:46.965
<v Speaker 1>it's probably going to be the HashiCorp internal

00:47:46.965 --> 00:47:48.965
<v Speaker 1>team that's working on that as an example.

00:47:49.205 --> 00:47:52.165
<v Speaker 1>So it it are are we looking for

00:47:52.165 --> 00:47:54.485
<v Speaker 1>a lot of help there? Not not really.

00:47:54.485 --> 00:47:56.485
<v Speaker 1>But when it comes to providers,

00:47:56.725 --> 00:47:57.285
<v Speaker 1>documentation,

00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.320
<v Speaker 1>some other instantiations

00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:00.440
<v Speaker 1>of Terraform,

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:01.720
<v Speaker 1>that's that's going to be a lot more

00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:03.720
<v Speaker 1>helpful and and and definitely a better use

00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:04.440
<v Speaker 1>of time.

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:07.000
<v Speaker 1>I haven't tried opening anything up on Terraform

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.240
<v Speaker 1>core just yet, but but, yeah, I would

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:11.240
<v Speaker 1>it it'd just be harder to identify something

00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:13.080
<v Speaker 1>that's there because it's been so well built

00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:13.320
<v Speaker 1>out.

00:48:14.035 --> 00:48:16.275
<v Speaker 1>With Waypoint though, it's it's it's very open.

00:48:16.275 --> 00:48:17.555
<v Speaker 1>So if there is something that you see

00:48:17.555 --> 00:48:19.475
<v Speaker 1>or you wanna collaborate on, I I know

00:48:19.475 --> 00:48:20.275
<v Speaker 1>there's some,

00:48:20.675 --> 00:48:23.395
<v Speaker 1>like, good first issues that are marked in

00:48:23.395 --> 00:48:24.435
<v Speaker 1>there too. So

00:48:24.915 --> 00:48:27.075
<v Speaker 1>but, yeah, no no managed offering just yet,

00:48:27.075 --> 00:48:29.250
<v Speaker 1>but but who who knows what the future

00:48:29.250 --> 00:48:29.890
<v Speaker 1>brings?

00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:32.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any I I don't think

00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:35.090
<v Speaker 1>I've found a crystal ball that's been reliable

00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:37.170
<v Speaker 1>just yet, but, you know, goodness.

00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:39.570
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:42.785
<v Speaker 1>So looks like we do have our Waypoint

00:48:42.785 --> 00:48:45.425
<v Speaker 1>server installed on Kubernetes. Let's go ahead and

00:48:45.425 --> 00:48:47.025
<v Speaker 1>confirm that that's the case. Let's go ahead

00:48:47.025 --> 00:48:48.865
<v Speaker 1>and get those pods again, and we can

00:48:48.865 --> 00:48:50.785
<v Speaker 1>see we've got our server. We have our

00:48:50.785 --> 00:48:51.505
<v Speaker 1>runner.

00:48:51.585 --> 00:48:52.305
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic.

00:48:52.545 --> 00:48:53.345
<v Speaker 1>Let's

00:48:53.345 --> 00:48:56.305
<v Speaker 1>go ahead and authenticate and jump into that

00:48:56.305 --> 00:48:56.785
<v Speaker 1>UI.

00:48:57.700 --> 00:48:59.460
<v Speaker 1>Let me go ahead and close some things

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:01.860
<v Speaker 1>out because that would just not be fun

00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:03.780
<v Speaker 1>to be in the wrong context.

00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So this should look pretty familiar. We've

00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:10.420
<v Speaker 1>got our projects. We don't have anything instantiated

00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:11.060
<v Speaker 1>just yet.

00:49:12.204 --> 00:49:14.125
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna be using the GitOps workflow

00:49:14.125 --> 00:49:15.885
<v Speaker 1>with these, so I don't have to go

00:49:15.885 --> 00:49:17.165
<v Speaker 1>and set any

00:49:17.565 --> 00:49:19.805
<v Speaker 1>AWS credentials or anything like that. I think

00:49:19.805 --> 00:49:21.724
<v Speaker 1>in the future, it's it's it'll be nice

00:49:21.724 --> 00:49:22.365
<v Speaker 1>to have

00:49:22.605 --> 00:49:24.125
<v Speaker 1>when you install this, kind of have it

00:49:24.125 --> 00:49:26.925
<v Speaker 1>bootstrap itself. And so, you know, that's I'm

00:49:26.925 --> 00:49:28.980
<v Speaker 1>curious to see how, we start to think

00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:31.300
<v Speaker 1>through that as the project matures and,

00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:32.980
<v Speaker 1>how do you how do we, you know,

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:35.700
<v Speaker 1>bootstrap with Kubernetes authentication? How we bootstrap,

00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:38.900
<v Speaker 1>running in AWS with instance roles or or,

00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:41.204
<v Speaker 1>you know, switching policies and things like that,

00:49:41.204 --> 00:49:43.365
<v Speaker 1>assuming roles and whatnot. It should be an

00:49:43.365 --> 00:49:44.484
<v Speaker 1>interesting conversation.

00:49:47.525 --> 00:49:50.885
<v Speaker 1>Let's go ahead and initialize our demo here.

00:49:51.525 --> 00:49:53.285
<v Speaker 1>What this demo is going to do is

00:49:53.285 --> 00:49:55.730
<v Speaker 1>kinda show you again how we can get

00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:58.609
<v Speaker 1>that YAML into our Kubernetes cluster and then

00:49:58.609 --> 00:50:00.369
<v Speaker 1>kind of with the, you know, with our

00:50:00.369 --> 00:50:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Waypoint Waypoint

00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:03.890
<v Speaker 1>tinted glasses on.

00:50:04.290 --> 00:50:05.570
<v Speaker 1>So let's jump in here.

00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:07.970
<v Speaker 1>We'll see everything's all built out. I'll go

00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:09.975
<v Speaker 1>ahead and put this to the side, and

00:50:09.975 --> 00:50:13.255
<v Speaker 1>then I'll do a Waypoint up, and we

00:50:13.255 --> 00:50:14.935
<v Speaker 1>should be off to the races.

00:50:15.495 --> 00:50:17.415
<v Speaker 0>Okay. So while that builds, we got a

00:50:17.415 --> 00:50:19.255
<v Speaker 0>question from Rajasthanan

00:50:19.255 --> 00:50:19.895
<v Speaker 0>again.

00:50:20.055 --> 00:50:22.935
<v Speaker 0>Why do we always have to dash accept

00:50:22.935 --> 00:50:23.495
<v Speaker 0>toss?

00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:28.530
<v Speaker 1>So right now, the so because of that

00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:29.330
<v Speaker 1>integration

00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:31.570
<v Speaker 1>with the Horizon service

00:50:32.050 --> 00:50:32.930
<v Speaker 1>clear that up.

00:50:33.250 --> 00:50:36.290
<v Speaker 1>That is the terms that's the TOS right

00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:38.375
<v Speaker 1>there. So if you don't accept that, you

00:50:38.375 --> 00:50:41.255
<v Speaker 1>can you can work without that Horizon service,

00:50:41.575 --> 00:50:44.375
<v Speaker 1>but that is that's explicitly why that TOS

00:50:44.375 --> 00:50:46.215
<v Speaker 1>is there. And just just to make sure

00:50:46.215 --> 00:50:48.215
<v Speaker 1>because there is that transference of data and

00:50:48.215 --> 00:50:50.535
<v Speaker 1>you're linking together these applications in a public

00:50:50.770 --> 00:50:51.330
<v Speaker 1>space.

00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:53.410
<v Speaker 1>I just wanna make sure that people are

00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:55.570
<v Speaker 1>aware of that and, again, you know, aren't

00:50:55.570 --> 00:50:58.450
<v Speaker 1>aren't, sharing applications that they didn't intend to,

00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:00.530
<v Speaker 1>and that's kind of the the the TOS

00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:02.370
<v Speaker 1>thing that is at the end there. But,

00:51:02.610 --> 00:51:05.250
<v Speaker 1>not not, not you don't have to use

00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:06.845
<v Speaker 1>that if if that doesn't make sense for

00:51:06.845 --> 00:51:09.005
<v Speaker 1>for your team or for your workflows. Okay.

00:51:09.005 --> 00:51:10.605
<v Speaker 0>So if you didn't include the flag, would

00:51:10.605 --> 00:51:13.325
<v Speaker 0>it have prompted you to confirm or accept?

00:51:13.325 --> 00:51:14.125
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:51:14.685 --> 00:51:15.965
<v Speaker 1>I see you Exactly.

00:51:17.325 --> 00:51:18.045
<v Speaker 0>Thanks.

00:51:18.925 --> 00:51:19.565
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.

00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:21.030
<v Speaker 1>So we

00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:23.670
<v Speaker 1>so here, I'd I won't be able to

00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:25.830
<v Speaker 1>click on this today either. For for the

00:51:25.830 --> 00:51:27.030
<v Speaker 1>next two demos, I won't be able to

00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:28.710
<v Speaker 1>click on that deployment and show off that

00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:29.830
<v Speaker 1>Horizon feature

00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:31.670
<v Speaker 1>just because I I I don't have a

00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:33.110
<v Speaker 1>service defined here. I could go ahead and

00:51:33.110 --> 00:51:34.870
<v Speaker 1>create one, but I I don't have one

00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:35.510
<v Speaker 1>defined here.

00:51:36.365 --> 00:51:38.925
<v Speaker 1>And then or or never mind. I'd I'd

00:51:39.484 --> 00:51:40.685
<v Speaker 1>forgot this one did work.

00:51:41.005 --> 00:51:43.565
<v Speaker 1>We get our adjective and that works for

00:51:43.565 --> 00:51:44.045
<v Speaker 1>me.

00:51:44.684 --> 00:51:46.925
<v Speaker 1>We get we get our adjective and our

00:51:46.925 --> 00:51:49.005
<v Speaker 1>our animal, and so we can actually see

00:51:49.005 --> 00:51:50.925
<v Speaker 1>this this service working as we intended.

00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:53.430
<v Speaker 1>Let me go ahead here and and actually

00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:54.710
<v Speaker 1>change out this code, and I can show

00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:57.990
<v Speaker 1>you the difference between releases and deployments too.

00:51:57.990 --> 00:52:00.390
<v Speaker 1>So let's go ahead into the application.

00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:03.030
<v Speaker 1>I think we're gonna want to go in

00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:04.310
<v Speaker 1>here to templates.

00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:06.870
<v Speaker 1>And then

00:52:06.414 --> 00:52:07.775
<v Speaker 1>very cool Waypoint.

00:52:08.414 --> 00:52:10.174
<v Speaker 1>Let's we can be more descriptive than this.

00:52:10.174 --> 00:52:12.414
<v Speaker 1>Right, David? Like, let's let's, make this

00:52:14.414 --> 00:52:16.015
<v Speaker 0>Presumably smashing?

00:52:16.734 --> 00:52:17.615
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I like that.

00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Awesome. Okay.

00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:25.860
<v Speaker 1>I like it. Let's let's let's ship this.

00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:28.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay. So I'm gonna go ahead and view

00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:30.260
<v Speaker 1>a Waypoint up. And you can start to

00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:32.020
<v Speaker 1>see now that, you know, we have things

00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:34.500
<v Speaker 1>like this. This kind of workflow makes it

00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:37.045
<v Speaker 1>really easy, especially if you're hacking on something

00:52:37.045 --> 00:52:38.805
<v Speaker 1>or or trying to get something out. It

00:52:38.805 --> 00:52:40.485
<v Speaker 1>really it works well for that kind of

00:52:40.485 --> 00:52:41.125
<v Speaker 1>workflow.

00:52:42.165 --> 00:52:43.925
<v Speaker 1>Know I've gotten quite a few demos pushed

00:52:43.925 --> 00:52:45.845
<v Speaker 1>out this way, and and it's just kinda

00:52:45.845 --> 00:52:47.765
<v Speaker 1>fun to have that feedback loop. That's the

00:52:47.765 --> 00:52:49.740
<v Speaker 1>goal of Waypoint is to make a, you

00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:51.180
<v Speaker 1>know, developer's

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:52.700
<v Speaker 1>life a lot easier in that respect rather

00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:54.300
<v Speaker 1>than have to worry about getting all of

00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:56.140
<v Speaker 1>these things set up and and running and

00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:56.780
<v Speaker 1>working.

00:52:58.140 --> 00:52:59.820
<v Speaker 1>You know, you could actually focus on what

00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:01.420
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to do rather than how to

00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:03.785
<v Speaker 1>set it up to do the thing. Okay.

00:53:05.065 --> 00:53:08.105
<v Speaker 1>So let us jump in here, and now

00:53:08.105 --> 00:53:10.345
<v Speaker 1>we can see that we've got presumably smashing,

00:53:10.585 --> 00:53:12.425
<v Speaker 1>and then we could use this release to

00:53:12.425 --> 00:53:15.225
<v Speaker 1>to point back and forth. So I don't

00:53:15.225 --> 00:53:16.985
<v Speaker 1>know if I can jump in here.

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:19.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. So I can jump back with Waypoint

00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:22.190
<v Speaker 1>release. I'd specify one and that would shift

00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:24.750
<v Speaker 1>it back. So Okay. I'm going here.

00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:26.990
<v Speaker 1>And then oh, and that's what it is.

00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:28.350
<v Speaker 1>We won't get that final

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:31.070
<v Speaker 1>I I just had it mixed up. We

00:53:31.070 --> 00:53:34.165
<v Speaker 1>won't get that final release endpoint just because

00:53:34.244 --> 00:53:36.484
<v Speaker 1>we don't have that service defined, and that's

00:53:36.484 --> 00:53:38.005
<v Speaker 1>that's okay. We don't wanna share this with

00:53:38.005 --> 00:53:39.605
<v Speaker 1>the world. I I think there's there's more

00:53:39.605 --> 00:53:41.525
<v Speaker 1>that we could add to it. You know,

00:53:41.525 --> 00:53:42.645
<v Speaker 1>OpenID Connect,

00:53:42.885 --> 00:53:44.805
<v Speaker 1>some more features, different colors

00:53:45.125 --> 00:53:47.445
<v Speaker 1>would probably be helpful. So that's our second

00:53:47.445 --> 00:53:51.140
<v Speaker 1>demo showing off kubectl apply in that plugin

00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:53.380
<v Speaker 1>and how that works. Okay. Can can we

00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:54.420
<v Speaker 0>try something?

00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:56.980
<v Speaker 0>I just like Absolutely. You know, everything's worked

00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:59.140
<v Speaker 0>so far. So, you know, well done. But

00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:01.435
<v Speaker 0>let's break it. What's the feedback like if

00:54:01.435 --> 00:54:03.595
<v Speaker 0>my Docker build fails or my Kube control

00:54:03.595 --> 00:54:06.235
<v Speaker 0>apply fails? Could we maybe just intentionally

00:54:07.435 --> 00:54:09.035
<v Speaker 0>break the Docker file and the and the

00:54:09.035 --> 00:54:10.475
<v Speaker 0>the deployment template?

00:54:11.194 --> 00:54:12.075
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.

00:54:12.075 --> 00:54:13.755
<v Speaker 1>Let's go ahead and do it.

00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:16.680
<v Speaker 1>So

00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:20.600
<v Speaker 1>here, we could try to

00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:23.080
<v Speaker 1>would you rather how how do you wanna

00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:24.840
<v Speaker 1>break it? Do you want to

00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:26.520
<v Speaker 1>we could either blow up the image. You

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:28.520
<v Speaker 1>know, we could do, like, p ubuntu, like,

00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:31.685
<v Speaker 1>an the not so great smelling ubuntu.

00:54:32.165 --> 00:54:34.485
<v Speaker 0>Ubuntu. I like it. Or

00:54:36.245 --> 00:54:38.085
<v Speaker 1>just, you know, part of a pub sub

00:54:38.085 --> 00:54:39.045
<v Speaker 1>thing, maybe.

00:54:39.845 --> 00:54:41.765
<v Speaker 1>I don't know. We'll get somebody marketing to

00:54:41.765 --> 00:54:43.525
<v Speaker 1>work on that. Yeah. Alright. So if we

00:54:43.525 --> 00:54:44.725
<v Speaker 1>start to build up here,

00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:47.330
<v Speaker 1>we should see that so we get that

00:54:47.330 --> 00:54:49.890
<v Speaker 1>feedback immediately within our CLI. And then here

00:54:49.890 --> 00:54:51.170
<v Speaker 1>in just a second, we should see that

00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:52.130
<v Speaker 1>build fail.

00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:53.730
<v Speaker 1>And then we can actually go in and

00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:55.570
<v Speaker 1>introspect this, you know, what the heck is

00:54:55.570 --> 00:54:57.650
<v Speaker 1>going on. So we could see Docker login.

00:54:57.650 --> 00:54:59.855
<v Speaker 1>It's assuming that it must be private because,

00:54:59.855 --> 00:55:01.214
<v Speaker 1>you know, it can't find this anywhere in

00:55:01.214 --> 00:55:02.335
<v Speaker 1>the public registry,

00:55:02.974 --> 00:55:04.255
<v Speaker 1>which is which is good.

00:55:05.855 --> 00:55:08.095
<v Speaker 1>But, yeah, that's the that's the status report

00:55:08.095 --> 00:55:09.935
<v Speaker 1>kind of functionality that we get to.

00:55:10.734 --> 00:55:13.490
<v Speaker 1>Let me do that actually. So Waypoint status,

00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:15.010
<v Speaker 1>we can actually start to see that in

00:55:15.010 --> 00:55:15.970
<v Speaker 1>the CLI.

00:55:15.970 --> 00:55:18.369
<v Speaker 1>We we we get that visual representation of

00:55:18.369 --> 00:55:20.690
<v Speaker 1>it over here in the UI, but we

00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:22.450
<v Speaker 1>can actually see, you know, what's going on.

00:55:22.450 --> 00:55:24.530
<v Speaker 1>We don't have a deployment status. We don't

00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:26.610
<v Speaker 1>have that release status because we just failed

00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:27.329
<v Speaker 1>our build.

00:55:28.025 --> 00:55:30.185
<v Speaker 1>If we fix that and push that back,

00:55:30.185 --> 00:55:32.345
<v Speaker 1>then we're going to get, you know, available,

00:55:32.425 --> 00:55:34.985
<v Speaker 1>looks good, checked, you know, x x moments

00:55:34.985 --> 00:55:37.305
<v Speaker 1>ago. But but, yeah, that's that's what that

00:55:37.305 --> 00:55:39.465
<v Speaker 1>looks like when something fails. And then we

00:55:39.465 --> 00:55:41.625
<v Speaker 1>do have that helpful context

00:55:41.945 --> 00:55:43.145
<v Speaker 1>in terms of

00:55:43.779 --> 00:55:45.140
<v Speaker 1>go ahead and just run it again so

00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:46.180
<v Speaker 1>we can see that error.

00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:49.460
<v Speaker 1>We get that feedback immediately as well. So

00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:51.940
<v Speaker 0>if we now fix the image but break

00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:54.180
<v Speaker 0>the deployment YAML and then run a Waypoint

00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:55.859
<v Speaker 0>up, it's gonna do the build,

00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:57.779
<v Speaker 0>fill the apply. And then if we fix

00:55:57.779 --> 00:55:59.595
<v Speaker 0>the apply and run a Waypoint up, will

00:55:59.595 --> 00:56:01.515
<v Speaker 0>it skip the build and do the apply?

00:56:03.994 --> 00:56:05.035
<v Speaker 1>I

00:56:05.275 --> 00:56:05.915
<v Speaker 1>think

00:56:06.315 --> 00:56:08.555
<v Speaker 1>so it should do the apply. I'd I'm

00:56:08.555 --> 00:56:10.315
<v Speaker 1>curious to see. Let's go ahead and give

00:56:10.315 --> 00:56:12.555
<v Speaker 1>that give that a go. I think that

00:56:12.810 --> 00:56:14.010
<v Speaker 1>my prediction

00:56:14.010 --> 00:56:14.890
<v Speaker 1>is that

00:56:15.610 --> 00:56:16.330
<v Speaker 1>should

00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:20.730
<v Speaker 0>be deprecated. Right? A bit of you. Yeah.

00:56:20.730 --> 00:56:21.610
<v Speaker 0>Go for it.

00:56:24.665 --> 00:56:26.425
<v Speaker 1>So let's go ahead and do that. I

00:56:26.425 --> 00:56:28.665
<v Speaker 1>think it should break because I think Kubernetes

00:56:28.665 --> 00:56:30.585
<v Speaker 1>will hand it back. This Kubernetes one dot

00:56:30.585 --> 00:56:32.265
<v Speaker 1>two one that we're running to.

00:56:32.905 --> 00:56:34.744
<v Speaker 1>I I was I did run something earlier

00:56:34.744 --> 00:56:37.224
<v Speaker 1>locally where I had one nineteen installed and

00:56:37.224 --> 00:56:40.420
<v Speaker 1>because it is using my local cube control

00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:41.620
<v Speaker 1>applied binary,

00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:42.420
<v Speaker 1>that

00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:45.700
<v Speaker 1>that's where okay. Cool. So we we get

00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:46.660
<v Speaker 1>that feedback there.

00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:48.820
<v Speaker 1>It it was saying that

00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:52.944
<v Speaker 1>because of the the version differences, the cron

00:56:52.944 --> 00:56:54.625
<v Speaker 1>jobs and and it was basically having an

00:56:54.625 --> 00:56:56.385
<v Speaker 1>issue with an API version at at the

00:56:56.385 --> 00:56:57.744
<v Speaker 1>end of the day. And so I got

00:56:57.744 --> 00:56:59.585
<v Speaker 1>that feedback, but looks like we do get

00:56:59.585 --> 00:57:00.705
<v Speaker 1>that as well here

00:57:01.585 --> 00:57:03.585
<v Speaker 1>because that tag doesn't exist. And then we

00:57:03.585 --> 00:57:04.545
<v Speaker 1>can actually see

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.680
<v Speaker 1>let's go to this deployment.

00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:11.200
<v Speaker 1>And then, yeah, we can actually see via

00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:12.640
<v Speaker 1>the statuses that,

00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:15.040
<v Speaker 1>that is not

00:57:17.265 --> 00:57:19.105
<v Speaker 1>what we wanted to see happen, which is

00:57:19.105 --> 00:57:19.665
<v Speaker 1>nice.

00:57:20.224 --> 00:57:21.025
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

00:57:22.545 --> 00:57:23.984
<v Speaker 0>Okay. Let's fix it and run it one

00:57:23.984 --> 00:57:25.105
<v Speaker 0>more time, and then I'll let you move

00:57:25.105 --> 00:57:26.385
<v Speaker 0>on to your last demo.

00:57:27.184 --> 00:57:28.145
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah.

00:57:29.184 --> 00:57:29.984
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

00:57:29.984 --> 00:57:31.904
<v Speaker 0>I'm just too curious. That's my problem.

00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh. It's it's the best thing.

00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Never stop being curious.

00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:39.910
<v Speaker 1>It's it's, it's fun working on these demos

00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:40.870
<v Speaker 1>too, frankly,

00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:44.150
<v Speaker 1>because there are so many, it's I feel

00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:45.190
<v Speaker 1>like that's the best way.

00:57:45.755 --> 00:57:47.915
<v Speaker 1>It's it is as as backwards as it

00:57:47.915 --> 00:57:49.915
<v Speaker 1>sounds, I feel like working on demos and

00:57:49.915 --> 00:57:51.755
<v Speaker 1>trying to find, you know, all these use

00:57:51.755 --> 00:57:53.755
<v Speaker 1>cases and workflows, to me, is a lot

00:57:53.755 --> 00:57:55.355
<v Speaker 1>of fun because then you get to find

00:57:55.355 --> 00:57:57.435
<v Speaker 1>these edge cases in these wild kinds of

00:57:57.435 --> 00:57:58.315
<v Speaker 1>states and

00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:01.220
<v Speaker 1>things that come up. I when you're working

00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:02.980
<v Speaker 1>with something in production or, like, working on

00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:04.500
<v Speaker 1>a pipeline, yeah, I feel like you don't

00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:06.820
<v Speaker 1>always get that experience because you're so focused

00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:08.500
<v Speaker 1>on making it work. You are with the

00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:10.660
<v Speaker 1>demo too, but, you know, it's with the

00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:11.940
<v Speaker 1>demo, you can be a little bit more

00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:13.460
<v Speaker 1>curious and push on it and see if

00:58:13.460 --> 00:58:15.224
<v Speaker 1>it's got any flex to it. So

00:58:16.025 --> 00:58:18.664
<v Speaker 1>always always fun. Awesome. So it still did

00:58:18.664 --> 00:58:20.345
<v Speaker 0>the build, but it was all cached. So

00:58:20.345 --> 00:58:22.664
<v Speaker 0>it kinda flew past it, but it worked

00:58:22.664 --> 00:58:23.224
<v Speaker 0>well.

00:58:24.825 --> 00:58:25.705
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.

00:58:26.184 --> 00:58:26.665
<v Speaker 1>And

00:58:27.464 --> 00:58:28.505
<v Speaker 1>there we go. Just like that.

00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Cool.

00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Any any questions on this front? Otherwise, I've

00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:37.980
<v Speaker 1>got a fun way to cap things off

00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:42.060
<v Speaker 1>with a final not not not quite typical

00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:43.180
<v Speaker 1>demo for y'all.

00:58:43.875 --> 00:58:45.555
<v Speaker 0>No. I think it's all starting to click,

00:58:45.555 --> 00:58:46.675
<v Speaker 0>and it's starting to make a lot more

00:58:46.675 --> 00:58:49.075
<v Speaker 0>sense in my head. I understand kinda what

00:58:49.075 --> 00:58:51.555
<v Speaker 0>its responsibilities are, what it's trying to do.

00:58:51.635 --> 00:58:54.035
<v Speaker 0>It's yeah. Definitely making progress on my end.

00:58:54.035 --> 00:58:54.915
<v Speaker 0>So all good.

00:58:56.195 --> 00:58:58.990
<v Speaker 1>Awesome. Awesome. Always a good thing to hear.

00:58:59.230 --> 00:59:01.230
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. If I can understand, everyone can understand

00:59:01.230 --> 00:59:01.869
<v Speaker 0>it. So

00:59:05.309 --> 00:59:07.390
<v Speaker 1>That's that's that's always the goal. That's always

00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:07.950
<v Speaker 1>the goal. Exactly.

00:59:09.615 --> 00:59:12.255
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead and actually jump into this. Are

00:59:12.255 --> 00:59:14.415
<v Speaker 0>you familiar with the Dagger project?

00:59:15.535 --> 00:59:16.175
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

00:59:16.415 --> 00:59:17.775
<v Speaker 1>So I I haven't gone to check that

00:59:17.775 --> 00:59:19.775
<v Speaker 1>out as much as I've wanted to. I

00:59:19.775 --> 00:59:21.935
<v Speaker 1>I really want to I I haven't done

00:59:21.935 --> 00:59:23.295
<v Speaker 1>a deep dive with it just yet. I

00:59:23.295 --> 00:59:26.010
<v Speaker 1>I I've been invited to the repository

00:59:26.090 --> 00:59:27.530
<v Speaker 1>and so I've gotten to like build it.

00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:29.530
<v Speaker 1>I've done a couple demos locally, but it

00:59:29.530 --> 00:59:31.370
<v Speaker 1>definitely something I've I've got my eye on,

00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:32.730
<v Speaker 1>you know. It feels like there's quite a

00:59:32.730 --> 00:59:34.810
<v Speaker 0>lot Dagger, so it's cutting edge. It

00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:36.810
<v Speaker 0>feels like there's a lot of crossover between

00:59:36.810 --> 00:59:38.645
<v Speaker 0>what what Waypoint and what Dagger are trying

00:59:38.645 --> 00:59:41.125
<v Speaker 0>to offer. They're both kinda using BuildKit or

00:59:41.125 --> 00:59:42.325
<v Speaker 0>can use BuildKit.

00:59:42.725 --> 00:59:45.045
<v Speaker 0>Except this is obviously using HCL and Dagger

00:59:45.045 --> 00:59:47.525
<v Speaker 0>uses Q, but yeah.

00:59:47.525 --> 00:59:49.045
<v Speaker 0>Really cool the way they they're both trying

00:59:49.045 --> 00:59:51.045
<v Speaker 0>to solve this this this problem. Like this

00:59:51.045 --> 00:59:52.760
<v Speaker 0>is a real problem that needs some better

00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:53.320
<v Speaker 0>tooling.

00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:56.760
<v Speaker 1>I agree. It's just too it's too specific.

00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:59.640
<v Speaker 1>There's no, like, ability for dependency injection or

00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.880
<v Speaker 1>or really anything like that for for this

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.680
<v Speaker 1>kind of tooling. So it's well, you know,

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.280
<v Speaker 1>like I said before, I I think that

01:00:06.474 --> 01:00:07.275
<v Speaker 1>honestly,

01:00:07.275 --> 01:00:09.595
<v Speaker 1>every single company I've worked at except for

01:00:09.595 --> 01:00:10.475
<v Speaker 1>HashiCorp,

01:00:10.714 --> 01:00:12.395
<v Speaker 1>they say it more tongue in cheek, but,

01:00:12.395 --> 01:00:13.835
<v Speaker 1>like, we do things a little bit differently

01:00:13.835 --> 01:00:16.315
<v Speaker 1>here. You know, it's it's it's honestly what

01:00:16.315 --> 01:00:17.675
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten every time I've been like, can

01:00:17.675 --> 01:00:19.035
<v Speaker 1>we go over the build system? Can we

01:00:19.035 --> 01:00:20.795
<v Speaker 1>talk through this? I don't really quite understand

01:00:20.795 --> 01:00:21.915
<v Speaker 1>how this works or how do you do

01:00:21.915 --> 01:00:22.155
<v Speaker 1>this here.

01:00:22.930 --> 01:00:25.170
<v Speaker 1>So those those conversations are as really I

01:00:25.170 --> 01:00:26.370
<v Speaker 1>find those really interesting

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:29.570
<v Speaker 1>to to kinda talk through. Alright. My car

01:00:29.570 --> 01:00:31.410
<v Speaker 0>alarm's gone off. I'm just gonna quickly go

01:00:31.410 --> 01:00:32.290
<v Speaker 0>turn it off.

01:00:33.810 --> 01:00:34.850
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely. Absolutely.

01:00:35.975 --> 01:00:38.375
<v Speaker 1>Well, please please feel free if you have

01:00:38.375 --> 01:00:40.615
<v Speaker 1>any questions on these fronts to to put

01:00:40.615 --> 01:00:41.815
<v Speaker 1>them in the chat, and we can get

01:00:41.815 --> 01:00:44.215
<v Speaker 1>to that. Otherwise, I'll get things kicked off

01:00:44.215 --> 01:00:47.175
<v Speaker 1>while David handles one alarm and and one

01:00:47.495 --> 01:00:49.335
<v Speaker 1>rear in IRL status.

01:00:49.869 --> 01:00:51.070
<v Speaker 1>You know, like

01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:54.110
<v Speaker 1>like we've seen here. We've got some successful

01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:56.750
<v Speaker 1>statuses here, but, yeah, car alarms definitely definitely

01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:58.270
<v Speaker 1>worth getting fixed.

01:00:58.510 --> 01:00:59.070
<v Speaker 1>So

01:00:59.390 --> 01:01:02.109
<v Speaker 1>our last demo today is going to be

01:01:02.109 --> 01:01:03.470
<v Speaker 1>something a little bit different.

01:01:04.475 --> 01:01:06.715
<v Speaker 1>They're like, yay. Okay. Congrats.

01:01:07.355 --> 01:01:08.395
<v Speaker 1>Congrats,

01:01:08.395 --> 01:01:09.915
<v Speaker 1>David, on your on your car. Sorry about

01:01:09.915 --> 01:01:11.595
<v Speaker 0>that. I'll just leave you hanging there.

01:01:12.235 --> 01:01:14.235
<v Speaker 1>No worries. No worries. It's it's your show

01:01:14.235 --> 01:01:14.875
<v Speaker 0>now.

01:01:15.675 --> 01:01:16.635
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

01:01:17.130 --> 01:01:19.930
<v Speaker 1>It's actually, yeah. It was it was actually

01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:21.609
<v Speaker 1>me that did that with the car alarm.

01:01:21.609 --> 01:01:24.329
<v Speaker 1>So okay. Let's let's get into let's get

01:01:24.329 --> 01:01:25.609
<v Speaker 1>into the next demo.

01:01:25.770 --> 01:01:28.329
<v Speaker 1>And that is it's gonna be a Minecraft

01:01:28.329 --> 01:01:29.930
<v Speaker 1>server. We're gonna go ahead and run that

01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:30.650
<v Speaker 1>on Kubernetes.

01:01:30.965 --> 01:01:32.805
<v Speaker 1>We're going to deploy it with Waypoint.

01:01:32.965 --> 01:01:34.085
<v Speaker 1>And because

01:01:34.085 --> 01:01:36.965
<v Speaker 1>this image is already defined, we we don't

01:01:36.965 --> 01:01:38.405
<v Speaker 1>wanna build it. We kind of just want

01:01:38.405 --> 01:01:40.405
<v Speaker 1>to shim this together so that we can

01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:42.245
<v Speaker 1>actually use Waypoint to deploy this.

01:01:42.805 --> 01:01:45.290
<v Speaker 1>You know, probably not the most practical example,

01:01:45.290 --> 01:01:47.770
<v Speaker 1>but it is if you like playing Minecraft

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:49.610
<v Speaker 1>and you wanna set the server with with

01:01:49.610 --> 01:01:50.970
<v Speaker 1>one of your favorite tools out there. Am

01:01:50.970 --> 01:01:53.930
<v Speaker 1>I right? Okay. So let's let's

01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:55.930
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at how we get

01:01:55.930 --> 01:01:56.330
<v Speaker 1>this done.

01:01:57.145 --> 01:01:59.225
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead and do my favorite thing here.

01:01:59.305 --> 01:02:00.425
<v Speaker 1>And there we go.

01:02:01.225 --> 01:02:01.785
<v Speaker 1>So

01:02:02.025 --> 01:02:04.345
<v Speaker 1>you won't see things that look too different

01:02:04.345 --> 01:02:06.105
<v Speaker 1>here. You shouldn't see things look too different

01:02:06.105 --> 01:02:08.505
<v Speaker 1>here. We've got our labels, we've got our

01:02:08.505 --> 01:02:10.185
<v Speaker 1>projects, we've got our app stanzas.

01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:12.350
<v Speaker 1>The real thing that's different here

01:02:12.910 --> 01:02:15.790
<v Speaker 1>so right now, it's it's a requirement within

01:02:15.790 --> 01:02:16.670
<v Speaker 1>Waypoint.

01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:18.510
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to have a release stanza,

01:02:18.510 --> 01:02:19.950
<v Speaker 1>but you do have to have a build

01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:22.350
<v Speaker 1>and a deploy stanza as a bare minimum.

01:02:22.704 --> 01:02:24.625
<v Speaker 1>It's you know, we we've talked about this

01:02:24.625 --> 01:02:26.305
<v Speaker 1>with the I've talked about this with the

01:02:26.305 --> 01:02:29.105
<v Speaker 1>team in a few different contexts, but it's

01:02:29.105 --> 01:02:30.464
<v Speaker 1>my hope that these kind of get separated

01:02:30.464 --> 01:02:32.865
<v Speaker 1>out over time. But, you know, Waypoint doesn't

01:02:32.865 --> 01:02:35.424
<v Speaker 1>work best when you're not using it all

01:02:35.424 --> 01:02:37.424
<v Speaker 1>of the pieces of it. You know, it's

01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:38.830
<v Speaker 1>you you'll get those feature ads. You'll get

01:02:38.830 --> 01:02:40.110
<v Speaker 1>those benefits. But,

01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:43.070
<v Speaker 1>you know, it's it does work better together.

01:02:43.070 --> 01:02:44.270
<v Speaker 1>But if you did just wanna build something

01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:45.790
<v Speaker 1>and use Waypoint to do that,

01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:47.869
<v Speaker 1>that's that's something I'd like to see in

01:02:47.869 --> 01:02:50.350
<v Speaker 1>the future, you know, personally, selfishly.

01:02:51.174 --> 01:02:53.494
<v Speaker 1>Here, we're just gonna be pulling down this

01:02:53.494 --> 01:02:54.935
<v Speaker 1>docker image here.

01:02:56.055 --> 01:02:58.375
<v Speaker 1>What Waypoint does one thing I forgot to

01:02:58.375 --> 01:03:00.535
<v Speaker 1>mention was when we were let me actually

01:03:00.535 --> 01:03:02.375
<v Speaker 1>go back to this.

01:03:02.775 --> 01:03:04.454
<v Speaker 1>We're seeing all these builds, we're seeing all

01:03:04.454 --> 01:03:06.470
<v Speaker 1>these logs. Where the heck are they coming

01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.950
<v Speaker 1>from?

01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:10.470
<v Speaker 1>Waypoint injects an entry point

01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:15.109
<v Speaker 1>binary into your docker image when you use

01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:17.990
<v Speaker 1>Waypoint to build it. So in the example

01:03:17.990 --> 01:03:20.535
<v Speaker 1>of our lambda function, it was actually be

01:03:20.535 --> 01:03:22.775
<v Speaker 1>able to look at the CloudWatch logs and

01:03:22.775 --> 01:03:24.695
<v Speaker 1>pull those in. And that's the benefit of

01:03:24.695 --> 01:03:26.935
<v Speaker 1>the entry point is getting the application logs.

01:03:27.015 --> 01:03:29.015
<v Speaker 1>That's how we can then evaluate the status.

01:03:29.015 --> 01:03:30.615
<v Speaker 1>Is it up? Is it down? What's going

01:03:30.615 --> 01:03:32.935
<v Speaker 1>on? And then that entry point will allow

01:03:32.935 --> 01:03:35.290
<v Speaker 1>for some neat functionality in the future too.

01:03:35.290 --> 01:03:36.410
<v Speaker 1>I I can only,

01:03:36.970 --> 01:03:38.730
<v Speaker 1>you know, only only assume.

01:03:39.849 --> 01:03:42.250
<v Speaker 1>One one also thing to point out is

01:03:42.250 --> 01:03:43.770
<v Speaker 1>that in this release,

01:03:44.410 --> 01:03:44.650
<v Speaker 1>we

01:03:45.369 --> 01:03:47.609
<v Speaker 1>Mitchell and and the team wrote up the

01:03:47.609 --> 01:03:50.875
<v Speaker 1>architecture document with, oh my gosh, pictures. This

01:03:50.875 --> 01:03:53.434
<v Speaker 1>is so helpful to kind of understand, you

01:03:53.434 --> 01:03:55.115
<v Speaker 1>know, it's you can read things all day,

01:03:55.115 --> 01:03:57.434
<v Speaker 1>but like this, when you have this summation,

01:03:57.434 --> 01:04:00.075
<v Speaker 1>the the boxes and the arrows, really, really

01:04:00.075 --> 01:04:02.234
<v Speaker 1>makes for for some good good reading. Boxes

01:04:02.234 --> 01:04:03.115
<v Speaker 0>and arrows. Yeah.

01:04:04.869 --> 01:04:06.950
<v Speaker 1>It's it's it's it's nice. That's I think

01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:08.550
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm best at drawing. If it's

01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:10.869
<v Speaker 1>like actual art, terrible. But when it comes

01:04:10.869 --> 01:04:12.869
<v Speaker 1>to boxes and arrows Yeah. Pretty good at

01:04:12.869 --> 01:04:13.750
<v Speaker 0>stick people.

01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:18.070
<v Speaker 1>It's a a mix for mix for good

01:04:18.070 --> 01:04:20.185
<v Speaker 1>past time. But, yeah, if you're interested in

01:04:20.185 --> 01:04:22.265
<v Speaker 1>the, like, internals and the architecture of Waypoint

01:04:22.265 --> 01:04:24.345
<v Speaker 1>and, like, really wanna understand the deep technical

01:04:24.345 --> 01:04:28.105
<v Speaker 1>pieces of it, definitely recommend checking out architecture.md

01:04:28.105 --> 01:04:30.345
<v Speaker 1>in the root of of the repository. Lots

01:04:30.345 --> 01:04:32.905
<v Speaker 1>of lots of time care and and and

01:04:32.905 --> 01:04:35.224
<v Speaker 1>just

01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:35.110
<v Speaker 1>chances

01:04:35.110 --> 01:04:36.870
<v Speaker 1>for illumination on that front.

01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:38.630
<v Speaker 1>Cool. So

01:04:39.350 --> 01:04:41.590
<v Speaker 1>apologies before I get too too sidetracked.

01:04:42.310 --> 01:04:44.310
<v Speaker 1>We're going to so I talked about this.

01:04:44.310 --> 01:04:45.750
<v Speaker 1>We talked a little bit about entry point.

01:04:46.505 --> 01:04:48.985
<v Speaker 1>Finally, this deploy step, we've

01:04:48.985 --> 01:04:50.345
<v Speaker 1>seen this before too. So this is just

01:04:50.345 --> 01:04:53.465
<v Speaker 1>using the Kubernetes apply. I've got a deployment

01:04:53.465 --> 01:04:56.025
<v Speaker 1>file and some other YAML items which you

01:04:56.025 --> 01:04:57.465
<v Speaker 1>can take a look at

01:04:58.105 --> 01:05:00.490
<v Speaker 1>right here. So I've got my deployment, a

01:05:00.490 --> 01:05:01.770
<v Speaker 1>whole bunch of things here.

01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:05.690
<v Speaker 1>I do update this I do increase this

01:05:05.690 --> 01:05:08.330
<v Speaker 1>initial delay seconds because since it is a

01:05:08.330 --> 01:05:09.290
<v Speaker 1>Minecraft

01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:11.850
<v Speaker 1>server, it has to generate some assets and

01:05:11.850 --> 01:05:13.370
<v Speaker 1>that does take some time. So

01:05:14.785 --> 01:05:16.865
<v Speaker 1>like David, I was I was curious and,

01:05:16.865 --> 01:05:19.105
<v Speaker 1>like, is different compute? Can I make this

01:05:19.105 --> 01:05:21.345
<v Speaker 1>any faster? But I had haven't really been

01:05:21.345 --> 01:05:23.745
<v Speaker 1>able to find out anythings while it's initializing

01:05:23.745 --> 01:05:25.665
<v Speaker 1>just yet. But if you if you have

01:05:25.665 --> 01:05:27.585
<v Speaker 1>some tips or some suggestions on that front,

01:05:27.585 --> 01:05:29.105
<v Speaker 1>please let me know. I'm I'm all ears

01:05:29.105 --> 01:05:29.665
<v Speaker 1>on that front.

01:05:30.250 --> 01:05:32.170
<v Speaker 1>We are defining a service here too

01:05:32.490 --> 01:05:34.330
<v Speaker 1>because I'm gonna want to connect to this

01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:37.530
<v Speaker 1>with my local desktop client and specify that

01:05:37.530 --> 01:05:39.690
<v Speaker 1>load balancer address so that I can connect

01:05:39.690 --> 01:05:42.490
<v Speaker 1>this. And if anyone out there has Minecraft

01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Java Minecraft on their machine too,

01:05:45.385 --> 01:05:47.065
<v Speaker 1>you know, you you would be able to

01:05:47.065 --> 01:05:48.025
<v Speaker 1>join as well.

01:05:48.505 --> 01:05:51.225
<v Speaker 1>Alright. So let's go ahead

01:05:52.185 --> 01:05:54.025
<v Speaker 1>and kick this off.

01:05:54.745 --> 01:05:56.585
<v Speaker 1>Let me close out things I don't need.

01:05:56.585 --> 01:05:57.465
<v Speaker 1>That's always a plus.

01:05:58.220 --> 01:05:58.859
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

01:05:59.180 --> 01:05:59.740
<v Speaker 1>So

01:06:01.339 --> 01:06:02.940
<v Speaker 1>probably probably getting the hang of this by

01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:05.339
<v Speaker 1>now. We wanna run our Waypoints in it,

01:06:05.339 --> 01:06:08.059
<v Speaker 1>and we will see that project instantiate.

01:06:08.059 --> 01:06:10.539
<v Speaker 1>And drum roll, please. Still waiting on the

01:06:10.539 --> 01:06:12.380
<v Speaker 1>team to add music sound effects to this,

01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:13.734
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if they're gonna accept

01:06:13.734 --> 01:06:15.335
<v Speaker 1>that feature request. Yeah.

01:06:16.454 --> 01:06:18.935
<v Speaker 1>Like, oh, yes. Okay. I I would I

01:06:18.935 --> 01:06:20.214
<v Speaker 0>don't have a drum roll, but I'll work

01:06:20.214 --> 01:06:21.335
<v Speaker 0>on that for next time.

01:06:22.295 --> 01:06:23.655
<v Speaker 1>It's I I I got it. We we

01:06:23.655 --> 01:06:25.655
<v Speaker 1>have to keep doing streams because that's that's

01:06:25.815 --> 01:06:27.655
<v Speaker 1>yeah. That's that's that's where that's the magic

01:06:27.655 --> 01:06:28.055
<v Speaker 1>right there.

01:06:30.110 --> 01:06:33.070
<v Speaker 1>Awesome. So we've initialized this, and

01:06:33.870 --> 01:06:37.310
<v Speaker 1>we are connected to the right Kubernetes cluster.

01:06:37.310 --> 01:06:40.510
<v Speaker 1>Everything is good. We don't need any authentication

01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:42.270
<v Speaker 1>details because they're all accounted for.

01:06:42.775 --> 01:06:44.855
<v Speaker 1>The build is going to be very quick

01:06:44.855 --> 01:06:47.895
<v Speaker 1>because it's it's it's just a docker pull.

01:06:47.975 --> 01:06:49.095
<v Speaker 1>And I did run this as

01:06:49.655 --> 01:06:51.815
<v Speaker 1>did run a couple tests on this beforehand,

01:06:51.815 --> 01:06:54.615
<v Speaker 1>so we have that already instantiated

01:06:54.615 --> 01:06:55.815
<v Speaker 1>and good to go.

01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:57.680
<v Speaker 1>Cool.

01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:59.839
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to or we should get

01:06:59.839 --> 01:07:01.520
<v Speaker 1>this release status here in just a little

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:02.000
<v Speaker 1>bit,

01:07:02.559 --> 01:07:05.839
<v Speaker 1>but looks like everything has loaded up just

01:07:05.839 --> 01:07:06.800
<v Speaker 1>like we wanted.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:09.039
<v Speaker 1>We're not gonna have the entry point because

01:07:09.039 --> 01:07:11.615
<v Speaker 1>we did a docker pull, so there was

01:07:11.615 --> 01:07:13.695
<v Speaker 1>no injection into

01:07:13.695 --> 01:07:15.535
<v Speaker 1>this pod. So we won't get those logs

01:07:15.535 --> 01:07:17.135
<v Speaker 1>in Waypoint. But at the end of the

01:07:17.135 --> 01:07:19.535
<v Speaker 1>day, this is really just, you know, off

01:07:19.535 --> 01:07:21.295
<v Speaker 1>the wall demo and that, like, let's just

01:07:21.295 --> 01:07:23.454
<v Speaker 1>get a Minecraft server up and running.

01:07:24.579 --> 01:07:25.859
<v Speaker 1>So let's go ahead and take a look

01:07:25.859 --> 01:07:27.220
<v Speaker 1>at the logs. I guess I could do

01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:29.700
<v Speaker 0>that with a sidecar injection as well though,

01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:32.020
<v Speaker 0>right, as part of the deploy step for

01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:33.620
<v Speaker 0>when you do use a Docker pull?

01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:37.295
<v Speaker 1>That's true. That's true. I I do like

01:07:37.295 --> 01:07:39.134
<v Speaker 1>that. And and and and, honestly, I could

01:07:39.134 --> 01:07:41.134
<v Speaker 1>probably take take a look at the how

01:07:41.134 --> 01:07:41.775
<v Speaker 1>that

01:07:42.174 --> 01:07:44.494
<v Speaker 1>how that Docker file is written, and then

01:07:44.494 --> 01:07:45.934
<v Speaker 1>we could actually just kind of, like, port

01:07:45.934 --> 01:07:47.375
<v Speaker 1>that over to be its own

01:07:48.015 --> 01:07:50.575
<v Speaker 1>Waypoint project or or file, you know, basically

01:07:50.575 --> 01:07:52.610
<v Speaker 1>put it into the repository. I like this.

01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:53.410
<v Speaker 1>I like this.

01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. TBD. I'm gonna have to open up

01:07:56.050 --> 01:07:57.410
<v Speaker 1>an issue for that. That's that can make

01:07:57.410 --> 01:07:58.290
<v Speaker 1>for a fun time.

01:07:59.250 --> 01:08:02.130
<v Speaker 0>So this is the main craft doing the

01:08:02.370 --> 01:08:03.810
<v Speaker 0>generation thing. Right? Okay.

01:08:04.885 --> 01:08:06.565
<v Speaker 1>This yeah. This was this was a fun

01:08:06.565 --> 01:08:08.725
<v Speaker 1>demo to work on because the fact that

01:08:08.725 --> 01:08:11.285
<v Speaker 1>there was so much going on with it's

01:08:11.445 --> 01:08:13.205
<v Speaker 1>it took like oh my goodness. It was

01:08:13.205 --> 01:08:14.805
<v Speaker 1>it was a very frustrating,

01:08:14.805 --> 01:08:16.885
<v Speaker 1>like, thirty minutes the first couple of times

01:08:16.885 --> 01:08:18.405
<v Speaker 1>that I was trying to get this set

01:08:18.405 --> 01:08:20.085
<v Speaker 1>up because it would keep crashing

01:08:20.590 --> 01:08:22.750
<v Speaker 1>just before it would like get here. So

01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:24.830
<v Speaker 1>so we we we yeah. So just like

01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:25.630
<v Speaker 1>this. This actually

01:08:26.189 --> 01:08:27.389
<v Speaker 1>I think it's

01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:29.870
<v Speaker 1>yeah. I think it might have crashed here,

01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:31.869
<v Speaker 1>but let's let's just go ahead and see.

01:08:32.029 --> 01:08:32.830
<v Speaker 1>Might have restarted.

01:08:34.465 --> 01:08:35.265
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

01:08:35.265 --> 01:08:38.545
<v Speaker 1>It's it's always fun. Okay. So so, yeah,

01:08:38.545 --> 01:08:41.744
<v Speaker 1>it'll it'll do this. It's it's probably about

01:08:42.145 --> 01:08:44.625
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's finger fingers crossed. I think

01:08:44.625 --> 01:08:46.305
<v Speaker 1>it's like 5% of the time it it

01:08:46.305 --> 01:08:49.185
<v Speaker 1>doesn't work a %, but that's that's okay.

01:08:49.350 --> 01:08:51.830
<v Speaker 1>That's that's the the stakeholders have deemed that

01:08:51.830 --> 01:08:53.750
<v Speaker 1>as acceptable for for this demo.

01:08:55.830 --> 01:08:57.350
<v Speaker 1>I'll go ahead and get this loaded up

01:08:57.350 --> 01:08:57.910
<v Speaker 1>too.

01:08:58.229 --> 01:08:59.189
<v Speaker 1>I'm using

01:08:59.750 --> 01:09:02.455
<v Speaker 1>the latest version here. I I think I've

01:09:02.455 --> 01:09:04.455
<v Speaker 1>migrated my account to I I I haven't

01:09:04.455 --> 01:09:06.375
<v Speaker 1>checked out some of the newer Minecraft stuff

01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:07.734
<v Speaker 1>in dungeons. I've heard it's a lot of

01:09:07.734 --> 01:09:09.814
<v Speaker 1>fun, but I got some coworkers that are

01:09:09.814 --> 01:09:11.975
<v Speaker 1>are quite deep into dungeons,

01:09:11.975 --> 01:09:14.295
<v Speaker 1>funny enough. But definitely, you need to check

01:09:14.295 --> 01:09:14.854
<v Speaker 1>that out later.

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:20.800
<v Speaker 1>We'll do this. The music, didn't pipe through,

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:22.160
<v Speaker 1>so it might be a little bit loud

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:24.479
<v Speaker 1>on my end, but whatever. That's just that

01:09:24.479 --> 01:09:26.479
<v Speaker 1>makes it more engaging for me. I'll I'll

01:09:26.479 --> 01:09:28.479
<v Speaker 1>save you from blowing out your eardrums.

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:30.000
<v Speaker 1>Cool.

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:31.600
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

01:09:32.085 --> 01:09:32.725
<v Speaker 1>So

01:09:33.685 --> 01:09:36.405
<v Speaker 1>let's go ahead and actually get this

01:09:36.805 --> 01:09:38.165
<v Speaker 1>get this service.

01:09:38.725 --> 01:09:40.484
<v Speaker 1>Let me pump this up.

01:09:42.245 --> 01:09:43.125
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

01:09:43.365 --> 01:09:44.165
<v Speaker 1>And

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:45.840
<v Speaker 1>so

01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:47.520
<v Speaker 1>oh, that's right.

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:50.000
<v Speaker 1>Let's go ahead and close that. I don't

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.600
<v Speaker 1>I use one time logins in my terminal

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:56.240
<v Speaker 1>and so I don't have AWS credentials over

01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:59.040
<v Speaker 1>there. Shoot. But I I have them over

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:00.160
<v Speaker 1>here so I'll go ahead and get them

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:00.400
<v Speaker 1>here.

01:10:03.655 --> 01:10:04.455
<v Speaker 1>Alright.

01:10:04.535 --> 01:10:05.175
<v Speaker 1>So

01:10:05.335 --> 01:10:07.095
<v Speaker 1>this is the

01:10:07.815 --> 01:10:09.575
<v Speaker 1>cool. This is what I want. This is

01:10:09.575 --> 01:10:11.495
<v Speaker 1>going to be the load balancer that is

01:10:11.495 --> 01:10:13.255
<v Speaker 1>in front of our Minecraft server.

01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:16.389
<v Speaker 1>It's it's all up and running. We check

01:10:16.389 --> 01:10:18.070
<v Speaker 1>the logs. We're good to go. I'm gonna

01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:19.349
<v Speaker 1>go ahead and pull those logs back up

01:10:19.349 --> 01:10:21.349
<v Speaker 1>so you can actually see me join into

01:10:21.349 --> 01:10:22.229
<v Speaker 1>that session.

01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Clear the buffer and let's do a direct

01:10:25.270 --> 01:10:27.110
<v Speaker 1>connection. We can see we've got a load

01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:27.989
<v Speaker 1>balancer from before.

01:10:29.885 --> 01:10:31.005
<v Speaker 1>Clear that out.

01:10:31.324 --> 01:10:34.125
<v Speaker 1>Join that server and then we should see

01:10:34.525 --> 01:10:37.085
<v Speaker 1>only dull is my moniker over here. We

01:10:37.085 --> 01:10:39.005
<v Speaker 1>could actually see that I've joined the game.

01:10:39.085 --> 01:10:41.085
<v Speaker 1>I can run around. Hopefully, this isn't clipping

01:10:41.085 --> 01:10:43.005
<v Speaker 1>too bad for for anyone. I think I've

01:10:43.005 --> 01:10:44.364
<v Speaker 1>done some streams in the past and spend

01:10:44.364 --> 01:10:47.010
<v Speaker 1>like lag lag lag. But

01:10:47.889 --> 01:10:49.810
<v Speaker 1>but yeah, we could we could enhance this.

01:10:49.810 --> 01:10:51.409
<v Speaker 1>We could add in the ability to like

01:10:51.409 --> 01:10:52.849
<v Speaker 1>jump and fly.

01:10:53.170 --> 01:10:56.210
<v Speaker 1>This is just very very base bone bare

01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:59.315
<v Speaker 1>bones right now. Not not too much functionality

01:10:59.315 --> 01:11:02.275
<v Speaker 1>added, you know, pretty pretty static but we've

01:11:02.275 --> 01:11:03.795
<v Speaker 1>done it. You know, we could we could

01:11:03.795 --> 01:11:05.475
<v Speaker 1>have people all over the world joining our

01:11:05.475 --> 01:11:08.195
<v Speaker 1>Minecraft server and we deployed it with Waypoint.

01:11:08.755 --> 01:11:09.954
<v Speaker 1>Like David said,

01:11:10.275 --> 01:11:12.600
<v Speaker 1>quite a quite a few many opportunities to

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:14.360
<v Speaker 1>we could enhance this. We could add entry

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:14.920
<v Speaker 1>points.

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.720
<v Speaker 1>We could even add, like, configuration map integration

01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:18.680
<v Speaker 1>with Kubernetes.

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:20.520
<v Speaker 1>We could add in some secrets of vaults

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:22.840
<v Speaker 1>and kinda make something shift around and change.

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:24.784
<v Speaker 1>And it seems you've got me thinking, David.

01:11:24.784 --> 01:11:26.784
<v Speaker 1>I might have to let you know when

01:11:26.784 --> 01:11:28.065
<v Speaker 1>we have a v two of this demo

01:11:28.065 --> 01:11:30.304
<v Speaker 1>because that's I I didn't realize how much

01:11:30.304 --> 01:11:31.665
<v Speaker 1>more we could actually do. This would be

01:11:31.665 --> 01:11:32.385
<v Speaker 1>kind of fun.

01:11:33.265 --> 01:11:35.905
<v Speaker 1>That Awesome. That concludes my my demos. I'll

01:11:35.905 --> 01:11:37.800
<v Speaker 1>go ahead and disconnect. You'll see that I

01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:40.920
<v Speaker 1>just left the game, and that is that's

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:42.040
<v Speaker 1>Waypoint, folks.

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:44.360
<v Speaker 0>Awesome. Thank you very much for that. Let

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:45.880
<v Speaker 0>me pop us back over

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:47.160
<v Speaker 0>here.

01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:48.840
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

01:11:49.415 --> 01:11:53.175
<v Speaker 0>Three really great demos. Nothing went wrong, annoyingly.

01:11:53.175 --> 01:11:53.895
<v Speaker 0>Well done.

01:11:54.935 --> 01:11:56.375
<v Speaker 0>I think each

01:11:57.175 --> 01:11:59.335
<v Speaker 0>of those demos really helped cement the idea

01:11:59.335 --> 01:12:02.055
<v Speaker 0>of where Waypoint fits in, what its responsibilities

01:12:02.055 --> 01:12:03.415
<v Speaker 0>are, and I think that's the the best

01:12:03.415 --> 01:12:05.409
<v Speaker 0>takeaway we can get here. In fact, we

01:12:05.409 --> 01:12:07.729
<v Speaker 0>got a a comment to send demos great.

01:12:07.809 --> 01:12:09.969
<v Speaker 0>It shows how Waypoint is progressing and I

01:12:09.969 --> 01:12:11.170
<v Speaker 0>do get it more than when it's first

01:12:11.170 --> 01:12:12.609
<v Speaker 0>released. Yeah. Me too.

01:12:13.329 --> 01:12:15.650
<v Speaker 0>I I I was confused. Today, I'm no

01:12:15.650 --> 01:12:17.329
<v Speaker 0>longer confused. So thank you very much for

01:12:17.329 --> 01:12:20.475
<v Speaker 0>that. We got another comment from Russell w.

01:12:20.475 --> 01:12:22.795
<v Speaker 0>I find we do things differently here equals

01:12:22.795 --> 01:12:24.635
<v Speaker 0>we never read the documentation.

01:12:25.035 --> 01:12:26.635
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. There's there's probably

01:12:27.115 --> 01:12:28.075
<v Speaker 0>a bit of that.

01:12:29.595 --> 01:12:33.670
<v Speaker 1>That's funny. Alright. Awesome. So if anyone has

01:12:33.670 --> 01:12:35.430
<v Speaker 0>any more questions in the chat, you've got

01:12:35.430 --> 01:12:37.350
<v Speaker 0>about one or two minutes to get it

01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:40.150
<v Speaker 0>in. Otherwise, we will be saying goodbye and

01:12:40.150 --> 01:12:41.190
<v Speaker 0>leaving it there.

01:12:41.830 --> 01:12:44.645
<v Speaker 0>So what's next for Waypoint? Can you share

01:12:44.645 --> 01:12:46.564
<v Speaker 0>any any juicy gossip of us?

01:12:47.284 --> 01:12:49.844
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. So that's it's and and one

01:12:49.844 --> 01:12:51.125
<v Speaker 1>of the fun things too. I used to

01:12:51.125 --> 01:12:53.684
<v Speaker 1>work at Walt Disney Studios prior to working

01:12:53.684 --> 01:12:55.780
<v Speaker 1>at Hashicorp, and so it was very difficult

01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:58.179
<v Speaker 1>to talk about. You can't talk about movies

01:12:58.179 --> 01:13:00.260
<v Speaker 1>and things that are happening. So I I

01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:01.699
<v Speaker 1>I do like being able to work more

01:13:01.699 --> 01:13:03.380
<v Speaker 1>in open source and being able to talk

01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:05.300
<v Speaker 1>and and kinda share on that front. But

01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:08.500
<v Speaker 1>so so really so, zero five was really

01:13:08.755 --> 01:13:10.675
<v Speaker 1>focused on this visibility,

01:13:10.675 --> 01:13:11.715
<v Speaker 1>this governance,

01:13:11.715 --> 01:13:15.395
<v Speaker 1>this, you know, input variables, OpenID Connect, those

01:13:15.395 --> 01:13:17.395
<v Speaker 1>statuses that that I just kinda, like, very

01:13:17.395 --> 01:13:20.595
<v Speaker 1>quickly walked through. And so zero six is

01:13:20.595 --> 01:13:22.915
<v Speaker 1>really going to be more focused on platform

01:13:22.915 --> 01:13:25.050
<v Speaker 1>is is the initial thought. So when it

01:13:25.050 --> 01:13:27.769
<v Speaker 1>comes to making those Kubernetes workflows work better,

01:13:28.409 --> 01:13:30.889
<v Speaker 1>if you're running on something like ECS or

01:13:30.889 --> 01:13:32.969
<v Speaker 1>Nomad, that's kind of going to be the

01:13:32.969 --> 01:13:35.369
<v Speaker 1>the more generic drop in that focus is

01:13:35.369 --> 01:13:37.625
<v Speaker 1>what it's looking like right now. So as

01:13:37.625 --> 01:13:39.705
<v Speaker 1>we start to, like, do sprint planning and

01:13:39.705 --> 01:13:41.625
<v Speaker 1>and identify some more things that we want

01:13:41.625 --> 01:13:43.625
<v Speaker 1>to do, you you'll see those things get

01:13:43.625 --> 01:13:46.585
<v Speaker 1>added to the zero six milestone within GitHub.

01:13:46.585 --> 01:13:48.344
<v Speaker 1>That's the best place to tune in and

01:13:48.344 --> 01:13:49.545
<v Speaker 1>check to check things out.

01:13:50.230 --> 01:13:51.670
<v Speaker 1>I think that there might have been a

01:13:51.670 --> 01:13:53.110
<v Speaker 1>public board at one point in time, but

01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:55.030
<v Speaker 1>I'd say milestone's probably the best thing to

01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:55.909
<v Speaker 1>take a look at

01:13:56.710 --> 01:13:58.470
<v Speaker 1>if if you're curious on things that are

01:13:58.470 --> 01:14:00.230
<v Speaker 1>upcoming or things that got kinda pulled down

01:14:00.230 --> 01:14:02.070
<v Speaker 1>and and planned as it moves into those

01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:04.585
<v Speaker 1>phases. So I'm really excited to see what

01:14:04.585 --> 01:14:06.905
<v Speaker 1>makes it. As with any release, you know,

01:14:06.905 --> 01:14:08.744
<v Speaker 1>there's things that get worked on, things that

01:14:08.744 --> 01:14:10.185
<v Speaker 1>don't make the cut that fall on the

01:14:10.185 --> 01:14:11.545
<v Speaker 1>the cutting room floor.

01:14:11.864 --> 01:14:13.304
<v Speaker 1>But the good news about that is they

01:14:13.304 --> 01:14:15.400
<v Speaker 1>don't get put in as DVD extras. They

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:17.000
<v Speaker 1>probably just get deferred to a later release

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.160
<v Speaker 1>or a minor release. So that's that's always

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:19.880
<v Speaker 1>good to know.

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:21.320
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:23.960
<v Speaker 0>We have a tongue in cheek question from

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:27.560
<v Speaker 0>Russell. So which movies are HashiCorp Studios releasing

01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:27.880
<v Speaker 0>next?

01:14:28.985 --> 01:14:30.905
<v Speaker 1>It's I I I can't talk about that.

01:14:30.905 --> 01:14:33.224
<v Speaker 1>I I can't talk about that. But

01:14:34.264 --> 01:14:35.784
<v Speaker 1>maybe

01:14:35.784 --> 01:14:38.025
<v Speaker 1>maybe we could talk with Mitchell and Arman

01:14:38.025 --> 01:14:39.465
<v Speaker 1>about that. You know? Maybe we wanna start

01:14:39.465 --> 01:14:41.385
<v Speaker 1>up a new a new studio. It seems

01:14:41.385 --> 01:14:42.985
<v Speaker 1>like there are a lot of streaming platforms

01:14:42.985 --> 01:14:43.145
<v Speaker 1>now.

01:14:43.970 --> 01:14:46.690
<v Speaker 1>Definitely learned some things at at previous job

01:14:46.690 --> 01:14:49.330
<v Speaker 1>with the with streaming platforms. So I'll get

01:14:49.330 --> 01:14:50.850
<v Speaker 1>back to you on that. Yeah. I mean,

01:14:50.850 --> 01:14:52.290
<v Speaker 0>Mitchell might be looking for some new things

01:14:52.290 --> 01:14:53.570
<v Speaker 0>to do. Now he's got a bit more

01:14:53.570 --> 01:14:56.770
<v Speaker 0>time. So maybe maybe HashiCorp Studios is the

01:14:56.770 --> 01:14:57.570
<v Speaker 0>next venture. Right?

01:14:58.585 --> 01:15:00.184
<v Speaker 0>Alright. I don't think we're gonna get any

01:15:00.184 --> 01:15:02.025
<v Speaker 0>more questions. So, Taylor, I'm gonna leave it

01:15:02.025 --> 01:15:03.304
<v Speaker 0>there. I'm gonna say thank you so much

01:15:03.304 --> 01:15:04.264
<v Speaker 0>for joining us.

01:15:04.744 --> 01:15:06.744
<v Speaker 0>Really, really great demos. They they really helped

01:15:06.744 --> 01:15:09.385
<v Speaker 0>my understanding of Waypoint and others. So thank

01:15:09.385 --> 01:15:11.224
<v Speaker 0>you for that. And hopefully, we get to

01:15:11.224 --> 01:15:13.385
<v Speaker 0>do something again soon. So have a wonderful

01:15:13.385 --> 01:15:15.219
<v Speaker 0>day, and I'll speak to you later.

01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:17.540
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much, David. Thanks everybody for

01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:18.820
<v Speaker 1>joining. Cheers. Bye.
