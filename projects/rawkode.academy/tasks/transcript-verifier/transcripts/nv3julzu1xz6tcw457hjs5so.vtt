00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
<v Speaker 0>Hey, everyone. Unfortunately, Laura couldn't join us today

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.600
<v Speaker 0>for this episode. So, obviously, there's about 200%

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.240
<v Speaker 0>less snarky comments. Well I'll let you decide

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.920
<v Speaker 0>if that's a win. Sorry. I sent an

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.639
<v Speaker 0>AI ducky instead. Speaking of ducky's, if Karai

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:14.480
<v Speaker 0>looks like a statue for the last five

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.414
<v Speaker 0>minutes, don't adjust your screen. The machines let

00:00:17.414 --> 00:00:18.935
<v Speaker 0>us down. We tried to fix them with

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:21.335
<v Speaker 0>AI, but David's Linux machine is about as

00:00:21.335 --> 00:00:24.294
<v Speaker 0>useful as a ducky at fixing video. Enjoy

00:00:24.294 --> 00:00:26.695
<v Speaker 0>this episode. Welcome, and thank you for joining

00:00:26.695 --> 00:00:28.615
<v Speaker 0>me on today's episode of Cloud Native Compass.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.599
<v Speaker 0>Hello, Karai. For anyone who's not familiar with

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.120
<v Speaker 0>your work, could you please take a few

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.480
<v Speaker 0>moments just to tell us a little bit

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.120
<v Speaker 0>about you? Yeah, sure. So, yeah, my name

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.760
<v Speaker 1>is Karai. I'm Turkish. I live in Istanbul.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.295
<v Speaker 1>Nowadays, for the last almost four years, worked

00:00:43.295 --> 00:00:46.175
<v Speaker 1>for a company called Kubernetes, where we help

00:00:46.175 --> 00:00:49.215
<v Speaker 1>people or help companies with their cloud native

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.135
<v Speaker 1>and Kubernetes journeys.

00:00:51.775 --> 00:00:53.935
<v Speaker 1>Prior to that, I worked as

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.050
<v Speaker 1>DevOps engineer,

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:56.930
<v Speaker 1>operations

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:57.890
<v Speaker 1>engineer,

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.329
<v Speaker 1>SysAdmin.

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.809
<v Speaker 1>So I was always on the operations

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.049
<v Speaker 1>side. I would say I've never worked as

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.930
<v Speaker 1>a developer.

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean, from

00:01:07.475 --> 00:01:09.155
<v Speaker 1>Unix Linux background,

00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:11.314
<v Speaker 1>but yeah, nowadays it's Kubernetes

00:01:11.314 --> 00:01:12.594
<v Speaker 1>mostly. I

00:01:12.835 --> 00:01:13.634
<v Speaker 1>married,

00:01:13.715 --> 00:01:14.994
<v Speaker 1>I have two kids.

00:01:15.155 --> 00:01:18.515
<v Speaker 1>Life is fun with them and also with

00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:19.395
<v Speaker 1>cloud, everything.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.010
<v Speaker 1>I was selected as CNCF

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.370
<v Speaker 1>ambassador since last year. I have also bunch

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.090
<v Speaker 1>of certificates now. I'm a cube astronaut.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.610
<v Speaker 1>They will announce a golden cube astronaut soon,

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.675
<v Speaker 1>I think, which is for the old CNCF

00:01:35.675 --> 00:01:36.635
<v Speaker 1>certificates.

00:01:36.635 --> 00:01:38.155
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think I'll go for that

00:01:38.155 --> 00:01:41.275
<v Speaker 1>one, but yeah, we'll see. Awesome. Yeah,

00:01:41.515 --> 00:01:43.675
<v Speaker 1>that's mostly it about me. All right. Thank

00:01:43.675 --> 00:01:45.355
<v Speaker 0>you for sharing all that. I am also

00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:47.850
<v Speaker 0>married with two kids and fun isn't normally

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.770
<v Speaker 0>the word I call it. Yeah, want to

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.330
<v Speaker 1>say fun, that's yeah, yeah, because they are

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.690
<v Speaker 1>my kids, they are my kids, I say

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.090
<v Speaker 1>fun, but bunch of other descriptions for that

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.210
<v Speaker 1>I totally agree.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.770
<v Speaker 0>Alright, awesome. Again, thank you for sharing. So

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.594
<v Speaker 0>let's dive into that a little bit. Cloud

00:02:01.594 --> 00:02:03.914
<v Speaker 0>native and Kubernetes for four years now. Yep.

00:02:03.914 --> 00:02:06.475
<v Speaker 0>Now as a CNCF ambassador, and congratulations on

00:02:06.475 --> 00:02:08.555
<v Speaker 0>that. It's a fantastic tale to hold. Thanks.

00:02:08.555 --> 00:02:11.035
<v Speaker 0>I'm assuming you've been in this space

00:02:11.435 --> 00:02:13.569
<v Speaker 0>for a while. So could you maybe share

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.410
<v Speaker 0>and let us understand how did you end

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.209
<v Speaker 0>up in this whole Kubernetes cloud native landscape?

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.489
<v Speaker 1>You need to be lucky to start working

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.730
<v Speaker 1>for a company like Kubernetes where

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.724
<v Speaker 1>their main work is Kubernetes and cloud native.

00:02:27.724 --> 00:02:30.364
<v Speaker 1>So there is a job opening and a

00:02:30.364 --> 00:02:32.605
<v Speaker 1>lot of really qualified people apply for it,

00:02:32.605 --> 00:02:34.125
<v Speaker 1>but then you somehow

00:02:34.285 --> 00:02:35.245
<v Speaker 1>go through

00:02:35.485 --> 00:02:37.405
<v Speaker 1>the path and take the job. But for

00:02:37.405 --> 00:02:39.405
<v Speaker 1>me, at the beginning of my career, I

00:02:39.405 --> 00:02:42.230
<v Speaker 1>was mostly on the telco side, telecoms IT

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.350
<v Speaker 1>side, about

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.070
<v Speaker 1>working with the rating charging applications,

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.390
<v Speaker 1>billing applications, that sort of stuff.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.110
<v Speaker 1>That space is, you just work with mainly

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.095
<v Speaker 1>closed source, that software from companies like Ericsson

00:02:54.095 --> 00:02:56.894
<v Speaker 1>or Huawei, and that's the main thing. But

00:02:56.894 --> 00:02:59.455
<v Speaker 1>I always wanted to work for more on

00:02:59.455 --> 00:03:02.495
<v Speaker 1>source side more and more. My initial more

00:03:02.495 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 1>DevOps like work was at Ebank in The

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.060
<v Speaker 1>Netherlands. I was part of DevOps team, we

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.660
<v Speaker 1>were actually having those really CICD pipelines and

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.820
<v Speaker 1>everything, so more like edge work.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.620
<v Speaker 1>And then I joined the company here in

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.900
<v Speaker 1>Turkey where all the infrastructure was on Google

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.385
<v Speaker 1>Cloud, on GCP,

00:03:21.545 --> 00:03:24.105
<v Speaker 1>which also contains some GKE clusters as well.

00:03:24.105 --> 00:03:26.584
<v Speaker 1>I had started to work with OpenShift before

00:03:26.584 --> 00:03:29.705
<v Speaker 1>while I was at ING. So some initial,

00:03:29.705 --> 00:03:31.705
<v Speaker 1>let's say, or introduction to

00:03:32.025 --> 00:03:35.739
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes containers more. But then after I changed

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.980
<v Speaker 1>my job, so I just had to work

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.500
<v Speaker 1>with the containers,

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 1>GKE clusters,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.900
<v Speaker 1>also

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.460
<v Speaker 1>a lot of other services from GCP,

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.579
<v Speaker 1>which was fun. And I learned a lot

00:03:47.175 --> 00:03:50.375
<v Speaker 1>there. And later on, I joined Kubernetes. So

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:53.415
<v Speaker 1>you only work with managed

00:03:53.415 --> 00:03:55.815
<v Speaker 1>services like Cheeky or EKS.

00:03:55.895 --> 00:03:59.095
<v Speaker 1>You learn some part of the Kubernetes. Mainly

00:03:59.095 --> 00:04:00.535
<v Speaker 1>you learn to

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.490
<v Speaker 1>run your applications, run your workloads.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.650
<v Speaker 1>But of course, there are more to actually

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.610
<v Speaker 1>manage the cluster itself with its upgrades and

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.610
<v Speaker 1>stuff. So when you work on a managed

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:11.410
<v Speaker 1>environment,

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.650
<v Speaker 1>someone else does it for you or makes

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.375
<v Speaker 1>your life easier about that point. But later

00:04:16.375 --> 00:04:19.095
<v Speaker 1>on, I also started to work more on

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:23.175
<v Speaker 1>managing or not design, but architecting

00:04:23.415 --> 00:04:26.135
<v Speaker 1>clusters, the environments, infrastructures.

00:04:26.215 --> 00:04:28.055
<v Speaker 1>So back to the question, how I ended

00:04:28.055 --> 00:04:30.419
<v Speaker 1>up there, I really wanted to do this,

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.580
<v Speaker 1>but I was also lucky that it was

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.700
<v Speaker 1>after pandemic,

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.020
<v Speaker 1>like towards the end of pandemic, looking for

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.419
<v Speaker 1>a remote job and found it there and

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:39.139
<v Speaker 1>somehow

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.780
<v Speaker 1>passed the old interviews and got it, I

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.085
<v Speaker 1>don't know, luck somehow.

00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:45.245
<v Speaker 1>Of course you find your way, of course

00:04:45.245 --> 00:04:47.165
<v Speaker 1>you show that you are capable of doing

00:04:47.165 --> 00:04:49.725
<v Speaker 1>the job, etc. But in the end, I'm

00:04:49.725 --> 00:04:51.565
<v Speaker 1>quite happy with that. Yeah, what is it

00:04:51.565 --> 00:04:53.245
<v Speaker 0>they say? Luck is just, you know, where

00:04:53.245 --> 00:04:54.685
<v Speaker 0>skill meets preparation.

00:04:54.845 --> 00:04:57.085
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. So I'm assuming when you were working

00:04:57.085 --> 00:04:57.885
<v Speaker 0>for ING,

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.660
<v Speaker 0>was no Kubernetes there, right? No, there was

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.300
<v Speaker 1>a project to move towards OpenShift

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.460
<v Speaker 1>a little bit. Not there yet. At least

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.020
<v Speaker 1>my team, we were preparing our applications to

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.220
<v Speaker 1>move containers

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.585
<v Speaker 1>at that time, but then I left. I

00:05:11.585 --> 00:05:14.145
<v Speaker 1>think they continued. But my first introduction to

00:05:14.145 --> 00:05:16.465
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes was there with OpenShift.

00:05:16.945 --> 00:05:18.785
<v Speaker 0>Well, they're probably not there yet. I mean,

00:05:18.785 --> 00:05:20.625
<v Speaker 0>no disrespect to ING, but all banks seem

00:05:20.625 --> 00:05:22.305
<v Speaker 0>to move at a glacial pace. And that's

00:05:22.305 --> 00:05:24.385
<v Speaker 0>because the sensitivity of their product and their

00:05:24.385 --> 00:05:26.530
<v Speaker 0>data and all of that stuff is governed

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.370
<v Speaker 0>so much so that it slows it down.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, exactly. It's quite hard for telco companies,

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.010
<v Speaker 1>for banking

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:35.810
<v Speaker 1>to move towards. Definitely, they can't move to

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:36.850
<v Speaker 1>public clouds,

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.655
<v Speaker 1>at least for their core services, maybe their

00:05:39.655 --> 00:05:42.295
<v Speaker 1>websites or like some other stuff might be

00:05:42.295 --> 00:05:45.575
<v Speaker 1>some, I don't know, not data driven services

00:05:45.575 --> 00:05:48.375
<v Speaker 1>might be running on the public clouds, but

00:05:48.535 --> 00:05:52.055
<v Speaker 1>definitely not their core services. It's also issue

00:05:52.055 --> 00:05:54.520
<v Speaker 1>here in Turkey as well. There are, yeah,

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.000
<v Speaker 1>they just can't use AWS or GCP because

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.080
<v Speaker 1>there is no data center here. You are

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.080
<v Speaker 1>not allowed to send the data out of

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.040
<v Speaker 1>the country, like call records or bank bank

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.440
<v Speaker 1>account records, etcetera. Either they have their own

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.545
<v Speaker 1>data centers, their own on premise cloud, or

00:06:09.545 --> 00:06:12.345
<v Speaker 1>there are companies who do that for them,

00:06:12.425 --> 00:06:13.785
<v Speaker 1>of course. But, yeah, it's

00:06:14.105 --> 00:06:16.265
<v Speaker 1>not the same scale comparing to the other

00:06:16.265 --> 00:06:18.665
<v Speaker 1>ones. Alright. Well, I'm curious about I love

00:06:18.665 --> 00:06:19.945
<v Speaker 0>the fact that you're a trainer and a

00:06:19.945 --> 00:06:22.260
<v Speaker 0>consultant. So you're seeing multiple angles here. You're

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.139
<v Speaker 0>helping individuals and companies and teams level up

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.220
<v Speaker 0>their their skills. But as a consultant, you're

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.500
<v Speaker 0>also navigating architect and guiding, etcetera. And

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.380
<v Speaker 0>now that we are over ten years and

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.254
<v Speaker 0>to this Kubernetes thing is is ten years

00:06:35.254 --> 00:06:37.815
<v Speaker 0>old as a project. Yeah. What is

00:06:38.294 --> 00:06:39.974
<v Speaker 0>what is the skill level like? What is

00:06:39.974 --> 00:06:41.735
<v Speaker 0>the knowledge of people that you're working with

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:43.414
<v Speaker 0>these days? Have they had have they ever

00:06:43.414 --> 00:06:45.574
<v Speaker 0>worked with containers before, but they want Kubernetes?

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.910
<v Speaker 0>Have they just decided Kubernetes,

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.070
<v Speaker 0>even though they've got monoliths, like what does

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.150
<v Speaker 0>that look like? There are both of them.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.790
<v Speaker 1>So

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.830
<v Speaker 1>exactly some people get the training. Some people

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.350
<v Speaker 1>even we had some companies

00:06:58.015 --> 00:07:01.295
<v Speaker 1>where they get even Linux fundamentals training because

00:07:01.295 --> 00:07:03.295
<v Speaker 1>all they do is on Windows all the

00:07:03.295 --> 00:07:06.175
<v Speaker 1>time. So we just tell them, yeah, let's

00:07:06.175 --> 00:07:07.615
<v Speaker 1>start with Linux because

00:07:08.095 --> 00:07:10.175
<v Speaker 1>you will need it, at least some basic

00:07:10.175 --> 00:07:13.055
<v Speaker 1>understanding of how it works or what you

00:07:13.055 --> 00:07:15.300
<v Speaker 1>do. And then we go with the container

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.180
<v Speaker 1>fundamentals and then Kubernetes fundamentals, etcetera, that sort

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.380
<v Speaker 1>of stuff. So there are still companies who

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.140
<v Speaker 1>have never used containers

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.420
<v Speaker 1>before, or they're on the way

00:07:26.695 --> 00:07:28.935
<v Speaker 1>to start migrating. Those are the ones that

00:07:28.935 --> 00:07:30.535
<v Speaker 1>get the training, right? So they want to

00:07:30.535 --> 00:07:33.255
<v Speaker 1>migrate to containers or Kubernetes in general. So

00:07:33.255 --> 00:07:35.175
<v Speaker 1>that's why they get the training. But there

00:07:35.175 --> 00:07:37.415
<v Speaker 1>are also other companies where,

00:07:39.095 --> 00:07:40.449
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's right to say,

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:41.970
<v Speaker 1>but for example, they want to get away

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.850
<v Speaker 1>from VMware to some other solution. They've already

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:48.050
<v Speaker 1>using Tanzu, but due to the So they

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.330
<v Speaker 1>know Kubernetes,

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:51.889
<v Speaker 1>but they need some other sort of solution

00:07:51.889 --> 00:07:54.945
<v Speaker 1>because of yeah, licensing or whatever. Those are

00:07:54.945 --> 00:07:57.425
<v Speaker 1>also there, but both of them

00:07:57.985 --> 00:07:58.785
<v Speaker 1>exist.

00:07:58.865 --> 00:08:01.745
<v Speaker 1>And for us, for the people, probably for

00:08:01.745 --> 00:08:03.665
<v Speaker 1>you as well, Kubernetes is kind of not

00:08:03.665 --> 00:08:04.465
<v Speaker 1>boring, but

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.200
<v Speaker 1>yeah, we learned it and we know how

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.040
<v Speaker 1>it works. But for some people, it's some

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.680
<v Speaker 1>brand new technology. Sometimes I get surprised when

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.080
<v Speaker 1>I see on LinkedIn, there are posts like,

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Hey, here's how you can best practice for

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.315
<v Speaker 1>Docker files. I'm like, yeah, for me, this

00:08:19.315 --> 00:08:20.755
<v Speaker 1>was like ten years ago. I'm not ten,

00:08:20.755 --> 00:08:22.675
<v Speaker 1>five years ago, six years ago, but for

00:08:22.675 --> 00:08:24.355
<v Speaker 1>some people it's brand new. So

00:08:24.995 --> 00:08:27.635
<v Speaker 1>both of them exist. And another question or

00:08:27.635 --> 00:08:30.514
<v Speaker 1>another angle is that does everyone need to

00:08:30.514 --> 00:08:33.230
<v Speaker 1>move to containers? Everyone need to move to

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.190
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes?

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:35.950
<v Speaker 1>That's also another question. I mean,

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.950
<v Speaker 1>I think it's not for everyone

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:39.630
<v Speaker 1>like- Definitely.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.270
<v Speaker 1>Not for their use case. If their use

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:43.470
<v Speaker 1>case is

00:08:43.884 --> 00:08:46.925
<v Speaker 1>supporting it, then it's good. Again, multiple parameters,

00:08:46.925 --> 00:08:50.125
<v Speaker 1>some parameters are based on the regulations

00:08:50.125 --> 00:08:53.324
<v Speaker 1>like having data centers, local data centers, etcetera.

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:55.644
<v Speaker 1>But some of them are just, they are

00:08:55.644 --> 00:08:57.720
<v Speaker 1>too big companies to

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.480
<v Speaker 1>make changes easily. That's also other case,

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.120
<v Speaker 1>I think. Or they are just happy with

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.440
<v Speaker 1>their current infrastructure. It works fine and they

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.200
<v Speaker 1>just don't want to change it. That's that's

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.000
<v Speaker 1>also there. Yeah. So two things there. The

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.415
<v Speaker 0>VMware Broadcom is causing hysteria and mass migrations

00:09:14.415 --> 00:09:16.175
<v Speaker 0>across our industry. I I see it in

00:09:16.175 --> 00:09:18.255
<v Speaker 0>the limited capacity that I work with other

00:09:18.255 --> 00:09:20.735
<v Speaker 0>companies. Yep. But I I I ask curious

00:09:20.735 --> 00:09:22.975
<v Speaker 0>about that question because I go to a

00:09:22.975 --> 00:09:25.535
<v Speaker 0>lot of conferences and at those conferences, occasionally,

00:09:25.535 --> 00:09:28.015
<v Speaker 0>do three Kubernetes

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.110
<v Speaker 0>trainings or half days or or whatever. Mhmm.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:30.790
<v Speaker 0>And it's hard for me to gauge how

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:32.790
<v Speaker 0>many people are just gauge. Gosh. I don't

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.149
<v Speaker 0>even know what that word is now. It's

00:09:34.149 --> 00:09:35.350
<v Speaker 0>hard for me to understand.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:38.070
<v Speaker 0>People are just there because the training happens

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.310
<v Speaker 0>to be a conference they're at versus the

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.715
<v Speaker 0>people are specifically looking for Kubernetes Because I

00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:43.595
<v Speaker 0>often find

00:09:43.995 --> 00:09:45.835
<v Speaker 0>the people in that room and again, it's

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:47.195
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes trading.

00:09:47.275 --> 00:09:49.275
<v Speaker 0>When I ask them, have you used containers

00:09:49.275 --> 00:09:51.595
<v Speaker 0>before? It's still rare for

00:09:51.915 --> 00:09:53.195
<v Speaker 0>more than half the room to have their

00:09:53.195 --> 00:09:55.035
<v Speaker 0>hands up. Right? It's still the minority of

00:09:55.035 --> 00:09:56.875
<v Speaker 0>people that have played in used containers.

00:09:57.275 --> 00:09:58.830
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Forget even asking if they're using containers

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.670
<v Speaker 0>in production because it's still usually one or

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.590
<v Speaker 0>two hands. Yeah. Yeah. And then you say,

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:05.790
<v Speaker 0>who understands container technology and Linux primitives? And,

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.750
<v Speaker 0>again, almost zero hands are going up. And

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.430
<v Speaker 0>I never know if it's just because these

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.030
<v Speaker 0>people are just using the training because they're

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:13.675
<v Speaker 0>there, or maybe they're just being told they

00:10:13.675 --> 00:10:16.235
<v Speaker 0>need to learn Kubernetes because let's face it,

00:10:16.235 --> 00:10:19.115
<v Speaker 0>we're now in 2025 at a point where

00:10:19.115 --> 00:10:22.155
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes is this huge project with so much

00:10:22.155 --> 00:10:24.395
<v Speaker 0>momentum powered by the CNCF,

00:10:24.395 --> 00:10:27.060
<v Speaker 0>biggest conferences we've got and people just feel

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.339
<v Speaker 0>like I have to learn this thing.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.899
<v Speaker 0>But they've not been through the struggles and

00:10:30.899 --> 00:10:33.380
<v Speaker 0>tribulations to understand why that thing is important.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:34.820
<v Speaker 0>And I I was just curious from because

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.339
<v Speaker 0>you do a lot more training and consulting

00:10:36.339 --> 00:10:38.420
<v Speaker 0>of whether that is something that you're seeing

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:38.740
<v Speaker 0>as well.

00:10:39.725 --> 00:10:42.125
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. Yeah. Is definitely. From what you said,

00:10:42.125 --> 00:10:43.565
<v Speaker 0>I think you are right. You're this is

00:10:43.565 --> 00:10:45.885
<v Speaker 0>the same at least at some at

00:10:46.365 --> 00:10:47.965
<v Speaker 0>least to some degree, this is the same

00:10:47.965 --> 00:10:50.045
<v Speaker 0>journey that people are taking with your treatment

00:10:50.045 --> 00:10:53.430
<v Speaker 0>and consulting. Yeah, exactly. Again, there are people

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:56.470
<v Speaker 1>who have already been playing with and they

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:59.350
<v Speaker 1>just want to change their tooling to something

00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.910
<v Speaker 1>else.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:02.310
<v Speaker 1>But there are a lot of people,

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:05.670
<v Speaker 1>it's true. So there are people who have

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:08.415
<v Speaker 1>never done it or never worked with containers

00:11:08.415 --> 00:11:11.214
<v Speaker 1>before. That's fine. Maybe their company was not,

00:11:11.214 --> 00:11:12.255
<v Speaker 1>they didn't need to.

00:11:12.654 --> 00:11:15.055
<v Speaker 1>But there are also people who have been

00:11:15.055 --> 00:11:17.455
<v Speaker 1>working with it for a couple of years,

00:11:17.455 --> 00:11:19.214
<v Speaker 1>but they haven't understand

00:11:19.214 --> 00:11:21.695
<v Speaker 1>what's happening under the hood. That's also, I

00:11:21.695 --> 00:11:24.350
<v Speaker 1>think, I mean, people can argue that it's

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.990
<v Speaker 1>not important for a developer to understand. They

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:29.149
<v Speaker 1>just need to run their code. Someone just

00:11:29.149 --> 00:11:31.709
<v Speaker 1>packages it, like packages it as a container

00:11:31.709 --> 00:11:33.790
<v Speaker 1>and deploys it. In the end, the application

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:36.985
<v Speaker 1>is running. But I think to make use

00:11:36.985 --> 00:11:37.545
<v Speaker 1>of

00:11:37.865 --> 00:11:39.945
<v Speaker 1>the whole platform in the right way, I

00:11:39.945 --> 00:11:42.425
<v Speaker 1>think everyone needs to understand how it actually

00:11:43.385 --> 00:11:46.425
<v Speaker 1>works. What's happening there? What the container is?

00:11:46.505 --> 00:11:48.505
<v Speaker 1>Why it's there? Or what the pod is?

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:50.950
<v Speaker 1>What you can do with the pods, what

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:54.470
<v Speaker 1>sort of configurations or options you have there.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.710
<v Speaker 1>I think these are all important

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:59.670
<v Speaker 1>stuff. So I've seen many cases people running

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:02.070
<v Speaker 1>their pods or containers in privilege mode. Is

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:03.830
<v Speaker 1>there any reason for that? No. There are

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:06.065
<v Speaker 1>some pods that needs run-in the privilege mode.

00:12:06.065 --> 00:12:07.745
<v Speaker 1>Yes. But not probably

00:12:07.745 --> 00:12:10.385
<v Speaker 1>your normal workload, right? People

00:12:10.545 --> 00:12:12.944
<v Speaker 1>just copy paste stuff. And then if it

00:12:12.944 --> 00:12:15.185
<v Speaker 1>works and then they continue with it or

00:12:15.185 --> 00:12:17.264
<v Speaker 1>they just take it for granted and just

00:12:17.264 --> 00:12:20.225
<v Speaker 1>use it. But I think learning is important

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.839
<v Speaker 1>about how it's going. And

00:12:22.959 --> 00:12:24.800
<v Speaker 1>there is also a fact that the Kubernetes

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.720
<v Speaker 1>is quite complex system.

00:12:27.199 --> 00:12:30.000
<v Speaker 0>So yes, it makes it easy. I mean,

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.440
<v Speaker 1>if you only want to do a deployment

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.425
<v Speaker 1>of your application, it's easy. You just write

00:12:36.425 --> 00:12:38.345
<v Speaker 1>some YAML files, you have your container, it

00:12:38.345 --> 00:12:39.065
<v Speaker 1>just works.

00:12:39.385 --> 00:12:41.625
<v Speaker 1>But there are a lot of different stuff

00:12:41.625 --> 00:12:44.665
<v Speaker 1>going on happening in the background. So for

00:12:44.665 --> 00:12:46.505
<v Speaker 1>any system, I think also if you are

00:12:46.505 --> 00:12:49.065
<v Speaker 1>Linux admin or if you are Java developer,

00:12:49.065 --> 00:12:51.750
<v Speaker 1>you need to understand how the

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:54.390
<v Speaker 1>whole stuff is happening, how the garbage collection

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:56.630
<v Speaker 1>is happening. So I also in the past

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:58.710
<v Speaker 1>worked with some developers that they have no

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:00.470
<v Speaker 1>idea about the garbage collection or how it

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:01.910
<v Speaker 1>works or how it can be configured.

00:13:02.505 --> 00:13:05.625
<v Speaker 1>So that's, I think, general problem that people

00:13:05.625 --> 00:13:08.665
<v Speaker 1>don't care about this, but I think that's

00:13:08.665 --> 00:13:12.105
<v Speaker 1>the important part which makes the difference

00:13:12.105 --> 00:13:13.865
<v Speaker 1>whether you are a good developer or a

00:13:13.865 --> 00:13:16.920
<v Speaker 1>good IT person or do things right.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.120
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I think you're right. Learning is

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.000
<v Speaker 0>it never stops. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. Kubernetes

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.600
<v Speaker 0>is certainly not slowing down in the last

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.680
<v Speaker 0>ten years. Yeah. It's practice changing more now

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.920
<v Speaker 0>than it ever did. And I love what

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.840
<v Speaker 0>you said there, right? Everyone

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.105
<v Speaker 0>I think all online content is guilty of

00:13:33.105 --> 00:13:34.385
<v Speaker 0>this, and I'll put my hand up sometimes

00:13:34.385 --> 00:13:36.464
<v Speaker 0>to say I do this. Yeah. Giving someone

00:13:36.464 --> 00:13:38.225
<v Speaker 0>a YAML to do a deployment to Kubernetes

00:13:38.225 --> 00:13:40.385
<v Speaker 0>cluster doesn't teach people how to run workloads

00:13:40.385 --> 00:13:42.625
<v Speaker 0>on Kubernetes as 1% because,

00:13:43.265 --> 00:13:44.870
<v Speaker 0>of course, we've got the substrate. There's a

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.630
<v Speaker 0>control plane, the API server, the Kubernetes, all

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.070
<v Speaker 0>that. Now a lot of people can avoid

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:49.830
<v Speaker 0>that. They can use managed services.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:51.990
<v Speaker 0>But even even that little bit on the

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:53.830
<v Speaker 0>top, a little bit, the massive bit on

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:55.750
<v Speaker 0>the top, you know, to

00:13:56.295 --> 00:13:59.095
<v Speaker 0>let me rephrase this question. When you're teaching

00:13:59.095 --> 00:14:00.215
<v Speaker 0>people Kubernetes,

00:14:00.375 --> 00:14:02.055
<v Speaker 0>do you teach them to work with deployments

00:14:02.055 --> 00:14:04.135
<v Speaker 0>and services and endpoints and

00:14:04.455 --> 00:14:05.175
<v Speaker 0>stop?

00:14:05.575 --> 00:14:08.850
<v Speaker 0>Or do we set aside twelve days and

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:10.209
<v Speaker 0>say, okay. Now we have to learn get

00:14:10.209 --> 00:14:12.050
<v Speaker 0>ups. Now we have to learn observability.

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:13.730
<v Speaker 0>Now we have to learn continuous delivery. Now

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:15.410
<v Speaker 0>we've got to do progressive rollers. Now we've

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.410
<v Speaker 0>got to do automation within the cluster. Like,

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:19.730
<v Speaker 0>the land the surface of knowledge that people

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:22.450
<v Speaker 0>need not just to deploy to Kubernetes, but

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:24.209
<v Speaker 0>to be successful with Kubernetes

00:14:24.524 --> 00:14:27.485
<v Speaker 0>is a volatile landscape itself. I'm curious how

00:14:27.485 --> 00:14:28.365
<v Speaker 0>you tackle that.

00:14:29.165 --> 00:14:32.605
<v Speaker 1>The trainings, we have some agenda and talk

00:14:32.605 --> 00:14:35.404
<v Speaker 1>about those, but not like in deep, to

00:14:35.404 --> 00:14:37.660
<v Speaker 1>be honest. So it's also, for example, the

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:39.820
<v Speaker 1>GitOps question always comes in, how do we

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.140
<v Speaker 1>do this or can we do that this

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:43.260
<v Speaker 1>way, etcetera.

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.700
<v Speaker 1>For the trainings,

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.740
<v Speaker 1>we do or I do in general is

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.740
<v Speaker 1>that we talk about the objects,

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.339
<v Speaker 1>at least the

00:14:51.285 --> 00:14:54.805
<v Speaker 1>core objects and some extra ones like additional

00:14:54.805 --> 00:14:56.725
<v Speaker 1>ones like ingress, etcetera,

00:14:57.125 --> 00:14:59.285
<v Speaker 1>about what they do, why they are there,

00:14:59.285 --> 00:15:01.925
<v Speaker 1>the relation between the pod and the replica

00:15:01.925 --> 00:15:04.240
<v Speaker 1>set and the deployment and why stateful set

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.800
<v Speaker 1>is there, why we have daemon sets, etcetera,

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.040
<v Speaker 1>that sort of stuff, to understand how they

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.759
<v Speaker 1>work, why they exist, etcetera. But then there

00:15:11.759 --> 00:15:14.160
<v Speaker 1>are a lot of other topics. So these

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.120
<v Speaker 1>are like mentioned on the surface. Yeah, because

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.605
<v Speaker 1>of time limits, of But

00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:21.805
<v Speaker 1>I try to direct people to those topics.

00:15:21.805 --> 00:15:24.524
<v Speaker 1>You need to maybe look at the service

00:15:24.524 --> 00:15:25.325
<v Speaker 1>meshing.

00:15:25.404 --> 00:15:27.404
<v Speaker 1>You might need it. You don't have to

00:15:27.404 --> 00:15:29.964
<v Speaker 1>have service mesh, but you might need it

00:15:29.964 --> 00:15:31.245
<v Speaker 1>for this and that.

00:15:31.645 --> 00:15:33.325
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, you may need to use,

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.100
<v Speaker 1>you should use GitOps approach.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.340
<v Speaker 1>Which one, it doesn't matter if ArgoCD or

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.740
<v Speaker 1>Flux, whichever works for you. I like Flux

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.780
<v Speaker 1>more. ArgoCD is great. But yeah, in the

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.660
<v Speaker 1>end, it's about the result, right? So if

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:47.885
<v Speaker 1>you have

00:15:48.045 --> 00:15:51.165
<v Speaker 1>your manifest somewhere and then managing

00:15:51.325 --> 00:15:53.645
<v Speaker 1>your cluster over those manifests, it's great. Doesn't

00:15:53.645 --> 00:15:55.245
<v Speaker 1>matter which tool you are using. Yeah, I

00:15:55.245 --> 00:15:57.965
<v Speaker 0>like that approach. Like teach people the primitives.

00:15:57.965 --> 00:15:59.725
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Teach them everything that they need to

00:15:59.725 --> 00:16:01.325
<v Speaker 0>know and then give them a map of

00:16:01.325 --> 00:16:03.410
<v Speaker 0>the landscape for them to follow their path

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:05.890
<v Speaker 0>after that, because everybody, what they're trying to

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:07.890
<v Speaker 0>get out of Kubernetes is gonna be different

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:10.210
<v Speaker 0>depending on their use case and what they're

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:11.730
<v Speaker 0>trying to do with Exactly. And also the

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:14.290
<v Speaker 1>landscape is like too broad. There are

00:16:14.855 --> 00:16:17.735
<v Speaker 1>too many stuff that we can talk about.

00:16:17.735 --> 00:16:20.535
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It's also hard to keep up with

00:16:20.535 --> 00:16:21.654
<v Speaker 1>what's happening,

00:16:21.894 --> 00:16:25.175
<v Speaker 1>what's new tools. So you probably heard there's

00:16:25.175 --> 00:16:28.950
<v Speaker 1>a new tool, Krow, Kubernetes resource operator from

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:31.350
<v Speaker 1>AWS, GCP and Azure. They

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:34.630
<v Speaker 1>will be supporting that project. So it's like

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:37.430
<v Speaker 1>cross plane to some extent, but not exactly

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.015
<v Speaker 1>cross So you can simply create CRDs and

00:16:40.015 --> 00:16:42.815
<v Speaker 1>create another object like, I don't know, test

00:16:42.815 --> 00:16:43.615
<v Speaker 1>environment,

00:16:43.775 --> 00:16:46.015
<v Speaker 1>which consists of some deployments, maybe some database

00:16:46.015 --> 00:16:48.175
<v Speaker 1>on GCP or AWS, etcetera, that sort of

00:16:48.175 --> 00:16:51.055
<v Speaker 1>thing. But it's quite in early stage when

00:16:51.055 --> 00:16:51.535
<v Speaker 1>it's new.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.780
<v Speaker 1>Every day there is some new project, new

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:55.900
<v Speaker 1>things happening,

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.540
<v Speaker 1>and it's really hard to keep up with.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:59.580
<v Speaker 1>And also

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:02.140
<v Speaker 1>sometimes there are very

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:06.695
<v Speaker 1>powerful tools which is supported by that huge

00:17:06.695 --> 00:17:09.015
<v Speaker 1>company. And then another huge company says that,

00:17:09.015 --> 00:17:10.775
<v Speaker 1>hey, we have this one, which is faster

00:17:10.775 --> 00:17:12.855
<v Speaker 1>or it is blah, blah, blah. And then

00:17:12.855 --> 00:17:14.455
<v Speaker 1>you need to know both of them because

00:17:14.455 --> 00:17:17.655
<v Speaker 1>especially in our case, sometimes customer says, yeah,

00:17:17.655 --> 00:17:19.095
<v Speaker 1>we are on this platform. We want to

00:17:19.095 --> 00:17:21.175
<v Speaker 1>use this. And then they are on that

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.160
<v Speaker 1>platform, they want to use that. You can't,

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.040
<v Speaker 1>my job is not to mandate to or

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.399
<v Speaker 1>tell people to use

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.200
<v Speaker 1>OPA or Kiverno. I say like, hey, if

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.440
<v Speaker 1>you have OPA already use it, but if

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.840
<v Speaker 1>you want to have a new policy engine,

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:38.045
<v Speaker 1>Kiverno is more Kubernetes native. Okay, it's that

00:17:38.045 --> 00:17:39.645
<v Speaker 1>one, but it's your decision.

00:17:39.885 --> 00:17:41.965
<v Speaker 1>And then they say this and that. So

00:17:41.965 --> 00:17:45.485
<v Speaker 1>too many things to follow, not easy. Yeah.

00:17:45.485 --> 00:17:46.765
<v Speaker 0>When I go to conferences,

00:17:46.925 --> 00:17:49.350
<v Speaker 0>occasionally people will ask what cloud native database

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:51.990
<v Speaker 0>should I be using or what message queue

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:54.150
<v Speaker 0>is the best right now. And I hate

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:56.550
<v Speaker 0>those questions because one, my my default answer

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:57.670
<v Speaker 0>is what day of the week is it

00:17:57.670 --> 00:17:59.670
<v Speaker 0>because this stuff changes all the time. But

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:02.285
<v Speaker 0>secondly, asking what the best is comes down

00:18:02.285 --> 00:18:03.804
<v Speaker 0>to actually understand what you're trying to get

00:18:03.804 --> 00:18:05.485
<v Speaker 0>out of it. The best database is okay.

00:18:05.485 --> 00:18:07.804
<v Speaker 0>Do you want something stable that never changes,

00:18:07.804 --> 00:18:09.725
<v Speaker 0>but it is performant? Go with Postgres. But

00:18:09.725 --> 00:18:11.485
<v Speaker 0>do you want something that's future phasing and

00:18:11.485 --> 00:18:13.725
<v Speaker 0>doing cool stuff with rust and IO urging?

00:18:13.725 --> 00:18:15.325
<v Speaker 0>Oh, then maybe you should go see SeqStorm

00:18:15.325 --> 00:18:17.530
<v Speaker 0>or something. There's no right or wrong answer

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.210
<v Speaker 0>here. I think it comes down to just

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:22.410
<v Speaker 0>giving people that confidence and the ability to

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:24.250
<v Speaker 0>explore this landscape in a way that makes

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:26.170
<v Speaker 0>sense for them because the tools I pick

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:27.290
<v Speaker 0>are not gonna be the tools that you

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:28.410
<v Speaker 0>pick. And the tools that you pick are

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:29.450
<v Speaker 0>not gonna be the tools that someone else

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:32.195
<v Speaker 0>over there picks. And that landscape document is

00:18:32.195 --> 00:18:35.394
<v Speaker 0>just wild, isn't it? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Just

00:18:35.394 --> 00:18:37.394
<v Speaker 1>like I said about Flux and Argo CD,

00:18:37.394 --> 00:18:39.554
<v Speaker 1>I like Flux more because for me it's

00:18:39.554 --> 00:18:40.674
<v Speaker 1>more GitOps

00:18:40.755 --> 00:18:43.475
<v Speaker 1>style than Argo CD, but Argo CD is

00:18:43.475 --> 00:18:46.150
<v Speaker 1>also great. It's not a bad product or

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:48.550
<v Speaker 1>something. It's doing a great job and a

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:51.030
<v Speaker 1>lot of people using it. I also use

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:53.590
<v Speaker 1>it for with clients and projects,

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:56.550
<v Speaker 1>whichever works for you, whichever you feel like

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:59.495
<v Speaker 1>is better suited for your case. I think

00:18:59.495 --> 00:19:01.095
<v Speaker 1>that's fine. But again,

00:19:01.255 --> 00:19:03.575
<v Speaker 1>you need to follow many things and I

00:19:03.575 --> 00:19:05.735
<v Speaker 1>totally agree. There's there's no answer for which

00:19:05.735 --> 00:19:07.255
<v Speaker 1>one is the best. Which one suits you

00:19:07.255 --> 00:19:09.175
<v Speaker 1>best is would be a better question. Just

00:19:09.175 --> 00:19:11.655
<v Speaker 1>like you mentioned, like what you want and

00:19:11.655 --> 00:19:12.135
<v Speaker 1>then

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:14.929
<v Speaker 1>based on your requirement, this would be the

00:19:14.929 --> 00:19:16.929
<v Speaker 1>best option. I think that's but again, to

00:19:16.929 --> 00:19:18.210
<v Speaker 1>be able to do that, you need to

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:20.610
<v Speaker 1>first know what you want. And second, which

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:23.570
<v Speaker 1>tool provides that for you. All right. Now,

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:25.649
<v Speaker 0>just to put you on the spot, go

00:19:25.649 --> 00:19:27.535
<v Speaker 0>against everything you've just said now. I'm gonna

00:19:27.535 --> 00:19:30.095
<v Speaker 0>ask you to see what is your preferred,

00:19:30.095 --> 00:19:32.575
<v Speaker 0>not best, preferred C and I? To see

00:19:32.575 --> 00:19:33.135
<v Speaker 1>you.

00:19:33.615 --> 00:19:34.335
<v Speaker 0>Choice.

00:19:34.495 --> 00:19:37.934
<v Speaker 0>Alright. What's your preferred flavor of managed Kubernetes?

00:19:38.335 --> 00:19:38.815
<v Speaker 1>GKE.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.120
<v Speaker 0>Alright. Alright. Silly and JKE, that is the

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.600
<v Speaker 0>best because we both agree. Everyone listening, that's

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:45.800
<v Speaker 0>the one you should be using. Thank you

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.360
<v Speaker 0>very much. Alright. No. But serious talk. See

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.120
<v Speaker 0>this talk again. Now, obviously,

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.085
<v Speaker 0>some people listening to this are gonna be

00:19:52.085 --> 00:19:54.165
<v Speaker 0>hearing us talk about the complexities of Kubernetes,

00:19:54.165 --> 00:19:56.085
<v Speaker 0>the evolving cloud native landscape, and maybe be

00:19:56.085 --> 00:19:57.845
<v Speaker 0>a little bit worried about

00:19:58.245 --> 00:19:59.525
<v Speaker 0>do they even want to be in this

00:19:59.525 --> 00:20:01.205
<v Speaker 0>industry anymore because how the hell can they

00:20:01.205 --> 00:20:02.565
<v Speaker 0>keep up? There is a time and a

00:20:02.565 --> 00:20:05.365
<v Speaker 0>place to learn all the bets underneath

00:20:05.445 --> 00:20:07.600
<v Speaker 0>the under the water of the iceberg. And

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.040
<v Speaker 0>sometimes you could just skate along the top

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.960
<v Speaker 0>and have the managed service. And you're training

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.440
<v Speaker 0>and consulting. What is there any heuristics you've

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.759
<v Speaker 0>got to understand or help people understand? Are

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.920
<v Speaker 0>there any heuristics that you have came up

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.595
<v Speaker 0>with that help people understand when to make

00:20:19.595 --> 00:20:22.394
<v Speaker 0>that decision of just managed service versus getting

00:20:22.394 --> 00:20:24.794
<v Speaker 0>into the weeds of Kubernetes and cloud native?

00:20:24.794 --> 00:20:26.794
<v Speaker 1>In our case, to go back a little

00:20:26.794 --> 00:20:27.274
<v Speaker 1>bit,

00:20:27.674 --> 00:20:31.670
<v Speaker 1>product, Kubernetes product is simply to manage multi

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:34.470
<v Speaker 1>clusters on multi different clouds or multi different

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:36.710
<v Speaker 1>providers. So simply when we have, when you

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:37.910
<v Speaker 1>install KKP,

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:40.790
<v Speaker 1>you kind of have, you are able to

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:44.230
<v Speaker 1>provide managed Kubernetes to your clients, internal, external,

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:47.245
<v Speaker 1>whatever on different clouds. In that sense, what

00:20:47.245 --> 00:20:49.804
<v Speaker 1>we are providing is like

00:20:49.885 --> 00:20:51.725
<v Speaker 1>our customers become

00:20:51.805 --> 00:20:54.605
<v Speaker 1>or are able to have or provide many

00:20:54.605 --> 00:20:56.525
<v Speaker 1>services to many Kubernetes

00:20:56.525 --> 00:20:59.909
<v Speaker 1>classes to their customers. So in that sense,

00:20:59.909 --> 00:21:02.950
<v Speaker 1>that's my go to part mainly because we

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:05.510
<v Speaker 1>either sell this product and then working with

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:08.150
<v Speaker 1>it, or we are doing POCs, etcetera. But

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:10.950
<v Speaker 1>to your question in general, I think the

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:13.990
<v Speaker 1>first thing is about the experience

00:21:14.185 --> 00:21:17.785
<v Speaker 1>and number of people or the team size

00:21:17.785 --> 00:21:21.225
<v Speaker 1>of how you can manage the infrastructure

00:21:21.225 --> 00:21:23.625
<v Speaker 1>in general. So you will probably not have

00:21:23.625 --> 00:21:25.304
<v Speaker 1>one Kubernetes cluster,

00:21:25.465 --> 00:21:27.545
<v Speaker 1>but you will probably have a database

00:21:27.545 --> 00:21:29.960
<v Speaker 1>or some other infrastructure

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.960
<v Speaker 1>as well. And if you are already on

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.600
<v Speaker 1>public cloud, then I think with a small

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.559
<v Speaker 1>team, it makes sense to use a managed

00:21:37.639 --> 00:21:41.000
<v Speaker 1>service because you get some help already for

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.434
<v Speaker 1>the upgrades, for the maintenance or

00:21:45.154 --> 00:21:47.875
<v Speaker 1>health of the cluster in general. But if

00:21:47.875 --> 00:21:49.955
<v Speaker 1>you're on prem already and you have to

00:21:49.955 --> 00:21:52.115
<v Speaker 1>do things on prem, then you don't have

00:21:52.115 --> 00:21:54.114
<v Speaker 1>many options. Yeah, that's

00:21:54.434 --> 00:21:55.955
<v Speaker 1>it's there. I mean, you will have to

00:21:55.955 --> 00:21:58.270
<v Speaker 1>deal with but it's also okay, I think,

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:00.509
<v Speaker 1>if you want to have more freedom.

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:03.950
<v Speaker 1>For example, when you have a GKE cluster,

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:06.030
<v Speaker 1>you have a certain CNI installed there. So

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:07.550
<v Speaker 1>if you want to use Cilium, then you

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:10.350
<v Speaker 1>have to do a lot of extra stuff

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:13.065
<v Speaker 1>to make it install. I tried it once.

00:22:13.065 --> 00:22:15.785
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't successful. I didn't care. I just

00:22:15.785 --> 00:22:17.705
<v Speaker 1>tried to do it. I think it can

00:22:17.705 --> 00:22:20.505
<v Speaker 1>be done. It's documented. But yeah, you

00:22:20.905 --> 00:22:24.105
<v Speaker 1>can't make that choice. Or the choice to

00:22:24.105 --> 00:22:26.669
<v Speaker 1>have some other control plane tools, or you

00:22:26.669 --> 00:22:29.149
<v Speaker 1>cannot, for example, open feature gates on the

00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:32.270
<v Speaker 1>API server because you just use whatever is

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:35.149
<v Speaker 1>provided by them. But if you are experienced,

00:22:35.149 --> 00:22:37.470
<v Speaker 1>if you need those kind of stuff, I

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:38.830
<v Speaker 1>mean, if you have the team to be

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:41.725
<v Speaker 1>able to manage things, then just creating a

00:22:41.725 --> 00:22:44.205
<v Speaker 1>few on the cloud using Kube ADM to

00:22:44.205 --> 00:22:46.125
<v Speaker 1>create a cluster is also fine or some

00:22:46.125 --> 00:22:48.684
<v Speaker 1>other tools to have a cluster is there.

00:22:48.685 --> 00:22:51.005
<v Speaker 1>But I think my main concern would be

00:22:51.005 --> 00:22:52.125
<v Speaker 1>the experience

00:22:52.205 --> 00:22:52.924
<v Speaker 1>again.

00:22:53.245 --> 00:22:56.129
<v Speaker 1>And also if you really need to

00:22:56.529 --> 00:22:57.889
<v Speaker 1>make customizations

00:22:57.889 --> 00:22:59.490
<v Speaker 1>to that clusters.

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:01.490
<v Speaker 1>If you don't need it, then yeah, I

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:03.490
<v Speaker 1>think it's If you only want to run

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:05.089
<v Speaker 1>a couple of workloads,

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:07.490
<v Speaker 1>then I think you can just go with

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:08.769
<v Speaker 1>the managed service,

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:10.370
<v Speaker 1>which would make the life easier for you.

00:23:10.585 --> 00:23:12.505
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I think that's a pretty solid answer.

00:23:12.505 --> 00:23:14.265
<v Speaker 0>If you're a one or two person team,

00:23:14.265 --> 00:23:16.665
<v Speaker 0>the operational complexity of Kubernetes and managing that

00:23:16.665 --> 00:23:17.305
<v Speaker 0>is gonna

00:23:18.025 --> 00:23:19.705
<v Speaker 0>be tough. Right? Yeah. I'm not even talking

00:23:19.705 --> 00:23:21.225
<v Speaker 0>about bare metal, even running that on the

00:23:21.225 --> 00:23:23.705
<v Speaker 0>cloud is going to be tough. Upgrades don't

00:23:23.705 --> 00:23:24.745
<v Speaker 0>always go seamlessly.

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:26.450
<v Speaker 0>I think managed services

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:29.250
<v Speaker 0>are probably the the best approach for most

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:31.010
<v Speaker 0>people, but I liked your caveat as well.

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:33.010
<v Speaker 0>Kubernetes is a fast evolving project. It does

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:34.450
<v Speaker 0>have feature case. It does have things you

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:36.610
<v Speaker 0>can configure at each level of the control

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:39.364
<v Speaker 0>plane. And if you need that level of,

00:23:39.525 --> 00:23:41.284
<v Speaker 0>I don't know, configuration to a point, if

00:23:41.284 --> 00:23:42.484
<v Speaker 0>you're doing HPC,

00:23:42.645 --> 00:23:43.924
<v Speaker 0>then yeah, you're going to have to go

00:23:43.924 --> 00:23:45.205
<v Speaker 0>alone and you're going to have to configure

00:23:45.205 --> 00:23:46.885
<v Speaker 0>it this way. And then if you are

00:23:46.885 --> 00:23:47.845
<v Speaker 0>on bare metal,

00:23:48.405 --> 00:23:50.885
<v Speaker 0>good luck because storage on bare metal is

00:23:50.885 --> 00:23:53.450
<v Speaker 0>such a huge problem. True. There are also

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:56.090
<v Speaker 1>not many solutions there and they all have

00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:58.650
<v Speaker 1>issues, let's say. They're all expensive either is

00:23:58.650 --> 00:23:59.290
<v Speaker 0>your time or

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:01.210
<v Speaker 0>is money expensive?

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:05.370
<v Speaker 1>I agree. All right. So I'm curious then,

00:24:05.385 --> 00:24:07.865
<v Speaker 0>you're a well versed person in Kubernetes and

00:24:07.865 --> 00:24:10.105
<v Speaker 0>cloud native. I'm assuming you're always looking at

00:24:10.105 --> 00:24:11.385
<v Speaker 0>new shiny technologies.

00:24:11.385 --> 00:24:13.065
<v Speaker 0>Is there anything in the future that you

00:24:13.065 --> 00:24:14.825
<v Speaker 0>think is gonna play a bigger part in

00:24:14.825 --> 00:24:18.025
<v Speaker 0>our industry? Any technologies that you're interested and

00:24:18.025 --> 00:24:20.745
<v Speaker 0>excited by playing with experiment with anything like

00:24:20.745 --> 00:24:23.400
<v Speaker 0>that? I'm not very good at about to

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.960
<v Speaker 1>predict the future, about technical stuff.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, nowadays

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.600
<v Speaker 1>AI is the whole buzzword and everyone is

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.440
<v Speaker 1>talking about it and also- We almost made

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.399
<v Speaker 0>an episode without saying AI. Yeah, sorry

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.925
<v Speaker 1>about No, I will not say, but the

00:24:37.925 --> 00:24:40.405
<v Speaker 1>thing is that CNCF is also pushing it

00:24:40.405 --> 00:24:43.125
<v Speaker 1>to run the AI workloads on Kubernetes as

00:24:43.125 --> 00:24:45.205
<v Speaker 1>well to make things together.

00:24:45.525 --> 00:24:47.605
<v Speaker 1>So I think things are going on this

00:24:47.605 --> 00:24:49.919
<v Speaker 1>direction, at least they are pushed on this

00:24:49.919 --> 00:24:52.640
<v Speaker 1>direction. But I also can't predict that every

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.480
<v Speaker 1>day on that side, on the AI side,

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.759
<v Speaker 1>are some new,

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.120
<v Speaker 1>some something new. It's also hard to follow

00:24:59.120 --> 00:24:59.759
<v Speaker 1>there.

00:25:00.159 --> 00:25:03.684
<v Speaker 1>But other than that, I think for Kubernetes

00:25:03.684 --> 00:25:05.044
<v Speaker 1>definitely will stay

00:25:05.525 --> 00:25:07.044
<v Speaker 1>for a few years.

00:25:07.365 --> 00:25:10.885
<v Speaker 1>Again, there are people who recently moved there

00:25:10.885 --> 00:25:13.845
<v Speaker 1>and especially for enterprise companies, which means that

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.720
<v Speaker 1>you'll get five years support for

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:20.080
<v Speaker 1>whatever products, three years support is already there.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.480
<v Speaker 1>So I think Kubernetes will be, will stay

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.560
<v Speaker 1>here for a long time. There was a

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.800
<v Speaker 1>talk in one of the conferences

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.240
<v Speaker 1>a couple of years ago. The idea was

00:25:29.895 --> 00:25:32.615
<v Speaker 1>simply that we make some new things. They

00:25:32.615 --> 00:25:36.135
<v Speaker 1>are like great, they do the job, they're

00:25:36.455 --> 00:25:39.015
<v Speaker 1>elegant, nice, small things and then we make

00:25:39.015 --> 00:25:39.975
<v Speaker 1>them complex.

00:25:40.135 --> 00:25:42.535
<v Speaker 1>And at some complexity people say that, hey,

00:25:42.535 --> 00:25:43.895
<v Speaker 1>it's

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:45.990
<v Speaker 1>too much. We need something like something that

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:48.549
<v Speaker 1>does the job, something small, something easier to

00:25:48.549 --> 00:25:51.190
<v Speaker 1>manage, then we create it. And then again,

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:53.669
<v Speaker 1>it becomes complex because of everyone wants to

00:25:53.669 --> 00:25:56.309
<v Speaker 1>do something extra. So I think Kubernetes is

00:25:56.309 --> 00:25:59.030
<v Speaker 1>in that stage now. Initially it was

00:25:59.404 --> 00:26:01.005
<v Speaker 1>still doing a great job, but it was

00:26:01.005 --> 00:26:03.404
<v Speaker 1>like just to run the containers in a

00:26:03.404 --> 00:26:07.005
<v Speaker 1>more production like environment with peeling and running

00:26:07.005 --> 00:26:08.924
<v Speaker 1>multiple nodes, etcetera.

00:26:09.085 --> 00:26:13.325
<v Speaker 1>But nowadays you can even manage your infrastructure

00:26:13.325 --> 00:26:16.680
<v Speaker 1>through Kubernetes with tools like Crossplane and others.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:19.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It again became complex. So probably at

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.720
<v Speaker 1>some point someone will say, yeah, that's too

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.480
<v Speaker 1>much. I just want to run my workloads

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.080
<v Speaker 1>and here's a new tool.

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.995
<v Speaker 1>It's faster, it's blah, blah, blah. But I

00:26:27.995 --> 00:26:30.075
<v Speaker 1>don't know when this will happen or how

00:26:30.075 --> 00:26:33.354
<v Speaker 1>this will happen. I really can't predict that

00:26:33.434 --> 00:26:35.195
<v Speaker 1>much. But I think it will come to

00:26:35.195 --> 00:26:38.154
<v Speaker 1>that point because again, Kubernetes is a great

00:26:38.154 --> 00:26:40.154
<v Speaker 1>project. It has now

00:26:40.315 --> 00:26:41.674
<v Speaker 1>you can do a lot of stuff with

00:26:41.674 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 1>it. But yeah, it's also too complex and

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.980
<v Speaker 1>hard to learn. People will start over at

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:48.260
<v Speaker 1>some point probably

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:50.660
<v Speaker 1>to run their workloads. I don't want to

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:51.460
<v Speaker 1>say easier,

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:53.140
<v Speaker 1>like in a more, yeah,

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.645
<v Speaker 1>easier, but in a less complex environment. All

00:26:57.645 --> 00:27:00.125
<v Speaker 0>right. I'll allow that. Thanks. All right. I

00:27:00.125 --> 00:27:02.125
<v Speaker 0>have two more questions for you. One of

00:27:02.125 --> 00:27:04.445
<v Speaker 0>them a few minutes ago, mentioned having one

00:27:04.445 --> 00:27:06.845
<v Speaker 0>cluster or multiple clusters, and I think this

00:27:06.845 --> 00:27:07.325
<v Speaker 0>is

00:27:07.805 --> 00:27:09.485
<v Speaker 0>a problem that a lot of people struggle

00:27:09.485 --> 00:27:11.965
<v Speaker 0>with is should I have one huge cluster

00:27:11.965 --> 00:27:13.510
<v Speaker 0>with all my work loads or should I

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:15.430
<v Speaker 0>be running many small clusters? What are your

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:17.430
<v Speaker 0>thoughts on that? What would you consider best

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:20.550
<v Speaker 0>practice? As a consultant, my answer will be,

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:23.750
<v Speaker 1>it depends if you have like doing multi

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:26.150
<v Speaker 1>tenancy, if you have different type of workloads

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:27.110
<v Speaker 1>or running

00:27:27.274 --> 00:27:30.955
<v Speaker 1>many namespaces or different environments like dev test

00:27:30.955 --> 00:27:33.674
<v Speaker 1>in one cluster, maybe it makes sense to

00:27:33.914 --> 00:27:37.595
<v Speaker 1>separate them just because it would be easier

00:27:37.595 --> 00:27:41.355
<v Speaker 1>to manage that cluster. Manage meaning like to

00:27:41.355 --> 00:27:44.370
<v Speaker 1>do the upgrades, etcetera. So I mean, putting

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:46.610
<v Speaker 1>everything into one cluster is like putting all

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:48.450
<v Speaker 1>your eggs into one basket,

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:51.970
<v Speaker 1>I think if you can separate things, makes

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:54.530
<v Speaker 1>more sense to have more

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:57.895
<v Speaker 1>availability or like managing things easier. But that

00:27:57.895 --> 00:28:00.055
<v Speaker 1>doesn't also mean that instead of one huge

00:28:00.055 --> 00:28:03.255
<v Speaker 1>cluster, have a hundred clusters. That's also probably

00:28:03.255 --> 00:28:04.775
<v Speaker 1>not the best approach.

00:28:05.175 --> 00:28:07.335
<v Speaker 0>But clusters with one pod each. Yeah, yeah.

00:28:07.335 --> 00:28:09.895
<v Speaker 1>For example, yeah. That's also not the Then

00:28:09.895 --> 00:28:12.040
<v Speaker 1>just run back around, right? In a VM.

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.600
<v Speaker 1>You don't need Kubernetes there. Yeah, if you

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.960
<v Speaker 1>can separate things to different clusters, I think

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.080
<v Speaker 1>it makes

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.280
<v Speaker 1>sense to me because then if you lose

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.200
<v Speaker 1>one cluster, then the others might be running.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.245
<v Speaker 1>Or if you are doing an upgrade to

00:28:26.245 --> 00:28:29.365
<v Speaker 1>one of them, things fail, then you can

00:28:29.365 --> 00:28:31.445
<v Speaker 1>get the knowledge and then do things. You

00:28:31.445 --> 00:28:33.285
<v Speaker 1>have different environments, right? So you have dev

00:28:33.285 --> 00:28:36.245
<v Speaker 1>tests, staging, production, whatever. If they are on

00:28:36.245 --> 00:28:39.640
<v Speaker 1>separate clusters, then something fails on dev and

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.720
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that, yeah, okay, I need to

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.440
<v Speaker 1>I should do things differently on test and

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:47.640
<v Speaker 1>staging, etcetera. But if you put all of

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.320
<v Speaker 1>them at this not the production, but the

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.434
<v Speaker 1>others into one cluster in different namespaces,

00:28:52.434 --> 00:28:54.755
<v Speaker 1>then if during the upgrade if things fail

00:28:54.755 --> 00:28:58.195
<v Speaker 1>then you'll lose all your environments. So in

00:28:58.274 --> 00:29:00.354
<v Speaker 1>that sense separating them

00:29:00.755 --> 00:29:01.714
<v Speaker 1>makes sense

00:29:02.034 --> 00:29:02.514
<v Speaker 1>to me,

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:06.049
<v Speaker 1>But again, if you have the resource to

00:29:06.049 --> 00:29:08.929
<v Speaker 1>be able to manage those, etcetera. So it's,

00:29:08.929 --> 00:29:11.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if there's a right decision

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:14.130
<v Speaker 1>there or the right answer to this. Yeah.

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:15.570
<v Speaker 0>I think you've gave it. So I'm gonna

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:16.850
<v Speaker 0>try and present it back to you at

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:18.684
<v Speaker 0>one sentence. What I heard you say there

00:29:18.684 --> 00:29:21.965
<v Speaker 0>was that Kubernetes at the container workload level

00:29:21.965 --> 00:29:25.085
<v Speaker 0>gives us redundancy through horizontal scale. And then

00:29:25.085 --> 00:29:27.565
<v Speaker 0>depending on your company or teams, risk appetite,

00:29:27.565 --> 00:29:30.205
<v Speaker 0>at some point, you're gonna need cluster redundancy

00:29:30.205 --> 00:29:32.690
<v Speaker 0>as we're maybe splitting your workloads across Split

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:35.410
<v Speaker 0>your workloads horizontally as well. Your clusters horizontally

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:37.650
<v Speaker 0>as well may be the appropriate solution. So,

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:40.130
<v Speaker 0>yeah, I think definitely a good message in

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:41.330
<v Speaker 0>there for people listening.

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:43.730
<v Speaker 0>Oh, alright. Thanks thanks for rephrasing. That was

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:45.330
<v Speaker 1>even the right message. Thanks.

00:29:46.144 --> 00:29:48.384
<v Speaker 0>My superpower is to listen to people and

00:29:48.625 --> 00:29:50.384
<v Speaker 0>Thanks. See what they say back to them

00:29:50.384 --> 00:29:52.224
<v Speaker 0>and, you know, hopefully make that

00:29:52.784 --> 00:29:56.384
<v Speaker 1>Yeah. It is. Yeah. It Alright. Let's finish

00:29:56.384 --> 00:29:58.144
<v Speaker 0>with one last question. Please feel free to

00:29:58.144 --> 00:30:00.224
<v Speaker 0>take a minute to think about this one,

00:30:00.225 --> 00:30:02.250
<v Speaker 0>but people who are listening to this, they're

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:03.530
<v Speaker 0>going to come away from us with two

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:05.690
<v Speaker 0>things. One, Kubernetes is scary and everyone to

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:07.690
<v Speaker 0>do this or, oh, there's a lot to

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:09.370
<v Speaker 0>learn there. How do I get started? I'm

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:11.050
<v Speaker 0>going to do this tomorrow or tonight. Yeah.

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:14.010
<v Speaker 0>Do you have three actionable tips for anyone

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:17.675
<v Speaker 0>listening on how to improve their Kubernetes skills

00:30:17.675 --> 00:30:20.315
<v Speaker 0>or even get started. Three tips. And please

00:30:20.315 --> 00:30:21.515
<v Speaker 0>feel free to take a minute if you

00:30:21.515 --> 00:30:23.995
<v Speaker 0>need it. On on the tree? Okay. Sorry,

00:30:23.995 --> 00:30:25.674
<v Speaker 0>I've got a book here. Go. No.

00:30:26.235 --> 00:30:29.115
<v Speaker 1>Problem about learning a new technology, whatever that

00:30:29.115 --> 00:30:29.755
<v Speaker 1>is,

00:30:29.915 --> 00:30:33.100
<v Speaker 1>is to have some sort of motivation or

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:34.940
<v Speaker 1>a case to do it. So I also

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:35.740
<v Speaker 1>struggle.

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:38.780
<v Speaker 1>I used to struggle with learning things. So

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:40.380
<v Speaker 1>for example, I want to learn, let's say

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.100
<v Speaker 1>Python,

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:44.135
<v Speaker 1>but what will I be doing it? So

00:30:44.135 --> 00:30:45.015
<v Speaker 1>before that,

00:30:45.255 --> 00:30:47.575
<v Speaker 1>wanted to learn Perl some years ago, beginning

00:30:47.575 --> 00:30:48.615
<v Speaker 1>of 2000s,

00:30:48.775 --> 00:30:50.855
<v Speaker 1>but then I was like, yeah, I was

00:30:50.855 --> 00:30:53.415
<v Speaker 1>reading books, but then I needed to do

00:30:53.415 --> 00:30:55.655
<v Speaker 1>something with it to actually learn. I did

00:30:55.655 --> 00:30:58.400
<v Speaker 1>some stuff with Python. So we had many

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.000
<v Speaker 1>shell scripts to

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.679
<v Speaker 1>connect to Oracle clusters,

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.600
<v Speaker 1>which was a command line tool.

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.280
<v Speaker 1>Scripts were getting the data, like select some

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.600
<v Speaker 1>things, writing to a file.

00:31:10.105 --> 00:31:13.144
<v Speaker 1>Then we were gripping from file, all scripts

00:31:13.144 --> 00:31:15.945
<v Speaker 1>everywhere. And then we were just doing something

00:31:15.945 --> 00:31:18.104
<v Speaker 1>with those scripts. I was like,

00:31:18.745 --> 00:31:20.585
<v Speaker 1>should be doing something different. And then with

00:31:20.585 --> 00:31:22.985
<v Speaker 1>Python, with the Oracle client, I was actually

00:31:22.985 --> 00:31:25.820
<v Speaker 1>just like a normal programming language, getting the

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:27.419
<v Speaker 1>data, doing things there

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:30.460
<v Speaker 1>in some structures and then pointing. It was

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.779
<v Speaker 1>running faster. It was great, etcetera. Having a

00:31:32.779 --> 00:31:35.580
<v Speaker 1>motivation, a use case to learn technology is

00:31:35.855 --> 00:31:38.175
<v Speaker 1>the, I think, key point. So you set

00:31:38.175 --> 00:31:41.135
<v Speaker 1>up a Kubernetes cluster. It's fairly easy on

00:31:41.135 --> 00:31:43.375
<v Speaker 1>your local machine. You can just do it

00:31:43.375 --> 00:31:46.015
<v Speaker 1>with minikube or kind, but then what? So

00:31:46.015 --> 00:31:48.895
<v Speaker 1>yeah, running it there, it's running what there?

00:31:48.895 --> 00:31:51.460
<v Speaker 1>That's also a thing. But in general, for

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:52.340
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes,

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:56.500
<v Speaker 1>my first recommendation is to follow Kubernetes the

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:59.220
<v Speaker 1>hard way from Kelsey Hightower.

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.539
<v Speaker 1>I think that will

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:04.955
<v Speaker 1>make people understand what's happening under the hood.

00:32:04.955 --> 00:32:06.555
<v Speaker 1>If you like command line tools, if you

00:32:06.555 --> 00:32:09.115
<v Speaker 1>like Linux and stuff, I think it's

00:32:09.195 --> 00:32:11.595
<v Speaker 1>a lot of fun. But maybe it might

00:32:11.595 --> 00:32:13.195
<v Speaker 1>not be so much fun if you are,

00:32:13.195 --> 00:32:16.075
<v Speaker 1>let's say from Windows background or doing different

00:32:16.075 --> 00:32:18.920
<v Speaker 1>things than those there. But for a new

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.600
<v Speaker 1>starter for Kubernetes,

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:23.400
<v Speaker 1>I think this is the really first recommendation,

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.720
<v Speaker 1>I would say. Kubernetes the hard way. There

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.399
<v Speaker 1>are a lot of online

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:28.679
<v Speaker 1>resources.

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.800
<v Speaker 1>I think the problem is which one is

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:32.280
<v Speaker 1>the

00:32:32.644 --> 00:32:35.764
<v Speaker 1>good quality. Your channel, for example. That's what

00:32:35.764 --> 00:32:37.445
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say. So there are

00:32:37.445 --> 00:32:39.365
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people doing things, but what

00:32:39.365 --> 00:32:42.164
<v Speaker 1>you do is perfect. Thank you. Appreciate that.

00:32:42.325 --> 00:32:44.325
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. I'll send you the check after the

00:32:44.325 --> 00:32:44.644
<v Speaker 0>interview.

00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Thanks. My Ivan number and the lulls and

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:50.890
<v Speaker 1>lowers. No. Yeah. There are a few people

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:54.090
<v Speaker 1>actually creating great content in general. I I

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:56.010
<v Speaker 1>think if you just do a little bit

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:59.610
<v Speaker 1>Google search, you'll people would will find those.

00:33:00.115 --> 00:33:02.995
<v Speaker 1>Just listen and see what people are doing.

00:33:02.995 --> 00:33:04.994
<v Speaker 1>That would be my second thing.

00:33:05.394 --> 00:33:08.115
<v Speaker 1>And the third, I learn things by hands

00:33:08.115 --> 00:33:09.474
<v Speaker 1>on stuff. Most

00:33:09.475 --> 00:33:10.914
<v Speaker 1>cloud providers

00:33:11.315 --> 00:33:13.154
<v Speaker 1>give you some credits

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:16.050
<v Speaker 1>to try things out. Creditors, just get it.

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:17.809
<v Speaker 1>Even if it is a managed service,

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:20.049
<v Speaker 1>have it use it. Try to

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:24.050
<v Speaker 1>create an NGINX server there with the certificate,

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:27.169
<v Speaker 1>with the domain DNS entry, everything.

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:29.535
<v Speaker 1>So try to set up a system that

00:33:29.535 --> 00:33:30.815
<v Speaker 1>actually works because

00:33:31.295 --> 00:33:32.895
<v Speaker 1>yeah, in the end it won't be only

00:33:32.895 --> 00:33:34.895
<v Speaker 1>about Kubernetes. You will need to get some

00:33:34.895 --> 00:33:37.935
<v Speaker 1>SSR certificates maybe with sort manager, let's encrypt

00:33:37.935 --> 00:33:38.895
<v Speaker 1>or you

00:33:39.295 --> 00:33:41.135
<v Speaker 1>will need ingress, you will need some static

00:33:41.135 --> 00:33:44.460
<v Speaker 1>IPs, you will need DNS entry somewhere. People

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:47.020
<v Speaker 1>probably can use, make use of those free

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:48.299
<v Speaker 1>credits and

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:51.020
<v Speaker 1>think hands on experience is hard.

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:53.659
<v Speaker 1>I know, again, goes to the motivation,

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:55.980
<v Speaker 1>but you also need to try out stuff,

00:33:56.515 --> 00:33:57.715
<v Speaker 1>I think. Nice.

00:33:58.035 --> 00:34:00.355
<v Speaker 0>All right. That was fantastic. I heard there

00:34:00.355 --> 00:34:03.155
<v Speaker 0>was one piece of strategical advice, right? The

00:34:03.155 --> 00:34:04.115
<v Speaker 0>strategy is

00:34:04.595 --> 00:34:06.195
<v Speaker 0>scratch your own itch. I

00:34:06.595 --> 00:34:08.195
<v Speaker 0>think a lot of people do try to

00:34:08.195 --> 00:34:09.074
<v Speaker 0>learn technologies.

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:11.800
<v Speaker 0>They don't have anything at hand to apply

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.800
<v Speaker 0>that. And it's like learning a language. Right?

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.239
<v Speaker 0>If you don't go and speak to people

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:17.080
<v Speaker 0>in that language, it's not gonna get the

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.840
<v Speaker 0>skill. It's not gonna work. Yeah. You need

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.119
<v Speaker 0>to move on. So make sure you scratch

00:34:20.119 --> 00:34:21.965
<v Speaker 0>your own edge and do something. Then you

00:34:21.965 --> 00:34:23.965
<v Speaker 0>gave us three pieces of tactical advice, which

00:34:23.965 --> 00:34:26.205
<v Speaker 0>I also loved. One of them, go to

00:34:26.205 --> 00:34:28.364
<v Speaker 0>kills high towers. Kubernetes is a hard way.

00:34:28.364 --> 00:34:30.364
<v Speaker 0>If you wanna learn Kubernetes from the bottom

00:34:30.364 --> 00:34:33.165
<v Speaker 0>up, fantastic resource. It's still maintained. It's still

00:34:33.165 --> 00:34:35.449
<v Speaker 0>updated. Go check it out. Second piece of

00:34:35.449 --> 00:34:37.529
<v Speaker 0>advice was to follow the Rawkode Academy. Appreciate

00:34:37.529 --> 00:34:39.130
<v Speaker 0>that one. Thank you very much. But I

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:39.929
<v Speaker 0>also

00:34:39.929 --> 00:34:41.929
<v Speaker 0>learn with other people. And this is a

00:34:41.929 --> 00:34:44.329
<v Speaker 0>community effort. I'll shout out Annie East Ehrlich,

00:34:44.329 --> 00:34:45.929
<v Speaker 0>Sycam,

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:46.409
<v Speaker 0>Canal,

00:34:47.565 --> 00:34:50.284
<v Speaker 0>Victor Farsek, so many great channels that they're

00:34:50.284 --> 00:34:51.324
<v Speaker 0>teaching DevOps,

00:34:51.324 --> 00:34:53.885
<v Speaker 0>infrastructures, code, Kubernetes. Go learn with them. It's

00:34:53.885 --> 00:34:55.484
<v Speaker 0>a great way to to follow along and

00:34:55.484 --> 00:34:57.805
<v Speaker 0>keep up to date. This is a volatile

00:34:57.805 --> 00:34:59.965
<v Speaker 0>landscape. It changes all the time. It can

00:34:59.965 --> 00:35:01.565
<v Speaker 0>be hard to keep up Yeah. That other

00:35:01.565 --> 00:35:03.140
<v Speaker 0>people do the hard work for you. That's

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:04.900
<v Speaker 0>that's a great great piece of advice.

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:07.060
<v Speaker 0>And then your last piece of advice there

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:09.300
<v Speaker 0>was cloud provider credits, which I love. Right?

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:11.620
<v Speaker 0>You're right. AWS, GCP, they all offer you

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:12.420
<v Speaker 0>$300

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:13.780
<v Speaker 0>to sign up. So just spin up a

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.365
<v Speaker 0>cluster and scratch your own edge, deploy

00:35:16.445 --> 00:35:18.845
<v Speaker 0>an NGINX server, deploy a database, deploy a

00:35:18.845 --> 00:35:21.405
<v Speaker 0>WordPress, not WordPress because they're self employed right

00:35:21.405 --> 00:35:22.765
<v Speaker 0>now. No. Apply something else.

00:35:23.405 --> 00:35:25.565
<v Speaker 0>Yeah. Deploy stuff and use it. And even

00:35:25.565 --> 00:35:27.485
<v Speaker 0>with that one workload, which I would never

00:35:27.485 --> 00:35:29.710
<v Speaker 0>encourage anyone to put one workload on Kubernetes.

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:31.070
<v Speaker 0>But stick one thing you care about on

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:32.910
<v Speaker 0>that cluster, and I guarantee you'll then start

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:34.270
<v Speaker 0>to explore, okay, how do I make sure

00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:35.710
<v Speaker 0>this is up? What do health checks look

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:38.030
<v Speaker 0>like? What does monitoring look like? It'll gauge

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:40.430
<v Speaker 0>you the path will write itself, hopefully, and

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:42.190
<v Speaker 0>have some fun. Let's not forget that. Just

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:44.355
<v Speaker 0>enjoy it while you do it. Awesome. Exactly.

00:35:45.075 --> 00:35:47.235
<v Speaker 0>That was fantastic. I really appreciate you taking

00:35:47.235 --> 00:35:48.515
<v Speaker 0>the time to sit down with me today

00:35:48.515 --> 00:35:50.275
<v Speaker 0>and just share your knowledge with all of

00:35:50.275 --> 00:35:52.355
<v Speaker 0>the listeners. So thank you very much. Do

00:35:52.355 --> 00:35:54.355
<v Speaker 0>you have any parting words before we say

00:35:54.355 --> 00:35:57.650
<v Speaker 0>goodbye? I also thank you the invitation. I

00:35:57.650 --> 00:36:00.609
<v Speaker 1>really had fun with the talk. Was great.

00:36:00.769 --> 00:36:03.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, Kubernetes is there. Again,

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:05.890
<v Speaker 1>a lot of resources out there to learn.

00:36:06.289 --> 00:36:08.450
<v Speaker 1>And again, it's community work, as you said.

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:11.250
<v Speaker 1>One more thing that they could join the

00:36:11.625 --> 00:36:14.025
<v Speaker 1>CNCF and Kubernetes Slack channels

00:36:14.265 --> 00:36:17.625
<v Speaker 1>where they could also interact with the projects

00:36:17.625 --> 00:36:19.545
<v Speaker 1>like the in their channels, as well as

00:36:19.545 --> 00:36:20.345
<v Speaker 1>Kubernetes,

00:36:20.345 --> 00:36:22.105
<v Speaker 1>ask questions, meet with people.

00:36:22.425 --> 00:36:24.905
<v Speaker 1>That's all that would also be another maybe

00:36:24.905 --> 00:36:26.345
<v Speaker 1>a bonus recommendation.

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:28.370
<v Speaker 0>Bonus stuff. Love it. Yeah.

00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:31.730
<v Speaker 1>Just reach out to people. This community is

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:32.530
<v Speaker 1>quite

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:33.490
<v Speaker 1>helpful,

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:36.930
<v Speaker 1>and everyone is welcome to ask questions,

00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:38.290
<v Speaker 1>get help. So

00:36:38.945 --> 00:36:40.865
<v Speaker 1>be part of the community, and I'm sure

00:36:40.865 --> 00:36:43.105
<v Speaker 1>people will be you and you'll get to

00:36:43.105 --> 00:36:45.185
<v Speaker 1>some point quite fast. Awesome. Well, thank you

00:36:45.185 --> 00:36:46.465
<v Speaker 0>again for joining me, and thank you to

00:36:46.465 --> 00:36:48.145

<v Speaker 0>native landscape

00:37:09.065 --> 00:37:09.945
<v Speaker 0>on 3.

00:37:10.105 --> 00:37:11.785
<v Speaker 0>On 3. 1,

00:37:12.025 --> 00:37:12.665
<v Speaker 0>2,
