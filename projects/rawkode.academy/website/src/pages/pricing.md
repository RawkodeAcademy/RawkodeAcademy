Thanks for taking the time to look at my pricing information. As someone that's just gone out on their own away from the support of a large organisation, I'd excited to know that you're interested in working together.

When you're ready to start a conversation, [get in touch here](/contact).

**Hourly rates start at 400 USD.**

We have a few different options for you to choose from.

## Retainer Model (Preferred)

This model is the most flexible approach to working with me. We agree upon a minimum number of hours per month or quarter that I will work with you and your organisation. A Statement of Work is prepared in advance that outlines the projects we expect to accomplish throughout the commitment, though we can always add or remove projects as needed. I like to be flexible and ensure we continue to deliver on the highest impact work for your organisation, instead of sticking to a predetermined plan.

Services offered under this model include:

- Content (Video, Articles, Interviews, Podcasts, etc)
- Product Advisory and Consultancy

Please be advised that content creation takes time. Here's some estimates to give you an idea of what we can accomplish based on your time commitment:

- 1 hour of pre-recorded and edited video takes around 20-25 hours
- 1 hour live stream takes around 10 hours to prepare and deliver
- 1 hour podcast (edited) takes around 10 hours to prepare and delivery
- 1 hour podcast (live) takes around 5 hours to prepare and delivery
- 1 article takes around 5-10 hours to write and edit, depending on depth

## Project Model

This model is for one-off projects. I will work with you to define the scope of the project and provide a fixed price quote. I will then deliver the project within the estimated time frame.

This model is preferred if you need my support around a product launch.

Services offered under this model include:

- Product Advisory
- Content for release on your channels only (Video, Articles, Interviews, Podcasts, etc)

## Training Model

This model is for one-off training sessions. I have pre-existing training courses that are readily available for your organisation.

Training is delivered at a fixed price per head at **1000 USD per day per person**, with a minimum charge of 5 people per day.
