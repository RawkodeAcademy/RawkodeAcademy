			<p class="mb-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
				Starting his career in 2003, David joined a small local development
				company that specialized in ticketing systems for horse racing tracks
				across the UK. Working at a smaller company allowed him to gain
				experience across the entire product stack: custom kernel development
				(C), backend servers (C & PHP), front-end point of sale terminals (C++
				with QT3), and even mobile development (C#) on early Windows CE devices.
			</p>

			<p class="mb-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
				As part of a small team, David was also responsible for the
				infrastructure that ran the company's products, leveraging his extensive
				Linux knowledge from running Linux on the desktop since his first Coral
				Linux install in 2000.
			</p>

			<p class="mb-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
				Working with diverse technologies early in his career, David developed a
				passion for exploring and experimenting with new technologies to better
				understand the problems they solved and the paradigms they introduced.
				One of the first technologies to capture David's attention was Puppet in
				2004. Puppet revolutionized the way the company managed their fleet of
				servers, which were located at customer sites across the UK, eliminating
				the need for emergency on-site visits to address server issues.

				highlightWords="Cloud-Native"
			/>

			<p class="mb-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
				David was an early adopter of cloud, containers, and cloud-native
				technologies. As the Director of Development for TeamRock (now
				LouderSound), a rock and metal media organization, David was responsible
				for the software, infrastructure, and website during a significant
				scaling challenge: a massive traffic surge following the passing of
				Lemmy Kilmister. Thanks to forward-thinking infrastructure decisions,
				David and his team had already migrated from traditional virtual-machine
				infrastructure to containerized workloads running on Amazon Web Services
				in 2014, shortly after the public launch of Docker. This preparation
				enabled the platform to handle the unexpected traffic spike
				successfully.
			</p>

			<H2Highlight
				title="The Birth of Rawkode Academy"
				highlightWords="Rawkode Academy"
			/>

			<p class="mb-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
				While David enjoyed writing software, scaling infrastructure, and
				leading teams, he discovered that his true passion was helping others
				learn and succeed in the field. He began presenting at local user groups
				in 2016, gradually progressing to conferences, before transitioning to a
				full-time Developer Advocacy position at InfluxData.
			</p>

			<p class="mb-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
				At InfluxData, David worked to simplify the adoption of InfluxDB and
				Telegraf for Kubernetes operators as their preferred solution for metric
				collection and storage. This effort extended beyond speaking engagements
				at conferences and user groups about monitoring Kubernetes clusters; he
				actively collaborated with engineering teams to improve deployment and
				management capabilities on Kubernetes.

					Historical Note
				</h4>
				<p class="text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
					Before metrics-server, Kubernetes collected monitoring information
					through a program called Heapster, which was built on top of InfluxDB
					1.
				</p>
			</div>

			<p class="mb-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
				It was during this time that the Rawkode Academy released its first
				video: "Last Week in Kubernetes."

			</div>

			<p class="mb-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
				After InfluxData, David joined Equinix Metal where he continued to
				develop and expand the Rawkode Academy. His focus was helping developers
				and operators learn to run and use <a href="/watch?tag=kubernetes" class="text-primary hover:underline">Kubernetes</a> and other <a href="/read" class="text-primary hover:underline">Cloud Native
				technologies</a> on bare metal infrastructure, addressing the unique
				challenges not present when running on cloud providers.
			</p>

			<p class="mb-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
				Throughout his work with <a href="/watch?tag=kubernetes" class="text-primary hover:underline">Kubernetes</a>, David was inspired by TGIK, a
				weekly live stream hosted by Joe Beda, one of Kubernetes' creators. On
				TGIK, Joe explored new <a href="/read" class="text-primary hover:underline">Cloud Native technologies</a> by working through
				documentation and examples, often with help from project maintainers and
				contributors in the chat. This inspired David to create his own format,
				inviting maintainers and contributors directly onto live streams where
				they could not only assist with technical issues but also discuss their
				projects' history, purpose, and context.

					Evolution of the Format
				</h4>
				<p class="text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
					Before being called "Rawkode Live," the stream was named "RTFM,"
					reflecting its premise of guiding people through open source projects
					using official documentation and examples.

				highlightWords="Innovative"

			<p class="mb-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
				In 2021, David launched a bold new educational format called <a href="/search?q=Klustered&type=video" class="text-primary hover:underline">Klustered</a>.
				The premise was simple but challenging: experts would attempt to
				troubleshoot deliberately broken <a href="/watch?tag=kubernetes" class="text-primary hover:underline">Kubernetes</a> clusters in real-time. This
				innovative approach to learning through problem-solving quickly became
				one of Rawkode Academy's most popular series, with David hosting the
				first episode alongside guest Walid Shaari.
