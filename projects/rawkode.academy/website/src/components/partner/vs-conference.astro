			Of course you have, we all have. We spend tens of thousands of dollars
			paying the conference organizer, setting up a booth, flying the team
			over, and hosting a happy-hour.

		<p class="mb-3 font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 sm:text-xl">
			The conference is over after two days and you're looking at the "lead"
			retrieval and wondering how many of the 200 scans will actually reply to
			your SDRs.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-8 font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 sm:text-xl">
			For a comparable price, you can partner with us and we work together for a
			WHOLE YEAR. We are fully invested in supporting your needs and that of the
			developers on our platform.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-8 font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 sm:text-xl">
			We can all be successful, for a fraction of the effort.
