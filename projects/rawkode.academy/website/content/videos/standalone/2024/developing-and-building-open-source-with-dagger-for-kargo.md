title: Developing & Building Open Source with Dagger for Kargo
description: |-
  This live stream series will demonstrate how open source projects can leverage Dagger to enhance their build automation and development environments. Dagger enables developers to define their pipelines and environments using general-purpose programming languages, increasing flexibility and maintainability compared to traditional configuration-based tools.

  We will collaborate with various open source communities to implement Dagger in real-world scenarios, showcasing best practices and addressing common challenges. Each stream will focus on a specific aspect of Dagger, such as building container images, orchestrating complex workflows, or managing dependencies. By the end of the series, viewers will have a comprehensive understanding of Dagger's capabilities and how to apply them to their own projects.
