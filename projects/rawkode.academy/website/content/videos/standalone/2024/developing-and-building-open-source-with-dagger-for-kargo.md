title: Developing & Building Open Source with Dagger for Kargo
description: >-
  This live stream series will demonstrate how open source projects can leverage
  Dagger to enhance their build automation and development environments. Dagger
  enables developers to define their pipelines and environments using
  general-purpose programming languages, increasing flexibility and
  maintainability compared to traditional configuration-based tools.


  We will collaborate with various open source communities to implement Dagger
  in real-world scenarios, showcasing best practices and addressing common
  challenges. Each stream will focus on a specific aspect of Dagger, such as
  building container images, orchestrating complex workflows, or managing
  dependencies. By the end of the series, viewers will have a comprehensive
  understanding of Dagger's capabilities and how to apply them to their own
  projects.
