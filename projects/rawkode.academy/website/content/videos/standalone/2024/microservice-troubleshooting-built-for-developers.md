  Observability and debugging through automated distributed tracing
  With one-click distributed tracing, Lumigo lets developers effortlessly find and fix issues in serverless and containerized environments.

  Lumigo's tracers constantly improve and unlock new abilities with each version. Some new features may require a newer tracer version, therefore you should periodically ensure you're up to date to get the latest and greatest Lumigo features.
