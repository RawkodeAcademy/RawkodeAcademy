  Observability and debugging through automated distributed tracing

  With one-click distributed tracing, Lumigo lets developers effortlessly find
  and fix issues in serverless and containerized environments.


  Lumigo's tracers constantly improve and unlock new abilities with each
  version. Some new features may require a newer tracer version, therefore you
  should periodically ensure you're up to date to get the latest and greatest
  Lumigo features.
