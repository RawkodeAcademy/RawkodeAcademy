title: The Roast of the Linux Desktop
description: |-
  Linux Desktop, you're like that band that everyone insists is about to make it big. You've been "the year of the Linux desktop" more times than Spinal Tap has had drummers spontaneously combust.  You've got more distros than a cat lady has hairballs, and yet, here we are, still waiting for you to stop tinkering with your config files and actually become the mainstream heartthrob you keep promising to be.

  Let's be honest, your idea of user-friendliness is making sure the command line interface has the right font.  You're like that one friend who insists on showing everyone their vacation photos from their backpacking trip through Uzbekistan, even though everyone else just wants to see pictures of their cat.  And for the love of all that is holy, could you please decide on a package manager and stick with it?
