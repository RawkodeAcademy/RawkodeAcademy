title: The Roast of the Linux Desktop
description: >-
  Linux Desktop, you're like that band that everyone insists is about to make it
  big. You've been "the year of the Linux desktop" more times than Spinal Tap
  has had drummers spontaneously combust.  You've got more distros than a cat
  lady has hairballs, and yet, here we are, still waiting for you to stop
  tinkering with your config files and actually become the mainstream heartthrob
  you keep promising to be.


  Let's be honest, your idea of user-friendliness is making sure the command
  line interface has the right font.  You're like that one friend who insists on
  showing everyone their vacation photos from their backpacking trip through
  Uzbekistan, even though everyone else just wants to see pictures of their
  cat.  And for the love of all that is holy, could you please decide on a
  package manager and stick with it?
