  We take on the challenge of safely exposing Kubernetes services to the internet with ngrok.

  The session explores routing traffic to a cluster, considering options between different load balancers, and emphasizing security needs like authentication and rate limiting. The solution is ngrok, which simplifies the process with a unified API.

  The video demonstrates deploying ngrok and Kubernetes operator, setting up a gateway with ngrok's platform, and implementing rate limiting using the gateway API. The showcased configuration and operations are designed with a focus on practical application and infrastructure-as-code principles, offering a simplified method to boost Kubernetes cluster resilience and security. Watch as we go hands-on deploying sample workloads and explore the full potential of ngrok within a Kubernetes context.
