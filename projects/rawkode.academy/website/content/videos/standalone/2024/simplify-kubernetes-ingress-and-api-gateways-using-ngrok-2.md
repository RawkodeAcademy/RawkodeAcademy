  We take on the challenge of safely exposing Kubernetes services to the
  internet with ngrok.


  The session explores routing traffic to a cluster, considering options between
  different load balancers, and emphasizing security needs like authentication
  and rate limiting. The solution is ngrok, which simplifies the process with a
  unified API.


  The video demonstrates deploying ngrok and Kubernetes operator, setting up a
  gateway with ngrok's platform, and implementing rate limiting using the
  gateway API. The showcased configuration and operations are designed with a
  focus on practical application and infrastructure-as-code principles, offering
  a simplified method to boost Kubernetes cluster resilience and security. Watch
  as we go hands-on deploying sample workloads and explore the full potential of
  ngrok within a Kubernetes context.
