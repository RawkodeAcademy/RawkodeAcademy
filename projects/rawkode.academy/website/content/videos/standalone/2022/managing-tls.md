title: Managing TLS
description: |-
  Welcome to the Portainer in Production course. In this video, I guide you through configuring Portainer with TLS certificates provisioned with certbot for LetsEncrypt. If you'd prefer a slightly more hands-off approach, I also guide you through configuring Caddy as a reverse proxy which handles the ACME dance for you.

  Let's have some fun.
