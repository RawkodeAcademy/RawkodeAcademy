title: Empowering EKS Cluster Deployments and GitOps with Portainer's Simplified Workflow
description: |-
  Today, we'll be diving into the world of Kubernetes and GitOps, specifically focusing on how Portainer simplifies the process of creating an EKS cluster and adopting GitOps practices.

  Our host, David Flanagan, will walk us through the steps of deploying a new EKS cluster on AWS and getting our application up and running with a GitOps pipeline, all in under 10 minutes.

  Join us as we explore the power of Portainer in making complex tasks trivial and making your life as a developer or operator so much easier.
