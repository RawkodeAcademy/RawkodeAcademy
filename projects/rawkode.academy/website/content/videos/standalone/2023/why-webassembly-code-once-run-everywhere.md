title: Why WebAssembly? Code Once, Run Everywhere
description: |-
  Spin is a framework for building, deploying, and running fast, secure, and composable cloud microservices with WebAssembly.

  In this first part of our course, I take a look at why you should start taking WebAssembly (WASM) seriously. Exploring WASM through the lens of a software developer looking to provide a reusable framework for their domain logic, I show you how to consume a function written in Rust via a Spin backend application and a client side rendered JavaScript (JS) application.

  This is just the beginning of our WebAssembly journey, let's get started.
