title: 'Why WebAssembly? Code Once, Run Everywhere'
description: >-
  Spin is a framework for building, deploying, and running fast, secure, and
  composable cloud microservices with WebAssembly.


  In this first part of our course, I take a look at why you should start taking
  WebAssembly (WASM) seriously. Exploring WASM through the lens of a software
  developer looking to provide a reusable framework for their domain logic, I
  show you how to consume a function written in Rust via a Spin backend
  application and a client side rendered JavaScript (JS) application.


  This is just the beginning of our WebAssembly journey, let's get started.
