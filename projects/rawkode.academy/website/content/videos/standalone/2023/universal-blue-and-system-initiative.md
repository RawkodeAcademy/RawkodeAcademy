title: Universal Blue & System Initiative
description: |-
  In the first episode of AlphaBits, Brian and David explain why they're excited about Universal Blue and System Intiative.

  Universal Blue is a collection of container images using Fedora's support for OCI/Docker containers as a transport and delivery mechanism for operating system content. This project's purpose is to be a "kit" for you to derive from to create your perfect image, as well as provide high quality images for use as a desktop.


  System Initiative is a collaborative power tool designed to remove the papercuts from DevOps work.
