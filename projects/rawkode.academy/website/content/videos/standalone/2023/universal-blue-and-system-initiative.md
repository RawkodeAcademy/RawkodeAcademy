title: Universal Blue & System Initiative
description: >-
  In the first episode of AlphaBits, Brian and David explain why they're excited
  about Universal Blue and System Intiative.


  Universal Blue is a collection of container images using Fedora's support for
  OCI/Docker containers as a transport and delivery mechanism for operating
  system content. This project's purpose is to be a "kit" for you to derive from
  to create your perfect image, as well as provide high quality images for use
  as a desktop.



  System Initiative is a collaborative power tool designed to remove the
  papercuts from DevOps work.
