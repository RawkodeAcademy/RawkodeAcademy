  such as React, Svelte, Remix, NextJS, Astro, and Gatsby; by allowing you to
  integrate their build command into the spin build pipeline. Using the
  file-server component, you can ship your static website with your serverless
  Spin WebAssembly functions for a cohesive application with a phenomenal
  developer experience.
