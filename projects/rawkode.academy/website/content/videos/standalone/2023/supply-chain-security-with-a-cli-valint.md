title: 'Supply Chain Security with a CLI: valint'
description: >-
  Valint is a powerful tool that validates the integrity of your supply chain,
  providing organizations with a way to enforce policies using the Scribe
  Service, CI, or admission controller. It also provides a mechanism for
  compliance and transparency, both within the organization and with external
  parties.


  By managing evidence generation, storage and validation, Valint ensures that
  your organization's policies are enforced throughout the supply chain.

  You can store evidence locally or in any OCI registry, as well as using the
  Scribe Service for storage.


  In addition to evidence management, Valint also generates evidence for a range
  of targets, including directories, file artifacts, images, and git
  repositories. It supports two types of evidence: CycloneDX SBOMs and SLSA
  provenance. With Valint, you can sign and verify artifacts against their
  origin and signer identity in the supply chain.
