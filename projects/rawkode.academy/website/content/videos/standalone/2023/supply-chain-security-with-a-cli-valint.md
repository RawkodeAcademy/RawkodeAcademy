title: "Supply Chain Security with a CLI: valint"
description: |-
  Valint is a powerful tool that validates the integrity of your supply chain, providing organizations with a way to enforce policies using the Scribe Service, CI, or admission controller. It also provides a mechanism for compliance and transparency, both within the organization and with external parties.

  By managing evidence generation, storage and validation, Valint ensures that your organization's policies are enforced throughout the supply chain.
  You can store evidence locally or in any OCI registry, as well as using the Scribe Service for storage.

  In addition to evidence management, Valint also generates evidence for a range of targets, including directories, file artifacts, images, and git repositories. It supports two types of evidence: CycloneDX SBOMs and SLSA provenance. With Valint, you can sign and verify artifacts against their origin and signer identity in the supply chain.
