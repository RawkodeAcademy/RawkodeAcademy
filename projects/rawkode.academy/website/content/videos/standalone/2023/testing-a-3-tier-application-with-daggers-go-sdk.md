title: Testing a 3-Tier Application with Dagger's Go SDK
description: >-
  In this video, I walk through how to get started with Dagger's Go SDK to build
  and test a 3-tier application with Dagger, the future of CICD.


  We cover many of Dagger's features, such as service dependencies, secret
  lookups, step composition, and much more.


  Come take a look at the future of CICD that can run anywhere, even your
  laptop.


  Let's dive in
