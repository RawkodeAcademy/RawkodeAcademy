title: Automating Deployments to the Edge
description: |-
  Welcome to the Portainer in Production course.

  In this video, I walk you through Portainer's Edge APIs for administering remote compute nodes with the Portainer agent.

  Using cdktf to automate the provisioning of some bare metal devices on Equinix Metal, we connect them to Portainer and automate the roll out of our nginx application.
