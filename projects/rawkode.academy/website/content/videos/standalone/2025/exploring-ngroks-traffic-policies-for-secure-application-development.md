  Enhance Your Application Security with ngrok: Protect Endpoints and Restrict
  Access

  In this video, you'll learn three exciting tricks to enhance your application
  using ngrok. We'll cover how to protect an endpoint, restrict access based on
  geolocation, and improve your application's security posture. The
  demonstration uses a simple Deno application with Prometheus metrics, and
  shows how to expose it via ngrok while applying advanced traffic policies to
  restrict IPs and geolocations. Whether it's protecting your metrics endpoint
  or making a page available only in the UK, you'll see how powerful and
  versatile ngrok can be. Explore these features and more through this
  comprehensive guide.
