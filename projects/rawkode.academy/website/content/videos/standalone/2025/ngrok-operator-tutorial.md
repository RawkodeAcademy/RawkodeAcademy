title: Unboxing the ngrok Kubernetes Operator
subtitle: Expose Any Kubernetes Service in 8 Lines of YAML
description: Learn how to expose your Kubernetes services to the internet in under 20 minutes using the ngrok Kubernetes Operator! In this hands-on tutorial, David Flanagan shows you how to bypass the complexity of load balancers, port forwarding, and traditional Kubernetes networking headaches. Starting with a fresh cluster, you'll see how to install the operator with Helm and expose a sample application using just 8 lines of YAML - compared to the hundreds typically required. But that's just the beginning. The tutorial dives into ngrok's powerful traffic policies, demonstrating how to add OIDC authentication, rate limiting, and custom error pages with minimal configuration. You'll see real production examples from Rawkode Academy's infrastructure and learn how to implement enterprise-grade security features without the usual complexity. Whether you're tired of wrestling with Kubernetes networking or looking for a simpler way to share your applications with the world, this tutorial shows you how ngrok makes the complex simple.
