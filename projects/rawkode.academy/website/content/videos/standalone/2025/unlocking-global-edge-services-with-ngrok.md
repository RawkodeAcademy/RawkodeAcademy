  Let's dive into the complexities of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and explore
  a simpler solution for low latency service delivery using ngrok.


  We illustrate how BGP acts like Google Maps for the internet, helping users
  find the nearest path to their destination. However, setting up BGP can be
  time-consuming and costly. Enter ngrok's global load balancers, offering a
  hassle-free way to deliver services with 8 Points of Presence (POPs)
  worldwide.


  With ngrok, there's no need for extensive networking expertise or
  geo-replication—it's as simple as a few commands. Watch as we demonstrate the
  ease of using ngrok to manage global requests efficiently and keep your
  customers happy.
