  Struggling with complex Kubernetes configurations? In this video, you'll learn
  how to build a production-ready, reusable Kubernetes stack using the Spectro
  Cloud Palette web UI—no code required. Think of a cluster profile as a
  reusable blueprint for your ideal cluster, allowing you to define it once and
  deploy it as many times as you need. \n\n\nOver the course of this tutorial,
  we will walk you through:\n\n\n- Creating a "Full" Cluster Profile: We'll
  start from scratch, defining every layer of a production-grade cluster. \n-
  Defining Your Infrastructure:\n- Operating System: Choose your OS; we use
  Ubuntu in this demo.\n- Container Network Interface (CNI): Select your
  preferred CNI, like Cilium, and customize its Helm chart values directly in
  the UI. \n- Container Storage Interface (CSI): Configure your storage layer,
  using Google Cloud disks for a GCP deployment. \n- Kubernetes Version: Easily
  select and modify the specific Kubernetes version you want to deploy.
  \n\n\nBuilding Composable Add-on Layers: Learn how to create a separate,
  reusable monitoring stack with Prometheus and Grafana that can be applied to
  any cluster. \n\nSimplifying Configuration: Use built-in presets and variables
  to manage complex settings and handle sensitive information like passwords
  securely. \n\n- Deploying and Managing Your Cluster:\n- Deploy your profile to
  a cloud provider (we use GCP) with just a few clicks. \n- Configure your
  control plane and worker nodes, including instance types and auto-scaling. \n-
  Apply updates and configuration changes to a running cluster with a clear view
  of the diff. \n\nUnderstanding the Power of Palette: Discover how Spectro
  Cloud Palette provides a user-friendly interface on top of the powerful,
  open-source Cluster API. \n\nIf you prefer an Infrastructure-as-Code approach,
  stay tuned! Our next videos will cover how to accomplish all of this using
  YAML, Git, and Terraform. \n\n00:00:00 - Introduction to Cluster
