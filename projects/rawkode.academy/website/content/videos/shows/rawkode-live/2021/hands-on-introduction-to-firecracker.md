  👥 About the Guests

  Radu Weiss

    I’m is a software development manager, and have been working on Firecracker since it got started. Many customers love using serverless compute offerings, and I in turn love helping build some of the components that power them.

  🔨 About the Technologies

  Firecracker


  Firecracker is an open source virtualization technology that is purpose-built for creating and managing secure, multi-tenant container and function-based services.
  Firecracker enables you to deploy workloads in lightweight virtual machines, called microVMs, which provide enhanced security and workload isolation over traditional VMs, while enabling the speed and resource efficiency of containers. Firecracker was developed at Amazon Web Services to improve the customer experience of services like AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate .
  Firecracker is a virtual machine monitor (VMM) that uses the Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) to create and manage microVMs. Firecracker has a minimalist design. It excludes unnecessary devices and guest functionality to reduce the memory footprint and attack surface area of each microVM. This improves security, decreases the startup time, and increases hardware utilization. Firecracker currently supports Intel CPUs, with AMD and Arm support in developer preview.
  Firecracker is used by/integrated with (in alphabetical order): appfleet , containerd via firecracker-containerd , Fly.io , Kata Containers , Koyeb , OpenNebula , Qovery , UniK , and Weave FireKube (via Weave Ignite ).
