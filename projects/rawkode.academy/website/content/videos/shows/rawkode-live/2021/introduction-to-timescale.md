I went on to represent South Africa at the International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) and International Junior Science Olympiad (IJSO) \n\U0001F1E8\U0001F1F7 My life changed when I was 17:  I moved across the world to live and learn with 150 other young, ambitious people from 70+ countries at United World College Costa Rica (UWC) without knowing a word of Spanish. \n\U0001F42F \U0001F393 I studied Computer Science at Princeton University\_ \n\U0001F4BB Current work: Developer Advocate at Timescale. I help developers be successful with time-series data for things like IoT, DevOps and Analytics. \n\U0001F510 Previous work: From my college dorm room, I co-founded and built Afari a social network that gave people more privacy and ownership over their data. It was funded by a premier crypto fund.\n\U0001F534 Favorite football team: Manchester United \n❌⭕️ Favorite musician: The Weeknd \n\U0001F3DD Favorite country to visit: Thailand \n\U0001F602 Favorite comedian: Trevor Noah \n\U0001F5FDCurrent City: New York City \n\n\U0001F426 https://twitter.com/avthars\n\U0001F9E9 https://github.com/avthars\n\U0001F30F https://avthar.com/\n\n\n\U0001F528 About the Technologies\n\nTimescale\n\nTimescaleDB is an open-source database designed to make SQL scalable for\ntime-series data.  It is engineered up from PostgreSQL and packaged as a\nPostgreSQL extension, providing automatic partitioning across time and space\n(partitioning key), as well as full SQL support.\n\n\U0001F30F https://www.timescale.com/\n\U0001F426 https://twitter.com/timescaledb\n\U0001F9E9 https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb\n\n\n\n\n\U0001F30F Show Links\nhttps://docs.timescale.com\nhttps://tsdb.co/timescale-newsletter\nhttps://tsdb.co/TimescaleSlack\nhttps://tsdb.co/get-started-cloud"
