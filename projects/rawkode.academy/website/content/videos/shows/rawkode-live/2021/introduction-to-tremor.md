These facilities mean that when systems go over-capacity (eg: during peak e-commerce trading environments such as cyber-5) - where we may already be running with scaled up infrastructure - the upstream or downstream resource saturation has no negative impact on our production operations.\nTremor replaces logstash, telegraf and other data distribution tools at\_Wayfair\_with a single high performance tool that is easy to configure and use.\n\n\U0001F30F https://www.tremor.rs/\n\U0001F426 https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/TremorDEBS\n\U0001F9E9 https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-runtime"
