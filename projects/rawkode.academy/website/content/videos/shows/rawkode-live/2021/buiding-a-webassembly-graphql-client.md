  👥 About the Guests

  Connor Hicks

    Connor Hicks is a software developer based in Ottawa, Canada. Connor works on security and distributed systems projects, leading Product Discovery at 1Password as well as building the Suborbital open source project. Connor is a strong believer in building security and privacy into the core of all software, and is exploring the next generation of web service development with technologies like WebAssembly.

  Francis Gulotta

    Francis Gulotta has spent many years writing JavaScript and making it fun to run in strange places. Like robots in classrooms, or underwater sensor drones causing international incidents or amazon lambda. Making projects is hard, and he hopes he has made it a little bit easier for the developers to get building. He's the maintainer of Node SerialPort and a handful of other niche open source projects. Currently Francis is at Shopify helping build a WASM powered platform so we can expose previously impossible APIs to our app developers.

  🔨 About the Technologies

  Suborbital

  The Suborbital Development Platform is a family of open source tools and frameworks that help you build web services that are powerful, but never complicated.

  WebAssembly

  WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

  GraphQ

  GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.
