title: Introduction to Kubeflow
description: "In this episode, Michael will introduce us to Kubeflow's new features, shipping in Kubeflow 1.3, and guide us through everything we need to get started running our data science workloads on Kubernetes with Kubeflow.\n\n\n\U0001F37F Rawkode Live\n\nHosted by David McKay / \U0001F426 https://twitter.com/rawkode\nWebsite: https://rawkode.live\nDiscord Chat: https://rawkode.live/chat\n\n#RawkodeLive\n\n\U0001F570 Timeline\n\n00:00 - Holding screen\n00:40 - Introductions\n06:00 - What is Kubeflow?\n42:00 - Introduction to Machine Learning by Example\n59:00 - Working with Kubeflow Notebooks\n1:54:00 - Deploying with Kale\n\n\U0001F465 About the Guests\n\n Michael Tanenbaum\n\n  Solutions Engineer\_@arrikto\n\n\n\U0001F426 https://twitter.com/tbaums\n\U0001F9E9 https://github.com/tbaums\n\n\n\n\U0001F528 About the Technologies\n\nKubeflow\n\nThe Kubeflow project is dedicated to making deployments of machine learning (ML) workflows on Kubernetes simple, portable and scalable. Our goal is not to recreate other services, but to provide a straightforward way to deploy best-of-breed open-source systems for ML to diverse infrastructures. Anywhere you are running Kubernetes, you should be able to run Kubeflow.\n\n\U0001F30F https://www.kubeflow.org/\n\U0001F426 https://twitter.com/kubeflow\n\U0001F9E9 https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow\n\n#Deep Learning #Machine Learning #Data Science"
