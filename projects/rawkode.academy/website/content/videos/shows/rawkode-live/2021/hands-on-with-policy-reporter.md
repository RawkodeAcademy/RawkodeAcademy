I love learning new technologies the trial and error way.

With Kyverno, policies are managed as Kubernetes resources and no new language is required to write policies. This allows using familiar tools such as kubectl, git, and kustomize to manage policies. Kyverno policies can validate, mutate, and generate Kubernetes resources. The Kyverno CLI can be used to test policies and validate resources as part of a CI/CD pipeline.\n\n\U0001F30F https://kyverno.io/\n\U0001F426 https://twitter.com/kyverno\n\U0001F9E9 https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno\n\n#Policy #Compliance #Kubernetes\n\n\nPolicy Reporter\n\nCreates Prometheus Metrics for PolicyReports and ClusterPolicyReports. Ships with an optional Web UI and can send new Results to different Clients like Loki and Elasticsearch. Provides a optional Monitoring Subchart with a ServiceMonitor and Grafana Dashboards for the Prometheus Operator.\n\n\n\n\U0001F9E9 https://github.com/fjogeleit/policy-reporter"
