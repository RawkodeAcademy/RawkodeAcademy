  🔨 About the Technologies

  Kapitan

  Kapitan is the tool to help you manage the complexity of your configuration using an inventory and a choice of templates like generators, jsonnet, kadet, jinja2 and helm.
  Use Kapitan to build an inventory which you can then use to drive templates for your Kubernetes manifests, your documentation, your Terraform configuration or even simplify your scripts.
