It is designed to be very cost effective and easy to operate. It does not index the contents of the logs, but rather a set of labels for each log stream.\nThe Loki project was started at Grafana Labs in 2018, and announced at KubeCon Seattle. Loki is released under the Apache 2.0 License.\nGrafana Labs is proud to lead the development of the Loki project, building first-class support for Loki into Grafana, and ensuring Grafana Labs customers receive Loki support and features they need.\n\n\U0001F30F https://grafana.com/oss/loki/\n\n\U0001F9E9 https://github.com/grafana/loki"
