It is a horizontally scalable, highly-compressed, and operationally mature platform for Prometheus data that offers the combined power of PromQL and SQL, enabling developers to ask any question, create any dashboard, and achieve greater visibility into their systems. Promscale is built on top of TimescaleDB, the leading relational database for time-series.\n\n\n\n\U0001F9E9 https://github.com/timescale/promscale"
