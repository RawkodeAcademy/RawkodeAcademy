  🔨 About the Technologies

  Fluent Bit

  Fluent Bit is an open source Log Processor and Forwarder which allows you to collect any data like metrics and logs from different sources, enrich them with filters and send them to multiple destinations. It's the preferred choice for containerized environments like Kubernetes.
  Fluent Bit is designed with performance in mind: high throughput with low CPU and Memory usage. It's written in C language and has a pluggable architecture supporting more than 70 extensions for inputs, filters and outputs.
  Fluent Bit is a CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) subproject under the umbrella of Fluentd.
  We are part of a wide community, no vendor lock-in.
