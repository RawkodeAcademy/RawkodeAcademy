With Vitess, you can even split and merge shards as your needs grow, with an atomic cutover step that takes only a few seconds.\nVitess has been a core component of YouTube's database infrastructure since 2011, and has grown to encompass tens of thousands of MySQL nodes.\n\n\U0001F30F https://vitess.io/\n\U0001F426 https://twitter.com/vitessio\n\U0001F9E9 https://github.com/vitessio/vitess\n\n#MySQL #CloudNative"
