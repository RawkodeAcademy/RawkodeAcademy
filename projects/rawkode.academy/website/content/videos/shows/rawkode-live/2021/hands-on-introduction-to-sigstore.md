  🔨 About the Technologies

  sigstore

  sigstore is a Linux Foundation project.
  sigstore is a project with the goal of providing a public good / non-profit service to improve the open source software supply chain by easing the adoption of cryptographic software signing, backed by transparency log technologies.
  sigstore will seek to empower software developers to securely sign software artifacts such as release files, container images, binaries, bill of material manifests and more. Signing materials are then stored into a tamper resistant public log
  sigstore will be free to use for all developers and software providers, with sigstore’s code and operation tooling being 100% open source and maintained / developed by the sigstore community.
