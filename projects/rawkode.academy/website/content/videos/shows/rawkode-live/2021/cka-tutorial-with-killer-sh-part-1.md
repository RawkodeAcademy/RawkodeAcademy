It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely \navailable.\nThe name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot. Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014. Kubernetes combines over 15 years of Google's experience running production workloads at scale with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.\nDesigned on the same principles that allows Google to run billions of containers a week, Kubernetes can scale without increasing your ops team.\nWhether testing locally or running a global enterprise, Kubernetes flexibility grows with you to deliver your applications consistently and easily no matter how complex your need is.\nKubernetes is open source giving you the freedom to take advantage of on-premises, hybrid, or public cloud infrastructure, letting you effortlessly move workloads to where it matters to you.\n\n\U0001F30F https://kubernetes.io/\n\U0001F426 https://twitter.com/kubernetesio\n\U0001F9E9 https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes\n\n#CloudNative #Kubernetes"
