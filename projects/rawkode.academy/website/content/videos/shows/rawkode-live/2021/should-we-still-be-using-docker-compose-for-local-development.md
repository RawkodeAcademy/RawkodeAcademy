Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. Because all of the containers share the services of a single operating system kernel, they use fewer resources than virtual machines.\nThe service has both free and premium tiers. The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine. It was first started in 2013 and is developed by Docker, Inc.\n\n\U0001F30F https://docker.com\n\U0001F426 https://twitter.com/docker\n\U0001F9E9 https://github.com/docker\n\n#Docker #Containers"
