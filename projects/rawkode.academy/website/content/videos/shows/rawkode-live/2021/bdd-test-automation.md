title: BDD Test Automation
description: "In this episode, we'll take a look at writing acceptance tests, in Rust, that confirm the scenarios and examples we wrote in previous episodes are implemented correctly.\n\nThis episode is part of the Introduction to Behaviour-Driven Development series.\n  -- BDD Test Automation - This Video\n\n\U0001F37F Rawkode Live\n\nHosted by David McKay / \U0001F426 https://twitter.com/rawkode\nWebsite: https://rawkode.live\nDiscord Chat: https://rawkode.live/chat\n\n#RawkodeLive\n\n\U0001F570 Timeline\n\n00:00 - Holding Screen\n00:45 - Introductions\n02:00 - Background / Context\n08:20 - Reviewing Our Feature File\n15:30 - Writing Acceptance Tests with Cucumber Rust\n\n\U0001F465 About the Guests\n\nCiaran McNulty\n\nCiaran helps teams at all levels of ability improve via training and \ncoaching. He has been a PHP professional since the late 90s and is \npassionate about TDD, BDD and Agile methodologies. He is lead maintainer\n of PhpSpec.\n\n\U0001F426 https://twitter.com/ciaranmcnulty\n\U0001F9E9 https://github.com/ciaranmcnulty\n\U0001F30F https://ciaranmcnulty.com\n\n\n\U0001F528 About the Technologies\n\nRust\n\nRust is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically similar to C++, but can guarantee memory safety by using a borrow checker to validate references. Rust achieves memory safety without garbage collection, and reference counting is optional.\nRust was originally designed by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla Research, with contributions from Dave Herman, Brendan Eich, and others. The designers refined the language while writing the Servo layout or browser engine, and the Rust compiler.\n It has gained increasing use in industry, and Microsoft has been \nexperimenting with the language for secure and safety-critical software \ncomponents.\nRust has been voted the \"most loved programming language\" in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey every year since 2016.\n\n\U0001F30F https://www.rust-lang.org/\n\U0001F426 https://twitter.com/rustlang\n\U0001F9E9 https://github.com/rust-lang/rust\n\n#RustLang\n\n\n\U0001F30F Show Links\nhttps://gitlab.com/rawkode/gitsync\nhttps://github.com/bbqsrc/cucumber-rust"
