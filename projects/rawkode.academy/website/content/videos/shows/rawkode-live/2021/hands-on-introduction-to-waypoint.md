After deployment, Waypoint provides tools such as logs, exec, and more to validate and debug any deployments. Waypoint is fully extensible based on a plugin system which allows Waypoint to work with any tools and platforms.\n\nWaypoint Goals\n    Consistency of Workflows. Waypoint aims to provide an easy-to-use, consistent workflow for getting applications from development to production: waypoint up. We believe that fragmentation in workflow based on platform is a big challenge for teams that attempt to use multiple build, deploy, release tooling.\n    Confidence in Deployment. The first thing any developer does after deploying is validate it works: open a browser, refresh the page, check logs, etc. Waypoint provides tools such as logs and exec to give you confidence that deployments succeed.\n    Extensibility with the Ecosystem. Consistency is only useful if Waypoint works with all the tools and patterns you work with. Waypoint is fully extensible via a plugin system that allows you to bring in custom builders, deployment platforms, and more.\n\n\U0001F30F https://www.waypointproject.io\n\n\U0001F9E9 https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint"
