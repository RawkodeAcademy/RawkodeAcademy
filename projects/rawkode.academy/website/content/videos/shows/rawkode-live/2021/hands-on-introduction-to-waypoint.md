  🔨 About the Technologies

  Waypoint

  Waypoint is a tool that enables developers to describe how to get their applications from development to production in a single file and deploy using a single command: waypoint up. After deployment, Waypoint provides tools such as logs, exec, and more to validate and debug any deployments. Waypoint is fully extensible based on a plugin system which allows Waypoint to work with any tools and platforms.

  Waypoint Goals
      Consistency of Workflows. Waypoint aims to provide an easy-to-use, consistent workflow for getting applications from development to production: waypoint up. We believe that fragmentation in workflow based on platform is a big challenge for teams that attempt to use multiple build, deploy, release tooling.
      Confidence in Deployment. The first thing any developer does after deploying is validate it works: open a browser, refresh the page, check logs, etc. Waypoint provides tools such as logs and exec to give you confidence that deployments succeed.
      Extensibility with the Ecosystem. Consistency is only useful if Waypoint works with all the tools and patterns you work with. Waypoint is fully extensible via a plugin system that allows you to bring in custom builders, deployment platforms, and more.
