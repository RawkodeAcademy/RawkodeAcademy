title: Hands-on Introduction to jsPolicy
description: "In this episode, we take a look at jsPolicy. We'll see how to get started writing validating and mutating policies in JavaScript for Kubernetes.\n\n\n\U0001F37F Rawkode Live\n\nHosted by David McKay / \U0001F426 https://twitter.com/rawkode\nWebsite: https://rawkode.live\nDiscord Chat: https://rawkode.live/chat\n\n#RawkodeLive\n\n\U0001F570 Timeline\n\n00:00 - Holding screen\n\n\U0001F465 About the Guests\n\nRich Burroughs\n\n  Rich Burroughs is a Senior Developer Advocate at Loft Labs where he's focused on improving workflows for developers and platform engineers using Kubernetes.

Most policies do not even take a single millisecond to execute.\nJavaScript is made for handling and manipulating JSON objects (short for \"JavaScript Object Notation\" (!)) and Kubernetes uses JSON by converting your YAML to JSON during every API request.\n\n\n\U0001F30F https://www.jspolicy.com/\n\n\U0001F9E9 https://github.com/loft-sh/jspolicy"
