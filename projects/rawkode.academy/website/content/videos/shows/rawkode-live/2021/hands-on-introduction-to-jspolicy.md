  🔨 About the Technologies

  jsPolicy

  jsPolicy is a policy engine for Kubernetes that allows you to write policies in JavaScript or TypeScript.
  jsPolicy runs policies with Google's super-fast V8 JavaScript engine in a pool of pre-heated sandbox environments. Most policies do not even take a single millisecond to execute.
  JavaScript is made for handling and manipulating JSON objects (short for "JavaScript Object Notation" (!)) and Kubernetes uses JSON by converting your YAML to JSON during every API request.
