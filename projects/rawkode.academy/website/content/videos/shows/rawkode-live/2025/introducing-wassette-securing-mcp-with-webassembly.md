subtitle: Microsoft just announced Wassette — a security-oriented runtime that bridges WebAssembly Components with the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
description: Microsoft just announced Wassette — a security-oriented runtime that bridges WebAssembly Components with the Model Context Protocol (MCP).\n\nIn this session, David is joined by Jiaxiao Zhou, Joshua Duffney, and Yosh Wuyts from Microsoft to go beyond the blog post and unpack how Wasette really works under the hood.\n\nWe’ll cover:\n\n- Why MCP needs hardened, capability-based security\n- How Wasette leverages Wasmtime and WebAssembly sandboxing\n- Secure execution of MCP tools fetched from OCI registries\n- Practical demos of permissions and isolation in action\n- What Wasette means for the future of AI agents and distributed systems security\n\nIf you’re working with MCP, building AI agents, or exploring WebAssembly beyond the browser, this session will give you a forward-looking and hands-on perspective.
