  Join Terence Lee, Heroku engineer and Cloud Native Buildpacks maintainer, for
  a practical session on CNBs. \n\nWe'll cover what buildpacks are, why they
  matter for containerizing applications, and walk through real
  implementations.\n\nWe'll cover:\n- Setting up and using buildpacks with
  different language stacks\n- Customizing buildpack behavior for your
  applications\n- Integration with CI/CD pipelines\n- Common pitfalls and how to
  avoid them\n\nThis is a working session - bring your questions about buildpack
  implementation, performance, or deployment strategies. Terence has been deep
  in the CNB ecosystem and will give you the unfiltered reality of what works
  and what doesn't.\n\nNo fluff, just practical knowledge from someone who
  builds the tools.
