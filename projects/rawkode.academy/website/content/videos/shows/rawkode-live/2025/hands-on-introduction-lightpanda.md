description: "Tired o10-11x faster while consuming 10x less RAM compared to Chrome headless, coupled with near-instant startup times. It directly tackles the challenges developers face when scaling resource-heavy tasks like web scraping or building AI agents that interact with the web, offering a significantly leaner alternative.   \\n\\nIn this Live Stream, You'll Discover:\\n\\nLive Performance Demo: Witness Lightpanda's speed and minimal resource footprint firsthand as we run comparisons against traditional headless browsers. See the difference \"built for headless\" makes.   \\nQuick Start Guide: We'll walk you through installing Lightpanda (available for Linux, macOS via direct download, and Windows via WSL) and running your first commands, like fetching and dumping web page content (./lightpanda fetch --dump URL). \\n\\nSeamless Integration (Puppeteer/Playwright): Learn how easily you can integrate Lightpanda into your existing automation scripts. We'll show you how to launch the Lightpanda CDP server (./lightpanda serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9222) and connect your Puppeteer or Playwright code by simply changing the browserWSEndpoint. Keep your scripts, swap the engine! \\n\\nThe Road Ahead: Hear directly from the creators about the future vision for Lightpanda, including the roadmap for expanding Web API coverage (a known current limitation ) and the ambition to provide a fundamentally better browser for machine-driven tasks.   \\n\\nOfficial Website: https://lightpanda.io    \\nGitHub (Open Source): https://github.com/lightpanda-io/browser    \\nDocumentation: https://lightpanda.io/docs/    \\nInstallation Steps: https://lightpanda.io/docs/getting-started/installation"
