title: Hands-on with Comtrya
description: |-
  Comtrya is a permissively licensed Open Source tool that is built 100% in Rust. It allows you, as the user, to provision and configure your systems through the use of simple configuration files using the YAML or TOML formats.

  The goals of comtrya are as follows:

  - Run on any operating system
  - Provide a simple YAML/TOML interface to, potentially, complex tasks

  Comtrya is open source and written in Rust.

  Comparison to alternatives:
  Ansible
    - Ansible is a great tool task runner, but comes with a lot of modules that aren't really necessary for localhost provisioning and can be cumbersome to run individual tasks within a playbook.

  SaltStack
    - SaltStack has been a favourite of mine (@rawkode) for many years, and while it's event system is a game changer for working with many devices - it's inability to display progress of large state runs makes it cumbersome to use for localhost provisioning.
