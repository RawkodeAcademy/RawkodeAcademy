  Dive deep into the world of cloud-native AI/ML model management! In this
  video, we'll explore how to leverage ORAS and OCI to streamline your AI/ML
  workflows.\n\nHere's what we'll cover:\n\n* *What are ORAS & OCI?* We'll start
  with a clear explanation of these essential technologies.\n* *Challenges of
  managing AI/ML Models in a cloud-native world:* Understand the complexities
  and pain points of deploying and managing AI/ML models in modern cloud
  environments.\n* *How to package an Ollama model as an OCI artifact:* Learn
  step-by-step how to containerize your Ollama models.\n* *Manage Ollama models
  as OCI Artifacts in an OCI registry:* Discover how to store, version, and
  distribute your models using OCI registries.\n* *Create a PV & PVC to mount
  the OCI artifact as a volume in Kubernetes (latest alpha feature):* Get
  hands-on experience with the cutting-edge Kubernetes feature that enables
  direct mounting of OCI artifacts as volumes.\n* *Deploy Ollama in a Pod and
  mount the model from the OCI registry:* See how to seamlessly integrate your
  containerized models into your Kubernetes deployments.\n* *Verify the Ollama
  model inside the container:* Ensure your model is correctly deployed and
  accessible.\n\n*Benefits:*\n\n* Learn how containerization and OCI artifacts
  simplify AI/ML model lifecycle management, versioning, and portability.\n*
  Stay ahead of the curve by adopting best practices for managing AI/ML models
  in a modern, cloud-native infrastructure.\n\nThis video is perfect for
  developers and DevOps engineers looking to enhance their AI/ML deployment
  strategies in a Kubernetes environment.
