title: MCP Servers for Rust Developers
subtitle: Join us live as we explore three powerful MCP servers that will transform how you develop and deploy Rust applications!
description: "Join us live as we explore three powerful MCP servers that will transform how you develop and deploy Rust applications!\\n\\nTogether with Mark S from shuttle.dev, we'll demonstrate how to leverage GitHub's MCP server to find and contribute to open source issues directly from your development environment, use Context7 to quickly understand and navigate unfamiliar Rust crates without drowning in documentation, and deploy your Rust applications seamlessly to shuttle.dev using their custom MCP server.\\n\\nWe'll show you the exact workflow from finding a good first issue to making your first contribution, all powered by MCP.\\n\\nWhether you're new to Rust or looking to contribute more to open source, this stream will give you practical tools to level up your development process. We'll walk through real scenarios: picking an approachable GitHub issue, using Context7 to understand the codebase and its dependencies, making the fix, and then deploying a working example to production on Shuttle. Mark will share insider tips on what makes a good first contribution and how shuttle's MCP server eliminates deployment headaches.\\n\\nCome with questions – we'll show you how these three MCP servers work together to create a streamlined path from code discovery to production deployment!"
