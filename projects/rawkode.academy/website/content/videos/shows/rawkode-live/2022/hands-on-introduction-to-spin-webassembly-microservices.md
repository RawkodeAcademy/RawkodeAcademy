title: 'Hands-on Introduction to Spin: WebAssembly Microservices'
description: >-
  In this live stream, David will be onboarding himself with Fermyon's Spin
  project, a WebAssembly framework for building microservices in your language
  of choice.


  Spin is an open source framework for building and running fast, secure, and
  composable cloud microservices with WebAssembly. It aims to be the easiest way
  to get started with WebAssembly microservices, and takes advantage of the
  latest developments in the WebAssembly component model and Wasmtime runtime.


  Spin offers a simple CLI that helps you create, distribute, and execute
  applications, and in the next sections we will learn more about Spin
  applications and how to get started.
