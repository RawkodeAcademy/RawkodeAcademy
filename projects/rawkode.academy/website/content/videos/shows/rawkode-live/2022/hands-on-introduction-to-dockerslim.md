title: Hands-on Introduction to DockerSlim
description: |-
  DockerSlim is a tool for developers that provides a set of commands (build, xray, lint and others) to simplify and optimize your developer experience with containers. It makes your containers betters, smaller and more secure.

  Don't change anything in your Docker container image and minify it by up to 30x making it secure too! Optimizing images isn't the only thing it can do though. It can also help you understand and author better container images.

  Keep doing what you are doing. No need to change anything. Use the base image you want. Use the package manager you want. Don't worry about hand optimizing your Dockerfile. You shouldn't have to throw away your tools and your workflow to have small container images.
