  The Helm Dashboard plugin offers a UI-driven way to view the installed Helm
  charts, see their revision history and corresponding k8s resources. Also, you
  can perform simple actions like roll back to a revision or upgrade to newer
  version.


  This project is part of Komodor's vision of helping Kubernetes users to
  navigate and troubleshoot their clusters.


  Some of the key capabilities of the tool:


  See all installed charts and their revision history

  See manifest diff of the past revisions

  Browse k8s resources resulting from the chart

  Easy rollback or upgrade version with a clear and easy manifest diff

  Integration with popular problem scanners

  Easy switch between multiple clusters
