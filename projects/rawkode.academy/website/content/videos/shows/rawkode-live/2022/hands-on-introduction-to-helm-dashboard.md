description: |-
  The Helm Dashboard plugin offers a UI-driven way to view the installed Helm charts, see their revision history and corresponding k8s resources. Also, you can perform simple actions like roll back to a revision or upgrade to newer version.

  This project is part of Komodor's vision of helping Kubernetes users to navigate and troubleshoot their clusters.

  Some of the key capabilities of the tool:

  See all installed charts and their revision history
  See manifest diff of the past revisions
  Browse k8s resources resulting from the chart
  Easy rollback or upgrade version with a clear and easy manifest diff
  Integration with popular problem scanners
  Easy switch between multiple clusters
