title: Hands-on Introduction to DevSpace
description: |-
  DevSpace is a client-only, open-source developer tool for Kubernetes:

  - Build, test and debug applications directly inside Kubernetes
  - Develop with hot reloading: updates your running containers without rebuilding images or restarting containers
  - Unify deployment workflows within your team and across dev, staging and production
  - Automate repetitive tasks for image building and deployment

  How does it work?

  DevSpace runs as a single binary CLI tool directly on your computer and ideally, you use it straight from the terminal within your IDE. DevSpace does not require a server-side component as it communicates directly to your Kubernetes cluster using your kube-context, just like kubectl.
