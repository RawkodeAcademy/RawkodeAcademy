title: Hands-on Introduction to Namespace
description: >-
  The all-in-one developer platform: Namespace provides a unified experience
  from development to production.


  You focus on the application. The platform takes care of the rest.


  Namespace was born out of necessity. When the Namespace Labs team was getting
  started on a different project, we faced the typical development workflow
  questions again.


  We wanted to jump to try out ideas for the application we wanted to build, but
  we were instead figuring out the latest recommendations for builds, tests, and
  production.


  Teams don't need to be caught up in this cycle.


  Namespace brings an opinionated but extensible all-in-one development and
  production experience to teams of all sizes.
