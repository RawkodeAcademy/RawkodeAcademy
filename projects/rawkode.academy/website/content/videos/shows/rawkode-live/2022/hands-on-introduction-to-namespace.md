title: Hands-on Introduction to Namespace
description: |-
  The all-in-one developer platform: Namespace provides a unified experience from development to production.

  You focus on the application. The platform takes care of the rest.

  Namespace was born out of necessity. When the Namespace Labs team was getting started on a different project, we faced the typical development workflow questions again.

  We wanted to jump to try out ideas for the application we wanted to build, but we were instead figuring out the latest recommendations for builds, tests, and production.

  Teams don't need to be caught up in this cycle.

  Namespace brings an opinionated but extensible all-in-one development and production experience to teams of all sizes.
