title: Monitoring Kubernetes with Prometheus & Robusta
description: |-
  Let’s take a look at some of the new features in Robusta that take your Kubernetes and Prometheus monitoring to the next level.

  Robusta is a troubleshooting and automations platform for Kubernetes. It streamlines everything that happens after you deploy your application. It is somewhat like Zapier/IFTTT for devops, written in Python, with an emphasis on prebuilt useful automations and not just "build your own".
