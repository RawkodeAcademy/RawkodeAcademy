title: Hands-on Introduction to Gitea
description: |-
  In this session, we take a look at Gitea - a self-hosted, pain-less, Git solution.

  Gitea is a painless self-hosted Git service. It is similar to GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab. Gitea is a fork of Gogs. See the Gitea Announcement blog post to read about the justification for a fork.

  The goal of this project is to provide the easiest, fastest, and most painless way of setting up a self-hosted Git service.

  With Go, this can be done platform-independently across all platforms which Go supports, including Linux, macOS, and Windows, on x86, amd64, ARM and PowerPC architectures. You can try it out using the online demo.
