title: Acing the DevOps Interview
description: >-
  New to DevOps? Today is another day for you to get started.


  Meet Rohit Ghumare, Founder of Keep Up, a community providing free training,
  Live and Recorded webinars, and various other educational resources across
  platforms like LinkedIn, Job portals, e-learning platforms and Developer
  communities for encouraging learning among enthusiastic learners with
  financial difficulties. He is also the Developer Advocate at solo.io, a
  company delivering application networking software that simplifies and unifies
  the configuration, operation and visibility of the network traffic within
  distributed applications.


  In conversation with David, Rohit discusses his journey to DevOps after
  graduating with a degree in Computer Engineering. He reveals exploring data
  science, machine learning, and Java product development before bumping into
  Cloud and DevOps. Data Science, ML, and Java, though interesting areas, failed
  to interest him significantly.


  Then, Cloud and DevOps happened. Rohit recollects how he loved learning about
  the different cloud technologies – hybrid multi cloud, AWS and GCP cloud
  providers felt fun. Gradually, MLOps happened too.


  Rohit loves learning and research and continues making the best of his time
  teaching, learning, and creating. He’s worked with different companies, has a
  considerable follower base for his learning community, and has knowledge about
  many technologies - a feat he’s achieved in less than two years of his
  professional journey.


  Some things you’ll learn in this episode:

  ● What is DevOps? How does it work? (You’ll have a comprehensive learning
  today)

  ● How to use Coursera’s financial aid to get free course certifications?

  ● The importance of industry knowledge for a computer engineer

  ● Walkthrough of different software tools – Terraform, Pulumi, Docker,
  Kubernetes

  ● What is a CI/CD pipeline?

  ● How to land remote DevOps jobs as a fresher?

  ● How important is knowing DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) for a job
  interview?

  ● MLOps for merging various machine learning models easily

  ● Easy and accessible resources for help in your coding journey
