title: Acing the DevOps Interview
description: |-
  New to DevOps? Today is another day for you to get started.

  Meet Rohit Ghumare, Founder of Keep Up, a community providing free training, Live and Recorded webinars, and various other educational resources across platforms like LinkedIn, Job portals, e-learning platforms and Developer communities for encouraging learning among enthusiastic learners with financial difficulties. He is also the Developer Advocate at solo.io, a company delivering application networking software that simplifies and unifies the configuration, operation and visibility of the network traffic within distributed applications.

  In conversation with David, Rohit discusses his journey to DevOps after graduating with a degree in Computer Engineering. He reveals exploring data science, machine learning, and Java product development before bumping into Cloud and DevOps. Data Science, ML, and Java, though interesting areas, failed to interest him significantly.

  Then, Cloud and DevOps happened. Rohit recollects how he loved learning about the different cloud technologies – hybrid multi cloud, AWS and GCP cloud providers felt fun. Gradually, MLOps happened too.

  Rohit loves learning and research and continues making the best of his time teaching, learning, and creating. He’s worked with different companies, has a considerable follower base for his learning community, and has knowledge about many technologies - a feat he’s achieved in less than two years of his professional journey.
