title: Hands-on Introduction to kluctl
description: |-
  Kluctl is the missing glue that puts together your (and any third-party) deployments into one large declarative Kubernetes deployment, while making it fully manageable (deploy, diff, prune, delete, ...) via one unified command line interface.

  Kluctl tries to be as flexible as possible, while remaining as simple as possible. It reuses established tools (e.g. Kustomize and Helm), making it possible to re-use a large set of available third-party deployments.

  Kluctl is centered around "targets", which can be a cluster or a specific environment (e.g. test, dev, prod, ...) on one or multiple clusters. Targets can be deployed, diffed, pruned, deleted, and so on. The idea is to have the same set of operations for every target, no matter how simple or complex the deployment and/or target is.
