title: Hands-on Introduction to Kubevious

  Find Kubernetes challenging to understand? Ruben Hakopian and his team might have found you a solution!

  Now you can make your Kubernetes environment easy to understand, avoid costly mistakes and outages, and make it overall safe and friendly to use with Ruben's software product, Kubevious. Formerly the Senior Software Engineer at multiple companies, Ruben founded Kubevious in 2019 in an attempt to improve overall Kubernetes and cloud-native experiences by enforcing and detecting through misconfigurations errors, conflicts or typos, violations, and best practices.

  Listen in to this Live Coding session and application walkthrough as Ruben unwinds everything you need to know to get started with it. From devising Kubevious to gradually including different new features, Ruben also dives into his journey to becoming an engineering leader. You'll learn everything about the software – from installing and running it in your system to its benefits, working, and optimization hacks!

  Key Takeaways:
  ● How does Kubevious work? How does it detect problems and ensure best practices? By correlating things happening in the cluster and ensuring that any changes made comply with the standard practices.
  ● How Kubevious started: Kubevious started as an internal project to see what kind of applications Ruben could have in his clusters without trying to connect the dots.
  ● In order to see how an app is deployed in Kubevious, you have to look at deployments and then check services that control how apps are exposed to the outside ingress, like volume mounts and config map secrets.
  ● Who can benefit from Kubevious? Many different kinds of users. For hobby projects, it can quickly help you get started with Kubernetes. For example, if you install a Helm chart with a few applications, it can make things more obvious with Kubernetes. For more complicated deployments, most likely in larger enterprises, complex deployments might focus more on capabilities like networking policies and writing their own detailed rules to enforce in complex scenarios.
  ● Kubevious feature: When the workload doesn't work, or when there are deployment issues, you can see the names propagated up to the application level with Kubevious, and it will guide you towards the area that needs more attention instead of showing themes and analyzing things in a table for you.
   
  We'll also explore how Kubevious listens to change requests in the CI/CD pipeline, identifies errors, the changes brought in with its latest version, and how it makes it more efficient than the older ones!
