title: Hands-on Introduction to Kubevious
description: >-
  Find Kubernetes challenging to understand? Ruben Hakopian and his team might
  have found you a solution!


  Now you can make your Kubernetes environment easy to understand, avoid costly
  mistakes and outages, and make it overall safe and friendly to use with
  Ruben's software product, Kubevious. Formerly the Senior Software Engineer at
  multiple companies, Ruben founded Kubevious in 2019 in an attempt to improve
  overall Kubernetes and cloud-native experiences by enforcing and detecting
  through misconfigurations errors, conflicts or typos, violations, and best
  practices.


  Listen in to this Live Coding session and application walkthrough as Ruben
  unwinds everything you need to know to get started with it. From devising
  Kubevious to gradually including different new features, Ruben also dives into
  his journey to becoming an engineering leader. You'll learn everything about
  the software – from installing and running it in your system to its benefits,
  working, and optimization hacks!


  Key Takeaways:

  ● How does Kubevious work? How does it detect problems and ensure best
  practices? By correlating things happening in the cluster and ensuring that
  any changes made comply with the standard practices.

  ● How Kubevious started: Kubevious started as an internal project to see what
  kind of applications Ruben could have in his clusters without trying to
  connect the dots.

  ● In order to see how an app is deployed in Kubevious, you have to look at
  deployments and then check services that control how apps are exposed to the
  outside ingress, like volume mounts and config map secrets.

  ● Who can benefit from Kubevious? Many different kinds of users. For hobby
  projects, it can quickly help you get started with Kubernetes. For example, if
  you install a Helm chart with a few applications, it can make things more
  obvious with Kubernetes. For more complicated deployments, most likely in
  larger enterprises, complex deployments might focus more on capabilities like
  networking policies and writing their own detailed rules to enforce in complex
  scenarios.

  ● Kubevious feature: When the workload doesn't work, or when there are
  deployment issues, you can see the names propagated up to the application
  level with Kubevious, and it will guide you towards the area that needs more
  attention instead of showing themes and analyzing things in a table for you.
   
  We'll also explore how Kubevious listens to change requests in the CI/CD
  pipeline, identifies errors, the changes brought in with its latest version,
  and how it makes it more efficient than the older ones!
