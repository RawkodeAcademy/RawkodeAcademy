title: CNCF Glossary & Linkerd with Catherine Paganini & Jason Morgan
description: |-
  The Cloud Native Glossary is a comprehensive list of terms related to Kubernetes and Cloud Native concepts, translated into multiple languages. It was created to make the concepts more accessible for both technical and non-technical people.

  This is an interview with Catherine Paganini and Jason Morgan from Buoyant, who have been leading the charge for the Cloud Native Glossary.

  As well as discussing the glossary, we dive into service mesh and Linkerd.
