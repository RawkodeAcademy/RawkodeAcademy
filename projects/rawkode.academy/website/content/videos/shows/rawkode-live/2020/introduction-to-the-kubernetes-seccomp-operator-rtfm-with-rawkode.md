title: Introduction to the Kubernetes Seccomp Operator (RTFM with Rawkode)
description: |-
  In this episode, joined by Daniel Mangum and Sascha Grunert, we take a look at the Seecomp Operator for Kubernetes; allowing for new security primitives for your Kubernetes environments.

  seccomp (short for secure computing mode) is a computer security facility in the Linux kernel. seccomp allows a process to make a one-way transition into a "secure" state where it cannot make any system calls except those defined through a seccomp profile.

  The Seccomp Operator is an out-of-tree Kubernetes enhancement which aims to make managing and applying seccomp profiles more easy and straight forward in Kubernetes.
