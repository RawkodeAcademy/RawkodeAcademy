  Building PHP Applications with Docker, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes (RTFM
  with Rawkode)
description: "In this episode, joined by Ciaran McNulty, we take a look at the best practices for developing Laravel PHP applications with Docker, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes.\n\nOur focus is on PHP applications run with nginx and php-fpm. This episode is a follow up to my \"Kickass Development Environments with Docker\" talk that I gave from 2016-2018.\n\nDubbed \"The PHP Framework for Web Artisan\", Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We’ve already laid the foundation — freeing you to create without sweating the small things.\n\n\n\U0001F570    Timeline\n\n00:00 - Holding screen\n00:50 - Introductions\n09:30 - Creating a Slim Framework application\n14:50 - Checking out the docker-compose.yml ... oh, did I write this? \U0001F62E\n30:15 - Adding a damn .editorconfig\n31:15 - Replacing the PHP dev server with nginx and php-fpm\n55:00 - Ditching compose 3.x for 2.x: leveraging complex dependencies with health-checks\n1:11:00 - Adding a multi-layer Dockerfile for build cache goodness\n1:29:00 - Deploying our application to Kubernetes\n\n\n\U0001F481\U0001F3FB‍♂️    Want some help?\n\n\U0001F4AC  Leave a comment\n\U0001F426  Ping me on Twitter - https://twitter.com/rawkode\n\U0001F4C6  Schedule some time during my office-hours - https://rawko.de/office-hours\n\n\n\U0001F30E    Links\n\nCiaran McNulty - https://twitter.com/CiaranMcNulty\nCode from Tutorial - https://gitlab.com/rawkode/php-examples/-/tree/main/docker-and-kubernetes"
