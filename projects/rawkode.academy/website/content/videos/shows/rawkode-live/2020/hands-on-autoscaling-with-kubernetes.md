Sign up at https://equinixmetal.com\n\n---\n\nKubernetes (commonly stylized as k8s) is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management.\n\nIt was originally designed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It aims to provide a \"platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts\". It works with a range of container tools, including Docker.\n\nMany cloud services offer a Kubernetes-based platform or infrastructure as a service (PaaS or IaaS) on which Kubernetes can be deployed as a platform-providing service. Many vendors also provide their own branded Kubernetes distributions.\n\n\nAutoscaling Special Interest Group\n\nCovers development and maintenance of components for automated scaling in Kubernetes. This includes automated vertical and horizontal pod autoscaling, initial resource estimation, cluster-proportional system component autoscaling, and autoscaling of Kubernetes clusters themselves.\n\n\n\U0001F570 Timeline\n\n00:00 - Holding screen\n00:40 - Introductions\n03:20 - About Kubernetes autoscaling\n09:40 - Different types of auto-scaling on Kubernetes\n11:50 - Autoscaling with resource metrics\n33:00 - Autoscaling with custom metrics\n57:00 - Autoscaling with external metrics\n1:17:45 - Vertical pod autoscaling\n\n\U0001F30E Resources\n\nGuy Templeton - https://twitter.com/GJTempleton\n\nTutorial - https://github.com/gjtempleton/k8s-autoscaling-by-example\nSIG Autoscaling - https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-autoscaling"
