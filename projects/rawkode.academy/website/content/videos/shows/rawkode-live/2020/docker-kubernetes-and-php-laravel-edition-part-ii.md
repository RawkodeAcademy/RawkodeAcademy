title: 'Docker, Kubernetes, & PHP: Laravel Edition (Part II)'
description: "In this episode, joined by Ciaran McNulty, we take a look at the best practices for developing Laravel PHP applications with Docker, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes.\n\nOur focus is on PHP applications run with nginx and php-fpm. This episode is a follow up to my \"Kickass Development Environments with Docker\" talk that I gave from 2016-2018.\n\nDubbed \"The PHP Framework for Web Artisan\", Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We’ve already laid the foundation — freeing you to create without sweating the small things.\n\n\U0001F570    Timeline\n\n00:00 - Holding Screen\n01:10 - Introductions\n01:50 - Context / Background: What are we going to do?\n11:00 - Looking at the development environment we provided last time\n12:00 - Docker for Mac volume options for better performance\n22:00 - Making asset / nodejs asset compilation a better experience for local development\n\n\nNote: We spent a lot of time working with explicit volume mounts to make the Laravel mix process work. It turns out that mix uses the location / existence of. The artisan file to establish the document root for asset compilation. The debugging around this should still be useful \U0001F62C\n\n\n\U0001F481\U0001F3FB‍♂️    Want some help?\n\n\U0001F4AC  Leave a comment\n\U0001F426  Ping me on Twitter - https://twitter.com/rawkode\n\U0001F4C6  Schedule some time during my office-hours - https://rawko.de/office-hours\n\n\U0001F30E    Links\n\nCiaran McNulty - https://twitter.com/CiaranMcNulty\nCode from Tutorial - https://gitlab.com/rawkode/php-examples"
