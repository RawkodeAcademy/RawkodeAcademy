  Tekton is a powerful and flexible open-source framework for creating CI/CD systems, allowing developers to build, test, and deploy across cloud providers and on-premise systems.

  Standardization
  Tekton standardizes CI/CD tooling and processes across vendors, languages, and deployment environments. It works well with Jenkins, Jenkins X, Skaffold, Knative, and many other popular CI/CD tools.

  Built-in best practices
  Tekton lets you create CI/CD systems quickly, giving you scalable, serverless, cloud native execution out of the box.

  Maximum flexibility
  Tekton abstracts the underlying implementation so that you can choose the build, test, and deploy workflow based on your team’s requirements.
