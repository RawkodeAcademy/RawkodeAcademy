title: 'Docker, Kubernetes, and PHP: Laravel Edition'
description: "In this episode, joined by Ciaran McNulty, we' take a look at the best practices for developing Laravel PHP applications with Docker, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes.\n\nOur focus is on PHP applications run with nginx and php-fpm. This episode is a follow up to my \"Kickass Development Environments with Docker\" talk that I gave from 2016-2018.\n\nDubbed \"The PHP Framework for Web Artisan\", Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We’ve already laid the foundation — freeing you to create without sweating the small things.\n\n\n\U0001F570    Timeline\n\n00:00 - Holding screen\n01:30 - Introductions\n04:30 - Looking at Flarum\n10:00 - Switching to pingcrm (Thanks @bowersbros)\n14:00 - How specific should I be with container images?\n17:00 - Adding MariaDB to `docker-compose.yml`\n19:30 - Adding nginx and fpm to `docker-compose.yml`\n24:00 - Dependencies and health-checks for `docker-compose.yml`\n33:00 - Fighting with `.env`\n56:00 - Interactive development with a the Docker shell pattern (dshell)\n1:02:00 - Add a multi-layer `Dockerfile`\n1:04:00 - Adding PHP extensions to the container image\n1:11:00 - Adding a `Makefile` to codify commands\n1:21:40 - Fighting with nginx\n1:40:00 - Deploying to Kubernetes\n\n\n\U0001F481\U0001F3FB‍♂️    Want some help?\n\n\U0001F4AC  Leave a comment\n\U0001F426  Ping me on Twitter - https://twitter.com/rawkode\n\U0001F4C6  Schedule some time during my office-hours - https://rawko.de/office-hours\n\n\n\U0001F30E    Links\n\nCiaran McNulty - https://twitter.com/CiaranMcNulty\nCode from Tutorial - https://gitlab.com/rawkode/php-examples"
