title: Example Mapping by Example
description: "Example mapping is a technique for fleshing out and gaining clarity around the acceptance criteria for a given story. It is based on the idea that multiple examples of specific cases convey information better than a single bad abstraction of a concept.\n\nExample mapping should be used when you have the right people in the room to be able to explain business rules and example scenarios, and a technical team that can ask the right questions about those rules. It should be used as a tool to ensure that the team appropriately understands what is expected of the story, and to get the stakeholders involved in the development of acceptance criteria.\n\nIt also brings to light misunderstandings while discussing specific examples of business rules.\n\n\U0001F570 Timeline\n\n00:00 - Holding screen\n00:40 - Introductions\n02:20 - What is Behaviour Driven Development?\n10:30 - What am I building?
