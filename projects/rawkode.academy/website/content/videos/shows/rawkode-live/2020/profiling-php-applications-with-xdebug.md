title: Profiling PHP Applications with Xdebug
description: |-
  In this episode, joined by Derick Rethans, we take a look at Xdebug and how it help you profile your PHP applications, allowing you to use a profiling front-end, like qcachegrind, to visualise your call graphs and dig into the bottlenecks of your applications.

  Xdebug is an extension for PHP to assist with debugging and development.

  - It contains a single step debugger to use with IDEs
  - It upgrades PHP's var_dump() function
  - It adds stack traces for Notices, Warnings, Errors and Exceptions
  - It features functionality for recording every function call and variable assignment to disk
  - It contains a profiler
  - It provides code coverage functionality for use with PHPUnit
