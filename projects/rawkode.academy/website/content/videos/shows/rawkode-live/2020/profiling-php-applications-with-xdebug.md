title: Profiling PHP Applications with Xdebug
description: "In this episode, joined by Derick Rethans, we take a look at Xdebug and how it help you profile your PHP applications, allowing you to use a profiling front-end, like qcachegrind, to visualise your call graphs and dig into the bottlenecks of your applications.\n\nXdebug is an extension for PHP to assist with debugging and development.\n\n- It contains a single step debugger to use with IDEs\n- It upgrades PHP's var_dump() function\n- It adds stack traces for Notices, Warnings, Errors and Exceptions\n- It features functionality for recording every function call and variable assignment to disk\n- It contains a profiler\n- It provides code coverage functionality for use with PHPUnit\n\n\n\U0001F570 Timeline\n\n00:00 - Holding Screen\n01:55 - Introductions\n06:30 - What are we going to profile?\n11:30 - Installing and enabling Xdebug extension with Pecl\n17:40 - Profiling our hello-world example\n28:20 - Profiling our factorial example\n46:20 - Profiling our simple composer configuration\n57:30 - Profiling our complex composer configuration\n1:09:00 - Compiling Xdebug 3 for the performance gains!\n1:13:00 - Profiling our complex composer configuration with much gains\n\n\n\U0001F30E Links\n\nDerick Rethans - https://twitter.com/derickr\nXdebug - https://xdebug.org/"
