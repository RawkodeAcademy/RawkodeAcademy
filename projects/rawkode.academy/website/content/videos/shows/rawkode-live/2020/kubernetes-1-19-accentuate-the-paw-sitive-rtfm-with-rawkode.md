Kubernetes builds upon 15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.\n\n\n\U0001F570    Timeline\n\n00:00 - Holding screen\n01:25 - Introductions\n13:30 - Kubernetes 1.19 major themes\n14:25 - Extending the Kubernetes support window to 12 months\n17:15 - Is Kubernetes releasing too often?\n23:00 - Storage capacity tracking, generic ephemeral volumes, & CSI volume health monitoring\n32:00 - Ingress GA\n36:10 - Structured Logging & klog\n43:00 - Structured Logging Demo\n53:45 - Immutable ConfigMap Demo\n1:03:30 - Seccomp Demo\n\n\n\U0001F481\U0001F3FB‍♂️    Want some help?\n\n\U0001F4AC  Leave a comment\n\U0001F426  Ping me on Twitter - https://twitter.com/rawkode\n\U0001F4C6  Schedule some time during my office-hours - https://rawko.de/office-hours\n\n\n\U0001F30E    Links\n\nTaylor Dolezal - https://twitter.com/onlydole\nKubernetes 1.19 - https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/08/26/kubernetes-release-1.19-accentuate-the-paw-sitive/"
