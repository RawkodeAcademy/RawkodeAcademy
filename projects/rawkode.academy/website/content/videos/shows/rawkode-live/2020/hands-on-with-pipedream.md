title: Hands-on with Pipedream
description: >-
  Pipedream is a serverless integration and compute platform that makes it easy
  to connect apps and develop event-driven workflows.


  Transform APIs into event streams


  Create event sources to listen for new Tweets, Github events, Airtable
  records, RSS items, webhook events and more. Inspect events in a
  human-friendly way, trigger Node.js workflows on every event, or consume
  events in your own app via API.


  Run Node.js code on every event


  Workflows are composed of Node.js code steps that run on every event. Write
  your own Node.js (and use any npm package) or reuse actions that scaffold
  popular APIs. Trigger via sources or a custom URL, email address, SDK code or
  schedule.


  Simple state management


  Maintain state between serverless executions with a line of code. You can
  maintain state for a workflow using $checkpoint, or for a specific step using
  this.$checkpoint. Just save and read values like any other variable.


  Use actions to scaffold popular APIs


  Send a message to Slack or Discord, store data in S3 or Snowflake, and more,
  all without writing any code (or customize it to your needs).
