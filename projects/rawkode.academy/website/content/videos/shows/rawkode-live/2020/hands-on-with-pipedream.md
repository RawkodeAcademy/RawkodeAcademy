description: |-
  Pipedream is a serverless integration and compute platform that makes it easy to connect apps and develop event-driven workflows.

  Transform APIs into event streams

  Create event sources to listen for new Tweets, Github events, Airtable records, RSS items, webhook events and more. Inspect events in a human-friendly way, trigger Node.js workflows on every event, or consume events in your own app via API.

  Run Node.js code on every event

  Workflows are composed of Node.js code steps that run on every event. Write your own Node.js (and use any npm package) or reuse actions that scaffold popular APIs. Trigger via sources or a custom URL, email address, SDK code or schedule.

  Simple state management

  Maintain state between serverless executions with a line of code. You can maintain state for a workflow using $checkpoint, or for a specific step using this.$checkpoint. Just save and read values like any other variable.

  Use actions to scaffold popular APIs

  Send a message to Slack or Discord, store data in S3 or Snowflake, and more, all without writing any code (or customize it to your needs).
