  Gravitational Teleport is a gateway for managing access to clusters of Linux servers via SSH or the Kubernetes API. It is intended to be used instead of traditional OpenSSH for organisations that need to:

  - Secure their infrastructure and comply with security best-practices and regulatory requirements.
  - Have complete visibility into activity happening across their infrastructure.
  - Reduce the operational overhead of privileged access management across both traditional and cloud-native infrastructure.
