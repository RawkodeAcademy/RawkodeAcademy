title: Hands-on Introduction to Gitea Actions
description: |-
  Gitea is a painless self-hosted all-in-one software development service, it includes Git hosting, code review, team collaboration, package registry and CI/CD. It is similar to GitHub, Bitbucket and GitLab. Gitea was forked from Gogs originally and almost all the code has been changed. See the Gitea Announcement blog post to read about the justification for a fork.

  It is similar and compatible to GitHub Actions, and its name is inspired by it too. To avoid confusion, we have clarified the spelling here:

  "Gitea Actions" (with an "s", both words capitalized) is the name of the Gitea feature.
  "GitHub Actions" is the name of the GitHub feature.
  "Actions" could refer to either of the above, depending on the context. So it refers to "Gitea Actions" in this document.
  "action" or "actions" refer to some scripts/plugins to be used, like "actions/checkout@v3" or "actions/cache@v3".
