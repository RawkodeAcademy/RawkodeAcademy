title: Hands-on Introduction to Restate
description: |-
  Restate is the platform for building resilient applications that tolerate all infrastructure faults w/o the need for a PhD. 

  Restate.dev is a platform designed to make building resilient, distributed applications much simpler. It allows developers to write familiar RPC-style services and functions, but executes them with an event-driven foundation for scalability and fault tolerance. It aims to eliminate the complexity typically associated with distributed systems, making them easier to build, debug, and operate, even in the face of infrastructure failures.

  Restate.dev provides a unique programming model combining the simplicity of RPC with the resilience of event-driven architectures. It achieves this by adding durability to invocations, promises, communication, and state, ensuring that applications can recover seamlessly from failures. It's designed to be flexible and can be used in various environments, including FaaS, Kubernetes, servers, and containers, both self-hosted and fully managed
