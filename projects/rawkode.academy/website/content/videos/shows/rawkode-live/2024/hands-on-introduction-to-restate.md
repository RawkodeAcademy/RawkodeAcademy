title: Hands-on Introduction to Restate
description: >-
  Restate is the platform for building resilient applications that tolerate all
  infrastructure faults w/o the need for a PhD. 


  Restate.dev is a platform designed to make building resilient, distributed
  applications much simpler. It allows developers to write familiar RPC-style
  services and functions, but executes them with an event-driven foundation for
  scalability and fault tolerance. It aims to eliminate the complexity typically
  associated with distributed systems, making them easier to build, debug, and
  operate, even in the face of infrastructure failures.

  Restate.dev provides a unique programming model combining the simplicity of
  RPC with the resilience of event-driven architectures. It achieves this by
  adding durability to invocations, promises, communication, and state, ensuring
  that applications can recover seamlessly from failures. It's designed to be
  flexible and can be used in various environments, including FaaS, Kubernetes,
  servers, and containers, both self-hosted and fully managed
