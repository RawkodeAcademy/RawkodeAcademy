title: Hands-on Introduction to Zitadel
description: >-
  Most applications require user identity for access control, secure data
  storage in the cloud, and to provide a consistent, personalized experience
  across all of a user's devices. With ZITADEL, you can rely on a hardened and
  extensible turnkey solution to address all your authentication and
  authorization needs. We offer a wide range of features out of the box to
  accelerate your project. These features include multi-tenancy with branding
  customization, secure login, self-service, OpenID Connect, OAuth2.x, SAML2,
  Passwordless with FIDO2 (including Passkeys), OTP, U2F, and an unlimited audit
  trail. Execute custom code on selected events within ZITADEL to ensure
  compatibility with your unique and complex software landscape and data models.


  ZITADEL is built with two essential patterns. Event Sourcing (ES) and Command
  and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS). Due to the nature of Event
  Sourcing ZITADEL provides the unique capability to generate a strong audit
  trail of ALL the things that happen to its resources, without compromising on
  storage cost or audit trail length.


  The combination of ES and CQRS makes ZITADEL eventual consistent which, from
  our perspective, is a great benefit in many ways. It allows us to build a
  Source of Records (SOR) which is the one single point of truth for all
  computed states. The SOR needs to be transaction safe to make sure all
  operations are in order.
