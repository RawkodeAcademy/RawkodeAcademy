title: Hands-on Introduction to Zitadel
description: |-
  Most applications require user identity for access control, secure data storage in the cloud, and to provide a consistent, personalized experience across all of a user's devices. With ZITADEL, you can rely on a hardened and extensible turnkey solution to address all your authentication and authorization needs. We offer a wide range of features out of the box to accelerate your project. These features include multi-tenancy with branding customization, secure login, self-service, OpenID Connect, OAuth2.x, SAML2, Passwordless with FIDO2 (including Passkeys), OTP, U2F, and an unlimited audit trail. Execute custom code on selected events within ZITADEL to ensure compatibility with your unique and complex software landscape and data models.

  ZITADEL is built with two essential patterns. Event Sourcing (ES) and Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS). Due to the nature of Event Sourcing ZITADEL provides the unique capability to generate a strong audit trail of ALL the things that happen to its resources, without compromising on storage cost or audit trail length.

  The combination of ES and CQRS makes ZITADEL eventual consistent which, from our perspective, is a great benefit in many ways. It allows us to build a Source of Records (SOR) which is the one single point of truth for all computed states. The SOR needs to be transaction safe to make sure all operations are in order.
