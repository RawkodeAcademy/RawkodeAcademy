title: Hands-on with RUNME
description: >-
  Runme is a tool that makes runbooks actually runnable, making it easier to
  follow step-by-step instructions. Shell/bash, Python, Ruby,
  Javascript/Typescript, Lua, PHP, Perl, and many other runtimes are supported
  via Runme's shebang feature. Runme allows users to execute instructions, check
  intermediate results, and ensure the desired outputs are achieved. This makes
  it an excellent solution for runbooks, playbooks, and documentation that
  requires users to complete runnable steps incrementally—making operational
  docs reliable and much less susceptible to bitrot.


  Runme achieves this by literally running markdown. More specifically, Runme
  runs your commands (shell, bash, zsh) or code inside your fenced code blocks.
  It's 100% compatible with your programming language's task definitions
  (Makefile, Gradle, Grunt, NPM scripts, Pipfile or Deno tasks, etc.) and
  markdown-native. Much like a terminal session, environment variables are
  retained across execution, and it is possible to pipe previous cells's output
  into successive cells. Runme persists your runbooks in markdown, which your
  docs are likely already using.
