title: Hands-on Introduction to Quickwit
description: |-
  Quickwit is the first engine to execute complex search and analytics queries directly on cloud storage with sub-second latency. Powered by Rust and its decoupled compute and storage architecture, it is designed to be resource-efficient, easy to operate, and scale to petabytes of data.

  Quickwit is a great fit for log management, distributed tracing, and generally immutable data such as conversational data (emails, texts, messaging platforms) and event-based analytics.
