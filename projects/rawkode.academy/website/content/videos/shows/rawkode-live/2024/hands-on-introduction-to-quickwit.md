title: Hands-on Introduction to Quickwit
description: >-
  Quickwit is the first engine to execute complex search and analytics queries
  directly on cloud storage with sub-second latency. Powered by Rust and its
  decoupled compute and storage architecture, it is designed to be
  resource-efficient, easy to operate, and scale to petabytes of data.


  Quickwit is a great fit for log management, distributed tracing, and generally
  immutable data such as conversational data (emails, texts, messaging
  platforms) and event-based analytics.
