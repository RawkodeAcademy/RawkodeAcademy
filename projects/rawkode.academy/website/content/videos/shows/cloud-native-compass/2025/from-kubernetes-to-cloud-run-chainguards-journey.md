  Exploring Cloud Migrations & Infrastructure Strategies with Jason Hall of
  Chainguard


  In this episode of the Cloud Native Compass podcast, hosts David Flanagan and
  Laura Santamaria chat with Jason Hall, Principal Engineer at Chainguard. They
  dive into Chainguard's migration from Kubernetes and Knative to Cloud Run,
  discussing the reasons behind the move, cost considerations, managing
  technical debt, and best practices for infrastructure management. The
  conversation also covers the benefits of using Cloud Run, their strategic use
  of BigQuery for event logging, and insights into least access security models.
  Tune in to learn more about navigating cloud-native environments and
  optimizing infrastructure.
