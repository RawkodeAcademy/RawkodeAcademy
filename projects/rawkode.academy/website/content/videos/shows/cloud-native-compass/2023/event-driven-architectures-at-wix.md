title: Event-Driven Architectures at Wix
description: >-
  In this episode of the Cloud Native Compass, host David Flanagan interviews
  Natan from Wix Engineering about event-driven architectures. 


  Natan shares his experience as a software engineer for almost 20 years and how
  working at Wix has improved his engineering skills. Wix has a powerful website
  building platform that has enabled people with different skill levels to build
  websites. They have expanded their reach from self-creators to agencies and
  web professionals and created a whole ecosystem platform. Wix has around 2,500
  microservices in production, even more added every week, and they have a lot
  of visitors, around 1 billion unique visitors every month, which gives more
  than 500 billion HTTP requests per day and 70 billion Kafka events produced
  every day.


  Let's learn how Natan and Wix build for success at some pretty stagger
  numbers.
