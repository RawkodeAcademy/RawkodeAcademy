title: Event Sourcing
description: >-
  In this episode, David interviews Frank, a staff engineer at Personio, a big
  HR company based out of Germany. Frank has been in the industry for close to
  15 years and has worked with various programming languages such as PHP,
  TypeScript, Kotlin, Java, Go, and Rust.


  Frank's interest in event-driven architecture started when he worked on a
  project for Schiphol airport. The website needed to ingest flight information
  as close to real-time as possible, and the only real way to do that for the
  scale they were at was through an event-based integration. Frank believes that
  event-driven architecture is the only way to do things for some projects.
