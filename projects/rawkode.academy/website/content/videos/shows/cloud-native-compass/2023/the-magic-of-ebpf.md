title: The Magic of eBPF
description: >-
  We're back with an exciting new episode of Cloud Native Compass, and this time
  we're diving deep into the captivating world of eBPF. Join Laura Santamaria,
  David Flanagan, and special guest Liz Rice as they unravel the mysteries and
  explore the incredible potential of this powerful technology!


  In this episode, you will learn:


  1. The two parts of eBPF: Discover the kernel program and the user space
  interaction that make up the magic of eBPF.

  2. Programming with eBPF: Explore the different options for writing eBPF
  programs, from bytecode form to higher-level languages like Rust.

  3. Compilers and SDKs: Learn which compilers, like clang GCC and the Rust
  compiler, support eBPF bytecode and how SDKs can make your interaction with
  eBPF programs easier.

  4. The Evolution of Packet Filtering: Trace the history of packet filtering,
  from its humble beginnings to the powerful and versatile capabilities of eBPF.

  5. The Widespread Adoption: Uncover the sudden rise in eBPF's popularity, its
  impact on observability and performance, and the role it plays in modern
  networking.

  Now, for a fascinating fun fact from the episode: Did you know that eBPF is
  now considered Turing complete? That's right! With its combination of
  features, eBPF has surpassed its humble start as a packet filtering tool and
  has become a full-fledged technology powerhouse.
