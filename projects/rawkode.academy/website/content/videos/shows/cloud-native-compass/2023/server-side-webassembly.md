title: Server-Side WebAssembly
description: >-
  In this episode of the Cloud Native Compass podcast, the guests discuss
  WebAssembly and server-side WebAssembly. The guests include Kevin Hoffman, CTO
  of Cosmonic and creator of the WasmCloud open source project, Connor Hicks,
  founder and CEO of Suborbital, and Kate Goldenring, senior software engineer
  at Fermyon.


  They each share their experiences and paths to working with WebAssembly, with
  Kevin having experimented with Asm.js and CloudABI before discovering
  WebAssembly, Connor being drawn to the performance benefits of WebAssembly for
  a job processing framework, and Kate coming from a Kubernetes background and
  working on a project called Krustlet, which was an attempt to run WebAssembly
  instead of containers on Kubernetes.


  The discussion also covers the WebAssembly Systems Interface (WASI), which was
  originally created to give WebAssembly modules access to low-level external
  services like file descriptors and standard out, but is evolving towards a
  component model where external services are high-level abstractions like web
  clients, web servers, and key value stores. WASI is defined by WIT interfaces
  that give access to host resources or other resources that the host can
  control.


  Overall, the episode provides insights into the growing use of WebAssembly and
  server-side WebAssembly in cloud-based applications and the potential benefits
  they offer.
