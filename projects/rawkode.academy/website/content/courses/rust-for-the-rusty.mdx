  I got a bit rusty (pun intended) over the time, so I wanted to take the time and re-learn Rust.
  Join me on my journey to travel through 10 years of Rust history and learn a new thing or two ðŸ¦€

## What's for dinner?

First we dive into the history of Rust and then walk through the inner workings & basics of the language.

To have some project to work on and apply the learned knowledge, we're developing a "dotfile manager":
* We'll write our own custom language
* We'll support symlinks / file copying and templates
* We'll think about on "how to get secrets into our dotfiles safely?"

This will be a long journey, so I'll maybe split up the course in multiple parts.
