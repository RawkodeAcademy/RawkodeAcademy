## About this Course

GraphQL Federation has become the de facto standard for building scalable, distributed GraphQL architectures. In this advanced course, we'll explore how to leverage WunderGraph Cosmo to build, deploy, and manage federated GraphQL services at scale.

You'll learn how to:
- Design and implement federated GraphQL schemas
- Build and compose multiple GraphQL subgraphs
- Handle authentication and authorization across federated services
- Optimize performance with caching and query planning
- Monitor and debug distributed GraphQL systems
- Deploy and scale federated architectures in production

Whether you're migrating from a monolithic GraphQL API or building a new distributed system from scratch, this course will provide you with the knowledge and practical skills needed to succeed with GraphQL Federation using WunderGraph Cosmo.
