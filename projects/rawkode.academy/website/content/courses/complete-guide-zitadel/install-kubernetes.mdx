# Installing Zitadel on Kubernetes with Helm

## Overview

This comprehensive hands-on tutorial demonstrates how to deploy Zitadel, the modern identity and access management platform, to a Kubernetes cluster using the official Helm charts. Starting with essential prerequisites including a running Kubernetes cluster (kind, minikube, or cloud-based) and the ability to execute kubectl and Helm commands, you'll learn the complete deployment process from start to finish.

## What You'll Learn

### Prerequisites and Setup
- Setting up a Kubernetes cluster (kind, minikube, or cloud-based)
- Installing and configuring kubectl and Helm
- Exploring the official `zitadel/zitadel-charts` repository
- Understanding deployment examples and configuration options

### Database Configuration
- **PostgreSQL Best Practices**: Learn why providing your own PostgreSQL instance is recommended over Helm dependencies
- **CloudNativePG Setup**: Practical demonstration of setting up a simple but effective PostgreSQL cluster
- **Database Credentials**: Configuring admin and user database credentials securely
- **Secret Management**: Using environment variables for sensitive configuration data

### Core Installation Process
- Adding the Zitadel Helm repository
- Configuring the deployment values file
- Setting up critical security configurations including master key management
- Executing the Helm installation with real terminal commands
- Troubleshooting common deployment issues

### Accessing and Validating the Deployment
- Configuring external domain settings for local development
- Setting up port forwarding to access the Zitadel console
- Initial admin login and password configuration
- Validating the deployment with kubectl commands

## Advanced Production Configurations

### Security and Secrets Management
- **Referenced Secrets**: Enhanced security through Kubernetes secret integration
- **Master Key Configuration**: Secure generation and storage of encryption keys
- **Non-root Execution**: Security contexts for safer container operations

### High Availability and Scaling
- **Multi-replica Setup**: Configuring high availability with multiple Zitadel instances
- **Pod Disruption Budgets**: Ensuring zero-downtime during updates and maintenance
- **Resource Management**: CPU, memory, and storage configuration for production workloads

### Production Infrastructure
- **Ingress Configuration**: Setting up external access through ingress controllers
- **TLS and DNS**: Proper domain and certificate management
- **Monitoring Integration**: Metrics collection for Prometheus and service monitors
- **Additional Manifests**: Deploying complementary services like secrets, service mesh config, or OpenTelemetry collectors

## Day-Two Operations
- Monitoring and observability setup
- Update and upgrade strategies
- Backup and disaster recovery considerations
- Performance tuning and optimization

## Outcome

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a **fully functional, production-ready Zitadel deployment** running securely on Kubernetes, complete with:

- ✅ Secure PostgreSQL integration
- ✅ Proper secret management
- ✅ High availability configuration
- ✅ Monitoring and metrics collection
- ✅ Production-grade security settings
- ✅ External access configuration

This foundation prepares you for the next phase: setting up your first Zitadel project and configuring authentication flows.
