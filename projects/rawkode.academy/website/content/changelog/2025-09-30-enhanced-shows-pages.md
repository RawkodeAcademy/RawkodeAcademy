**What's New:**

  thumbnail
- **Episode counts** - See at a glance how many episodes are available
- **Latest episode info** - Quick preview of the most recent episode title
- **Host labels** - Clear "Hosted by:" labels so you know who's behind each
  show
- **Better empty states** - Shows without episodes display a friendly message
  instead of 404

  improved visual hierarchy

  visual previews
