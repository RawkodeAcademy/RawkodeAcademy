In this article, we'll explore the design and implementation of our federated GraphQL API. This API serves as a single, unified interface to our microservice architecture, allowing clients to query and retrieve data from multiple services in a single request. If you're unfamiliar with GraphQL federation, it's an architectural pattern that combines multiple GraphQL schemas into a unified graph, enabling seamless data access across service boundaries.

We'll cover the benefits of using a federated GraphQL API, the challenges we faced during implementation, and the tools and techniques we used to build and deploy our solution. You'll see practical examples of how clients can interact with our API and how it dramatically simplifies the process of querying data from across multiple microservices.

By the end of this article, you'll understand how federated GraphQL APIs work and how they can create a more efficient and flexible API layer in a microservice architecture.

## Why Federated GraphQL?

In a microservice architecture, multiple services are responsible for different domains of an application. Each service typically has its own database and API, which can lead to clients needing to make multiple requests to different services to retrieve all necessary data.

A federated GraphQL API solves this problem by providing a single, unified interface to multiple services. Clients send a single GraphQL query to the federation layer, which handles fetching data from the appropriate services and aggregating it into a cohesive response.

This approach offers several significant benefits:

- **Reduced network requests**: Clients make just one request to the federated API instead of multiple requests to different services, reducing latency and bandwidth usage.
- **Simplified client code**: Developers write a single GraphQL query to retrieve data across service boundaries, eliminating complex data-fetching orchestration code.
- **Centralized data fetching logic**: The federation layer manages complex data retrieval patterns, including cross-service relationships, without burdening client applications.
- **Enhanced caching**: The federation layer can implement intelligent caching strategies, reducing load on downstream services and improving response times.
- **Incremental adoption**: Teams can add services to the federation incrementally, without disrupting existing functionality.

## Example

To understand our API and its federation, it makes sense to first see an example query.

```graphql
query {
  getLatestVideos(limit: 2) {
    id # videos-service

    title # videos-service

    creditsForRole(role: "host") {
      person {
        forename # people-service
        surname # people-service

        biography  # people-biographies-service

        links {
          url  # people-links-service
        }
      }
    }

    likes  # video-likes-service
  }
}
```

As you can see from the comments above, this single query is fetching data from multiple services. The `getLatestVideos` field is from the `videos-service`, and it's returning the `id` and `title` of the video. We're also fetching the `creditsForRole` from the `people-service`, the `biography` from the `people-biographies-service`, and the `links` from the `people-links-service`. Finally, we're fetching the `likes` from the `video-likes-service`.

## Our Federated GraphQL Stack

Our federated GraphQL API is built using Apollo Federation's specification, but we've chosen to implement it using a fully open-source stack:

### GraphQL Yoga

[GraphQL Yoga](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server) serves as our GraphQL server, chosen for its:

- **Flexibility**: Runs anywhere JavaScript can run, including Cloudflare Workers and Deno (our preferred environment over Node.js)
- **Simplicity**: Offers straightforward setup with sensible defaults
- **Extensibility**: Supports a rich plugin ecosystem
- **Federation support**: Natively implements Apollo Federation specifications

### Pothos

[Pothos](https://pothos-graphql.dev/) is our TypeScript schema builder, selected after evaluating several alternatives. Key advantages include:

- **Type safety**: Provides end-to-end type safety from database to GraphQL schema
- **Code-first approach**: Enables us to define schemas in TypeScript rather than SDL
- **Plugin architecture**: Offers modular functionality including direct Drizzle ORM integration
- **Developer experience**: Excellent autocompletion and type inference

### WunderGraph Cosmo

[WunderGraph Cosmo](https://wundergraph.com) manages our federated graph lifecycle, offering:

- **Composition checks**: Validates schema changes against the complete federated graph
- **Router**: Efficiently directs queries to the appropriate subgraphs
- **Analytics**: Provides insights into API usage patterns
- **Distributed tracing**: Helps identify performance bottlenecks across services
- **Schema registry**: Maintains a history of schema changes and enables rollbacks

## Building Our Federated GraphQL API

To demonstrate the power of our approach, let's walk through a real-world example: adding a new field to an existing entity without modifying the original service. We'll add thumbnail capabilities to videos by creating a dedicated thumbnails service.

### Defining the Database Schema

We use [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) for all our database interactions, providing type-safe queries and automated migrations.

Here's the existing schema from our `videos` service:

```typescript
import { createId } from '@paralleldrive/cuid2';
import { integer, sqliteTable, text } from 'drizzle-orm/sqlite-core';

export const videosTable = sqliteTable('videos', {
  // Unique identifier for each video
  id: text('id').primaryKey().$default(createId),
  // Core video metadata
  title: text('title').notNull(),
  subtitle: text('subtitle').notNull(),
  slug: text('slug').notNull().unique(),
  description: text('description').notNull(),
  // Technical details
  duration: integer({ mode: 'number' }).notNull(),
  publishedAt: integer({ mode: 'timestamp' }).notNull(),
});
```

Now, we'll create a new service, `thumbnails`, with its own schema:

```typescript
import { sqliteTable, text } from 'drizzle-orm/sqlite-core';

export const thumbnailsTable = sqliteTable('video-thumbnails', {
  // References the video ID from the videos service
  id: text('id').notNull().unique(),
  // URL to the thumbnail image
  url: text('url').notNull(),
});
```

This simple schema allows us to store thumbnail URLs associated with video IDs. Drizzle's `drizzle-kit` handles migration generation automatically.

### Defining the GraphQL Schema

Next, we transform our database schema into a GraphQL type using Pothos with its Drizzle plugin. The key to federation is how we reference and extend existing types:

```typescript
import drizzlePlugin from '@pothos/plugin-drizzle';
import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm';
import * as dataSchema from './schema.ts';

// Create a GraphQL schema builder with Drizzle plugin
const builder = new SchemaBuilder({
  plugins: [drizzlePlugin()],
});

// Reference and extend the Video type from another service
builder.externalRef(
  'Video',
  builder.selection<{ id: string }>('id'),
).implement({
  // The 'id' field is defined in the original videos service
  externalFields: (t) => ({
    id: t.string(),
  }),
  // Add our new thumbnail field to the Video type
  fields: (t) => ({
    thumbnail: t.field({
      type: 'String',
      nullable: true,
      resolve: async (video) => {
        // Use Drizzle to query the thumbnail for this video
        const result = await db.query.videoThumbnails.findFirst({
          columns: {
            url: true,
          },
          where: eq(dataSchema.videoThumbnails.id, video.id),
        });

        return result?.url || '';
      },
    }),
  }),
});
```

The magic of federation happens in these few lines. We're:

1. Declaring that we know about an external `Video` type
2. Specifying that we need the `id` field to resolve references
3. Adding our new `thumbnail` field to the existing `Video` type
4. Providing a resolver that fetches the thumbnail URL from our database

This approach follows Apollo Federation's [entity resolution pattern](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/entities/), allowing the federation layer to "stitch together" data from multiple services.

### Publishing the Schema Changes

After defining our schema, we need to register it with WunderGraph Cosmo. First, we generate an SDL representation of our schema:

```typescript
import { printSchemaWithDirectives } from '@graphql-tools/utils';
import { lexicographicSortSchema } from 'graphql';
import { getSchema } from './schema.ts';

// Convert our code-first schema to SDL format
const schemaAsString = printSchemaWithDirectives(
  lexicographicSortSchema(getSchema()),
  {
    pathToDirectivesInExtensions: [''],
  },
);

// Write the schema to a file
Deno.writeFileSync(
  `${import.meta.dirname}/schema.gql`,
  new TextEncoder().encode(schemaAsString),
);
```

Then, we publish this schema to Cosmo using the WunderGraph CLI:

```bash
bunx wgc subgraph publish ${SERVICE_NAME} \
  --namespace production \
  --schema ./read-model/schema.gql \
  --routing-url https://${SERVICE_NAME}-read-458678766461.europe-west2.run.app
```

Cosmo then:
1. Validates our schema against the existing federation
2. Checks for breaking changes
3. Updates the router configuration
4. Notifies us of any issues or successful completion

## Why We Love This Approach

This architecture has transformed how we build and expose our services:

**Incremental evolution**: We can add fields and capabilities without modifying existing services, enabling parallel development by multiple teams.

**Type safety throughout**: With Drizzle and Pothos, we have end-to-end type safety from database to API, catching errors at compile time rather than runtime.

**Developer autonomy**: Teams can evolve their domains independently while maintaining a cohesive API for consumers.

**Operational visibility**: WunderGraph Cosmo provides comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and tracing, making it easier to identify and resolve issues.

**Read-write separation**: By focusing our federation on read operations, we've simplified our architecture while maintaining clear command responsibility in individual services.

## Conclusion

Federated GraphQL has proven to be a powerful solution for our microservice architecture, providing a unified API that simplifies client development while preserving service autonomy. By leveraging open-source tools like GraphQL Yoga, Pothos, and WunderGraph Cosmo, we've built a robust, scalable system that supports rapid development across multiple teams.

If you're facing challenges with API integration in a microservice environment, we highly recommend considering a federated GraphQL approach. The initial investment in setting up the federation layer pays dividends in development speed, code quality, and system performance.
