I love shiny things, and when it comes to build tools, I'm always looking for a better way. That's what led me to create [cuenv](https://github.com/cuenv/cuenv), a modern toolchain built around CUE's powerful constraint-based system. There was just one problem: I'm building `cuenv` in Rust, and CUE's only mature evaluator is written in Go.

So, what do you do when you want the best of both worlds? You build a bridge.

This is the story of how I built **cuengine**, a high-performance, production-grade FFI library that lets Rust speak Go. We'll dive into the nitty-gritty of FFI, memory safety, and how to create a safe, ergonomic API on top of a completely different runtime. Let's get into it.

## The Core Problem: Two Runtimes, One Library

If you haven't used it, CUE (Configure, Unify, Execute) is a fantastically powerful configuration language with a sophisticated type system. The official Go implementation is mature and battle-tested. But my build toolchain, `cuenv`, had to be in Rust. For me, the reasons were clear:

-   **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership model wipes out entire classes of bugs.
-   **Performance**: I wanted zero-cost abstractions and predictable performance.
-   **Ecosystem**: The crate ecosystem for CLI tools and system integration is second to none.
-   **Cross-Compilation**: First-class support for targeting multiple platforms is a must.

So the question was never *if* I should use Rust, but *how* to bring CUE along for the ride.

### Why Not Just Port CUE to Rust?

Look, I'm not a masochist—at least not for this kind of punishment. Porting an entire language implementation is a multi-year odyssey of parser rewrites, type system reimplementation, and endless compatibility testing. Even if I pulled it off, I'd be chained to maintaining it against every upstream CUE change forever.

No, thanks. I chose pragmatism: build a thin, safe FFI layer that uses the existing Go implementation while exposing a clean, native Rust API.

## My Solution: A Three-Layer Architecture

I settled on an architecture with three carefully designed layers, each with a very specific job:

### Layer 1: The Go Bridge (`bridge.go`)

Over on the Go side, I wrote a simple bridge that handles the CUE evaluation and hands back structured JSON responses.

```go
type BridgeResponse struct {
    Version string           `json:"version"`
    Ok      *json.RawMessage `json:"ok,omitempty"`
    Error   *BridgeError     `json:"error,omitempty"`
}

//export cue_eval_package
func cue_eval_package(dirPath *C.char, packageName *C.char) *C.char {
    // Evaluate CUE and return structured envelope
}
```

A few key decisions made this work reliably:

-   **Structured Envelopes**: Every response is a predictable JSON object. You either get success data (`ok`) or a typed error (`error`). No guessing.
-   **Ordered JSON**: CUE's field order can be significant, so I couldn't rely on Go's randomized map ordering. I had to build the JSON string manually to keep it deterministic.
-   **Panic Recovery**: An FFI boundary should *never* panic. I wrapped the core logic in a recover block to catch any panics and turn them into proper errors.
-   **Typed Error Codes**: I created a set of error codes (and synced them with the Rust side) to let the caller know exactly what went wrong.

### Layer 2: The FFI Boundary (`lib.rs`)

This is where the real magic (and danger) happens. FFI in Rust means `unsafe` code, and you have to treat it with respect. My approach was to contain it as much as possible inside a safe wrapper.

```rust
pub struct CStringPtr {
    ptr: *mut c_char,
    _marker: PhantomData<*const ()>, // !Send + !Sync
}

impl Drop for CStringPtr {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        if !self.ptr.is_null() {
            unsafe { cue_free_string(self.ptr); }
        }
    }
}
```

I built this `CStringPtr` as a RAII wrapper. It's a smart pointer that:
-   Automatically calls the Go `cue_free_string` function when it goes out of scope.
-   Prevents use-after-free bugs by tying the memory to Rust's ownership system.
-   Uses `PhantomData` to mark the type as `!Send` and `!Sync`, which prevents it from being used across threads. This is critical because Go's runtime isn't thread-safe in the way Rust expects.

### Layer 3: The Safe Application Layer (`builder.rs`)

This is the public-facing API. I designed it to completely hide the FFI complexity behind a friendly builder pattern.

```rust
let evaluator = CueEvaluator::builder().build()?;
let result = evaluator.evaluate(path, "cuenv")?;
```

Anyone using the `cuengine` crate never sees a raw pointer, a C string, or any `unsafe` code. They get a safe, ergonomic Rust API that provides:
-   Input validation before FFI calls.
-   Output size limits to prevent abuse.
-   Rich, structured error types.

## Tackling the Hard Problems

Building this wasn't exactly a walk in the park. Here are some of the biggest hurdles I had to overcome.

### Hurdle #1: Taming Memory Across Runtimes

**The Challenge**: Go has a garbage collector. Rust has ownership. When Go allocates memory and gives Rust a pointer, who is responsible for cleaning it up?

**My Solution**: Explicit ownership transfer with my `CStringPtr` RAII wrapper.

When the Go bridge allocates a C string, it hands ownership over to Rust. My `CStringPtr` wrapper takes that ownership, and its `Drop` implementation guarantees that the memory is freed exactly once, even if errors occur.

```rust
let result_ptr = unsafe { cue_eval_package(c_dir.as_ptr(), c_package.as_ptr()) };
let result = unsafe { CStringPtr::new(result_ptr) }; // Takes ownership
// result is automatically freed when it goes out of scope. Magic!
```

The `PhantomData` marker is the unsung hero here, preventing any accidental use of the pointer across threads that could lead to subtle, horrifying bugs.

### Hurdle #2: Don't Lose the Error Context!

**The Challenge**: A simple string like `"CUE evaluation failed"` is a useless error. Go's errors have rich context, and I needed to preserve it across the FFI boundary.

**My Solution**: Structured error envelopes with typed codes.

Instead of just returning an error string, the Go bridge sends back a full JSON object for errors.

```json
{
  "version": "bridge/1",
  "error": {
    "code": "LOAD_INSTANCE",
    "message": "Failed to load CUE instance: undefined field foo",
    "hint": "Check CUE syntax and import statements"
  }
}
```

I synchronized the error codes (like `LOAD_INSTANCE`) as constants in both Go and Rust. This allows the Rust code to deserialize the error and map it into a proper, typed Rust `Error`.

```rust
match bridge_error.code.as_str() {
    ERROR_CODE_INVALID_INPUT => Err(Error::configuration(full_message)),
    ERROR_CODE_LOAD_INSTANCE => Err(Error::cue_parse(dir_path, full_message)),
    _ => Err(Error::ffi("cue_eval_package", full_message)),
}
```

It's more work, but it makes debugging a thousand times easier.

### Hurdle #3: Making it Build... Everywhere

**The Challenge**: My build process now needed a Go compiler, a C toolchain, and the Rust compiler, all playing nicely together. How could I make this work for other developers without a 30-step setup guide?

**My Solution**: A smart `build.rs` script with fallbacks.

I put a lot of effort into the `build.rs` script to make it as robust as possible:
1.  First, it checks for pre-built artifacts from my Nix-based workflow.
2.  If it can't find any, it falls back to building the Go bridge from source.
3.  It then configures platform-specific linking, because macOS, Linux, and Windows all need different system libraries.

This approach gives me fast, reproducible builds in my environment while still allowing anyone with `go` and `rustc` installed to build the crate from scratch.

### Hurdle #4: Preserving CUE's Field Order

**The Challenge**: This one was subtle but critical. For `cuenv` to work as a task runner, the order of tasks defined in a CUE file *must* be preserved. But Go's standard `encoding/json` library randomizes map key order by design. This would have completely broken my task execution logic.

**My Solution**: Ditching `encoding/json` and building the JSON manually.

The only way to guarantee order was to walk the CUE value structure myself and build the JSON string piece by piece.

```go
func buildOrderedJSONString(v cue.Value) (string, error) {
    switch v.Kind() {
    case cue.StructKind:
        var parts []string
        // Iterate through fields in the order they appear in CUE
        fields, err := v.Fields(cue.Optional(true))
        // ...
        for fields.Next() {
            // ... manually build "key":value string parts
        }
        return "{" + strings.Join(parts, ",") + "}", nil
    // ... handle lists and primitives
    }
}
```

This was a bit tedious to write, but it ensures the JSON output is deterministic and perfectly matches the order from the original CUE file.

## Safety and Observability

What separates a quick hack from a production-grade library? For me, it's about getting the fundamentals right: memory safety, fail-fast validation, and comprehensive observability. Here's what makes `cuengine` solid:

-   **Comprehensive Validation**: The API validates all inputs *before* they hit the FFI boundary. Path traversal attempts, oversized inputs, and invalid names are all rejected early with clear error messages.
-   **Structured Tracing**: I instrumented every important operation with `tracing`, providing detailed observability for debugging and monitoring in production environments.

## My Testing Strategy

I'm a firm believer in a multi-layered testing strategy. For `cuengine`, that meant:

-   **Unit Tests**: For testing the small stuff, like my `CStringPtr` wrapper and UTF-8 conversions.
-   **Integration Tests**: For end-to-end evaluation of real CUE files, making sure the whole pipeline works.
-   **Property Tests**: Using `proptest` to throw randomized inputs at my validation and parsing logic to shake out edge cases.
-   **Stress Tests**: Running the FFI calls in tight loops to check for memory leaks or race conditions.

## Performance Characteristics

The FFI bridge obviously adds some overhead, but for evaluating configuration files, it's more than acceptable. I ran benchmarks using `criterion` to see what I was dealing with:

| Configuration Size | Time     | Notes                    |
| ------------------ | -------- | ------------------------ |
| 10 variables       | ~3.7ms   | Small config             |
| 100 variables      | ~4.1ms   | Minimal parsing overhead |
| 1,000 variables    | ~9.8ms   | Medium config            |
| 10,000 variables   | ~136ms   | Large config             |
| 100,000 variables  | ~11.3s   | Extreme scale test       |

The benchmarks show performance scales linearly with the size of the configuration, which is exactly what I was hoping for. For a build tool, where you evaluate config once per run, this overhead is a tiny price to pay for the power of CUE.

## My Key Takeaways

1.  **FFI is Unsafe, So Contain It.** The public API of `cuengine` is 100% safe. All the `unsafe` code is an internal detail, carefully documented and wrapped in safe abstractions.
2.  **Good Errors are Worth the Effort.** Moving from simple error strings to structured JSON envelopes was extra work, but it made the library immensely more robust and easier to debug.
3.  **Build Scripts are First-Class Code.** I spent almost as much time on `build.rs` as on some of the library features. A good build experience is a feature in itself.
4.  **Fail Fast with Clear Errors.** Input validation and structured tracing aren't things you bolt on later. Building them in from the start makes debugging infinitely easier.

## What's Next

`cuengine` is the solid foundation, but the real fun is the rest of the `cuenv` project I'm building on top of it:

-   **A full-featured CLI** for task execution and environment management.
-   **Nix Integration** for automatic software provisioning.
-   **Pluggable secret management** for 1Password, AWS Secrets Manager, and more.

## Try It Yourself

`cuengine` is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/cuengine) with full [API documentation](https://docs.rs/crate/cuengine/latest) on docs.rs. The complete source is available at [github.com/cuenv/cuenv](https://github.com/cuenv/cuenv).

To use it in your Rust project:

```toml
[dependencies]
cuengine = "0.1.1"
```

```rust
use cuengine::CueEvaluator;
use std::path::Path;

let evaluator = CueEvaluator::builder().build()?;
let json = evaluator.evaluate(Path::new("./config"), "mypackage")?;
```

## Conclusion

Building this FFI bridge was a fascinating journey. It taught me that you don't have to choose between safety and pragmatism. By carefully containing `unsafe` code, designing for robust error handling, and thinking about production features from the start, it's possible to bring two very different ecosystems together and get the best of both.

If you're building tools that need CUE in Rust, I hope `cuengine` gives you a solid foundation. And if you're tackling any FFI project, I hope my story helps you sidestep some of the pitfalls I stumbled into!
