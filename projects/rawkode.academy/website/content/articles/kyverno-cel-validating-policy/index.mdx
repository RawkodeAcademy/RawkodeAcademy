Kyverno 1.14 (released April 25, 2025) introduces dedicated ValidatingPolicy and ImageValidatingPolicy types that leverage CEL (Common Expression Language) - the same validation language Kubernetes now uses natively, creating a unified policy experience across your entire stack.

For platform engineers and security teams implementing policy-as-code in Kubernetes, this convergence represents a fundamental shift toward standardization and performance. Let's explore why this matters and how to get started.

## The CEL Convergence

Kubernetes' adoption of CEL for native validation creates an unprecedented opportunity for policy engines like Kyverno to standardize on the same language. This convergence delivers three critical benefits:

**One expression language** to learn across Kubernetes and Kyverno means your team invests in skills that transfer between CRD validation rules, ValidatingAdmissionPolicies, and now Kyverno policies.

**Better performance** - CEL expressions are parsed once and compiled to bytecode, providing significant speed improvements over traditional validation methods.

**Reusable validation logic** between native Kubernetes and Kyverno policies eliminates the need to maintain separate validation implementations.

Kubernetes now uses CEL in multiple contexts:
- CRD validation rules (beta in 1.25, GA in 1.29)
- ValidatingAdmissionPolicies (beta in 1.28, GA in 1.30)
- Future features like ResourceQuota expressions and RBAC conditions

This means mastering CEL for Kyverno directly translates to expertise across the entire Kubernetes ecosystem.

## Your First ValidatingPolicy

Let's start with a practical example that demonstrates the power and simplicity of Kyverno's new ValidatingPolicy with CEL:

```yaml
apiVersion: policies.kyverno.io/v1alpha1
kind: ValidatingPolicy
metadata:
  name: require-pod-resources
spec:
  matchConstraints:
    resourceRules:
    - apiGroups:   [""]
      apiVersions: [v1]
      operations:  [CREATE, UPDATE]
      resources:   [pods]
  validations:
  - expression: |
      object.spec.containers.all(container,
        has(container.resources.limits) &&
        has(container.resources.limits.memory) &&
        has(container.resources.limits.cpu)
      )
    message: "All containers must have CPU and memory limits defined"
  - expression: |
      object.spec.containers.all(container,
        container.resources.limits.memory.matches('^[0-9]+(Mi|Gi)$') &&
        size(container.resources.limits.memory) <= size('8Gi')
      )
    message: "Memory limits must not exceed 8Gi"
```

This policy enforces two critical requirements:
1. All containers must have CPU and memory limits defined
2. Memory limits cannot exceed 8Gi

The CEL expressions use familiar functional programming patterns like `all()` to iterate over collections, making the logic both readable and powerful.

## Why This Matters: The Kubernetes CEL Native Story

Understanding how CEL fits into the broader Kubernetes ecosystem helps appreciate why this standardization matters. Consider how the same validation logic can now work across different contexts.

**CRD Validation Example:**
```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: applications.platform.io
spec:
  validation:
    openAPIV3Schema:
      properties:
        spec:
          properties:
            replicas:
              type: integer
              x-kubernetes-validations:
              - rule: "self <= 10"
                message: "replicas cannot exceed 10"
```

**Kyverno ValidatingPolicy Example:**
```yaml
apiVersion: policies.kyverno.io/v1alpha1
kind: ValidatingPolicy
metadata:
  name: replica-limit
spec:
  matchConstraints:
    resourceRules:
    - operations: ["CREATE", "UPDATE"]
      apiGroups: ["apps"]
      apiVersions: ["v1"]
      resources: ["deployments"]
  validations:
  - expression: "object.spec.replicas <= 10"
    message: "replicas cannot exceed 10"
```

Notice how the core CEL expression `object.spec.replicas <= 10` remains identical across all three contexts. This consistency dramatically reduces the learning curve and enables teams to reuse validation logic.

## Advanced Pattern: Cross-Resource Validation

CEL's power becomes evident when handling complex validation scenarios that require external data or cross-resource relationships:

```yaml
apiVersion: policies.kyverno.io/v1alpha1
kind: ValidatingPolicy
metadata:
  name: namespace-resource-quotas
spec:
  matchConstraints:
    resourceRules:
    - operations: ["CREATE", "UPDATE"]
      apiGroups: ["apps"]
      apiVersions: ["v1"]
      resources: ["deployments", "statefulsets"]
  variables:
  - name: configs
    expression: >
      resource.Get("v1", "configmaps", "platform", "team-configs")
  validations:
      - expression: |
          has(object.metadata.labels.team) &&
          object.metadata.labels.team in variables.configs.data &&
          object.spec.replicas <= int(variables.configs.data[object.metadata.labels.team])
        message: "Replica count exceeds team quota defined in platform/team-configs"
      - expression: |
          has(object.metadata.labels.environment) &&
          object.metadata.labels.environment in ['dev', 'staging', 'prod']
        message: "Must specify valid environment label: dev, staging, or prod"
```

This policy demonstrates advanced CEL patterns:
- **External parameter references** using `paramKind` and `paramRef`
- **Data validation** against external ConfigMap values
- **Multi-expression validation** with distinct error messages
- **Complex boolean logic** combining multiple conditions

The referenced ConfigMap might look like:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: team-configs
  namespace: platform
data:
  frontend: "5"
  backend: "10"
  data: "3"
```

## ImageValidatingPolicy in Action

Kyverno 1.14 also introduces ImageValidatingPolicy for specialized image security validation:

```yaml
# https://github.com/kyverno/policies/blob/main/other/verify-image-ivpol/verify-image-ivpol.yaml
apiVersion: policies.kyverno.io/v1alpha1
kind: ImageValidatingPolicy
metadata:
  name: verify-image-ivpol
  annotations:
    policies.kyverno.io/title: Verify Image
    policies.kyverno.io/category: Software Supply Chain Security, EKS Best Practices
    policies.kyverno.io/severity: medium
    policies.kyverno.io/subject: Pod
    policies.kyverno.io/minversion: 1.14.0
    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Using the Cosign project, OCI images may be signed to ensure supply chain
      security is maintained. Those signatures can be verified before pulling into
      a cluster. This policy checks the signature of an image repo called
      ghcr.io/kyverno/test-verify-image to ensure it has been signed by verifying
      its signature against the provided public key. This policy serves as an illustration for
      how to configure a similar rule and will require replacing with your image(s) and keys.
spec:
  webhookConfiguration:
    timeoutSeconds: 30
  evaluation:
   background:
    enabled: false
  validationActions: [Deny]
  matchConstraints:
    resourceRules:
      - apiGroups: [""]
        apiVersions: ["v1"]
        operations: ["CREATE", "UPDATE"]
        resources: ["pods"]
  matchImageReferences:
        - glob : "docker.io/mohdcode/kyverno*"
  attestors:
  - name: cosign
    cosign:
     key:
      data: |
                -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
                MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAE6QsNef3SKYhJVYSVj+ZfbPwJd0pv
                DLYNHXITZkhIzfE+apcxDjCCkDPcJ3A3zvhPATYOIsCxYPch7Q2JdJLsDQ==
                -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
  validations:
    - expression: >-
       images.containers.map(image, verifyImageSignatures(image, [attestors.cosign])).all(e ,e > 0)
      message: >-
       failed the verification
```

This policy combines signature verification with CEL-based attestation validation, ensuring:
- Images are signed with the specified public key
- Build provenance follows SLSA standards
- Dependencies meet stability requirements

## Migration Guide: From ClusterPolicy to ValidatingPolicy

Migrating existing ClusterPolicy resources to the new ValidatingPolicy type often simplifies your policy definitions. Here's a before/after comparison:

**Before (ClusterPolicy):**
```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: require-labels
spec:
  rules:
  - name: require-labels
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Deployment
    validate:
      failureAction: Enforce
      message: "Environment label must be dev, staging, or prod"
      anyPattern:
      - metadata:
          labels:
            environment: "dev" # Changed label key to 'environment' to match message
      - metadata:
          labels:
            environment: "staging"
      - metadata:
          labels:
            environment: "prod"
```

**After (ValidatingPolicy):**
```yaml
apiVersion: policies.kyverno.io/v1alpha1
kind: ValidatingPolicy
metadata:
  name: require-labels
spec:
  matchConstraints:
    resourceRules:
    - operations: ["CREATE", "UPDATE"]
      apiGroups: ["apps"]
      apiVersions: ["v1"]
      resources: ["deployments"]
  validations:
    - expression: "has(object.metadata.labels.team) && object.metadata.labels.team != ''"
      message: "Deployments must have a team label"
    - expression: "has(object.metadata.labels.environment) && object.metadata.labels.environment in ['dev', 'staging', 'prod']"
      message: "Environment label must be dev, staging, or prod"
```

**Migration Benefits:**
- **Reduced complexity**: Single rule instead of multiple rules
- **Better performance**: CEL compilation vs pattern matching
- **Clearer logic**: Explicit boolean expressions vs pattern inference
- **Enhanced readability**: Self-documenting validation conditions

## Performance Implications

CEL's compilation model provides significant performance advantages over traditional validation approaches. Kyverno maintainers report substantial improvements in policy evaluation speed, though specific benchmarks vary by workload:

**ClusterPolicy Pattern Matching:**
- Parse YAML patterns at runtime
- Recursive object traversal for each validation
- Variable performance depending on pattern complexity

**ValidatingPolicy CEL:**
- Compile expressions once at policy load
- Direct object field access via compiled bytecode
- Faster execution for complex validation logic

**Real-world Impact:**
- Measurably faster policy evaluation
- Reduced CPU usage during peak admission loads
- Better cluster responsiveness under policy-heavy workloads

For clusters with hundreds of policies and high pod creation rates, these performance improvements directly translate to reduced latency and improved user experience.
