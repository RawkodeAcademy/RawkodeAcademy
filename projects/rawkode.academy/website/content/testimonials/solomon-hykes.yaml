  Being a guest on Rawkode is always a fun experience. As a builder, watching someone use your product in real time is one of the most useful things you can do. If they're experienced enough to give you useful feedback as they do it, even better. Doing it all in front of a live audience... let's just say you'll be extra productive the day before üòÅ. Your community will appreciate the transparency and authenticity of an unscripted interaction.

  I encourage every builder to join Rawkode Academy if you have the chance. It will make you, and your product, better.
