  It was amazing working together with David. It's hard to present a deep tech product, but David is so knowledgeable about the web and everything so we were  having a great conversation and lots of fun. Additionally, I have to compliment David on how fluent he is in exploring a new project and doing live coding. It was great to see him explore WunderGraph for the first time, especially to see the excitement when we were combining APIs, first with GraphQL and then with TypeScript. I think this was an amazing presentation and I would recommend everyone to go on this show and present their work. David is amazing. I'm super thankful for this opportunity.
