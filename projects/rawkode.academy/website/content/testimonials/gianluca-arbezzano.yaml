  Rawkode Academy is my go to channel to stay up to date with projects I realy on on my day to day job. It is cool to know that there is a content creator that brings to gether industry leaders but also maintainers to give them a friendly place where they can share what they are up to.
  I also worked with David for many years but unfortunaty I still need to win a single  pool match against him!
