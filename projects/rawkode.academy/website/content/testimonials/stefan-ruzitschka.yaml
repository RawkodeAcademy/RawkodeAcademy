  Watching David's videos helped me learning about several useful tools in the cloud native landscape.
  I think that Rawkode Academy is a great and inclusive place where the only thing that matters is the will to learn.
  I'm also happy to help the Rawkode Academy become an even more awesome place for learning, thanks for having me!
