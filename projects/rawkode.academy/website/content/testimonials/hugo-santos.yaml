  I felt super welcomed by David in his show. I got enough guidance ahead of time, and appreciated the way that the show went as a back and forth between him and myself. David is an expert and it shows. But he approaches the questions in a thoughtful manner that help bridge the gap between the presenter and the audience.

  I'd be happy to be back at the show, and would encourage others to join as well.
