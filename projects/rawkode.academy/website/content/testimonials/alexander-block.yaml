  Being a guest on David's Rawkode Academy channel was a very great experience. This was my first time being a guest in such a format and David made sure that it turned out being a great session. My project was very well represented, especially due to David actively following and being able to ask the interesting and challenging questions. If you have an interesting project to show and feel that people would benefit, don't hesitate to get in contact with David.
