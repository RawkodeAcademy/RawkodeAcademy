  Rawkode Academy has done an amazing job helping developers be introduced to the world of server-side WebAssembly, promoting Spin project and Fermyon Cloud. We've heard from many developers, that the Advent of Spin challenges, created by Rawkode, was the perfect opportunity to get hands-on, and we've seen notable results in developers joining our community and using our services.
