  Rawkode Academy is the perfect place for mid to senior level engineers looking for content in the Cloud Native space. The videos act as a perfect guide for anyone looking to go beyond basics and becoming an expert in the field. The Klustered series is a must watch for anyone involved in operating Kubernetes clusters. The channel often has other industry experts joining and sharing their knowledge as well apart from Rawkode. I would definitely recommend and have recommended the channel in the past for anyone looking to skill up in the Cloud Native ecosystem.
