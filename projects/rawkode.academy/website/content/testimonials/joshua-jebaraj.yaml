  Rawkode Academy is one of the best youtube channel out there, the amount of stuff I learned from the klustered is insane. Being not a big fan of traditional method of learning stuffs, Klustered helps me to learn a lot of stuffs by breaking and fixing stuffs. If someone wants to learn and level up the kubernetes skills beyond the basics, I would highly recommend to checking out Rawkode Academy.
