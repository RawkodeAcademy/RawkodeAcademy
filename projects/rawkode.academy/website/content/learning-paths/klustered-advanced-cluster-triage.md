# Klustered: Advanced Cluster Triage

Go beyond kubectl and develop a battle-tested methodology for diagnosing multi-layer outages. Each scenario highlights a different failure domain—nodes, networking, security, and host-level manipulation—so you can bring clusters back from the dead.

## Learning Objectives

- Adopt a repeatable triage framework: validate symptoms, isolate the failing layer, and confirm the fix.
- Combine Kubernetes logs with host forensics (`journalctl`, `systemctl`, `ps`, `lsof`) when the API server is lying—or gone.
- Repair control-plane failures by dissecting static pod manifests, TLS assets, and etcd health.
- Detect malicious persistence (cron/systemd jobs, `ld.so.preload`, kubeconfig auth plugins) that reintroduce problems after a reboot.
- Harden clusters after recovery by applying network controls, auditing admission webhooks, and documenting runbooks.

## Videos in This Path

### 1. [Marino Wijay & John Anderson](/watch/marino-wijay-and-john-anderson)

**Why it matters:** Kubelet crashes and CNI misfires are the bread-and-butter incidents that escalate quickly. This episode establishes a systematic triage cadence.

**What you'll learn:**
- Diagnose `NodeNotReady` states by correlating kubelet logs, CNI status, and certificate errors.
- Inspect static pod manifests and component arguments under `/etc/kubernetes/manifests`.
- Track down webhook failures and broken admission controllers that silently reject workloads.

**Key takeaways:**
- Trust but verify your cluster context and credentials before making changes.
- Pod lifecycle issues often stem from lower layers—container runtime, CNI, or certificates—not the workload itself.

**Hands-on drill:** Reproduce a `NodeNotReady` incident by breaking the CNI config in a test cluster, then repair it using the workflow demonstrated.

### 2. [Hans Kristian Flaatten & Zach Wachtel](/watch/hans-kristian-flaatten-and-zach-wachtel)

**Why it matters:** Slow control planes are harder than outright failures. This session shows how to hunt down etcd pain, I/O throttling, and sneaky persistence.

**What you'll learn:**
- Profile control-plane latency and leader-election behaviour when etcd is under duress.
- Use low-level tools (`crictl`, `journalctl`, `iostat`) when `kubectl` no longer returns data.
- Discover malicious cron/systemd jobs reintroducing broken configs after each reboot.

**Key takeaways:**
- etcd health directly governs API responsiveness; treat disk I/O and quotas as first-class SLOs.
- Persistent host tasks can undo your fixes—eradicate them or they’ll respawn the outage.

**Hands-on drill:** Simulate etcd I/O starvation (e.g., `tc` or cgroup limits) and practice restoring health plus cleaning persistence hooks.

### 3. [Alex Jones & Alistair Hey](/watch/alex-jones-and-alistair-hey)

**Why it matters:** Networking mysteries rarely announce themselves. This duel demonstrates how to peel back NodePorts, policies, and host firewalls.

**What you'll learn:**
- Trace traffic with `kubectl exec`, `iptables -t nat`, and `tc` to find where packets die.
- Validate kube-controller-manager and kubelet configs when scheduling subtly fails.
- Guard yourself against sabotaged tooling (rogue aliases, modified kubeconfigs) that hinder troubleshooting.

**Key takeaways:**
- Multi-layer debugging beats guesswork—test from pod → node → service to pinpoint the break.
- Always confirm your tools haven’t been tampered with; even `kubectl` can be weaponized.

**Hands-on drill:** Inject latency with `tc qdisc`, observe service behaviour, then revert settings and record a runbook entry.

### 4. [The Community vs. Rawkode](/watch/the-community-vs-rawkode)

**Why it matters:** Security incidents often masquerade as outages. This group effort dissects a malicious kubeconfig helper and recovers the control plane.

**What you'll learn:**
- Audit kubeconfig exec plugins to detect hostile authentication helpers.
- Use classic Linux tooling (`ps`, `at`, `env`) to uncover suspicious activity on nodes.
- Restore control-plane availability by editing static manifests and restarting kubelet safely.

**Key takeaways:**
- kubeconfig files are executable attack surfaces—treat them like code.
- Static pod manifests provide single points of failure; secure and monitor them rigorously.

**Hands-on drill:** Craft a harmless kubeconfig exec helper, document how it executes, then disable it using RBAC and config policies.

### 5. [Klustered #11](/watch/klustered-11)

**Why it matters:** The finale showcases deep Linux forensics—hidden processes, etcd DoS, and host firewalls—under extreme pressure.

**What you'll learn:**
- Detect tampering techniques (`ld.so.preload`, rogue `systemd` units) that hide processes and binaries.
- Recover from etcd quota exhaustion and network lockouts using snapshots, compaction, and targeted iptables rules.
- Combine filesystem, network, and process evidence into a cohesive incident timeline.

**Key takeaways:**
- Complex outages demand patience, logs, and note-taking before touching anything.
- Hardened control planes require both Kubernetes and OS-level defenses (firewalls, file integrity, RBAC).

**Hands-on drill:** Build a lab where etcd hits its quota, practice compaction/defrag, then add iptables rules to lock down peer traffic.

## After-Action Suggestions

1. Turn your notes into a written incident response playbook (symptom → hypothesis → command sequence).
2. Automate recurring diagnostics with `kubectl debug` profiles or Systemd/Ansible scripts.
3. Feed lessons learned into platform guardrails: enforce admission webhook health, lock down kubeconfig exec plugins, and monitor etcd quotas continuously.
