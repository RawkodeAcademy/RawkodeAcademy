# Build Your First Kubernetes Developer Platform

Move from UI-driven Kubernetes operations to opinionated platform APIs, golden-path deployments, and automated incident response. Each stop introduces a production-ready building block you can stitch together into a developer platform.

## Learning Objectives

- Apply guardrails and RBAC to simplify day-one cluster onboarding for teams.
- Model applications with reusable templates that compile to standard Kubernetes manifests.
- Expose cloud infrastructure as platform APIs through Crossplane compositions.
- Deliver a consistent build → deploy → release workflow with HashiCorp Waypoint.
- Enrich Prometheus alerts so platform engineers and developers can close the loop on incidents quickly.

## Videos in This Path

### 1. [Hands-on Introduction to Portainer](/watch/hands-on-introduction-to-portainer)

**Why it matters:** Portainer gives you a "manager of managers" interface so teams can safely explore Kubernetes before you expose lower-level tools.

**What you'll learn:**
- Understand the core value proposition of Portainer for simplifying container management.
- Describe how Portainer provides a unified interface for managing diverse environments like Kubernetes, Docker, and Nomad.
- Apply policies, RBAC, and guardrails that keep self-service access secure.
- Deploy a containerized application from the Portainer UI to demonstrate a fast path to value.

**Key takeaways:**
- Portainer has grown into a universal management plane for multi-cluster and edge environments.
- Built-in guardrails, policy enforcement, and centralized RBAC prevent common misconfigurations while keeping workflows approachable.

### 2. [Hands-on Introduction to DevStand](/watch/hands-on-introduction-to-devstand)

**Why it matters:** DevStand turns platform patterns into Jsonnet templates and a drag-and-drop VS Code experience, closing the gap between application design and Kubernetes delivery.

**What you'll learn:**
- Recognize the Kubernetes pain points DevStand abstracts for application developers.
- Use Jsonnet-powered templates to replace verbose Kubernetes YAML.
- Assemble a microservice architecture visually inside VS Code and generate manifests.
- Export a single DevStand configuration that compiles to version-controlled Kubernetes resources.

**Key takeaways:**
- DevStand delivers a PaaS-like experience on any Kubernetes cluster through reusable building blocks. 
- The Jsonnet source of truth keeps complex app definitions portable and reviewable while the visual canvas accelerates developer onboarding.

### 3. [Introduction to Crossplane](/watch/introduction-to-crossplane)

**Why it matters:** Before you hand developers infrastructure APIs, you need a universal control plane that speaks Kubernetes and cloud. Crossplane provides the foundation.

**What you'll learn:**
- Explain how Crossplane extends the Kubernetes API to manage external infrastructure.
- Compare Crossplane’s continuous reconciliation model with on-demand IaC tools like Terraform.
- Install Crossplane, add a cloud provider, and explore Composite Resource Definitions (XRDs).
- Design simplified platform APIs that hide cloud complexity behind custom resources.

**Key takeaways:**
- Crossplane turns Kubernetes into a universal control plane so you can manage cloud resources with the same GitOps workflows as workloads.
- Continuous reconciliation and compositions keep infrastructure drift-free while enforcing platform policy.

### 4. [Crossplane in Action](/watch/crossplane-in-action)

**Why it matters:** This follow-up demonstrates how to package your abstractions into real platform building blocks that developers can consume safely.

**What you'll learn:**
- Provision cloud infrastructure using standard Kubernetes manifests and Crossplane Compositions.
- Apply opinionated platform APIs that bundle best practices into a single custom resource.
- Observe Crossplane’s reconciliation loop correcting drift and maintaining desired state.
- Map RBAC and credential boundaries so teams can request infrastructure without direct cloud access.

**Key takeaways:**
- Crossplane compositions let platform teams encode golden paths that stay aligned with policy and security requirements.
- Treating infrastructure as Kubernetes objects unlocks native integrations with GitOps, policy engines, and observability stacks.

### 5. [Hands-on Introduction to Waypoint](/watch/hands-on-introduction-to-waypoint)

**Why it matters:** Waypoint standardizes the build → deploy → release cycle, whether teams target Lambda, Kubernetes, or another runtime—perfect for platform engineers who need a portable workflow.

**What you'll learn:**
- Install the Waypoint server locally and on Kubernetes to back your platform workflows.
- Define applications in `waypoint.hcl` and plug into existing YAML or Cloud Native Buildpacks.
- Run automated deployments to Kubernetes and AWS Lambda from the same configuration.
- Separate deployment from release to enable progressive delivery strategies.

**Key takeaways:**
- `waypoint up` creates a consistent developer experience across multiple execution environments.
- Plugins and the distinct release phase give platform teams fine-grained control without rewriting pipelines per environment.

### 6. [Monitoring Kubernetes with Prometheus & Robusta](/watch/monitoring-kubernetes-with-prometheus-and-robusta)

**Why it matters:** A platform is only as good as its day-two operations. Robusta enriches Prometheus alerts so frontline engineers get context, not just noise.

**What you'll learn:**
- Install Robusta alongside Prometheus using Helm and connect it to Alertmanager.
- Enrich alerts with logs, graphs, and timelines that accelerate troubleshooting.
- Customize Robusta enrichers to collect runbook data for recurring production issues.
- Navigate the Robusta SaaS UI for multi-cluster visibility and faster MTTR.

**Key takeaways:**
- Standard Prometheus alerts lack context; Robusta automates evidence gathering to reduce alert fatigue.
- Runbook automation keeps developers productive and closes the loop between platform engineers and the teams they support.

## Where to Go Next

- Combine DevStand blueprints and Crossplane compositions into a single GitOps repository so application and infrastructure definitions travel together.
- Add Robusta KRR to surface resource efficiency recommendations alongside alert enrichment.
- Pilot Waypoint pipelines with a small product team, then roll them out across environments once the workflow meets internal guardrails.
