  eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is a revolutionary technology that allows users to run sandboxed programs in the Linux kernel without changing kernel source code or loading kernel modules. This enables powerful and efficient observation, monitoring, and control of system behavior at runtime. eBPF provides unprecedented visibility into the kernel and user space, enabling developers to trace system calls, monitor network traffic, profile application performance, and enforce security policies, all with minimal overhead.

  Its primary value lies in its ability to provide deep insights into system behavior without requiring kernel modifications, leading to faster development cycles and improved security. Main use cases include network performance monitoring, security observability (detecting malicious activity), application performance profiling, and load balancing in cloud native environments.
