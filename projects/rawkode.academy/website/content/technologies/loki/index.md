description: |-
  Loki is a horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus. Unlike traditional log aggregators, Loki indexes only metadata (labels) about the log content, not the log messages themselves. This makes Loki very cost-effective and efficient, especially for environments with high log volume. Loki is designed to work well with existing infrastructure like Prometheus and Grafana, allowing users to leverage familiar tools for querying and visualizing logs.

  Its primary value proposition is providing a centralized and scalable logging solution without the high indexing costs associated with traditional log management systems. Main use cases include troubleshooting application issues, monitoring system performance, and auditing security events within cloud-native environments, especially those orchestrated by Kubernetes.
