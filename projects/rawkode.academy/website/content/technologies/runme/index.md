description: Runme is a tool that enables you to execute code snippets directly from README files and other markdown documents. It treats markdown documents as executable scripts, allowing you to define and run code blocks interactively. This streamlines development workflows by making documentation more dynamic and useful, fostering a 'docs-as-code' approach. It improves collaboration, simplifies onboarding, and provides a consistent environment for developers to run and test instructions documented in markdown.
