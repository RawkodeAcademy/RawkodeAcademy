description: SchemaHero is a Kubernetes operator for managing database schema migrations. It allows developers to declaratively define the desired state of their database schemas in YAML files and automatically apply the necessary changes. This simplifies database schema management, promotes infrastructure-as-code practices, and helps ensure consistency across different environments. SchemaHero supports various databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB, and integrates seamlessly with existing CI/CD pipelines, enabling automated schema migrations as part of the software delivery process.
