description: |-
  Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management. It provides a platform to manage containerized workloads and services, declaring desired states and automating the processes to achieve and maintain them. Kubernetes simplifies complex deployments by abstracting away the underlying infrastructure and offering features like self-healing, rolling updates, and resource management.

  The primary value proposition of Kubernetes lies in its ability to increase application availability, reduce operational overhead, and improve resource utilization. It is widely used for deploying microservices, running batch processing jobs, and managing stateful applications, making it a cornerstone of modern cloud-native application development and deployment practices.
