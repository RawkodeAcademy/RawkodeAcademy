  Salt is an open-source configuration management and remote execution engine. It automates tasks like software installation, configuration management, and system administration across distributed systems. Salt provides a flexible infrastructure-as-code approach, enabling users to define desired states and enforce them consistently across their environments. It brings value through efficient orchestration, increased automation, and improved consistency, reducing manual intervention and minimizing errors.

  Salt is used for a wide range of use cases, including provisioning and configuring servers, deploying applications, managing cloud infrastructure, automating security compliance, and orchestrating complex workflows. Its scalability and modular architecture make it suitable for both small and large environments, from individual servers to massive data centers and cloud deployments.
