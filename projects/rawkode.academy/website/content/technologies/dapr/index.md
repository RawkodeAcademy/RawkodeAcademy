  Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime) is a portable, event-driven runtime that makes it easy for developers to build resilient, microservice stateless and stateful applications that run on the cloud and edge. Dapr codifies the best practices for building microservice applications into open, reusable building blocks that can be used regardless of the programming language, framework, or platform being used.

  Dapr offers a consistent and simplified developer experience. It provides building blocks like service invocation, state management, pub/sub, bindings, actors, and observability, enabling developers to focus on business logic rather than infrastructure concerns. Use cases include building microservices architectures, event-driven applications, IoT applications, and distributed systems where resilience, scalability, and portability are crucial.
