description: Namespace is a development-focused compute platform that just works. Namespace builds on Ephemeral Instances, our container-optimized cloud infrastructure that offers you most of the support you need, including persistent logs and metrics, lifecycle management, and root SSH access. And they’re fast. Creating an instance takes just a few second, making them great for testing and development. Namespace is cost-effective because it carefully orchestrates the underlying infrastructure for high utilization and automatically ensures that you only pay what you use - no need to manually manage the lifecycle. With Ephemeral Instances, you can run Kubernetes-based, Docker-based and containerd-based workflows. And intermix them. We provide the same features to all containers, regardless of their orchestration. Most importantly, Namespace works with your existing configurations and tools.
