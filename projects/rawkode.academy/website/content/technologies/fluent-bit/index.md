  Fluent Bit is a fast, lightweight, and highly scalable Log Processor and Forwarder. It allows you to collect logs and data from various sources, enrich them with filters, and forward them to multiple destinations. It is designed for high performance with a small memory footprint and minimal CPU usage, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments like embedded systems, containers, and Kubernetes clusters. Fluent Bit simplifies log management by providing a unified logging layer across your infrastructure. 

  Fluent Bit's primary value lies in its ability to centralize and streamline log aggregation and routing. It enables real-time data processing and analysis, allowing you to gain insights into application performance, security events, and system behavior. Common use cases include: collecting logs from Kubernetes clusters and forwarding them to Elasticsearch, aggregating system logs and metrics from edge devices, and routing application logs to cloud storage or monitoring platforms.
