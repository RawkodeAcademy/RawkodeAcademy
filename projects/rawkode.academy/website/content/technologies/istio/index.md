  Istio is an open-source service mesh that provides a way to control and secure traffic between microservices. It adds a layer of infrastructure on top of a Kubernetes cluster (or other deployment environments) without requiring changes to application code. Istio manages service discovery, traffic routing, load balancing, service-to-service authentication, authorization, and observability. 

  The primary value of Istio lies in its ability to improve the reliability, security, and observability of microservice architectures. Common use cases include A/B testing, canary deployments, fault injection, rate limiting, mutual TLS authentication, and detailed monitoring and tracing of service interactions.
