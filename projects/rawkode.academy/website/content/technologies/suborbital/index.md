  Suborbital is a platform for building and deploying web applications using WebAssembly (Wasm). It allows developers to build secure and performant serverless functions in any language that compiles to Wasm, enabling greater flexibility and speed. Suborbital provides a standardized execution environment for these functions, facilitating rapid development and deployment, while managing versioning, secrets, and other operational concerns.

  Suborbital's core value lies in its ability to drastically improve application performance and reduce infrastructure costs. By leveraging Wasm's lightweight nature and inherent security, applications can be deployed closer to the user, reducing latency. Common use cases include building serverless APIs, event-driven applications, and edge computing solutions.
