description: TimescaleDB is an open-source time-series database built on PostgreSQL. It's engineered to efficiently store and analyze time-series data, providing the full power of SQL with scalability and performance optimizations specific to time-series workloads. It essentially extends PostgreSQL to handle the demands of large-scale time-series applications. TimescaleDB is particularly well-suited for IoT, DevOps monitoring, financial markets, and industrial data applications. It provides significant benefits over traditional relational databases for time-series by offering native compression, continuous aggregates for real-time analysis, and optimized query performance.
