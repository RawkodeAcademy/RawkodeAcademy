  Falco is a cloud-native runtime security project. It's a behavioral activity monitor designed to detect anomalous activity and security threats within Kubernetes, containers, and the underlying host. Falco leverages system calls from the Linux kernel as its primary data source, allowing it to identify unexpected application behavior, policy violations, intrusions, and data exfiltration attempts in real-time. It provides valuable insights into application security and system integrity.

  Falco's value lies in its ability to provide deep visibility into runtime behavior without requiring code instrumentation. Its main use cases include detecting security breaches, identifying misconfigurations, monitoring compliance with security policies, auditing system activity, and troubleshooting application performance issues. It's highly configurable through a rules engine that can be tailored to specific environments and security needs.
