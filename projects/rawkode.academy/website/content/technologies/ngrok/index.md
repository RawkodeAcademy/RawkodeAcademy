description: ngrok is a multi-platform tunneling, reverse proxy, firewall, and network traffic analysis tool. It creates secure tunnels from a public endpoint (ngrok.io domain) to a locally running service on your machine, making it accessible over the internet. This is valuable for exposing local development servers, testing webhooks, building integrations with third-party services, and providing remote access to applications without complex firewall configurations or exposing your network directly.
