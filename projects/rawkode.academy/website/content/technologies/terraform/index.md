  Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) software tool created by HashiCorp. It allows users to define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. Terraform manages infrastructure as code, enabling repeatable infrastructure deployment across various cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP), on-premises environments, and even software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms.

  Terraform's value lies in its ability to automate infrastructure management, reduce errors, and improve consistency. It provides a single workflow for managing diverse resources, promoting collaboration among development and operations teams. Common use cases include provisioning virtual machines, setting up networking configurations, deploying databases, and managing application deployments, all described and managed through configuration files.
