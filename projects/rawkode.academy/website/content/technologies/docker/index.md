  Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in isolated environments called containers. It packages up an application and all its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development. Docker allows developers to build applications, package them into containers, and then deploy those containers on any platform that supports Docker. This ensures consistency across different environments, from development to testing to production. The primary value of Docker is improved portability, efficiency, and security of applications.

  Key use cases for Docker include simplifying application deployment, enabling microservices architectures, improving resource utilization, and fostering collaboration across development and operations teams. It helps eliminate "works on my machine" issues and makes it easier to scale and manage applications in various environments.
