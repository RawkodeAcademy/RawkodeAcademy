  Waypoint, by HashiCorp, is a developer-centric platform designed to simplify the build, deploy, and release process for modern applications. It provides a consistent workflow across diverse deployment environments, including Kubernetes, Amazon ECS, Google Cloud Run, and serverless platforms. Waypoint abstracts away the complexities of underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on writing code and delivering value. 

  It streamlines the deployment pipeline by offering a single, unified interface for building, deploying, and releasing applications. This reduces the operational overhead associated with managing different deployment strategies and environments. Waypoint aims to improve developer velocity and collaboration by providing a consistent and repeatable deployment experience, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.
