  Kluctl is a declarative Kubernetes deployment tool that extends Helm and Kustomize by providing a comprehensive framework for managing complex multi-environment and multi-cluster deployments. It focuses on GitOps workflows and allows you to define your entire infrastructure as code. Kluctl provides features like image tagging, parameterization, dependencies between deployments, and drift detection, simplifying the process of consistently deploying and managing applications across various environments. 

  Kluctl's value lies in its ability to streamline Kubernetes deployments, promote consistency, and reduce manual errors. Its main use cases include managing deployments across development, staging, and production environments; orchestrating complex application deployments involving multiple Kubernetes clusters; and enabling GitOps-driven infrastructure management.
