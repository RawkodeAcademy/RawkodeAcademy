description: aquaproj (aqua) is a declarative CLI version manager. It enables you to manage CLI tools and their versions in a consistent and reproducible way across different environments. Instead of manually installing and updating CLI tools, you define the tools and versions you need in a configuration file, and aqua automatically installs and manages them. This ensures that everyone on your team uses the same versions of tools, preventing compatibility issues and streamlining development workflows. It supports various package managers and methods of installation.
