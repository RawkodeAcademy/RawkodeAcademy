  Keptn is a cloud-native, event-driven orchestration platform designed to automate the software delivery lifecycle. It provides a unified control plane for continuous delivery and automated operations, allowing teams to define and enforce SLOs (Service Level Objectives) and automate remediation actions when those SLOs are breached. Keptn leverages a declarative approach and GitOps principles to manage deployments, testing, and operations across diverse environments.

  Keptn helps organizations improve software quality, accelerate release cycles, and reduce operational costs by automating tasks such as performance testing, canary deployments, and rollback procedures. It enables data-driven decision-making by providing insights into application performance and health, making it a valuable tool for implementing continuous delivery and continuous operations strategies.
