  Okteto is a platform that enables developers to build and test cloud-native applications directly in Kubernetes environments. It provides a fast and iterative development loop by allowing developers to work with their local development tools and IDEs, while seamlessly integrating with remote Kubernetes clusters. This eliminates the need for constant rebuilding and redeploying of code, significantly accelerating the development process.

  Okteto's value lies in its ability to streamline the developer experience for cloud-native applications. By providing a familiar and efficient local development environment connected directly to Kubernetes, it reduces the friction and complexity associated with developing and testing in a cloud-native context. Main use cases include developing microservices, testing applications in production-like environments, and collaborating on cloud-native projects.
