description: Linkerd is a service mesh designed for Kubernetes, providing observability, security, and reliability to microservices applications. It acts as a transparent layer over existing applications, without requiring code changes in many cases. Linkerd provides request routing, load balancing, service discovery, automatic retries, and circuit breaking capabilities, all while offering deep insights into application performance through metrics, tracing, and dashboards. It simplifies the complexities of managing distributed systems, allowing developers to focus on business logic instead of infrastructure concerns. Main use cases include improving application resilience, enhancing security with mutual TLS, gaining visibility into service-to-service communication, and simplifying the implementation of complex deployment patterns like canary releases and A/B testing.
