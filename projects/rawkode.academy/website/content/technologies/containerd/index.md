  containerd is a container runtime that is a CNCF graduated project. It provides an industry-standard core container runtime that can be embedded into larger systems. containerd manages the complete container lifecycle of its host system, from image transfer and storage to container execution and supervision. It provides a minimal set of primitives needed to manage containers effectively. 

  It offers a reliable and efficient foundation for building container platforms and orchestration systems like Kubernetes. containerd's design prioritizes stability, simplicity, and portability, allowing developers to focus on higher-level features without worrying about the underlying container execution details. Its main use cases include serving as the container runtime for Kubernetes, Docker, and other container management platforms; enabling efficient and reliable container execution in production environments; and providing a foundation for building custom container solutions.
