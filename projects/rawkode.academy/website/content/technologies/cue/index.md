  CUE (Configure, Unify, Execute) is a constraint-based, gradual typing configuration language. It allows users to define configurations that are both human-readable and machine-verifiable. CUE unifies data definition, configuration, validation, and data templating into a single language, providing a powerful tool for managing complexity in modern software systems.

  The value of CUE lies in its ability to simplify configuration management, reduce errors, and improve the reliability of deployments. Its use cases include defining Kubernetes configurations, generating API schemas, managing infrastructure as code, data validation, and simplifying CI/CD pipelines. It promotes consistency and avoids configuration drift by enforcing constraints.
