description: Slim Toolkit is a toolkit focused on minimizing and securing container images. It analyzes container images and removes unnecessary files, binaries, and dependencies, resulting in smaller, more secure, and faster-to-deploy containers. This process reduces the attack surface, improves resource utilization, and speeds up build and deployment pipelines. It's commonly used by DevOps teams and developers to optimize container images for production environments, ensuring they are as lean and secure as possible.
