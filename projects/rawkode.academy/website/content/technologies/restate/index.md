description: Restate is a distributed application framework for building reliable and scalable serverless applications. It simplifies state management, coordination, and fault tolerance in distributed systems by providing a durable execution model. Restate's key value lies in enabling developers to write simple, sequential code that automatically recovers from failures and scales horizontally without requiring complex infrastructure or intricate error handling logic. It's particularly well-suited for building applications that require complex workflows, long-running processes, and guaranteed consistency, such as e-commerce order processing, financial transactions, and IoT data pipelines.
