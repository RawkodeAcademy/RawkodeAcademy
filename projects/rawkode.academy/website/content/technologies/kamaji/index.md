  Kamaji is an open-source Kubernetes control plane manager that drastically simplifies the management of multiple Kubernetes clusters. It allows you to create lightweight Kubernetes clusters, called Tenant Clusters, on top of a management cluster, without the overhead of managing full-blown Kubernetes distributions. Kamaji leverages the Kubernetes API itself to manage these Tenant Clusters, providing a native and familiar experience.

  Its value lies in reducing the cost and complexity associated with running numerous Kubernetes clusters, particularly in scenarios like multi-tenancy, development environments, and edge computing. It optimizes resource utilization, centralizes management, and simplifies the operational burden of maintaining multiple control planes.
