  cdk8s (Cloud Development Kit for Kubernetes) is an open-source software development framework for defining Kubernetes applications and reusable abstractions using familiar programming languages like TypeScript, Python, Java, and Go. It allows developers to define infrastructure as code, offering a strongly-typed and programmatic approach to Kubernetes configuration, which is an alternative to YAML. cdk8s simplifies the creation, validation, and deployment of Kubernetes manifests.

  cdk8s provides value by enabling developers to leverage their existing programming skills and toolsets to manage Kubernetes resources. It promotes code reuse, simplifies complex configurations, and provides compile-time validation, reducing the risk of runtime errors. Main use cases include creating complex Kubernetes deployments, generating reusable Kubernetes components, and integrating Kubernetes configurations into existing software development workflows.
