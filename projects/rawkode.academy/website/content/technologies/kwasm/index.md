description: KWasm is a technology that enables running WebAssembly (Wasm) workloads directly within Kubernetes without requiring a full container runtime like Docker or containerd. It offers a lightweight and efficient alternative for executing microservices and functions by leveraging the portability and security benefits of WebAssembly. KWasm significantly reduces resource consumption and improves startup times compared to traditional containerized applications, making it well-suited for edge computing, serverless functions, and scenarios where density and speed are critical. It allows developers to deploy Wasm modules as first-class citizens within their Kubernetes clusters, integrating seamlessly with existing tooling and infrastructure.
