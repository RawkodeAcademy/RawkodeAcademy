description: Crossplane is an open-source Kubernetes add-on that extends your Kubernetes cluster to become a universal control plane. It allows you to manage and provision infrastructure from various cloud providers, on-premise environments, and SaaS offerings using Kubernetes APIs and tooling. By defining custom resource definitions (CRDs), you can create reusable abstractions for infrastructure services, enabling application teams to self-service provision resources without needing to understand the underlying provider details.
