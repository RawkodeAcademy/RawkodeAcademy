description: Pixie is an open-source observability platform for Kubernetes applications. It uses eBPF to automatically capture telemetry data (metrics, traces, logs, profiles) without requiring manual instrumentation. Pixie provides instant visibility into application behavior, allowing developers to quickly identify performance bottlenecks, troubleshoot errors, and understand system-wide interactions in real-time. It's particularly valuable for debugging and optimizing complex microservices architectures running on Kubernetes by offering out-of-the-box dashboards and a powerful query language (PxL) for exploring data.
