# RKA CLI Implementation Summary

## Overview
The RKA (Rawkode Academy) CLI is a Rust-based command-line tool that manages local playground environments for educational courses. It provides a seamless way to provision and manage virtual machines with pre-configured learning environments.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **CLI Interface** (`src/main.rs`, `src/cli/`)
   - Built with `clap` for robust command parsing
   - Subcommands: start, stop, status, destroy, list, logs, exec, port-forward, doctor, completion
   - Global verbose flag and configurable API endpoint

2. **GraphQL API Client** (`src/api/`)
   - Communicates with the Rawkode Academy API
   - Fetches cloud-init configurations and course listings
   - Handles rate limiting and error responses
   - Async operations using `tokio` and `reqwest`

3. **VM Provider Abstraction** (`src/vm/`)
   - Trait-based abstraction supporting multiple providers
   - Lima provider: Full VM isolation (recommended for macOS)
   - Docker provider: Lightweight alternative
   - Auto-detection of available providers

4. **State Management** (`src/state/`)
   - Persistent state storage using JSON
   - Tracks running playgrounds and resource allocation
   - Platform-specific directory handling via `directories` crate

5. **Utilities** (`src/utils/`)
   - System resource detection (CPU, memory)
   - Cross-platform compatibility helpers

## Key Features

- **Cloud-init Integration**: VMs are configured automatically using cloud-init templates from the API
- **Resource Management**: Automatic checking and allocation of CPU, memory, and disk resources
- **Port Forwarding**: Automatic setup for accessing services (Teleport, HTTP, HTTPS, K8s API)
- **Progress Indicators**: User-friendly spinners and colored output
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages with actionable suggestions
- **Shell Completions**: Auto-generated completions for bash, zsh, fish

## Testing

- Unit tests for state serialization
- Integration tests for CLI commands
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Cross-platform testing matrix

## Installation

- Quick install script at `https://get.rawkode.academy`
- Platform-specific binary distribution
- Automatic shell completion setup

## Security Considerations

- No hardcoded credentials
- API endpoint configurable via environment variable
- Local-only VM management
- Rate limiting on API calls

## Future Enhancements

- Streaming logs support
- Interactive shell improvements
- Additional VM providers (Podman, Vagrant)
- Offline mode with cached configurations
- Progress resumption for interrupted provisions
