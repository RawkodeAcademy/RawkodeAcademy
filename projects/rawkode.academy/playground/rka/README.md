## Requirements

- **CPU**: Minimum 2 cores (4+ recommended)
- **Memory**: Minimum 4GB RAM (8GB+ recommended)
- **Disk**: 20GB+ free space
- **OS**: Linux, macOS, or Windows
- **VM Provider**: Lima or Docker

## VM Providers

RKA supports multiple VM providers:

- **Lima** (Recommended for macOS): Provides full VM isolation
- **Docker**: Lighter weight but with some limitations

The CLI will automatically detect and use the best available provider.

## Development

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rawkode-academy/rka
cd rka

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Install locally
cargo install --path .
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
cargo test

# Integration tests
cargo test --test '*'

# With coverage
cargo tarpaulin
```

## Configuration

RKA can be configured via environment variables:

- `RKA_API_ENDPOINT`: Override the default API endpoint
- `RKA_INSTALL_DIR`: Custom installation directory

## Troubleshooting

### "No VM provider found"

Install either Lima or Docker:

```bash
# macOS
brew install lima

# Linux/macOS/Windows
# Install Docker from https://docker.com
```

### "Rate limit exceeded"

RKA limits playground creation to 5 per hour. Wait and try again later.

### Port conflicts

If ports 3080, 8080, 8443, or 6443 are in use, stop the conflicting services or use `rka destroy` to clean up existing playgrounds.
