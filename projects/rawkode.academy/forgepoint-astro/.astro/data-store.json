from CUE to Astro-based Product Management Platform","accepted","The existing ForgePoint system uses CUE for data modeling but lacks a user-friendly interface for product management tasks","Migrate to Astro with content collections and MDX for a web-based product management platform","Improved accessibility and usability while maintaining structured data benefits",["Date","2025-01-18T00:00:00.000Z"],"# ADR-001: Migration from CUE to Astro-based Product Management Platform\n\n## Status\n**Accepted** - 2025-01-18\n\n## Context\n\nThe current ForgePoint system uses CUE (Configure Unify Execute) for data modeling and validation of product management artifacts including:\n- User personas\n- User activities and journey mapping\n- User stories and features\n- Product requirements documents (PRDs)\n- Architecture decision records (ADRs)\n\nWhile CUE provides excellent data validation and type safety, the current implementation has several limitations:\n\n### Current Challenges\n1. **Accessibility**: Requires technical expertise to read and write CUE files\n2. **Visualization**: No built-in way to visualize user story maps or relationships\n3. **Collaboration**: Non-technical stakeholders cannot easily contribute or review content\n4. **Workflow Integration**: Difficult to integrate with standard product management workflows\n5. **Tooling**: Limited ecosystem compared to web-based alternatives\n\n### Requirements for New System\n- Maintain structured data and validation benefits\n- Provide accessible web interface for all stakeholders\n- Support rich content authoring with MDX\n- Enable visualization of user story maps and relationships\n- Integrate with modern development workflows\n- Support collaborative editing and review processes\n\n## Decision\n\nWe will migrate the ForgePoint system to an **Astro-based web application** with the following architecture:\n\n### Technology Stack\n- **Astro**: Static site generator with content collections\n- **TypeScript**: Type safety and developer experience\n- **Zod**: Runtime validation for content schemas\n- **MDX**: Rich content authoring with embedded components\n- **Vue.js + Radix Vue**: Interactive UI components\n- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling\n\n### Content Architecture\n- **Content Collections**: Replace CUE packages with Astro content collections\n- **Frontmatter Validation**: Use Zod schemas for type safety and validation\n- **MDX Content**: Enable rich documentation within each artifact\n- **File-based**: Maintain Git-friendly, version-controlled content\n\n### Key Features\n1. **User Story Map Visualization**: Interactive story mapping interface\n2. **Content Management**: Web forms for creating and editing artifacts\n3. **Relationship Tracking**: Automatic linking between personas, activities, and stories\n4. **Export Capabilities**: Generate reports and documentation\n5. **Search and Filtering**: Find content across all artifact types\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n\n### Option 1: Keep CUE with Web Frontend\n**Pros**: Maintains existing data structure and validation\n**Cons**: Adds complexity, requires CUE expertise for content authors\n\n### Option 2: Pure Database Solution (PostgreSQL + Admin Interface)\n**Pros**: Traditional data management, familiar to many teams\n**Cons**: Less version control friendly, harder to backup/restore, requires database infrastructure\n\n### Option 3: Notion/Airtable Integration\n**Pros**: No development required, familiar interfaces\n**Cons**: Vendor lock-in, limited customization, export/backup challenges\n\n### Option 4: Custom React/Next.js Application\n**Pros**: Maximum flexibility and customization\n**Cons**: Higher development overhead, complex content management\n\n## Consequences\n\n### Positive Consequences\n- **Improved Accessibility**: Web interface accessible to all stakeholders\n- **Better Visualization**: Built-in story mapping and relationship visualization\n- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Web-based editing and review workflows\n- **Familiar Tools**: Standard web technologies for easier maintenance\n- **Git Integration**: Maintains version control and backup benefits\n- **Performance**: Static generation provides fast loading times\n- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features and integrations\n\n### Negative Consequences\n- **Migration Effort**: Requires conversion of existing CUE files to MDX format\n- **Loss of CUE Benefits**: No longer get CUE's advanced constraint validation\n- **Complexity**: Web application is more complex than pure data files\n- **Maintenance Overhead**: Requires ongoing web application maintenance\n\n### Mitigation Strategies\n1. **Gradual Migration**: Convert content incrementally while maintaining CUE as source of truth initially\n2. **Schema Validation**: Use Zod to maintain data quality and type safety\n3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for content authors and developers\n4. **Backup Strategy**: Regular exports and Git-based versioning\n5. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing for content validation and user workflows\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)\n- [x] Project setup with Astro, TypeScript, and content collections\n- [x] Define content schemas with Zod validation\n- [x] Create base layouts and page templates\n- [x] Convert core personas and activities to MDX format\n\n### Phase 2: Core Features\n- [ ] Build user story map visualization component\n- [ ] Implement content creation and editing workflows\n- [ ] Add search and filtering capabilities\n- [ ] Create export and reporting features\n\n### Phase 3: Advanced Features\n- [ ] Real-time collaboration features\n- [ ] Integration with external tools (Jira, GitHub, etc.)\n- [ ] Advanced analytics and metrics tracking\n- [ ] Mobile-responsive optimization\n\n## Monitoring and Review\n\nThis decision will be reviewed after **3 months** of implementation with the following success criteria:\n- Stakeholder adoption rate > 80%\n- Content creation efficiency improvement > 50%\n- User story map usage in planning sessions\n- Reduced time for product management tasks\n- Positive feedback from non-technical stakeholders\n\nIf the new system doesn't meet these criteria, we will consider reverting to CUE or implementing one of the alternative approaches.","src/content/adrs/001-astro-migration.mdx","a35fdea7a5ed3034","001-astro-migration.mdx"]
