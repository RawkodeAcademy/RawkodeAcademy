## Overview

The Interactive Story Map is ForgePoint's killer feature that transforms how product teams visualize and plan their work. It provides a two-dimensional view where:

- **Horizontal axis**: Activities (user journey steps)
- **Vertical axis**: Stories prioritized within each activity
- **Color coding**: Different personas or story states

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Visual Organization
- Drag-and-drop interface for organizing stories
- Automatic layout adjustments
- Zoom in/out for different levels of detail

### 2. Filtering and Views
- Filter by persona to see specific user journeys
- Filter by priority (MoSCoW)
- Toggle between planning and execution views

### 3. Real-time Collaboration
- Multiple team members can view and edit simultaneously
- Comments and discussions on individual stories
- Change tracking and history

## Technical Implementation

The story map will be built using:
- Vue.js for the interactive components
- CSS Grid for the flexible layout
- Astro's content collections for data management

## Success Metrics

- Time to create initial story map: < 5 minutes
- Stories organized per minute: > 10
- Team adoption rate: > 80% within first month
