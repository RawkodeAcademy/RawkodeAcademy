## Interaction Details

The drag-and-drop interaction for story cards enables intuitive priority management:

### Visual Feedback
- Card lifts slightly on hover
- Ghost image follows cursor during drag
- Drop zones highlight when hovering
- Smooth animation on drop

### Business Rules
- Stories can only be moved within their activity column
- Moving up increases priority (must > should > could)
- Moving down decreases priority
- Related stories maintain their relationships

### Git Integration
```yaml
# Commit message format
chore(forgepoint): reorder story priority in [activity-name]

- Moved "[story-title]" from position X to Y
- Updated priority from [old] to [new]
```
