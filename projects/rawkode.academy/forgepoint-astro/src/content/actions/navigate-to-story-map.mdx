## Action Details

This navigation action initiates the story mapping experience. The navigation should:

- Be accessible from the main navigation menu
- Include keyboard shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl + M)
- Show loading state while fetching data
- Preserve user's last view preferences

### Performance Considerations

- Lazy load the tldraw library
- Cache story positions between sessions
- Use virtual rendering for large story counts
