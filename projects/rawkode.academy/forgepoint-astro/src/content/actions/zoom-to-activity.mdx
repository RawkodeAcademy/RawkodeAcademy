## Zoom Behavior

The zoom-to-activity feature provides quick navigation across large story maps:

### Implementation Details

1. **Trigger Methods**
   - Double-click on activity card
   - Keyboard shortcut: G then activity number
   - Activity dropdown selection

2. **Animation Properties**
   - Duration: 500ms ease-in-out
   - Zoom level: Calculated to fit activity + stories
   - Padding: 100px around content

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Prevent zoom beyond max/min limits
   - Handle empty activities gracefully
   - Maintain aspect ratio

### Code Example

```typescript
const zoomToActivity = (activityId: string) => {
  const bounds = getActivityBounds(activityId);
  editor.zoomToBounds(bounds, {
    duration: 500,
    padding: 100,
    animation: { easing: 'ease-in-out' }
  });
};
```
