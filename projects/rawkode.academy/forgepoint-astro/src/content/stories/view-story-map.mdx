## User Story Details

The story map view is the foundation of ForgePoint's visual planning capabilities. It transforms the traditional backlog list into a two-dimensional map that provides context and relationships between stories.

### Key Features

1. **Activity-based Organization**: Stories are grouped by the user activities they support
2. **Visual Priority**: Vertical positioning indicates priority within each activity
3. **Persona Integration**: Color coding helps identify which user types benefit from each story
4. **Feature Connections**: Visual indicators show which stories belong to larger features

### Technical Considerations

- Use Vue.js for reactive updates when stories change
- Implement virtual scrolling for performance with large story counts
- Cache rendered story cards to improve interaction speed
- Provide keyboard navigation for accessibility
