== Prerequisites

If you have `+nix+` installed, you can approve the `+.envrc+` file with `+direnv allow+`. This will automatically run `+nix develop+` and install all the required dependencies.

If you prefer not to use `+nix+`, you can manually install the following dependencies:

- supabase-cli
- bun

== Local Development

I like that I can include other files and this renders to give us "living" documentation.
